50|$|A heroin {{maintenance}} programme has {{existed in the}} United Kingdom (UK) since the 1920s, as drug addiction {{was seen as an}} individual health problem. Addiction to opiates was rare in the 1920s and was mostly limited to either middle-class people who had easy access due to their profession, or people who had become addicted as a side effect of medical treatment. In the 1950s and 1960s a small number of doctors contributed to an alarming {{increase in the number of}} drug-addicted people in the U.K. through excessive prescribing—the U.K. switched to more restrictive drug legislation as a result. However, the British government is again moving towards a consideration of heroin prescription as a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of the National Health Service (NHS). Evidence has clearly shown that methadone maintenance is not appropriate for all opioid-dependent people and that heroin is a viable maintenance drug that has shown equal or better rates of success.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{have had}} system of heroin {{maintenance}} since the 1920s. For decades it supplied {{a few hundred}} addicts nationwide, {{most of whom were}} doctors themselves. It was de-emphasized considerably during the 1960s-1980s {{as a result of the}} U.S. led [...] "war on drugs". Because of the lack of large-scale trials, only anecdotal evidence existed as to the efficacy of the treatment. This changed in 1994 when Switzerland, faced with one of the largest open drug scenes in Europe at the time, started large-scale trials on the potential use of diamorphine as a maintenance drug. They proved diamorphine to be a viable maintenance drug which has shown equal or better rates of success than methadone in terms of assisting long-term users establish stable, crime-free lives. These results encouraged countries like Germany and the Netherlands to conduct their own trials and finally to include heroin assisted treatment fully as a part of the national health system in 2009. In recent years the British have begun moving towards the inclusion of heroin maintenance programs as a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of their National Health Service. In 2013 European Union's European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction issued guidelines for the years 2013-2020; for the first time since the EMCDDA's 1995 inception, the group advocated [...] "reducing the health and social risks and harms caused by drugs" [...] in addition to longstanding policies of lessening demand and supply. Both the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Transnational Institute have released documents advocating harm-reduction strategies, though only the latter mentions heroin-assisted therapy. It should be noted that [...] "harm reduction" [...] remains a nebulous term which can include a wide variety of treatment modalities, many of which do not include heroin-assisted therapy.|$|E

Teaching and research, are recognized activities of modern academia; although their nexus is at times questioned. This paper seeks to understand the role of a rising academic activity, academic consultancy, and to portray its impact onto HE. A two-stage research design including a web-based survey and semi-structured interviews was implemented to gather the experiences and perceptions of academics in information technology/information systems/information management (IT/IS/IM) in the United Kingdom (UK). The findings reveal that the majority of consultancy activities undertaken by the study participants are of small scale, of technical nature and in areas strongly related to the research interest of the academics in questions. Although a shared understanding of what consultancy is can be found among academics, the perception of how consultancy impacts teaching practices and research differs significantly within research-led or teaching-led universities. Such findings are significant as they portray entrepreneurship as a contributing factor that may help universities to shape their policy, culture and structure...|$|R

Indeed, minerals constitute a high-tech knowledge industry in many countries.

However, increasingly, the majority of email traffic reflects opportunistic, rather than symbiotic social relations. Here we use e-mail data drawn from a large university to construct directed graphs of email exchange that quantify the differences between social and antisocial behaviors in networks of communication. We show that while structural characteristics typical of other social networks are shared to a large extent by the <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> they are not characteristic of antisocial traffic. Interestingly, opportunistic patterns of behavior do create nontrivial graphs with certain general characteristics that we identify. To complement the graph analysis, which suffers from incomplete knowledge of users external to the domain, we study temporal patterns of communication to show that the dynamical properties of email traffic can, in principle, distinguish different types of social relations.

40|$|From {{an extract}} of Drosophila melanogaster head homogenates, a {{membrane}} fraction can be isolated {{that has the}} same sedimentation properties as vertebrate synaptic vesicles and contains Drosophila synaptotagmin. The fraction disappears from homogenates of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant shibire(ts 1) (shi(ts 1)) flies paralyzed by exposure to non-permissive temperatures, and reappears on return to permissive temperatures. Since reversible, temperature-dependent depletion of synaptic vesicles is known to occur in shibire(ts 1) flies, we conclude that the fraction we have identified contains synaptic vesicles. We have examined the fate of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins in shibire flies at nonpermissive temperatures and found {{that all of these}} vesicle antigens are transferred to rapidly sedimenting membranes and codistribute with a plasma membrane marker by both glycerol velocity and metrizamide density sedimentation and by confocal microscopy. Three criteria were used to establish that other neuron-specific antigens [...] neuronal synaptobrevin and cysteine-string proteins [...] are <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> of synaptic vesicles: cosedimentation with Drosophila synaptotagmin, immunoadsorption, and disappearance of these antigens from the vesicle fractions in paralyzed shibire flies...|$|R

Using the longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (Wave 1 - 5), I introduce a general model where explanatory variables portray individual lifetime trajectory. All predictors are disentangled into illegitimate and <b>legitimate</b> <b>components.</b> The Hausman-Taylor (1981) estimator is employed {{to deal with the}} presence of unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity of time-variant lifestyle.

40|$|Research on {{organisational}} legitimation strategies {{has shown}} that organisational actors employ agent-centred strategies such as impression management and justification, and also draw on institutional features such as normative and cognitive structures in order to attain and maintain legitimacy. An important question remains; What happens when the nature and balance of underlying structural schema and resources change? What is the interplay between emergent organisational logics of action, enacted organisational contexts and legitimacy? These questions are examined {{with reference to the}} Corporate HR function of a large global airline. The HRM function in organisations {{can be seen as a}} microcosm of broader structural tensions between economic and social logics of action. In contemporary global organisations, HR professionals often see themselves as the organisation’s ‘corporate conscience’. The degree to which they can function in this role, and bring employee considerations to the fore, depends on their legitimacy within an organisation. If their strategies are not seen as <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> of ‘business’, the scope for agency on the part of HR professionals is limited. In this longitudinal study, ethnographic methods were used to examine the processes through which a corporate HR sub-unit sought to legitimate one of their key strategies, during a year of significant contextual change. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the few, but important legal and coronial cases concerning withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment from severely disabled or critically impaired infants in Australia. Although sparse in number, the judgements should influence common clinical practices based on assessment of “best interests” but these {{have not yet}} been adopted. In particular, although courts have discounted assessment of “quality of life” as a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of determination of “best interests,” this remains a prominent component of clinical guidelines. In addition, this paper highlights the lack of uniform clinical guidelines available to medical professionals and parents in Australia when making end-of-life decisions for severely ill infants. Thus, it is argued here {{that there is a need}} for an overarching prescriptive uniform framework or set of guidelines in end-of-life decision-making for impaired infants.

Computer science education has, for the most part, taken a different approach: rather than having our students play video games to learn concepts we ask them to build games to learn concepts [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In the process of building games, students become immersed in gaming. Yet neither the IEEE/ACM CC 2001 [1] curricular recommendations, nor the ABET/CAC [4] criteria mention the notion of gaming.

40|$|UN Security Council Resolution 1325 {{places the}} {{concerns}} {{and the potential}} of women directly within a security framework and acts {{as a reminder that}} the role and protection of women in conflict and peace-building must not be side-stepped. Resolution 1325 arguably represents a „human security‟ approach to international security, in which non-traditional security issues and non-state actors have only recently gained (limited) traction as <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> of a security framework hitherto dominated by a state-centric paradigm. Over a decade after its inauguration, the question remains whether the „securitization‟ of gender has indeed made a difference for the women (and men) „on the ground‟ and how a non-state actor is playing such a role. Using Danish Demining Group - an NGO operating in South Sudan - as case study, this research paper attempts to address this question and whether the impact lends credence or counter-weight to arguments within academia and IR that „human security‟ dilutes the intellectual coherence and therefore the practical applicability of security provision. The results demonstrate that contextual factors, such as underdevelopment, low institutional capacity of security providers and a patriarchal society impede how effectively the resolution is implemented by state and non-state actors alike. Yet DDG has managed to enhance security and gender equality at the communal level when no other actor is doing so. This argues in favour of a „human security‟ approach and demonstrates the utility and indeed the necessity of an expanded security framework to account for the lives of women (and society as a whole) on the ground...|$|R
30|$|The {{challenges}} that the Vietnamese CHC teachers need {{deep understanding of}} scientific content knowledge and that the Vietnamese teachers find teaching and learning scientific argumentation difficult align with concerns of researchers and educators {{about the state of}} science teaching in many primary classrooms recently. It is asserted that the teachers’ lack of confidence to teach science has been largely attributed to their poor background knowledge (Appleton 2007). The findings of this study can reinforce to a certain extent the claim that cooperative learning, in which social constructivist learning is the mainstream, has been applied both in Western culture and in CHC but the way of applying is different: cooperative learning in a CHC is in harmony rather than in argumentation or in conflicts (Xiao 2009). This can underpin the proposition that in a face culture like Vietnam, the idea of saving face is very important to people, especially those who, like teachers, are regarded as playing a respectable role in society and perceptions of face influence teachers’ behaviours in classrooms (Nguyen 2016). In one hand, this study agree that “Vietnamese educational reformers could perhaps, while paying due reverence to Confucian precepts, also include in teacher education programmes an appreciation that expertise in promoting student-centred learning and co-construction of knowledge by teachers and students are <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> of teachers’ face that contribute to the acceptance of innovation at the classroom level” (Nguyen 2016, p. 11). In the other hand, the study recommends scientific argumentation should be improved through science education to enhance scientific capability in a CHC. In doing this, it needs to balance “nature of science” elements (Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman 2000) and CHC values in the science curriculum. Also, the study suggests that CHC teachers need training to have more scientific content knowledge and argument capability so that they can teach science more effectively in primary classroom practices.|$|R
40|$|Institutionalists in {{organizational}} sociology {{have developed a}} good deal of evidence about the role of field logics in shaping the practices of organizations. In this paper, we extend this imagery to multiple fields, highlighting how shifting logics in a superordinate field enable the infrastructural development of a subordinate field. In particular, we track how initially marginal, anti-institutional service-learning practices became a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of mainstream curricula in the field of U.

While service-learning proponents have always made claims about the importance of generating knowledge and insight through helping others in the community, service-learning entrepreneurs had to build a field infrastructure to support their claims and culturally repackage the aims of service-learning in a way that articulated with broader logics in the field of higher education. We argue that the shift from an unarticulated closed-system logic to a situation of contending closed-system and open-system logics in the field of higher education facilitated the cultural repackaging of service-learning practices, enabling civic engagement to become a more accepted part of university curricula. Despite this apparently “successful ” institutionalization, however, competing logics in the field of higher education have instantiated contradictions in the service-learning field, raising important issues about th...|$|E
40|$|Objectivity, in {{the form}} of the {{application}} of external scrutiny according to standards agreed within a research community, is an essential characteristic of information science research whether pursued from positivist, interpretative, or action research perspectives. Subjectivity may represent both a legitimate focus of research (e. g., people's perceptions and attitudes) and a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of methodology (e. g., enabling researchers to enter, experience, and share the perceived worlds of their subjects). However, subjectivity that both (a) is not open to external scrutiny and (b) gives rise to contingent dependencies is problematic for research. The issue of problematic types of subjectivity is considered, and the contributions to the debate concerning possible solutions of two key thinkers - the cybernetician Gordon Pask and the methodological philosopher Brenda Dervin - are discussed. The need identified by Dervin for researchers to be able to escape (expose and test) their own assumptions is explored in terms of a dynamic interplay between relatively subjective and objective forces, each requiring the liberating and constraining energies of the other. The extent to which meta-methodological awareness - a prerequisite for any such escape - can be fostered, for example, by the quality of research environments, is explored along with implications for those responsible for managing and funding research...|$|E

The results indicate that social email traffic has lower entropy (higher structural information) than opportunistic traffic for periods covering both working and non-working hours. We see in general that both social and opportunistic traffics are not random, and that social email shows stronger temporal structure with a high probability for long silences and bursts of a few messages. These findings offer insights into the fundamental differences between social and opportunistic behavior in email networks, and may generalize to the structure of opportunistic social relations in other environments.

40|$|Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as it {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by the courts, is an uncompromising statute. It bars adverse employment actions taken on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, with only one exception: in cases where an employer can demonstrate that sex, religion, or national origin is a 2 ̆ 2 bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise” Much of Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s impact, of course, depends upon the scope given to this exception, and, in particular, upon whether employers are allowed to claim inconvenience, cost, or customer preference as <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> of the BFOQ analysis. Because a broad exception would swallow the rule, the Supreme Court has held that the BFOQ provision was 2 ̆ 2 meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination” and established a stringent test for its application. An employer seeking a sex-based BFOQ must have a 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 factual basis 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 to believe that 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 all or substantially all women [or men] would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved,’” or, alternatively, demonstrate that the qualification in question relates to 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 7 essence, 2 ̆ 7 or to the 2 ̆ 7 central mission of the employer 2 ̆ 7 s business. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Courts have also strongly rejected attempts to define the 2 ̆ 2 essence of a business 2 ̆ 2 in ways that allow sex discrimination in through the back door of customer preference. The logic is the same as that justifying a narrow BFOQ: As one court put it, “[I]t would be totally anomalous if we were to allow the preferences and prejudices of the customers to determine whether the sex discrimination was valid. Indeed, it was, to a large extent, these very prejudices the Act was meant to overcome. ” Thus, courts have refused to allow the preferences of airline customers to justify rejection of men for flight attendant positions, or the biases of customers or associates in other countries to justify refusal to promote women to positions directing international operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{diplomacy}} and theory of political state {{shows that the}} modern international legal principle of self-determination, in the current state-centric formal international political system, regulates inter and intrastate relations. Therefore the international legal principle of self-determination contributes to the national and international order. The self-determination is highly contentious, irregular and lacks a degree of certitude. This causes a threat to {{international peace and security}} when overlooked, or implemented immoderately, and without goodwill. Such a jurisprudential disposition leads to doubts over the legal credentials of the political concept of self-determination, suggesting that it invokes moral imperatives. This view runs contrary to the findings of this research. Political and legal moderation is shown to be essential in the administration of international law and therefore that of self-determination due to three distinctive elements: the humanity, the political state and the formal state-centric international political system. The components and determinants of society, political, and legal rules are distinctive thus rendering each system sui generis. Therefore no legal precept serving all three distinctive domains of order can achieve certitude and regular application, found in dissimilar legal systems, and be subject to fair criticism arising from comparative analysis. Although international law is sui generis legal system, the current challenges of self-determination can be resolved by the deployment of administrative measures and values within formally empowered international political system. The hypothesis is that the conditionality of <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> and determinants of international legal principle of self-determination, in the current formal state-centric international political system, does not deprive its jural imperatives. The hypothesis is proven by regressive historical tracing of the conceptual developments at national levels, and at international level, upon its transmutation, once the formal international political system was established. Once the hypothesis is proven jural imperative of self-determination in all three domains of humanity, the political state and the formal international order will be self-evident. Secondly, if all three domains are unregulated by international jural imperatives, they would be pitted against each other’s interest, and compete to subjugate each other. The proof of the hypothesis leds to several sustainable conclusions. First the transcendental jural cohesion provided by the three principles; legitimacy, democratic accountability and rule of law, in the said three domains of humanity, the state and the formal international order, forms the theoretic fusion of their pursued ends, as well as being found in practice as state action in the current UN era. Second, self-determination also provides stability in diversity, and conflict of interests, aggravated by the constancy of change in national and international political systems. Third, self-determination when administered moderately and with goodwill, provides the ultimate solution to international peace and security by placing greater international responsibility on the individual, and collective of individuals, and the state and international community, within the formal international political system. Thus, international law may be gentle civilised after all...|$|R

It was the Chinese who had under the Manila galleon trade system not only acted as the sup-plier of the Chinese luxury for Acapulco, but also provided daily needs of Spanish residents in the colony.

5000|$|They {{have begun}} to relate to their own European traditions as if to {{something}} remote and almost foreign, and treat it likewise without scruple. As both a direct and indirect consequence of manifold skepticism towards perspectives of contemporary civilization, {{it is possible to}} find the key amongst a great many of today’s artists, to the tendency of regressions to form portrayal, the <b>legitimate</b> <b>components</b> of which are also a path leading to the exploration of pictorial memory. The work of Karel Balcar can be categorized (even period-wise) among these contemporary endeavours, which have actually appeared throughout the entire course of {{the second half of the}} century, and which draws on the traditions of classicism, mannerism and primarily baroque illusionism. Figurative painting is, as it has been since the very beginning, a matter of cardinal destiny for Karel Balcar. He deals with it in a conscious and programmed manner. At first sight, the technical sovereignty with which the form of portrayal is handled here is arresting, however its concurrent secretiveness may be dissuading. In any case, its appeal is - in spite of the many shifts in opinion even in our constricted post-modern scene - exceptional all the same. What does this nonconformity reside in? A paradox, as if implicit within the process of originating itself, and of course also in the final form of his paintings. It seems nearly implausible that Karel Balcar himself belonged to a rare sort of talents in college, amongst whom the obstinate striving for personal release has stood far to the forefront ahead of the problems of technique itself. Such release then became the driving force in overcoming difficulty, which has simply capitulated to this will. Contentual and formal intransigence, led provocatively across temporal dimensions, may be the very fruit of such endeavour. Today, Karel Balcar controls suitable means of painting to such a degree, that he is capable to manipulate them to suit his own unconventional imagination. He is able to elicit shreds of grim tales in his pictures, in which it seems like spirits of renewed tendencies of romanticism circumambulate, multiplied by accents of stylized aggression and salacious shadiness. At the same time he manages to eschew tawdry effects of fantasy or any feigning of the cryptic, which is particularly noteworthy - he need not deviate towards even a hint of banally empty symbolist stylization. The torsos of figures, often isolated in an ambiguous environment, become kinds of lone phantoms of reality themselves, chess figures in an unfinished match. It is likely for that very reason that we feel a distinct detachment, delineating this work as postmodernist rule. The practice, hermetic forms of real form create a barrier between the stage and the auditorium. The spectator is not allowed to join in. It is as if a legacy of classicism were at work here, of that tributary of European thought that has long been furthest from modern art in its objective. (from: Zdeněk Beran, abbreviated.) ...|$|R

Partly {{as a result of the}} difficulty of assessment in this area, selection of students is receiving greater attention, in the pursuit of globally competent graduates. However, selection processes may be overrated for this purpose. Assessing actual attitudes and behaviour during the course is arguably a better way of ensuring that medical graduates are competent in these areas. I argue that judgments about attitudinal and behavioural competence are legitimate, and need be no more arbitrary than those made about scientific or clinical knowledge and skills, but also that these judgments should be restricted to what is agreed to be unacceptable behaviour, rather titan attempting to rate attitudes and behaviour positively. This model introduces students to the way in which their behaviours will be judged in their professional lives by registration authorities. These theoretical positions are illustrated by a recent case of academic failure based on inadequate attitudes and behaviours...|$|R
40|$|Can a {{directly}} elected European Parliament help deliver {{standards by}} which the European Union can be indirectly <b>legitimated</b> through its <b>component</b> national democracies? This article argues that the Union can be indirectly legitimate where it helps member state democracies meet their own obligations to their own publics. The Union can do just that by managing externalities in ways needed to secure core values of justice, democracy and freedom from arbitrary domination within member states. Yet that poses a predicament: for if any one member state {{has an interest in}} imposing negative externalities or in freeriding on positive externalities provided by another, then so may its voters and democratic institutions. The article argues a directly elected European Parliament can help manage that predicament both by identifying externalities and by ensuring their regulation meets standards of public control, political equality and justification owed to individual national democracies.

40|$|Background/rationale. In the Republic of Ireland, {{the amount}} of {{clinical}} teaching expected of staff nurses has increased substantially {{in the wake of}} the transfer of nursing education to universities, and the advent of supernumerary status for students. A modicum of previous research noted that staff nurses are unclear about their role in relation to facilitating the clinical learning of supernumerary students [...] Aims of the paper. To explore staff nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their role in the facilitation of learning for university-educated diploma students in the clinical area and their attitudes towards these students [...] Design/methods. Sixteen staff nurses were interviewed in depth using semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed qualitatively, using content analysis, with the help of the software package NUD*IST [...] Findings. Among the central themes to emerge, upon which this article is focused, was participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of supernumerary status compared with rostered service for diploma students. Data suggested that the rostered status of students was generally favoured by staff nurses over and above supernumerary status because, unlike supernumerary students, rostered students did not disrupt the existing social structure within the clinical setting. Both structuration theory and role theory are drawn upon to explain the reproduction of the prevailing social structure, where the concentration is on getting through nursing work with little emphasis on the supervised learning of supernumerary students [...] Study limitations. This study is constrained by eliciting only the views of staff nurses. Further studies are required of student nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences of rostered service and supernumerary status [...] Conclusions. Because staff nurses are part of the system within which they work, they need to modify their role to include active student teaching as a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of that role. ...|$|E
40|$|Labour {{politics}} in twentieth-century Northern Ireland {{has often been}} interpreted as a 'failure' {{and this has been}} explained as indicative of the lack of saliency of class to identity in Northern Ireland. Through usage of the concept of 'political culture' this thesis examines the Belfast labour movement between 1924 and 1939. The thesis addresses the national question, electoral politics, trade-unionism, unemployment, ideology and concludes with a comparative chapter on the inter-war Labour Parties in Belfast and Liverpool. It argues that the Belfast labour movement did not fail as comprehensively as previous analysis has claimed. The city's labour movement succeeded in becoming a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of civil society, despite an unsympathetic government and wider society. The thesis makes use of electoral sociology, political science and historical methodologies. Belfast Labour, like much contemporary European left-wing politics, failed to analyse nationalism coherently. Working-class political organisations in Belfast did have a significant electoral appeal, but were fundamentally undermined by their lack of access to political power in Northern Ireland. The Special Powers Act (1922) and Trade Disputes Act (1927) placed important constraints on the development of trade unionism in Belfast. Members of the labour movement organised and campaigned against unemployment in the city. The movement in Belfast adopted political positions-on fascism, social reform and gender-which were similar to contemporaneous European movements. The labour movements of inter-war Liverpool and Belfast shared similar problems, but the different national context of each city meant sectarianism continued to be dominant in the latter city. Despite the limited achievements of labour in Belfast, the legislative context dominance of sectarianism and partition prevented it from becoming a significant political force in Belfast between 1924 and 1939.

40|$|BackgroundThe Strong Women, Strong Babies, Strong Culture Program (the Program) {{evolved from}} a {{recognition}} of the value of Aboriginal knowledge and practice in promoting maternal and child health (MCH) in remote communities of the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. Commencing in 1993 it continues to operate today. In 2008, the NT Department of Health commissioned an evaluation to identify enabling factors and barriers to successful implementation of the Program, and to identify potential pathways for future development. In this paper we focus on the evaluation findings related specifically to the role of Aborignal cultural knowledge and practice within the Program. MethodsA qualitative evaluation utilised purposive sampling to maximise diversity in program history and Aboriginal culture. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 76 participants were recorded in their preferred language with a registered Interpreter when required. Thematic analysis of data was verified or modified through further discussions with participants and members of the evaluation team. ResultsAlthough the importance of Aboriginal knowledge and practice as a fundamental component of the Program is widely acknowledged, there has been considerable variation across time and location in {{the extent to which these}} cultural dimensions have been included in practice. Factors contributing to this variation are complex and relate to a number of broad themes including: location of control over Program activities; recognition and respect for Aboriginal knowledge and practice as a <b>legitimate</b> <b>component</b> of health care; working in partnership; communication within and beyond the Program; access to transport and working space; and governance and organisational support. ConclusionsWe suggest that inclusion of Aboriginal knowledge and practice as a fundamental component of the Program is key to its survival over more than twenty years despite serious challenges. Respect for the legitimacy of Aboriginal knowledge and practice within health care, a high level of community participation and control supported through effective governance and sufficient organisational commitment as well as competence in intercultural collaborative practice of health staff are critical requirements for realising the potential for cultural knowledge and practice to improve Aboriginal health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the drivers of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in the general population in Australia and to identify key policy implications. Data and methods: The National Health Survey 2007 / 2008, a representative survey of the Australian population, provides information on CAM use (practitioners and products) in the last 12 months. All adult respondents (N= 15, 779) aged 18 years or older are included in this study. Logistic regression is employed to determine the effect of socio-economic, condition-specific, health behavior variables, and private health insurance status on CAM use. Results: In addition to socio-economic variables known to affect CAM use, individuals who have a chronic condition, particularly a mental health condition, are more likely to use CAM. There does not appear to be a correlation between CAM use and more frequent General Practitioner use; however, ancillary private health insurance is correlated with a greater likelihood of CAM use, as expected. Conclusions: The Australian government does not currently intervene in the CAM market in a systematic way. CAM is clearly considered to be a <b>legitimate</b> and important <b>component</b> of health care for many Australians, despite the limited availability of clinical evidence for its efficacy and safety. Policy interventions may include the regulation of CAM products, practitioners, and information as well as providing subsidies for cost-effective modalities. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{validity}} of clinical tests with somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) {{relies on the}} montages chosen and on adequate interpretation making use of recent pathophysiological data. Only non-cephalic reference recordings can reliably identify the actual neural generators involved. Early SEPs include near-field (neck N 11 and N 13; parietal N 20 -P 27 -P 45 and prerolandic P 22 -N 30) and far-field (P 9 -P 11 -P 14) components. Far fields diffuse in the volume conductor through a solid angle of 180 ° downstream from the propagated dipole generator. P 9 reflects the afferent volley at the brachial plexus, P 11 the volley in the dorsal column of the spinal cord, and P 14 reflects the volley in the medial lemniscus. Far fields have stationary latencies, but their voltage varies and is maximum downstream in the axis of the generator dipole. The spinal N 11 shows a latency shift of 0. 9 msec along the neck which allows dorsal column conduction to be estimated. Its dipole has a longitudinal axis. The N 13 dipole is fixed and has a horizontal axis: the N 13 phase reverses into a P 13 at oesophageal (prevertebral) derivations. This N 13 -P 13 spinal dipole produces no far field at the scalp. The cortical pre- and post-rolandic components can be studied with an earlobe reference, but not with a frontal reference which confounds the distinct generators. For spinal potentials, the cephalic (often frontal) reference still used in recent publications introduces major distortions. The algebraic addition of scalp far fields {{picked up at the}} front fabricates illegitimate components in such traces: the neck P 9 becomes an "N 9 " of variable amplitude, the "N 11 " augmented by the (inverted) frontal P 11 loses its latency shift characteristics, and an "N 14 " (whose generator is actually above the foramen magnum) superimposes on the <b>legitimate</b> spinal <b>components.</b> In general, the clinical use of hybrid montages mixing distinct components that can be distorted or delayed by a neurological lesion leads to severe errors of interpretation. © 1984 Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam.

40|$|When {{a network}} packet is formed by a computer's {{protocol}} stack, {{there are many}} components (e. g., Memory, CPU, etc.) of the computer {{that are involved in}} the process. The objective of this research is to identify, characterize and analyze the effects of the various components of a device (e. g., Memory, CPU, etc.) on the device's network traffic by measuring the changes in its network traffic with changes in its components. We also show how this characterization can be used to effectively perform counterfeit detection of devices which have counterfeit components (e. g., Memory, CPU, etc.). To obtain this characterization, we measure and apply statistical analyses like probability distribution fucntions (PDFs) on the interarrival times (IATs) of the device's network packets (e. g., ICMP, UDP, TCP, etc.). The device is then modified by changing just one component (e. g., Memory, CPU, etc.) at a time while holding the rest constant and acquiring the IATs again. This, over many such iterations provides an understanding of the effect of each component on the overall device IAT statistics. Such statistics are captured for devices (e. g., field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and personal computers (PCs)) of different types. Some of these statistics remain stable across different IAT captures for the same device and differ for different devices (completely different devices or even the same device with its components changed). Hence, these statistical variations can be used to detect changes in a device's composition, which lends itself well to counterfeit detection. Counterfeit devices are abundant in today's world and cause billions of dollars of loss in revenue. Device components are substituted with inferior quality components or are replaced by lower capacity components. Armed with our understanding of the effects of various device components on the device's network traffic, we show how such substitutions or alterations of <b>legitimate</b> device <b>components</b> can be detected and hence perform effective counterfeit detection by statistically analyzing the deviation of the device's IATs from that of the original legitimate device. We perform such counterfeit detection experiments on various types of device configurations (e. g., PC with changed CPU, RAM, etc.) to prove the technique's efficacy. Since this technique is a fully network-based solution, it is also a non-destructive technique which can quickly, inexpensively and easily verify the device's legitimacy. This research also discusses the limitations of network-based counterfeit detection. MSCommittee Chair: Dr. Raheem A. Beyah; Committee Member: Dr. Douglas M.
