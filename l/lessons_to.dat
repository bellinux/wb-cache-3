5|$|Lysacek began skating {{at the age}} of eight. His {{grandmother}} had always {{wanted to be in the}} Ice Capades, so she bought him skates for Christmas. He originally wanted to play hockey, so his mother enrolled him and his sister Laura in figure-skating <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> learn how to skate. Lysacek was soon competing as a figure skater.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval attaché, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt practiced wrestling and boxing while in the White House, and he had received jujutsu jackets from William Sturgis Bigelow and jujutsu lessons from J. J. O'Brien, a Philadelphia police officer who had studied jujutsu while living in Nagasaki. Roosevelt was impressed with Yamashita's skill, and during March and April 1904, Yamashita gave judo <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> the President and interested family and staff in {{a room at the}} White House. Subsequently, at other locations, Yamashita and his wife Fude gave <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> prominent American women, to include Martha Blow Wadsworth (sister of Kindergarten pioneer Susan Blow), Hallie Elkins (wife of Senator Stephen Benton Elkins), and Grace Davis Lee (Hallie Elkins' sister), and their children.|$|E
5|$|Although {{primarily}} {{known for}} his television work, Carey has done limited film work, with his first appearance in 1993's Coneheads. His next film was the 2000 television film Geppetto, which debuted on The Wonderful World of Disney. The film, an adaptation of Pinocchio, included actor Wayne Brady, who had joined Carey on his improv shows. Carey took singing <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the role. In 2005, Carey appeared in three films: the animated film Robots, where he provided a voice-over for the character Crank; The Aristocrats, where he retold a dirty joke along with other celebrities; and the documentary Fuck, where he was interviewed.|$|E

5|$|American actress Lauren Bacall (1924–2014) had an {{extensive}} career in films, television shows, and plays. She {{was one of}} the leading ladies during the Golden Age of Hollywood along with actresses such as Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth. Bacall started her career as a teenage fashion model when she appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar and was discovered by Howard Hawks' wife Nancy. As she naturally had a high-pitched and nasal voice, she received <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> help deepen it and was required to shout verses by Shakespeare for hours every day as part of her training.|$|E
5|$|For {{her role}} in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she {{reproduced}} the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting is a technique she views as an obvious requirement in her portrayal of a character.|$|E
5|$|In an {{environment}} where motor transport could not operate, the Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The Australian Army had many <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> learn, but it proved capable of adapting to the circumstances it found itself in. The fighting along the Kokoda Track was but {{the start of the}} effort to drive the Japanese from New Guinea that would continue in 1943.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s he made {{journeys}} to both Germany and Russia. His experience with authoritarian states – both fascist and communist – helped reinforce his political outlook of a democracy/dictatorship dichotomy {{rather than a}} simple right/left one. During the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39, he helped organise aid to those fighting the fascists and, {{during the winter of}} 193637, he visited the country. At one point the former pacifist Lie also took flying <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> actively participate in the conflict, but this plan was never carried out.|$|E

He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that would allow them to find and express their own musical feelings, or style.|$|E

Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls apart, as he believes she betrayed them to Umbridge. Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape disliked Harry's father James, who often bullied him.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, {{with whom}} she entered into a relationship. An engraver, {{photographer}} and former journalist for the Brighton Argus, he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they {{considered to be a}} benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or Ordo Stella Matutina (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained The Book of Lumiel, a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.|$|E
5|$|In Belle's Tales of Friendship (1999), a {{spin-off}} of {{the film}} series, Belle owns a bookstore in which she teaches valuable <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> children by reading and retelling well-known stories and fairy tales, narrating four classic Disney animated shorts: The Three Little Pigs (1933), Peter and the Wolf (1946), The Wise Little Hen (1934) and Morris the Midget Moose (1950). For the first time, Belle appears as both animated and live-action versions of herself, voiced and portrayed by actresses Paige O'Hara and Lyndsey McLeod, respectively. In the television series Sing Me a Story with Belle (1995–1999), Belle, in a role reprised by McLeod, owns her own music and bookshop, where she is visited by children to whom she tells and sings stories.|$|E

5|$|On 22 March 1933 he {{was invited}} for an {{interview}} for a commission in the Air Force in Pretoria. One of 30 applicants vying for three places, he was rejected for lack of flying experience. Determined to rectify this weakness, he went to Johannesburg and began taking flying <b>lessons.</b> <b>To</b> fund his new ambition, {{he worked for a}} mining company, Sheba Gold Mine. He enjoyed the work so much he considered studying for a degree in mining engineering. His passion for flying subsided, but an impromptu visit by a transport aircraft gave Pattle a close glimpse of it, which rekindled his interest. At around the same time, the Ministry of Defence created the Special Service Battalion to employ South African youth who were struggling to find work because of the Great Depression. He joined up in 1936 hoping it would lead to a career in the Air Force. He undertook basic training and national service on the understanding that he would be given an opportunity to enter the Air Force as an instructor {{at the end of his}} four-year service.|$|E
5|$|Richard Armitage {{secured the}} role of Lee {{when he arrived at}} his {{audition}} wearing a pair of old boots, something that greatly impressed producer Spencer Campbell. In order to match the scripted description of his character, Armitage began a heavy workout regimen and took aqua-aerobics <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> better understand Lee's profession. His first scene was a sex scene with Ramona. Despite leaving the series in 2001, Fay Ripley was persuaded to return to the programme for one last appearance as Jenny in the final episode. To make sure the rest of the cast agreed to return, their salaries were increased to £75,000 per episode, a 50% increase on their pay for the fourth series (though Joseph earned less).|$|E
5|$|The Greencards were {{initially}} {{composed of two}} Australians, Kym Warner on mandolin and Carol Young on bass, and an Englishman, Eamon McLoughlin on fiddle. Raised in South London, McLoughlin began to perform country music shows with his family on weekends, influenced by George Jones, George Strait, and Ricky Skaggs. Born to Irish parents, McLoughlin's father was head of a London-based country band. At age nine, McLoughlin moved away from piano <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> play fiddle, and performed with his father's band. McLoughlin had earlier relocated from Brighton to Austin in 1997, after leaving the University of Sussex {{with a degree in}} Politics and American Studies. Trained in London studying Royal Schools of Music Grades before emigrating, McLoughlin also toured with the Asylum Street Spankers, Austin Lounge Lizards, Bruce Robison and Ray Wylie Hubbard after arriving in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{formed the}} basis for the late 16th-century play, The Life and Death of Jack Straw, {{possibly}} written by George Peele and probably originally designed for production in the city's guild pageants. It portrays Jack Straw as a tragic figure, being led into wrongful rebellion by John Ball, making clear political links between the instability of late-Elizabethan England and the 14th century. The story of the revolt was used in pamphlets during the English Civil War of the 17th century, and formed part of John Cleveland's early history of the war. It was deployed as a cautionary account in political speeches during the 18th century, and a chapbook entitled The History of Wat Tyler and Jack Strawe proved popular during the Jacobite risings and American War of Independence. Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke argued over the <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> be drawn from the revolt, Paine expressing sympathy for the rebels and Burke condemning the violence. The Romantic poet Robert Southey based his 1794 play Wat Tyler on the events, taking a radical and pro-rebel perspective.|$|E
5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E
