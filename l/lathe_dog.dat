50|$|A <b>lathe</b> <b>dog,</b> {{also known}} as a lathe carrier, is a device that clamps around the {{workpiece}} and allows the rotary motion of the machine's spindle to be transmitted to the workpiece.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lathe</b> <b>dog</b> (or lathe carrier) is {{essentially}} analogous to a clutch dog. It {{is used to}} provide positive drive to a workpiece turning between centers on a lathe. Without the dog, the cutting tool would tend to [...] "catch", e.g., stop the workpiece from turning while the headstock center continued to rotate, possibly causing damage to the workpiece, or the lathe.|$|E
50|$|The {{workpiece}} is manually clamped to a <b>lathe</b> <b>dog,</b> {{powered by}} the faceplate, that holds the piece in between two centers and rotates the piece. The piece and the grinding wheel rotate in opposite directions and small bits of the piece are removed as it passes along the grinding wheel. In some instances special drive centers {{may be used to}} allow the edges to be ground. The workholding method affects the production time as it changes set up times.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the entire}} {{tailstock}} is {{moved to the}} approximate position {{that it will be}} needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a leadscrew to the exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this leadscrew. The tailstock quill or extendible portion usually has a Morse taper mount in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a <b>lathe</b> <b>dog</b> as shown in the photo.|$|E
5000|$|The Xpandrel {{method of}} {{expanding}} mandrels {{was introduced in}} the mid-1990s. This method uses basic mechanical principles of deformation to achieve expansion of a non-tapered mandrel. Using various methods of actuation, the body of the mandrel is deformed below the limit of elasticity to provide repeatable holding forces without typical deformation caused by pressing on tapered mandrels. Other commercial mandrels are very slightly tapered, and the hollow object slides down the taper until it [...] "sticks". The shop-made mandrel shown in the photo is designed to clamp a hollow tube or gear between the two tapered plugs. There is little about such a mandrel that can't be made right on the lathe on which it is to be used, so {{it is not uncommon for}} machinists to make a mandrel to hold a particular item and then set the mandrel aside hoping to use it again some day. Mandrels of this type are usually set in the lathe on centers and turned with a <b>lathe</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A soft {{dead center}} {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60Â°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a live center, as it turns freely with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or <b>lathe</b> <b>dog</b> may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|E
