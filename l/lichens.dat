40|$|Quantification of <b>lichen</b> {{abundance}} {{is important}} for management of reindeer populations. We measured dry <b>lichen</b> biomass in 876 micro plots (16. 5 cm - 16. 5 cm) systematically sampled within 219 vegetation plots (2 m - 2 m) from 7 different areas in S Norway. <b>Lichen</b> biomass was quantified as: (a) dry weight in g m- 2, (b) <b>lichen</b> height in cm, (c) <b>lichen</b> cover, and (d) <b>lichen</b> volume (<b>lichen</b> height ? <b>lichen</b> cover). <b>Lichen</b> biomass decreased with increasing precipitation and increasing altitude. On local scale, the variation in <b>lichen</b> biomass varied strongly with snow conditions. The grazed parts of Hardangervidda had in general a low average <b>lichen</b> biomass (an average mostly lower than 150 g m- 2). <b>Lichen</b> biomass was much higher in area where reindeer migration was interfered by human activity. <b>Lichen</b> height and <b>lichen</b> volume were strongly linearly correlated with dry <b>lichen</b> biomass.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{focus of}} the work was to {{investigate}} dependency between reindeer density and <b>lichen</b> (Cladonia spp.) ranges in the Finnish semidomesticated reindeer management area. Secondly, we formed a model on the recovery rate of ungrazed woodland <b>lichen</b> ranges (29 sites) after forest fires to evaluate the potential productivity and time needed for Finnish <b>lichen</b> ranges to recover at optimal production. During 1974 – 95, 59 % {{of the variation in}} mean semidomesticated reindeer density (range: 0. 7 – 3. 0 reindeer/km 2 of the total land area) among the reindeer herding districts in Finland was explained by the proportion of land area covered by <b>lichen</b> ranges in these districts. Reindeer densities were highest in the districts where <b>lichen</b> ranges covered 20 % to 30 % of the area. Reindeer density on the total land area did not explain the condition of <b>lichen</b> ranges, but 58 % of the condition was explained by the reindeer density on the <b>lichen</b> ranges. A condition level for <b>lichen</b> ranges of 1000 kg dry matter per hectare (d. m. /ha) of <b>lichen</b> biomass can be considered adequate to ensure survival of reindeer and continued production of <b>lichen.</b> To maintain this level within the sedentary Finnish grazing system, winter reindeer densities on <b>lichen</b> ranges must remain below 5 – 7 reindeer/km 2. According to our model, the maximum amount of living <b>lichen</b> in the woodland <b>lichen</b> stand at the climax stage is on average about 7000 kg d. m. /ha. The maximum annual yield of <b>lichen</b> (175 kg d. m. /ha) is produced by <b>lichen</b> stands that contain 2600 – 2800 kg d. m. /ha of living <b>lichen.</b> Using our model and our 1995 – 96 data, we calculated that the average <b>lichen</b> biomass on <b>lichen</b> ranges in the Finnish reindeer management districts was 13. 0 % of this optimum, and the average <b>lichen</b> production was 36 % of the possible maximum annual yield. Our model indicates that the Finnish <b>lichen</b> ranges would have t...|$|R

A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted to evaluate evidence regarding all treatment modalities proposed and tested for palmoplantar <b>lichen</b> planus in the literature.

The review included all case reports, letters and original articles reporting any treatment for palmoplantar <b>lichen</b> planus but not treatment used in the other type of <b>lichen</b> planus, generalized <b>lichen</b> planus or other type of palmoplantar dermatoses.

40|$|Background: <b>Lichen</b> planus is an {{idiopathic}} subacute {{or chronic}} inflammatory {{disease of the}} skin, mucous membranes and nails. We studied the clinicopathological profile of <b>lichen</b> planus in Indian population. Methods: A total of 145 cases of histologically diagnosed <b>lichen</b> planus samples were included.
