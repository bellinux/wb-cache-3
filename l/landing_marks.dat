50|$|According to Stanford, another witness {{called an}} Albuquerque {{television}} station around 5:30 p.m. to report an oval object at low altitude traveling slowly south towards Socorro. This report was also {{brought up by}} KSRC Socorro radio newsman Walter Shrode when he interviewed Zamora on the radio the next day. Zamora said he hadn't heard of the report. Shrode thought this was likely the same object that Zamora encountered only 20 minutes later and helped corroborate his report. Several other stories appeared in New Mexico newspapers in succeeding days of other sightings of oval-shaped objects, including another landing case with burned soil near La Madera in northern N.M. Also similar to the Socorro incident, the FBI report on the La Madera case further noted the witness reporting a blue-white flame associated with the object, four rectangular, V-shaped <b>landing</b> <b>marks,</b> and several circular marks about 4 inches in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 July 2013, an {{unmanned}} X-47B drone {{completed an}} arrested {{landing on the}} flight deck of George H.W. Bush. The <b>landing</b> <b>marks</b> the first time any unmanned aircraft had completed an arrested landing on board an aircraft carrier operating at sea. The drone completed a second successful arrested landing on George H.W. Bush, but it was diverted to the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia after an issue was detected, requiring that a planned third landing to be aborted. One of the drone's three navigational sub-systems failed, which was identified by the other two sub-systems. The anomaly was indicated to the mission operator, who followed test plan procedures to abort the landing. The Navy stated that the aircraft's detection of a problem demonstrated its reliability and ability to operate autonomously. [...] On 15 July 2013, in a fourth attempt, an X-47B drone failed to make a successful flight deck landing on board the vessel due to [...] "technical issues." ...|$|E

30|$|In recent years, drone {{technology}} has gained great popularity. This {{technology has}} witnessed enhanced capabilities {{in terms of}} payload, longer range operability, and hover stability [10]. Jin Y [11] discussed the difficulty of crossover drone image estimation based on theoretical analysis and image description and verified the feasibility of the rule through simulation examples. The {{results show that the}} rules provide a manual control method for astronauts. Jonghwan B [12] designed an object with four legs to be picked up during flight, using a stream image processing to verify the design of the walking drone. Srikudkao B [13] introduced the configuration and integration of various sensors based on a series of image processing techniques and their data management schemes, simulating the tasks required to estimate critical flood-related parameters. The experimental results can provide a basis for determining its potential applications in flood warning and forecasting systems and the problems that need to be addressed. Maria G [14] proposed a car inspection system prototyped in an experimental project. The video stream of UAV recorded in the urban environment is analyzed. Lee E J [15] used an UAV-based FIR camera to photograph a sunken hole at an altitude of 5002  m, and integrated classification results based on optical convolution neural network (CNN) and Boosted Random Forest (BRF) with manual features. The proposed ensemble method is successfully applied to downhole data of various sizes and depths in different environments. Skoczylas M [16] designed an autonomous UAV landing system based on CCD camera and image transmission system connected to base station. The system landed in an area of 1 [*]m[*]×[*] 1  m, scanned the captured images, and detected <b>landing</b> <b>marks.</b> Xiong X [17] proposed an automatic view finding scheme that can autonomously navigate the drone to an appropriate spatial location where it can take a photo with the best composition. Oh, Jae Hong [18] used overlapping images captured by UAV to automatically reconstruct power lines in object space. Two overlapping images are selected for epipolar image resampling, and the resampled images and redundant images are extracted. The extracted lines from the polar image are matched together and reconstructed for power line primitives that are noisy due to multiple line matches.|$|E

The target {{of this study is to}} optimize drilling operation and enhance its performance in one of the Sudanese field-Dindir area that suffer of very low rate of penetration by using three tools (<b>land</b> <b>Mark</b> Well Plan soft ware, Z.

50|$|Starting in 1999, <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> is {{a series}} of {{projects}} that encompasses film, video, photography and performance pieces related to the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, which, for 60 years, was used by the United States for military operations, leading to a civil disobedience campaign waged by local residents. The works include <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> (1999/2003/2006), <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> (Footprints) (2001-02), Returning a Sound (2004), Under Discussion (2005) and Half Mast\Full Mast (2010). Allora & Calzadilla interrogate the economic, cultural, and political markers that differentiate one area of land from another, and the processes of colonization and gentrification that come to define its changing status. As a whole, these works connected performances typical of political activism to artistic traditions like engraving. <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> is explained semantically as an instrument for reading marks left on the territory (landmarks) instead of as a simple point of spatial orientation (landmark). The spatial investigations in Allora & Calzadilla's work are made {{in terms of what the}} artists call “the trace.” At once a poetic trope and a set of material operations, the trace links presence and absence, inscription and erasure, preservation and destruction, and appearance and disappearance.|$|R
