50|$|The <b>Lesser</b> <b>Swallow</b> <b>Prominent</b> (Pheosia gnoma) is a moth {{from the}} family Notodontidae.|$|E
5000|$|The imago can {{be easily}} {{confused}} with Pheosia tremula but gnoma is usually smaller, and the ground colour has usually less brown in it; the chief character by which it may be distinguished is the broader and clearer white wedge-shaped mark between veins one and two on the fore wings of gnoma.The host plant of the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Swallow</b> <b>Prominent</b> is the birch- [...] Betula (British Isles), Betula pendula (Finland) Betula pubescens (Finland).|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} swallows, Brazza's martin feeds on flying insects, {{including}} termites, and may hunt over rivers or open savanna. It {{can occur in}} single-species flocks or with other swallows including barn <b>swallows,</b> <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallows,</b> or rock martins.|$|R
50|$|The {{host plant}} of the <b>Swallow</b> <b>Prominent</b> are the poplar, {{especially}} the aspen, the willow and the birch. For detailed list see Robinson, G. S., P. R. Ackery, I. J. Kitching, G. W. Beccaloni & L. M. Hern√°ndez, 2010.|$|R

50|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from the smaller <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow,</b> Hirundo abyssinica, in that the latter species has heavier and darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and rufous rather than buffy ear coverts. Lesser also prefers less open habitats.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> (Cecropis abyssinica) {{is a large}} swallow. It breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa from Sierra Leone and {{southern}} Sudan south into eastern South Africa. It is partially migratory with South African birds wintering further north. West African birds leave {{the north of the}} breeding range in the dry season.|$|R
5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> has {{heavier and}} darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and a {{brighter}} head colour than the larger greater striped <b>swallow.</b> The <b>lesser</b> also prefers less open habitats. It feeds mainly on flying insects, {{but has been}} known to eat small fruits. The flight is erratic, and the call is a nasal zeh zeh zeh zeh zeh.|$|R
50|$|The nest may be reused {{in later}} years, {{and one was}} {{utilised}} for 30 years. The nest is built in natural cavities or man-made structures such as buildings, culverts and shafts, but its preference for isolated and abandoned buildings means that this species has not benefited from artificial sites {{to the same extent}} as, for example, the greater or <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallows.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brazza's martin can be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows within its range by the heavy streaking on the underparts. [...] Although the <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> also has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head. Compared to the Mascarene martin, this species is smaller, has a plainer back and finer dashing on the throat and chest, {{but there is no}} range overlap.|$|R
50|$|Bates's swift forages {{above the}} canopy of the {{rainforest}} using a fluttering flight, with short periods of gliding occasionally interrupting the rapid wing beats. It may be seen singly, or in small flocks and in mixed flocks with other swifts and hirundines. It nests solitarily in the old nests of hirundines and other swifts, mainly forest swallow and possibly mottled spinetail and <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow.</b> Breeding has been recorded in September to March in Gabon and egg laying has been noted in Cameroon in May and June.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> is 15-10 cm long. It has {{dark blue}} upperparts {{with a red}} rump and a rufous-chestnut crown, nape and sides of the head. The underparts are white with dark streaking, and the upper wings and underwing flight {{feathers}} are blackish-brown. The underwing coverts are tawny. The blackish tail has very long outer feathers; these are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner, with less contrast and shorter outer tail feathers. There are five or six subspecies differing in {{the extent of the}} underpart streaking ...|$|R
50|$|No other {{streaked}} swallow species {{occur within}} the island breeding {{range of the}} Mascarene martin, and in Africa the <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head. The brown-throated sand martin has similar structure and plumage colour to the Mascarene martin, but has plain, unstreaked underparts. The small Mascarene swiftlet has longer, narrower wings than the martin, and a much lighter flight. The Brazza's martin is smaller, has a plainer back and finer dashing on the throat and chest, {{but there is no}} range overlap.|$|R
50|$|This is a bird of wooded, mainly lowland habitats, and is {{replaced}} in montane grassland by the greater striped swallow, Hirundo cucullata. It is common and often found around human habitation. The <b>lesser</b> striped <b>swallow</b> builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a tubular entrance {{on the underside}} of a suitable structure. The nest has a soft lining, and may be reused in later years. The nest may be built in a cave or under a rock overhang or a tree branch. This species has benefited from its willingness to use buildings, bridges, culverts and similar structures. Given the choice, it will select a high nest site.|$|R
25|$|Wilson's disease (WD) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} {{disorder in}} which patients have a problem metabolizing copper. In patients with WD, copper accumulates in the liver {{and other parts of}} the body, particularly the brain, eyes and kidneys. Upon accumulation in the brain, patients may experience speech problems, incoordination, <b>swallowing</b> problems, and <b>prominent</b> hyperkinetic symptoms including tremor, dystonia, and gait difficulties. Psychiatric disturbances such as irritability, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, and mood disturbances are also common.|$|R
50|$|Hatching {{success is}} 90% and the {{fledging}} survival rate is 70-90%. Average mortality is 70-80% {{in the first}} year and 40-70% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years. Barn <b>swallow</b> nestlings have <b>prominent</b> red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell-mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.|$|R
40|$|Background: Communication and <b>swallowing</b> {{changes are}} <b>prominent</b> in Parkinson's disease, but {{there remains a}} lack of {{information}} regarding the experiences and expectations of people with Parkinson's disease in respect of speech-language therapy (SLT) services. Aims: To conduct a survey of people with Parkinson's disease and their carers in the United Kingdom to elicit their views concerning communication and swallowing changes in Parkinson's disease and the support they envisage in helping with these changes. Methods & Procedures: A national survey utilizing a questionnaire developed for the project, accessible by people with Parkinson's disease in web-based, e-mail or paper forms. Outcomes & Results: A total of 168 people with Parkinson's disease (median = 7 years since diagnosis, range = 0. 5 - 30) and 47 carers who provided their impression {{of the experience of}} the PwPD responded. Of these 215, 92 (43 %) had no contact with SLT services. In general those who had seen an SLT found it a positive experience. Pointers for improvement centred around timing, intensity, duration and access to SLT as well as issues around transfer and maintenance of gains outside of clinic and (lack of) attention to psychosocial dimensions. Availability of ongoing support as the situation evolved and access to SLT when it was needed were two prominent features desired of a responsive service. Conclusions & Implications: Responses suggest that when SLT is available it offers positive support, but respondents felt (re) access when and where SLT is needed could improve, as well as what aspects of swallowing and communication were addressed in assessment and therapy. We reflect on possible recommendations to address the challenges for SLT services in considering organization and content of provision...|$|R
