Soundscapes and environmental sounds are often present in his works. Another distinctive character in his music is the use of feedback noise. Kuljuntausta has developed his own electronic system to generate and control feedback sounds live.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, capturing iris images under NIR light eliminates most of {{the rich}} melanin information because the chromophore of the human iris is only visible under VL [8, 9]. Therefore, light-pigmented irides exhibit more information under visible <b>light.</b> <b>Figure</b> 2 shows a green-yellow iris image captured under NIR and VL. It {{can be seen that}} the red channel reveals more information than the NIR image. So, intuitively, the recognition performance would be better for such images in the VL rather than the NIR spectrum.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a study into the bicycle lighting use. In this study the lighting on bicycles, on mopeds, and on cycles with auxiliary motors was specifically investigated {{for the first}} time regarding both the front and rear light. The measurements were conducted in January and February, 1996. The percentage of bicycles using front lighting had fallen to 51 %, when limiting firstly to the same four measurement locations as used in 1988 (65 %) and in 1993 (54 %). Here, Amsterdam represented the greatest anomaly with a user percentage of 27 %. The number of locations were extended to ten with the latest measurements. For these ten locations (including Amsterdam), the percentage of bicycles that used front lighting was 55 %, while for moped riders and cyclists with auxiliary motors, the figures were 94 % and 91 %, respectively. The operative rear <b>light</b> <b>figures</b> were only a few percent below the front <b>light</b> <b>figures.</b> The rear reflector presence was 94 %. If there was no rear reflector, the rear light only burned in 13 % of the cases. Cyclists aged over 25 years used lighting more often than the younger age categories. Women more often used their lights than men. See also B 27764 (IRRD 818165) and C 2411 (IRRD 862253) ...|$|R

The girl's <b>light</b> <b>figure</b> seemed to disappear in a smothering circumambient mass of bonnet ribbons and unintelligible drapery, as Mrs. Peckover saluted her with a rattling fire of kisses, the report of which was audible above the voluble talking of Mr. Blyth and the boisterous laughter of Zack.|$|R

These signs were meant to indicate Mrs. Blyth's father, the poor engraver, whose old-fashioned habit it was to pay homage to all his friends among the ladies, by saluting them from afar off with tremulous bows and gallant kissings of the hand.|$|R
