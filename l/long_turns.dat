60|$|THE {{foraging}} {{began with}} the first relenting days of winter, which usually came in February. Then the boys began {{to go to the}} woods to get sugar-water, as they called the maple sap, and they gave whole Saturdays to it as long as the sap would run. It took at least five or six boys to go for sugar-water, and they always had to get a boy whose father had an auger to come along, so as to have something to bore the trees with. On their way to the woods they had to stop at an elder thicket to get elder-wood to make spiles of, and at a straw pile to cut straws to suck the sap through, if the spiles would not work. They always brought lots of tin buckets to take the sap home in, and the big boys made the little fellows carry these, for they had to keep their own hands free to whittle the elder sticks into the form of spouts, and to push the pith out and make them hollow. They talked loudly and all at once, and they ran {{a good deal of the}} way, from the excitement. If it was a good sugar-day, there were patches of snow still in the fence corners and shady places, which they searched for rabbit-tracks; but the air was so warm that they wanted to take their shoes off, and begin going barefoot at once. Overhead, the sky was a sort of pale, milky blue, with the sun burning softly through it, and casting faint shadows. When they got into the woods, it was cooler, and there were more patches of snow, with bird-tracks and squirrel-tracks in them. They could hear the blue-jays snarling at one another, and the yellowhammer chuckling; on some dead tree a redheaded woodpecker hammered noisily, and if the boys had only had a gun with them they could have killed lots of things. Now and then they passed near some woodchoppers, whose axes made a pleasant sound, without frightening any of the wild things, they had got so used to them; sometimes the boys heard the long hollow crash of a tree they were felling. But all the time they kept looking out for a good sugar-tree, and when they saw a maple stained black from the branches down with the sap running from the little holes that the sap-suckers had made, they burst into a shout, and dashed forward, and the fellow with the auger began to bore away, while the other fellows stood round and told him how, and wanted to make him let them do it. Up and down the tree there was a soft murmur from the bees that had found it out before the boys, and every now and then they wove through the air the straight lines of their coming and going, and made the fellows wish they could find a bee-tree. But for the present these were intent upon the sugar-tree, and kept hurrying up the boy with the auger. When he had bored in deep enough, they tried to fit a spile to the hole, but it was nearly always crooked and too big, or else it pointed downward and the water would not run up through the spile. Then some of them got out their straws, and began to suck the sap up from the hole through them, and to quarrel and push, till they agreed to take turn-about, and others got the auger and bunted for another blackened tree. They never could get their spiles to work, and the water gathered so slowly in the holes they bored, and some of the fellows took such <b>long</b> <b>turns,</b> that it was very little fun. They tried to get some good out of the small holes the sap-suckers had made, but there were only a few drops in them, mixed with bark and moss. If it had not been for the woodchoppers, foraging for sugar-water would always have been a failure; but one of them was pretty sure to come up with his axe in his hand, and show the boys how to get the water. He would choose one of the roots near the foot of the tree, and chop a clean, square hole in it; the sap flew at each stroke of his axe, and it rose so fast in the well he made that the thirstiest boy could not keep it down, and three or four boys, with their heads jammed tight together and their straws plunged into its depths, lay stretched upon their stomachs and drank their fill at once. When every one was satisfied, or as nearly satisfied as a boy can ever be, they began to think how they could carry some of the sugar-water home. But by this time it would be pretty late in the afternoon; and they would have to put it off till some other day, when they intended to bring something to dip the water out with; the buckets they had brought were all too big. Then, if they could get enough, they meant to boil it down and make sugar-wax. I never knew of any boys who did so.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the major}} dental {{problems}} among Alaska Natives in rural villages is tooth disease, which occurs {{when there is a}} buildup of plaque and tartar on the teeth. Plaque is the sticky mass of germs, which are bacteria found in the mouth. When plaque is left on the teeth {{for more than a few}} days it builds up a heavy growth of disease that causes bacteria, and then it rapidly starts infecting the teeth. Plaque that is left for too <b>long</b> <b>turns</b> into tartar, which is hardened plaque. Tartar then creates a layer of disease-carrying germs on the teeth and gums. When it gets to the gums, it causes gum disease, which makes gums bleed easily and become swollen. If gum disease is left untreated it will cause teeth to become diseased and fall out. In these rural villages tooth and gum disease is quite often left untreated due to lack of dental care.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the intent}} to force the village of indomitable Gauls to accept Roman civilization, Julius Caesar plans to destroy the {{surrounding}} forest {{to make way for}} a Roman patrician colony, called the 'Mansions of the Gods'. The project is led by the architect Squaronthehypotenus, who orders an army of slaves of various nationalities to pull down the trees in the forest. With the help of Getafix's magic, Asterix and Obelix plant acorns that grow into mature oak tress instantly; whereupon an increasingly erratic Squaronthehypotenus threatens [...] "to work the slaves to death". Taking this literally, Asterix gives the slaves magic potion with which to rebel; but the slaves, upon rebellion, do not stop work and leave, as Asterix intended, but insist on better working conditions, regular pay, and freedom after completing the first block of the Mansions of the Gods (similar to that of modern-day employers and trade unionists). Upon hearing that the slaves are better paid than they, the Roman legionaries go on strike for similar and better conditions for themselves (a common occurrence among French strikers). Since the freedom of the slaves depends on constructing at least one building, the Gauls allow the work to proceed. After their release, a group of the former slaves (the (almost) luckless pirates from previous adventures) [...] "float a company" [...] with their wages. Finally, the first completed building of the Mansions of the Gods is inhabited by Roman families: the first of these consisting of a patrician husband and wife selected by lottery. These Romans then go shopping in the village which, before <b>long,</b> <b>turns</b> into a market town selling [...] "antique" [...] weapons and fish to the Romans, embroiled in price wars and (in the case of some of the wives) assuming Roman dress. To counteract this, Asterix asks Squaronthehypotenus for an apartment, but is told they are full; whereafter the initial winners of the first apartment are continually harassed by Obelix acting like a rabid monster, with Asterix holding him back. The next day, the couple returns to Rome and Asterix arranges for Cacofonix the bard to move into the vacated apartment. As a result of the bard's discordant nocturnal practice, the rest of the Roman inhabitants return to Rome as well. Squaronthehypotenus tries to keep the Mansions in business by bringing the local Roman soldiers as tenants and expels Cacofonix from the building; whereupon the Gauls take this as an insult, and destroy the Roman colony. The legionnaires gratefully return to their camp and Squaronthehypotenus announces his plan to go to Egypt to build pyramids in the desert with [...] "nice quiet tenants". That evening, the Gauls hold their usual celebratory banquet (in which this time Cacofonix takes part) and the ruins of the mansion are covered by Getafix's instantaneous trees.|$|E

Now, the task aims to assess production only, with awarding lower test scores concerning two components, namely Communicative value and Discourse management, of the rating scale if interaction is to take place. The findings contradict well-established results of the fluency-accuracy continuum research. What is more, significant changes in test scores can only be observed at the components in which no changes were made. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{argues that}} by mapping three {{selected}} discursive practices – Explanations, Accounts, and Formulations – and by interpreting their respective roles and interrelations, {{it is possible}} to assess how, through talk, decisions are developed and implemented in meetings. Drawing on a longitudinal, year-long observation of business meetings undertaken by managerial teams in a large UK Chamber of Commerce and on analyses of authentic audio data, the thesis investigates how decision making is enacted in meetings discourse in the context of organisational change. A structured, Conversation-analytical approach is employed to examine the transcribed data and develops a macro-/micro- matrix within which to understand the behaviour and influences of the practices on decision-making. The research specifically expands the role of Explanations and furthers the established communicative properties of Accounts and Formulations proposed in the ground-breaking work of Scott and Lyman (1968) and Heritage and Watson (1979), respectively. Most importantly, the analysis identifies the significance of <b>long</b> <b>turns</b> in the meetings data, and documents the link between decision-making and the recurrence and clustering of the three practices in or around these.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find out what questions are easy and what are difficult to answer. This distinction serves as a base for composing the exam tasks because according to Todd (1998 : 57) teachers should sequence questions they want to ask, considering question types, in a series of questions ordered from easy to difficult. Easy questions are important for slower students. We should enable them to answer our questions and this way take part in conversation, while difficult questions can be asked from more advanced students in order to select the really excellent ones. Meanwhile I am also interested in what kind of questions to ask students at exams to extract short or long answers from them depending on the given task or situation because students are required to use interactional short turns, transactional short and <b>long</b> <b>turns</b> at school-leaving exams.

40|$|The {{prominence}} of lexical chunks or prefabricated language has grown over recent years, however {{there have been}} few longitudinal case studies exploring changes in non-native speaker (NNS) speech and little work done involving NNSs in identifying chunks in their own speech. This study attempts to track changes in two intermediate-level Japanese students' spoken usage of lexical chunks over a period of five months in the UK. Each NNS was recorded three times in conversational <b>long</b> <b>turns</b> at two-month intervals. Twelve native speakers (NSs) were asked to order transcripts of each student's speech by perceived fluency level and three also underlined the lexical chunks; however there was little coherence amongst NSs in these tasks. Identification of chunks using Wordsmith software suggests an overall rise in the percentage of talk within chunks and a reduction in ill-formed chunks over the five months. Following some awareness-raising training on identifying lexical chunks, the Japanese students themselves were asked to identify chunks within their own transcripts. Despite the difficulty of the task, they were able to do this and additionally offered insights into which chunks were common for them. These insights included an awareness of typical Japanese phrases and how they felt their speech had changed overall. A further recording and transcribing cycle suggests that this training resulted in some short-term uptake as the percentage of chunks used increased after the lessons. Both students found it highly motivating to record and analyse transcripts of their talk as they could see progress in their own spoken language development...|$|E

An experimental investigation on oscillating heat pipes with uneven turns was conducted {{in order to determine the}} effect of short turns on the heat transport capability. The shorter turns do not go through both the evaporating and condensing sections; the short turns were placed only in the evaporating section. The design of the OHP consists of 14 <b>long</b> <b>turns</b> which run from the evaporator to the condenser and 6 short turns were placed only on the evaporating section. An extensive experimental investigation on the effects of the input power, tilted angle, condensing temperature, and charging ratio was conducted. Experimental results show that for all test conditions, the OHP functions very well and it can transport an input power up to 1200 W and can reach a thermal resistance of 0. 028. From the experimental results of tilted angle effect, it can be found that the heat pipe is almost independent of the tilted angle. Most importantly, it is shown that with a number of short turns placed on the evaporating section, the OHP can operate efficiently without the assistance of the gravitational force. In other words, the heat pipe developed herein can operate at a condition of the heating section on the top and the cooling section on the bottom with a distance of 18. 5 cm from the center of the evaporator section the center of the condensing section. In addition, the results show that the heat transfer performance depends on the operating temperature and charging ratio. When the operating temperature increases, the heat transfer performance of the OHP investigated herein significantly increase. WC/o...|$|E
