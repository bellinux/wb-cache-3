5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian <b>longliners,</b> led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the round ribbontail ray as Vulnerable. It cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure {{due to its}} low reproductive rate, and there is widespread degradation of its coral reef habitat, including from agricultural runoff and destructive fishing practices such as blast fishing. This species is caught by commercial and fisheries throughout its range, using line gear and trawls. One region where it is heavily pressured is in Indonesian waters, where it and other large rays are taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle netters, <b>longliners,</b> and trawlers operating off Java, Bali, New Guinea, and Lombok. All landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for <b>longliners</b> which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E

40|$|Standardization {{of catch}} per unit effort (cpue) series using a {{generalized}} linear model (GLM) for Northern European hake Merluccius merluccius (L., 1758) in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) subarea VII, based on catch and effort data from the Spanish trawler and <b>longliner</b> fleets from 1986 to 2000, are presented. Data were collected from trawler and <b>longliner</b> fleets targeting hake off the Spanish ports of La Coruña, Burela, and Celeiro. Main factors in the models created include a factor for engine Horse Power, to adjust for characteris-tics that determine fishing power; Year and Month factors for La Coruña’s trawler fleet; and the factors Month, Year, Vessel, and Fishing Days for the Spanish <b>longliner</b> fleet as a whole. Moreover, both models indicate that interactions between the Year and Month factors also {{had a significant impact}} on hake catch rates. The total proportions of variance explained by these models were 55 % for La Coruña’s trawler fleet, and about 48 % for Spanish <b>longliner</b> fleet. The results showed sim-ilar patterns comparing nominal and standardized catch rates...|$|R
5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish <b>longliners</b> and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, the U.S. fishing fleet used sailing vessels. By the early 20th century, fishing vessels were built as steam boats with steam engines, or as schooners with {{auxiliary}} gasoline engines. By the 1930s the fleet was almost completely converted to diesel vessels. Fishing gear became more technical: Alaska purse seiners were in use by 1870, <b>longliners</b> {{were introduced in}} 1885; otter trawls were operating in the groundfish and shrimp fisheries by the early 20th century.

50|$|During the 17th century, the British {{developed}} the dogger, an early type of sailing trawler or <b>longliner,</b> which commonly operated in the North Sea. The dogger takes {{its name from}} the Dutch word dogger, meaning a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Dutch trawling boats were common in the North Sea, and the word dogger was given to the area where they often fished, which became known as the Dogger Bank.|$|R
25|$|Around the mid-18th century, {{goods and}} {{passengers}} {{began to be}} transported by ship between London and Whitstable, and a toll road was built to the cathedral city of Canterbury. These improvements in transport led to the town's development as a seaside resort; the first advertisements for bathing machines at Whitstable appeared in 1768. In 1790 the manor was sold to private landowners, and three years later the rights to harvest the oyster beds were bought by the newly established Company of Free Fishers and Dredgers of Whitstable, the successor to the Whitstable Company of Dredgers. Between roughly 1775 and 1875 the well smacks or early <b>longliners</b> out of Barking and other local fishing ports would collect lugworms and whelks from Whitstable's bait-diggers and dredgers before beginning their tour for prime fish north to Iceland. Whelks suspended in net bags in the well could live for a while due to circulating fresh water.|$|E
500|$|Since 1980, the Australian blacktip shark {{has also}} been {{targeted}} by Australian commercial gillnetters and <b>longliners</b> in the Northern Shark Fishery. It is additionally caught incidentally by other commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes or prawns. The contemporary northern Australian shark catch {{is estimated to be}} between 100 and 900 tons (live weight) annually, of which most are Australian blacktip and spottail sharks. The meat of this species is sold in Australia as [...] "flake", though it may contain high concentrations of mercury. The fins are exported to Asia, while the cartilage, liver oil, and skin may also be used. Since fishing pressure on the Australian blacktip shark is now much lower than historical levels, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, of potential concern are Indonesian fishers in the Arafura Sea, who are increasingly trespassing into the AFZ.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Longliners</b> – use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built <b>longliners</b> can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale <b>longliners</b> handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|E

40|$|Exploitation of {{fish stocks}} is {{dependent}} on effort, catchability, the selectivity of the gear used, and the fishermen's choice of time and place. A full-scale fishing experiment was conducted in February 1996 at the coast of Finnmark, Norway; involving a trawler, a <b>longliner</b> and a gillnetter. The objective was to investigate how the length distributions of the catches were influenced by the gear type and the fishermen's strategy in fishing operations. The target species was North-East Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The study analyses relative selectivity of the gears during a week when the boats fished in a predestined area, and during a week when the skippers were allowed to fish as close to commercial operation as possible with regard to choice of fishing grounds and depths. Gillnet catches consisted almost solely of large cod. Trawl and longline fished similar length distributions of cod although the L 50 for cod was higher in long line than in trawl.
