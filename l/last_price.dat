6000|$|Thus constituted, with {{an immense}} body of natural means, which are lessened in their amount {{only to be}} {{increased}} in their effect, France has, since the accomplishment of the Revolution, a complete unity in its direction. It has destroyed every resource of the state which depends upon opinion and the good-will of individuals. The riches of convention disappear. The advantages of Nature in some measure remain; even these, I admit, are astonishingly lessened; the command over what remains is complete and absolute. We go about asking when assignats will expire, and we laugh at the <b>last</b> <b>price</b> of them. But what signifies the fate of those tickets of despotism? The despotism will find despotic means of supply. They have found the short cut to the productions of Nature, while others, in pursuit of them, are obliged to wind through the labyrinth of a very intricate state of society. They seize upon {{the fruit of the}} labor; they seize upon the laborer himself. Were France but half of what it is in population, in compactness, in applicability of its force, situated as it is, and being what it is, it would be too strong for most of the states of Europe, constituted as they are, and proceeding as they proceed. Would it be wise to estimate what the world of Europe, as well as the world of Asia, had to dread from Genghiz Khân, upon a contemplation of the resources of the cold and barren spot in the remotest Tartary from whence first issued that scourge of the human race? Ought we to judge from the excise and stamp duties of the rocks, or from the paper circulation of the sands of Arabia, the power by which Mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful empires of the world, beat one of them totally to the ground, broke to pieces the other, and, in not much longer space of time than I have lived, overturned governments, laws, manners, religion, and extended an empire from the Indus to the Pyrenees? ...|$|E

50|$|An uptick is {{when the}} <b>last</b> (non-zero) <b>price</b> change is positive, and a downtick {{is when the}} <b>last</b> (non-zero) <b>price</b> change is negative.

50|$|The {{uptick rule}} is a trading {{restriction}} that states that short selling a stock is only allowed on an uptick.

One Canada Post NVI stamp covers the cost of mailing a standard letter up to 30 g within Canada.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Cardwell {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} positive and negative reversals in the RSI. Reversals are the opposite of divergence. For example, a positive reversal occurs when an uptrend price correction results in a higher low compared to the <b>last</b> <b>price</b> correction, while RSI results in a lower low compared to the prior correction. A negative reversal happens when a downtrend rally results in a lower high compared to the last downtrend rally, but RSI makes a higher high compared to the prior rally.|$|E

50|$|Telephone and {{teleprinter}} {{have been}} the broker's first main tools. The teleprinter, or Teletype, got financial quotes and printed them out on a ticker tape.

[...] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609. [...] The <b>last</b> <b>price</b> increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, [...] "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," [...] letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations, and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging. The <b>last</b> <b>price</b> increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as [...] "shocking" [...] and [...] "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction {{from the point of view}} of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses. [...] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens, a gesture that was called a [...] "classic public relations move" [...] by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim. The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.|$|E

If this new average NYMEX spot price changes by ±4 cents per litre over the last NYMEX spot price average, used to set the scheduled price change, the pump price may be adjusted using the new average NYMEX spot price as the baseline. If the interrupter is not triggered on the interruption date, the current pump price will continue until the next price change the following Thursday.In extreme circumstances, precipitated by a weather or perhaps a geopolitical event, a catastrophic interrupter could initiated whereby international product prices change by significant amounts, say ±15 cents per litre.

5000|$|Mylan's {{efforts to}} {{maintain}} its market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor {{was rejected by the}} FDA in March 2016. By the first half of 2015, sales of EpiPen accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit. Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2007, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; the price was about the same in 2009; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609, around a 500% jump from the price in 2009. The <b>last</b> <b>price</b> increase sparked widespread outrage in the late summer as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens.
