40|$|Objective: {{to analyse}} the {{economic}} benefits, {{in comparison with}} placebo, of the secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (Kardegic(R)) in patients {{with a history of}} ischaemic stroke, MI or stable and unstable angina pectoris. Design and setting: This was a modelling study from the perspectives of direct medical costs, the social security system and society in France. Methods: Efficacy data for the secondary prevention of ischaemic events were derived from the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis on antithrombotics. The rates and costs of ischaemic disease and of serious gastrointestinal adverse affects arising from long term aspirin treatment, as well as the costs of treatment with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> were taken from published sources, using French data where possible. Results: From the social security perspective, the estimated cost-effectiveness ratios show that the prevention of MI in patients with a history of unstable angina (with a 1 -year follow-up) is a cost-saving strategy, with net benefits ranging from $US 5703 (1996 prices) per avoided MI for <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> 300 mg/day to $US 5761 per avoided MI for <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> 75 mg/day. The prevention of MI and stroke is also a cost-saving strategy in patients with prior MI [net benefits in a 2 -year follow-up (5 % discount rate) ranging from $US 15 to $US 494 per avoided MI and from $US 37 to $US 1170 per avoided stroke]. This was also true in patients with prior ischaemic stroke (net benefits in a 3 -year follow-up ranging from $US 610 to $US 2082 per avoided MI and from $US 176 to $US 599 per avoided stroke). Finally, a 4 -year follow-up in patients with a history of stable angina pectoris shows that prophylactic treatment with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> is associated with net costs per avoided MI, ranging from $US 4375 to $US 3608 per avoided event. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that prophylaxis with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> in patients at high risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events results in savings in social security expenditure. Conclusions: Our results underline the high economic benefit of using <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> to prevent secondary ischaemic stroke and MI in patients at high risk of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events, leading to savings for the social security system and society.

40|$|Inhaled frusemide {{effectively}} {{prevents the}} bronchial obstructive response to allergens {{and to a}} number of nonallergic stimuli. In most of the experimental models in which it has been tested, the protective effect of frusemide has been evaluated for only a short time after administration. In aspirin-sensitive patients, acetylsalicylic acid causes an asthmatic reaction which typically lasts for 2 h or more after exposure. We investigated the presence and duration of the protective effect of inhaled frusemide against the bronchial response to aspirin in sensitive patients, using a specific inhalation challenge with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (LASA). In the first study, eight subjects with aspirin-asthma underwent two bronchial challenges with a single dose of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> administered through a jet nebulizer, after treatment with 40 mg inhaled frusemide or placebo, according to a randomized, double-blind protocol. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was monitored for 120 min after challenge. In the second study in eight patients, the protocol was modified by the use of a dosimeter for delivery of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> by reducing the dose of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> to avoid intense reactions, and by extending the follow-up to 4 h. In the first study, after placebo, FEV 1 gradually decreased, reaching a maximum decrement of 39 +/- 3 % at 120 min. Inhaled frusemide exerted a significant protection at all time-points, although this activity appeared to decrease with time. In the second study, after placebo, inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> caused a gradual decrease in FEV 1, which reached a maximum decrement at 180 min.

40|$|Inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and {{furosemide}} exert {{a mutually}} potentiating protective activity on experimentally induced bronchoconstriction in asthma. Our {{purpose was to}} investigate the clinical effectiveness of combined treatment of asthma with inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and furosemide. We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in nine patients with chronic asthma requiring a high dose (2 mg/day) of inhaled beclomethasone for clinical control. Patients were treated with a combination of 720 mg inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and 40 mg furosemide twice daily, or with matched placebo in addition to inhaled steroids. The dose of inhaled steroids was reduced by half every 15 days and eventually suspended unless a patient's respiratory condition worsened. During treatment with placebo, all patients had worsening of asthma at dosages of 1 or 0. 5 mg/day beclomethasone (mean +/- SE, 833 +/- 83 micrograms/day). During combined treatment complete suspension of inhaled steroids in two patients and reduction to 0. 5 to 0. 25 mg in the remaining seven patients (mean, 250 +/- 72 micrograms/day) was achieved, with a mean reduction of 71 % +/- 7 %. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second, weekly peak expiratory flow rate, symptom score, and bronchodilator intake remained significantly better with combined treatment than with placebo. Treatment with inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and furosemide allows a considerable sparing of inhaled steroids without significant side effects in patients with severe asthma...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} tested (i) {{the effect}} of orexin A injected into a lateral cerebral ventricle on sympathetic and thermogenic activity and (ii) the involvement of prostaglandins in these phenomena. The firing rates of the sympathetic nerves to interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), along with IBAT and colonic temperatures and heart rate were monitored in urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats before and 6 h after an injection of orexin A (1. 5 nmol) into the lateral cerebral ventricle. The same variables were monitored in rats with an intraperitoneal administration of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (100 mg/kg bw), an inhibitor of prostaglandins synthesis. The results show that orexin A increases the sympathetic firing rate, IBAT and colonic temperatures and heart rate.

40|$|Nonsteroid {{antiinflammatory}} drugs {{interfere with}} the diuretic activity of furosemide, implying that this effect is at least partially dependent on renal prostaglandin synthesis. To investigate whether prostaglandin production could also modulate the bronchial antireactive activity of this diuretic drug, we investigated the effect of inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (162 mg) and of furosemide (18 mg), alone and in combination, on the bronchial obstructive response to ultrasonically nebulized water in asthmatic patients. The study was also prompted by the conflicting results obtained in previous studies of oral nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs. Fifteen asthmatic patients underwent bronchial challenge with a mist of ultrasonically nebulized distilled water {{at the same time}} of day on four occasions, 2 - 4 days apart, 15 min after premedication according to a double-blind, randomized protocol. After placebo, mean PD 15 to water mist did not differ from a preliminary test (2. 1 +/- 0. 2 and 2. 5 +/- 0. 4 ml, M +/- SE, respectively). After <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> mean PD 15 rose to 5. 0 +/- 0. 7 ml (2. 8 +/- 0. 6 times higher than placebo); after furosemide, to 9. 0 +/- 1. 5 ml (4. 4 +/- 0. 9 times over placebo); and after the two drugs in combination, to 32. 2 +/- 5. 6 ml (16. 3 +/- 3. 0 times higher than placebo). Similar results were obtained with inhaled indomethacin, whereas sodium salicylate had no effect. These data indicate that the bronchial antireactive activity of inhaled furosemide is greatly enhanced by inhaled <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> through a mechanism which probably involves inhibition of the local synthesis of prostaglandins, and could have therapeutic implications...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} trigeminal sensory processing {{in patients}} with migraine using a novel "nociception-specific" blink reflex. METHODS: Seventeen patients with unilateral migraine headache were studied within 6 hours of onset. Blink reflexes were elicited with a standard stimulating electrode (standard blink reflex) and concentric stimulating electrode (nociception-specific blink reflex) during the acute migraine attack, after treatment with IV <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (1, 000 mg) or oral zolmitriptan (5 mg) and interictally. RESULTS: After standard stimulation, no differences were detected for the R 1 and R 2 onset latencies and areas under the curve (AUC) between the different time points and the headache and nonheadache side. Nociception-specific stimulation revealed a shortening of R 2 onset latencies (44. 3 +/- 5. 4 ms for headache side vs 48. 9 +/- 5. 8 ms for nonheadache side) during the acute migraine attack compared with the headache-free interval (49. 8 +/- 5. 3 vs 49. 8 +/- 4. 5 ms). The AUC of the R 2 increased on the headache side by 680 % and on the nonheadache side by 230 % compared with the headache-free interval. Drug treatment parallel to pain relief increased the onset latencies (zolmitriptan: 48. 0 +/- 8. 2 ms for headache side vs 52. 3 +/- 7. 6 ms for nonheadache side; lysine acetylsalicylate: 48. 0 +/- 5. 0 ms for headache side vs 51. 2 +/- 5. 6 ms for nonheadache side) and reduced the AUC of R 2 (zolmitriptan by 45 % and <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> by 48 %).

40|$|Aspirin is {{commonly}} used to treat migraine attacks, although sumatriptan, a much more expensive treatment, is also effective. We compared a combination of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (equivalent to 900 mg aspirin) and 10 mg metoclopramide (LAS+MTC) with oral sumatriptan (100 mg) and placebo in 421 patients with migraine. LAS+MTC was as effective as sumatriptan with a decrease of headache from severe or moderate to mild or none of 57 % and 53 %, respectively, for the first migraine attack treated.

Moreover, we studied the effect of LAS on the growth of fibroblasts derived from normal skin to determine whether the response was similar to that obtained in the above-mentioned cells. Fibroblasts were obtained from tissue samples of nasal polyps from two aspirin-tolerant and two aspirin-intolerant patients, and from the normal skin of a healthy donor. The cells were treated with LAS (20 - 2000 microg/ml of culture medium). Cell growth and viability were evaluated after 3 and 6 days of culture.

Little {{is known of}} the change in airway responsiveness to neurokinin A (NKA) after cyclooxygenase blockade. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we have investigated the effect of the potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor, <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (L-ASA) admin-istered by inhalation, on the bronchoconstrictor response both to neurokinin A (NKA) and methacholine in nine asthmatic subjects.

40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of nitroglycerin (NTG), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, in migraineurs triggers {{after several hours}} an attack of which the precise mechanisms are unknown. We found previously in rats that nitroglycerin (10 mg/kg s. c.) is able to increase significantly after 4 h the number of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) -immunoreactive neurones in the cervical part of trigeminal nucleus caudalis. In the present experiments, we demonstrate that the 5 -HT 1 (B/D) agonist sumatriptan (0. 6 mg/kg s. c.) does not alter this phenomenon when given before NTG. By contrast, pretreatment with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (50 mg/kg i. m.) attenuates the NTG-induced nNOS expression in the superficial laminae of trigeminal nucleus caudalis. These findings suggest that effect of NTG on nNOS at a high dosage may involve the cycloxygenase pathway and that activation of the peripheral 5 -HT 1 (B/D) receptors {{is not able to}} modify this effect. These data could help to better understand the role of NO in the pathogenesis of headaches and the action of antimigraine drugs. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The patients were divided in two groups: {{a group of}} 28 patients with ASA intolerance, including 20 with ASA triad, {{and a group of}} 15 patients without ASA intolerance. The local treatment was usually started 1 month after polypectomy and was well tolerated without side effects.

40|$|Understanding of the {{antiinflammatory}} {{actions of}} nonsteroidal drugs is incomplete, but these actions {{are believed to}} occur in the periphery, without any contribution from the central nervous system. Recent research on the antipyretic antiinflammatory neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone indicates that it can act centrally to inhibit peripheral inflammation; this raises the possibility that other agents, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, may have similar activity. In the present research both <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and sodium salicylate inhibited edema, induced in the mouse ear by topical application of picryl chloride, when injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle. This inhibitory activity on a measure of acute inflammation was not due to escape of the drugs into the periphery, because systemic injection of doses that were effective centrally did not affect inflammation. In contrast, central administration of a dose of indomethacin that was antiinflammatory when given intraperitoneally did not inhibit peripheral inflammation. Thus indomethacin apparently lacks the central antiinflammatory action of the salicylates. This observation, plus our inability to demonstrate either an antiinflammatory effect of intracerebroventricular dexamethasone, a prostaglandin inhibitor, or a pro-inflammatory influence of prostaglandin E 2, suggests that prostaglandins are not important to central modulation of inflammation. The results indicate that, in addition to having central influences on fever and pain, salicylates can act within the brain to inhibit acute inflammation in the periphery...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} prostaglandins are {{involved}} in endothelium-dependent vasodilatory responses of the skin microcirculation. METHODS: Twenty-three young male volunteers were studied on 2 different days 1 - 3 weeks apart. On each experimental day the forearm skin blood flow response to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (Ach, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator) was determined with laser Doppler imaging following the intravenous administration of either the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (L-AS), 900 mg, or the oral intake of indomethacin, 75 mg. Acetylcholine was iontophoresed both in presence and in absence of surface anesthesia. In some subjects, the effects of L-AS on skin reactive hyperemia were also assessed. RESULTS: Acute cyclo-oxygenase inhibition with either drug influenced neither the skin blood flow response to 4 different doses of Ach (0. 28, 1. 4, 7, and 14 mC/cm 2) nor reactive hyperemia. The peak vasodilatory response to Ach was significantly increased by skin anesthesia, {{regardless of whether the}} subjects received the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor or not. For example, the mean response (+/-SD) to the largest dose of Ach (tested in 6 subjects, expressed in perfusion units) were as follows: in absence of anesthesia: L-AS 339 +/- 105, placebo 344 +/- 68; with anesthesia: L-AS 453 +/- 76, placebo 452 +/- 65 (p <. 01 for effect of anesthesia). CONCLUSIONS: These data give no support for a contribution of prostaglandins to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation or to reactive hyperemia in the skin microcirculation.

Each subject performed two challenges with a single dose of LASA that caused a decrease in FEV 1 of 20 % or more in a preliminary test, immediately after inhaling 100 micrograms PGE 2 in 4 ml saline or placebo, according to a randomized double-blind protocol. FEV 1 was recorded at 30 -min intervals for 4 h. u-LTE 4 was measured by combined high-performance liquid chromatography enzyme immunoassay at 2 -h intervals.

Inhaled SSA partially prevented both the early and late response, providing a protection with respect to placebo of 22 +/- 6 % in the early phase and 23 +/- 9 % in the late phase of the response. These values were lower (but not significantly) than those of LASA (41 +/- 9 % and 39 +/- 11 %, respectively). In a second group of patients, indomethacin failed to affect the early response, while LASA provided a protection of 31 +/- 7 %. However, these two drugs were equally effective in reducing the late response (44 +/- 18 % and 39 +/- 17 % protection for LASA and indomethacin, respectively), In subjects with an early response, despite being ineffective in preventing allergen-induced bronchoconstriction, indomethacin blocked the allergen-induced increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness measured 2 h after challenge. We conclude that inhaled salicylates, but not indomethacin, exert a protective activity against the early allergic response.

40|$|To {{control the}} {{stability}} of the <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> compound (LAS) in aqueous solution, some studies of the hydronium ion-catalyzed, hydroxide ion-catalyzed, and spontaneous reactions of this active ingredient in water solutions have been carried out. The pH-rate profile (log kobs = f(pH)), shows that the hydrolysis reaction of the LAS, is conducted by a catalysis acid-base mechanism, with multiple reaction pathways. The rate constants, kH, kOH and k 0 to the reaction pathways catalyzed by H 3 O+, HO– ions and to the spontaneous reaction, for the hydrolysis reaction of the reagent LAS, were determined. The results show that the studied compound LAS is unstable in basic medium and the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by HO– ions is predominant. For a known acidity (pH ≈ 10), studies conducted for different temperatures of the medium, clearly indicate, that the experimental rate constant kobs,depends on the temperature according to the Arrhenius equation. The activation parameters: activation energy (Ea), enthalpy (ΔH≠) and entropy (ΔS≠), for the transition state were determined, The very negative value obtained for the activation parameter ΔS*, first indicates that in the transition state there is gain in order, then this late state, resembles the products and that probably for the mechanism of the LAS hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by HO– ions, the rate-determining step is a bimolecular reaction.

Thirteen asthmatic patients performed two UNDW challenges 20 minutes and 24 hours after inhalation of 900 mg <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (L-ASA) or placebo. The volume of UNDW causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (UNDW PD 20) was calculated by linear interpolation on the dose-response curve. UNDW response after placebo was {{not significantly different from}} the preliminary test (PD 20 4. 3 +/- 0. 7 and 4. 1 +/- 04 ml, respectively, mean +/- SE), whereas after L-ASA, UNDW PD 20 increased to 17 +/- 2. 7 ml (p < 0. 01 vs placebo) and remained significantly increased after 24 hours. In another group of 12 patients under the same experimental conditions, an equivalent dose of inhaled sodium salicylate caused no effect. Finally, in a third group of asthmatic patients pretreatment with inhaled indomethacin at two dose levels (6 patients, 25 mg; 10 patients, 50 mg) resulted in a significant dose-related protective effect. These findings indicate that inhaled indomethacin and especially L-ASA exert against UNDW-induced bronchoconstriction a potent protective effect, which appears to be mediated by inhibition of local prostaglandin synthesis in the airways. This fact could have therapeutic implications...|$|E

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 115 patients with nasal polyposis were randomly assigned to 4 different groups and treated as follows: (1) group A, 25 patients were first surgically treated and then treated with LAS; (2) group B, 25 patients received 40 mg of triamcinolone retard intramuscularly 3 times every 10 days (total dose 120 mg) and then they were treated with LAS; (3) group C, 16 patients were surgically treated and then treated with LAS and amphotericin B; (4) group D: 23 patients were treated with a medical polypectomy and steroids (as in the group B) and then with LAS and amphotericin B. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between groups C and D, groups C and A, or groups B and D. However, the recurrence of nasal polyps in the groups treated with amphotericin B plus LAS (C and D) was significantly lower (P =. 018) than in the 2 groups treated only with LAS (A and B). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that long term topical treatment with LAS and amphotericin B may be clinically effective in the treatment of patients with nasal polyposis associated with fungal infection...|$|E
40|$|The role of prostaglandins (PG) E 2 and F 2 α on urinary Na {{excretion}} was {{studied in}} paired isolated dog kidneys which were blood perfused on Nizet’s oxygenators. In group 1 experiments, <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (LAS), a PG-synthetase inhibitor, {{was added to}} the blood perfusing one kidney, the contralateral paired kidney being observed as control. In group 2 and in group 3 experiments, both kidneys were treated with LAS but PGE 2 (group 2) or PGF 2 α (group 3) {{was added to the}} experimental kidneys. In group 1, LAS inhibited the spontaneous vasodilatation characterizing the isolated dog kidney perfusion while PGE 2 or PGF 2 α addition to LAS-treated kidneys restored vasodilatation. No significant difference in glomerular filtration rate between experimental and control kidneys was observed in any of the three groups of experiments. In group 1, LAS reduced tubular Na reabsorption rate, presumably at a distal site (clearance studies). PGF 2 α reduced Na excretion rate in LAS-treated kidneys of group 3 while PGE 2 increased it in similar conditions (group 2). In group 1, LAS reduced PG levels in the perfusing blood mainly by decreasing PGF 2 α concentrations. A significant correlation was demonstrated between tubular Na reabsorption rate, expressed as a fraction of Na filtered load, and PGF 2 α levels. In the isolated dog kidney, Na tubular transport is thus inhibited by PGE 2 (hemodynamic or direct tubular effect) while it is enhanced by PGF 2 α (direct tubular effect). © 1979 S. Karger AG, Basel.

40|$|Background Aspirin {{inhibits}} colorectal carcinogenesis. In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, daily soluble aspirin {{significantly reduced}} recurrence of colorectal adenomas at 1 -year follow-up. In this study {{the results of}} daily intake of low-dose aspirin on polyp recurrence at 4 -year follow-up are presented. Methods 272 patients (naive for chronic aspirin use) with colorectal adenomas {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment with <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> 160 mg/day (n= 73) or 300 mg/day (n= 67) or placebo (n= 132) for 4 years. The primary endpoints were adenoma recurrence and adenomatous polyp burden at year 4, comparing aspirin at either dose with placebo. The same endpoints were also assessed at year 1 or 4 (last colonoscopy performed for each patient). Results At the final year 4 colonoscopy the analysis included 185 patients (55 receiving aspirin 160 mg/day, 47 aspirin 300 mg/day and 83 placebo). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with at least one recurrent adenoma between patients receiving aspirin at either dose and those treated with placebo (42 / 102 (41 %) vs 33 / 83 (40 %); NS) or in the adenomatous polyp burden (3. 1 ± 5. 8 mm vs 3. 4 ± 6. 2 mm; NS). Also, the proportion of patients with at least one advanced recurrent adenoma did not differ (10 / 182 (10 %) in the aspirin group vs 7 / 83 (7 %) in the placebo group; NS). Conclusion Daily low-dose aspirin decreased adenoma recurrence significantly at 1 year but not at year 4. This discrepancy might be explained by a differential effect of aspirin according to the natural history of the polyp. Trial Registration Number NCT 00224679...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect of somatostatin (SRIF) on immunoreactive insulin release and on many other hormonal secretions {{has been widely}} studied in both animal and man. However, the mechanism by which SRIF acts on these functions remains poorly defined. Aim {{of this study is}} to determine the {{inhibitory effect}} of SRIF on insulin secretion induced by arginine after the administration of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (LAS) in a dose which inhibits the endogenous synthesis of prostaglandins. Ten healthy informed volunteer subjects were studied. Four studies were carried out in randomized order, each one separated by a three day interval. The first study was a test of arginine (25 g i. v. in 30 min). The second study was a test of arginine with SRIF infusion (150 micrograms bolus followed by 100 micrograms/h for 120 min). The third study was a test of arginine with an infusion of SRIF and LAS (66 mg/min for 120 min). The fourth study was a test of arginine with LAS infusion. Plasma insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. After arginine administration the typical biphasic insulin response was observed with a precocious peak at 3 min and a late peak at 30 min. This response is not significantly modified under LAS infusion. With the infusion of SRIF at a dose of 100 micrograms/hr after arginine administration only a very modest insulin response was observed. The addition of LAS does not modify the inhibitory effect of SRIF on insulin secretion induced by arginine. This result demonstrates that the inhibitory action of SRIF on the secretion of insulin is not dependent upon the activation of the endocellular prostaglandin system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is mainly the {{coefficient}} identification of a pharmacokinetic two-compartment open model with first-order absorption. This model consists of the central compartment (plasma) and the peripheral one (tissue) containing the ill site aimed by the action of the administered drug. The different phenomenons taking place between the compartments obey a first-order (linear) kinetic. This phenomenons of absorption, transfer, and elimination are characterized by their rate constants. A compartmental analysis leads to a system of coupled linear differential equations whose coefficients, the unknowns of the problem, are the above-mentioned rate constants. This system describes the transition of the drug from its administration to its action site passing through the plasma. An oral administration of a single dose is considered and the evolution of the drug concentration in the plasma is measured. These measurements, performed over time in a reduced number on the rabbit, give unique and useful information for the identification of the coefficient set appearing in the mathematical model. The identification problem is stated in terms of a constraint minimization of a cost functional, given by the quadratic error between the measured and the computed drug concentrations in the plasma. From the nonconvexity of this cost functional (existence of more than one local minimum) follows the nonuniqueness of the optimal solution of this identification problem. The minimization is performed on a minicomputer by means of a nonlinear programming method of conjugate-gradient type. The efficiency of the suggested method has been tested with measurements made on a lot of rabbits after the administration of a single dose (100 mg/kg) of aspirin in form of <b>lysine</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and sodium salicylate. The administration was made, thanks to an adapted technique, by a rubber probe in two different ways: in the stomach and in the duodenum. After the model identification it was possible to study, in simulation on a computer, the effect of the metabolite/nonmetabolite drug forms as well as the effect of the drug administration site on the time course of the drug in the organism. This simulation makes it easy to have access to magnitudes, familiar to the pharmaceutical practitioner, like the half-life, the bioavailability, the clearances, the build- up of blood levels for multiple doses, etc.... It was possible to improve the understanding of the time course of aspirin in rabbit in comparison to the time course of its main metabolite, the sodium salicylate, and this for the same animal...|$|E
