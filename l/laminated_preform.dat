40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} the design, fabrication, {{characterisation}} and deployment of a multi-measurand optical fibre sensor (MMS) {{that is capable of}} simultaneously monitoring strain, temperature, refractive index and cross-linking chemistry. The sensor design is based on the extrinsic fibre Fabry–Perot interferometer. A feature of this sensor system is that a conventional multi-channel fibre-coupled near-infrared spectrometer is used to monitor the four independent parameters. The issues relating to the measurement resolution of the individual sensors and the associated interrogation equipment are discussed. The MMS was embedded in between the fourth and fifth plies of an eight-ply E-glass plain-weave fabric. A commercially available thermosetting epoxy/amine resin system was used to impregnate the fabric layers manually. The <b>laminated</b> <b>preform</b> was vacuum-bagged and cured in an autoclave. The following parameters were monitored: the depletion rates of the epoxy and amine functional groups in the resin system; the temperature in close proximity to the “chemical sensor”; the evolution of strain; and the refractive index of the resin system. The effect of post-processing on the output from the embedded optical fibre sensors is also considered...|$|E

This technique uses vacuum pressure to drive the resin into a <b>laminate.</b> <b>Preform</b> is laid dry into the mold and the vacuum is applied before the resin is introduced. Once a complete vacuum is achieved, resin is sucked into the laminate via placed tubing. Fig. 1 shows...|$|R

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in fibre reinforced composites {{can give}} rise to a number of undesired effects such as loss of dimensional stability and premature fracture. Hence, there is significant merit in developing processing techniques to mitigate the development of residual stresses. However, tracking and quantifying the development of these fabrication-induced stresses in real-time using conventional non-destructive techniques is not straightforward. This article reports on the design and evaluation of a technique for manufacturing pre-stressed composite panels from unidirectional E-glass/epoxy prepregs. Here, the magnitude of the applied pre-stress was monitored using an integrated load-cell. The pre-stressing rig was based on a flat-bed design which enabled autoclave-based processing. A method was developed to end-tab the laminated prepregs prior to pre-stressing. The development of process-induced residual strain was monitored in-situ using embedded optical fibre sensors. Surface-mounted electrical resistance strain gauges were used to measure the strain when the composite was unloaded from the pre-stressing rig at room temperature. Four pre-stress levels were applied prior to processing the <b>laminated</b> <b>preforms</b> in an autoclave. The results showed that the application of a pre-stress of 108 MPa to a unidirectional [0] 16 E-glass/ 913 epoxy preform, reduced the residual strain in the composite from − 600 µε (conventional processing without pre-stress) to approximately zero. A good correlation was observed between the data obtained from the surface-mounted electrical resistance strain gauge and the embedded optical fibre sensors. In addition to “neutralising” the residual stresses, superior axial orientation of the reinforcement can be obtained from pre-stressed composites. A subsequent publication will highlight the consequences of pres-stressing on fibre alignment, the tensile, flexural, compressive and fatigue performance of unidirectional E-glass composites...|$|R

40|$|The {{large size}} and the {{requirement}} for precise lightening cavities in a considerable portion of the titanium fan blades necessitated {{the development of a}} new manufacturing method. The approach which was selected for development incorporated several technologies including HIP diffusion bonding of titanium sheet laminates containing removable cores and isothermal forging of the blade form. The technology bases established in HIP/DB for composite blades and in isothermal forging for fan blades were applicable for development of the manufacturing process. The process techniques and parameters for producing and inspecting the cored diffusion bonded titanium <b>laminate</b> blade <b>preform</b> were established. The method was demonstrated with the production of twelve hollow simulated blade shapes for evaluation. Evaluations of the critical experiments conducted to establish procedures to produce hollow structures by a laminate/core/diffusion bonding approach are included. In addition the transfer of this technology to produce a hollow fan blade is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDefects, such as {{in-plane}} waviness and out-of-plane tow wrinkles, cause significant {{reductions in}} the mechanical performance of RTM-manufactured composite parts based on woven preforms. To avoid this problem and achieve a greater acceptance rate in industrial processes, the mechanisms behind these defects must be understood. This paper presents a mechanism {{for the formation of}} these defects, which is supported through layup trials of woven <b>preforms.</b> <b>Laminate</b> design and layup protocol were found to be significant drivers behind the mechanism. Defect severity can be controlled through intelligent stacking sequence design and reducing ply bridging by manual forming actions and ply–ply adhesion during layup...|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of the composites with knitted performs by introducing horizontal strands in the course direction in a flat-bed knitting machine. Flat knitted performs were produced with different proportions of axial inlay strands and the composite laminates were prepared using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding technique. It is observed that the introduction of inlay strands influences the structure of the knitted preform by increasing course density, wale density and thickness. This result in the increased anisotropic behaviour of the composite laminate showing increased strength in the course direction and decreased strength in the wale direction. The flexural strength of the knitted preform composites increases in both wale and course directions with the introduction of inlay strands. <b>Laminates</b> from <b>preforms</b> with two inlays exhibit overall improved impact properties whereas those from preforms with one inlay show higher impact damage tolerance index. These observations are explained in terms of the change in fibre architecture brought about by the introduction of the inlay strands...|$|R
40|$|Sewn net-shape preform based {{composite}} {{manufacturing technology}} is widely accepted {{in combination with}} liquid composite molding technologies for the manufacturing of fiber reinforced polymer composites. The development of threedimensional dry fibrous reinforcement structures containing desired fiber orientation and volume fraction before the resin infusion {{is based on the}} predefined preforming processes. Various preform manufacturing aspects influence the overall composite manufacturing processes. Sewing technology used for the preform manufacturing has number of challenges to overcome which includes consistency in preform quality, composite quality, and composite mechanical properties. Experimental studies are undertaken to investigate the influence of various sewing parameters on the preform manufacturing processes, preform quality, and the fiber reinforced polymer composite quality and properties. Sewing thread, sewing machine parameters, shortcomings of sewing process, and remedies are explained according to their importance during preforming and liquid composite molding. The stitches and fiber free zone in the form of ellipse that are generated in the thickness direction were investigated by evaluating the laminate micrographs. Correlation between ellipse formation phenomenon, sewing thread, and sewing machine parameters is established. A statistical tool, analysis of variance, was used to emphasize the major preform processing factors influencing the preform imperfections. For assessing the preform quality, the observations of sewing thread requirements for preform and structural sewing were well documented during the experimental studies and explained according to their significance in the composite processing. Furthermore, selection criteria for sewing thread according to end application are discussed in detail. Investigations on polyester sewing thread as a high speed preform manufacturing element are also performed. Applicability of polyester sewing thread for the preform sewing and challenges to be overcome for its extensive utilization in the composite components are explained. Apart from this, influence of physical structure of sewing thread on the laminate quality and properties are explained and relationship between them is discussed in brief. Furthermore, challenges caused due to applied spin-finishes and sizing and remedies for the same are discussed. Sewing threads made of high performance fibers that are available in the market, e. g., carbon, glass, and Zylon are studied for effect of thread material on through-thethickness laminate properties. Threads made up of carbon or glass fibers are very rigid and produces number of defects, which is a major cause of concern. Optimized sewing procedure has been implemented to minimize the in-plane and through-thethickness imperfections and to improve mechanical properties and surface characteristics of composite <b>laminate.</b> <b>Preform</b> sewing process and final ready to impregnate preforms were analyzed for quality appearance. The sewing defects and their influence on composite structure are monitored. Preform compressibility before and after the sewing operations are intensively studied and correlation with sewing parameters is developed. Influence of sewing process parameters on the warpage and change in preform area weight are also explained in detail. Results of analytical experiments can help to improve further exploitation of sewn preforms for composite manufacturing and overall <b>preform</b> and <b>laminate</b> quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of microorganisms with glass-reinforced polyester resins(GRP), both under laboratory and simulated operating conditions, has been examined following reports of severl! fungal biodeterioration. Although GRP was not previously associated with substantial microbial growth, {{small amounts of}} microbial activity would pose problems for products associated with comestible materials. The microbiology of the raw materials was investigated, two ingredients were supportive to microbial populations whilst five materials were biostatic or inhibitory in their action. Production laminate was not susceptible to microbial deterioration or inhibitory to microbes. Incorporation of zinc stearate, one of the supportive ingredients, at 300 % manufacturing level or drastic undercuring produced laminate capable of supporting microbial growth but only after a non-biotic stage of degradation. Study of the long-term population dynamics of cisterns of GRP and competitive materials under conditions simulating in-service conditions, monitoring microbial numbers within the experimental vessels and comparing with the populations of the supply water, suggests that the performance of GRP cisterns is slightly superior to conventional competitive materials. An investigation of the biological performance of GRP cisterns in an isolated area of known microbiological hazard was conducted. Severe biodeterioration had been experienced with Preform GRP articles moulded using different production techniques, but substitution of current GRP articles resulted in no recurrence of the problem. All attempts to establish the fungal isolate responsible for the phenomena in cisterns under controlled conditions failed. Scanning Electron Microscopy of GRP surfaces showed that although differences exist between current and <b>Preform</b> <b>laminates,</b> these could not satisfactorily explain the differences in service behaviour. These results {{and the results of}} the British Plastics Federation Expert Working Group interlaboratory study are discussed in relation to the original report of gross fungal biodeterioration and, to the design of future testing programmes for the products of industrial concerns...|$|R
