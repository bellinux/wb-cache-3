5|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the speed of}} <b>light</b> <b>is</b> to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park {{includes}} {{a number of}} navigational aids, {{as well as an}} ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The Fowey Rocks <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, the light was acquired by the Park Service on October 2, 2012. The unmanned Pacific Reef <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> about three miles (5 km) offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada.|$|E
5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that the speed of <b>light</b> <b>is</b> variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that <b>light</b> <b>is</b> substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of <b>light</b> <b>is</b> much faster {{than the speed of}} sound.|$|E
50|$|The Liston Rear Range <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{one of four}} lights {{forming a}} complex known as Liston's Tree Range. One set of two <b>lights</b> <b>was</b> located in New Jersey, forming the Finn's Point Range Lights, with the other pair in Delaware became the Port Penn Range Lights. The front <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> placed in low wood-framed structures, while the rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} as tall, skeletal wrought iron towers. Both rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> substantially similar, except that the rear Port Penn <b>light</b> <b>was</b> 30 ft higher.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, the Front <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> about 360 ft {{southeast}} of the southeastern angle of Fort Moultrie, and the other <b>light</b> <b>was</b> about 190 ft {{to the east of}} the Front <b>light.</b> The <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> eventually removed at an unknown date.|$|R
50|$|In fish-only marine aquariums, <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{only for}} illumination. <b>Lighting</b> <b>is</b> chosen primarily with aesthetic considerations for optimal viewing of the fish. The <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> generally of much lower intensity than {{is used in}} reef aquariums to limit algae growth.|$|R
5|$|Infrared <b>light</b> <b>is</b> {{of lower}} energy than visible light, hence is emitted by cooler objects. As such, the {{following}} {{can be viewed}} in the infrared: cool stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Selective mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow <b>light</b> <b>is</b> reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue <b>light</b> <b>is</b> reflected twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{is visible}} {{for two weeks}} every 27.3 days at the North and South Pole. The Moon's <b>light</b> <b>is</b> used by {{zooplankton}} in the Arctic {{when the sun is}} below the horizon for months on end.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{dismantled}} and {{a modern}} automated <b>light</b> <b>was</b> erected {{on the old}} foundation.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, the {{automated}} <b>light</b> <b>was</b> dismantled, and the Coast Guard constructed a 50 ft steel tower {{in front of}} the lighthouse. The automated <b>light</b> <b>was</b> placed on top until 1985, when the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> placed back in the lighthouse and the tower was removed.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{produced}} between 1965 - 1979 were {{equipped with}} old-style lights: turn signal <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> colorless (white), rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> round, {{and the back}} of the body was rounder. Subsequent post-1979 models got amber (yellow) signal lights, and rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> slightly bigger and rectangular.|$|R
5|$|The {{interference}} pattern {{between the two}} beams when the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> recombined at the observer depends upon the transit times over the two paths, {{and can be used}} to calculate the speed of light {{as a function of the}} speed of the water.|$|E
5|$|A {{departure}} from her previous work, Ray of <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> an electronica, dance and techno-pop album which incorporates multiple genres, including ambient, trip hop and house music. Vocally, the album saw Madonna sing with greater breadth and a fuller tone. Mystical themes are also strongly present {{in both the}} music and lyrics, {{as a result of}} Madonna embracing Kabbalah, her study of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as her daily practice of Hatha Yoga.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue <b>light</b> <b>is</b> scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
50|$|The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1871. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{one of a}} group of New England lighthouses built to the same plan after an award-winning design by a Vermont architect. Nearly identical <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> constructed at Sabin Point, Rose Island, and Colchester Reef. It was deactivated in 1974, but relighted on July 30, 2006. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> added to the National Register of Historic Places as Pomham Rocks Light Station on July 9, 1979. In the 1970s the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> sold to The American Lighthouse Foundation, and is today managed by the Friends of Pomham Rocks Lighthouse.|$|R
50|$|The Passage <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the last}} <b>lights</b> to <b>be</b> {{constructed}} on the Great Lakes. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> built {{at the same time that}} the 1895 lighthouse was deactivated. In 1959, the lighthouse's beacon characteristic was changed from green to a flashing red light, and the radiobeacon distance-finding system was deactivated in 1962. In 1968 the formerly all-white <b>light</b> <b>was</b> given a red-painted base on a white pier. In 1973 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> automated, and the steel antenna tower was removed in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Best {{views of}} this <b>light</b> <b>are</b> from the water. The privately owned island and <b>light</b> <b>are</b> {{closed to the}} public.|$|R
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known {{are located in the}} NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their <b>light</b> <b>is</b> as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} and emission of light by a living organism. It {{is a form of}} chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim <b>light</b> <b>is</b> obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} front <b>light</b> <b>was</b> the Delaware Breakwater Range Front Light, a {{much older}} light {{situated at the}} west end of the breakwater as originally constructed; in 1903 this <b>light</b> <b>was</b> discontinued and the Delaware Breakwater East End <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> designated as the front light instead.|$|R
50|$|The Fort Sumter Range <b>Lights</b> <b>are</b> range <b>lights</b> {{to guide}} ships {{through the main}} channel of the Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The {{original}} front <b>light</b> <b>was</b> built at Fort Sumter and the original rear <b>light</b> <b>was</b> in the steeple of St. Philip's Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Both <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> lit from 1893 to 1915 to make range lights. Today the Fort Sumter Range is the main approach channel to Charleston Harbor.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} New Castle Range <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> wooden towers {{built in}} 1876. The New Castle Range Rear <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{attached to the}} keeper’s quarters while the New Castle Range Front <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> a free standing tower. The original front range <b>light</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 1964 when it {{was replaced by a}} steel skeletal tower. Both of the current skeletal towers remain an active aid to navigation and are not open to the public.|$|R
5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar <b>light</b> <b>is</b> obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to <b>light</b> <b>is</b> {{detrimental}} to the stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|First <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> a {{young adult}} science fiction and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, first {{published}} in 2007. The novel follows Peter, who is in Greenland {{with his father and}} mother for research on global warming, and Thea, who lives in Gracehope, an underground colony located below Greenland. First Light explains how global warming is melting Gracehope and Peter and Thea's attempt to persuade the people to leave. The novel addresses the effects of global warming as a theme.|$|E
50|$|When the New High and Low <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> {{commissioned}} in 1810 the old <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> {{taken out}} of service and the white façade of the low <b>light</b> <b>was</b> painted black (to prevent it being confused with the new light when viewed from the water). In due course both Old <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> converted by Trinity House into almshouses; the Old Low Light, {{with the addition of}} a pitched roof, reopened as Trinity Alms House in 1830.|$|R
50|$|DJ <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> {{a variant}} of stage <b>lighting</b> that <b>is</b> used by mobile DJs and in nightclubs. DJ <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} used by mobile disco DJs and in most modern nightclubs and many late-night bars.|$|R
50|$|In 1904 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} to incandescent gas, In 1933 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> electrified, and the lighthouse was automated and demanned.|$|R
5|$|If we were {{to regard}} Sirius and Procyon as double stars, the change of their motions would not {{surprise}} us; we should acknowledge them as necessary, and have only to investigate their amount by observation. But <b>light</b> <b>is</b> no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white <b>light</b> <b>is</b> used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E

5000|$|As {{an aid to}} {{navigation}} at {{the harbor}} channel entrance the Sheffield Island <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> operational by 1826 (on what was called [...] "Smith Island" [...] at the time).In 1872 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers startedits first work on harbor improvements in Norwalk.On January 21, 1897, the United States Congress agreed to spend $73,100.00 on aids to navigationin Norwalk Harbor including lights and fog signals. [...] As {{a result of the}} expenditure Greens Ledge <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> operational by 1902 andPecks Ledge <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> operational by 1906. The Sheffield Island <b>light</b> <b>was</b> discontinuedas a federally maintained aid to navigation when the Greens Ledge <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> activated.|$|R
50|$|The navigational <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{moved to}} the tower in 1867. The {{clockwork}} operated revolving dioptric <b>light</b> <b>was</b> constructed by Chance Brothers. The height of the focal plane above sea-level was 140 m and the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> visible to an eye elevated 61 m above sea level {{at a distance of}} 27 km in clear weather. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> a triple flash at intervals of 30 seconds, each flash being of one second duration, and each long eclipse of 18 seconds duration. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> lit using kerosene oil. In 1907 it was converted to gas. In 1933 it was replaced with a 1,500 candle power light powered by electricity.|$|R
