At this period the chancellor of the exchequer (Mr. George Grenville) says to the House of Commons, [...] "We must call for money from the colonies {{in the way of}} a tax;" [...] and to the colony-agents, [...] "Write to your several colonies, and tell them, if they dislike a duty upon stamps, and prefer any other method of raising the money themselves, I shall be content, provided the amount be but raised." [...] "That is," [...] observed the colonies, when commenting upon his terms, [...] "if we will not tax ourselves as we may be directed, the Parliament will tax us." [...] Dr. Franklin's instructions, spoken of above, related to this gracious option. As the colonies could not choose [...] "another tax" [...] while they disclaimed every tax, the Parliament passed the stamp-act.|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of standardization and computerization <b>of</b> radiology <b>requisitions</b> {{on the quality of}} provided data, satisfaction of hospital staff and access time. MethodsThe impact <b>of</b> <b>requisition</b> support was assessed at each step of the improvement process for inpatients: before (Step 1), after standardization (Step 2) and after computerization <b>of</b> radiology <b>requisition</b> (Step 3). The quality of information provided was assessed by proportion of missing data on MRI and CT requisitions. Satisfaction was assessed by an anonymous auto-questionnaire filled by ordering physicians, radiologists and radiology technicians. Access time was prospectively assessed. ResultsStandardization <b>of</b> radiology <b>requisition</b> resulted in a significant drop in proportion of missing data. Computerization <b>of</b> radiology <b>requisition,</b> based on the single standardized radiology requisition, further improved the quality of information reported on radiology requisitions. The median access time was significantly improved (from 5 to 3 days) for the largest provider <b>of</b> CT <b>requisitions.</b> ConclusionsStandardization and computerization have a synergistic effect on the overall quality improvement. Moreover, the computerized provider order entry enables traceability of information, makes communication between radiologists and ordering physicians easier and improves examination planning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:Background: Blood {{utilization}} audit {{helps to}} formulate guidelines for improving transfusion {{practice in a}} health care centre. With increasing demand for blood components being unable to meet the supply particularly in developing countries, {{there is a need}} to implement strategies for rational use of blood and its components. The present study aims to evaluate the transfusion practices in a hospital based blood centre. Material and Methods: A retrospective audit was conducted on 1000 blood requisitions and 300 requisitions for fresh frozen plasma and platelets. The requisitions were reviewed for pre transfusion hematological values, utilization trends and appropriateness. Results: Out <b>of</b> 1000 <b>requisitions,</b> 67. 8 % were for packed red cells and 32. 2 % were for whole blood. Pre transfusion hemoglobin values were available for 11. 1 %. The urgency for transfusion and indication was mentioned on 18. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>requisition</b> forms. The maximum cross match to transfusion ratio was for Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The blood utilization was 41. 3 %. Out <b>of</b> 300 <b>requisitions</b> for fresh frozen plasma/platelets, 67. 33 % were for fresh frozen plasma and 32. 6 % were for platelets. Only 25. 66 % <b>of</b> <b>requisitions</b> had prothrombin index/platelet count mentioned. Over ordering was seen in 37. 33 % <b>of</b> <b>requisitions.</b> Conclusion: Retrospective audits help to identify key areas that need interventions to change local guidelines for transfusion. There is need for regular audit to improve transfusion practices in a health care set up. A type and screen policy for routine surgeries and obstetric patients should be implemented to save valuable time and resources in developing countries. [KaurP et al NJIRM 2013; 4 (2) : 123...|$|R
