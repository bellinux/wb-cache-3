5|$|Ballard's {{subsequent}} {{search for}} the Japanese carriers was unsuccessful. In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers. Using advanced renavigation techniques {{in conjunction with the}} ship's log of the submarine USS Nautilus, the expedition located a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wreckage, subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of Kaga. The main wreck of Kaga has yet to be located.|$|E
5|$|By 17:10, Thetis and Blonde {{began to}} {{withdraw}} from the bay as the fire took hold of the first frigate. The rest of the British squadron, despite heavy cannon fire from a fort on shore, successfully landed their troops and stormed and captured the defences. There were heavy casualties in the storming parties, including Hugh Cameron, captain of Hazard, who was killed by grapeshot. At 17:20, the fire reached the magazines of the burning flûte, and the ensuing explosion hurled burning wreckage across the bay. The British ships were largely untouched, but the second French flûte was struck by a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> flaming timber, which ignited her mainmast and destroyed her as well. The operations successfully completed, the British ships embarked their landing parties, who had demolished the fortifications around the bay, and returned to open water.|$|E
5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{his newly}} {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written {{would create a}} bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of}} the following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot on American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.|$|E

5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The king's reign {{was marked}} by a drought lasting seven years that caused a famine in much of Imerina. According to oral history, the king {{attempted}} to purchase rice from his fief at Ambohipiainana. The town had a surplus but the local leader refused to sell rice to Andriamasinavalona, claiming none was available. The king then sent porters to purchase rice from Antsahatovoka, where the residents declared that while the land was his and it was thus unnecessary for the king to purchase what already belonged to him, there was no rice available to share. Finally Andriamasinavalona sought to purchase rice in Andraisisa. His money was refused by the local leader, Andriandrivotra, who willingly gave the king large shares of food and a tribute of silver. To reward {{the leader of the}} fief, Andriamasinavalona promised to give him anything he liked. Andriandrivotra declared that all he desired was the love of his sovereign. To show his appreciation, Andriamasinavalona declared that he would make Andriasisa into a great fief, and gave Andriandrivotra a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land {{to the west of the}} territory. He then undertook a major expansion of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo, significantly increasing their rice production to feed the populace.|$|E

25|$|A <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{compressed}} ice, or a glacier, appears blue, {{as large}} quantities of water appear blue. This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue. The other reason for the blue color of glaciers {{is the lack of}} air bubbles. Air bubbles, which give a white color to ice, are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice.|$|E

In 1869, excavations {{to the south of}} the old town revealed the existence of a monumental gate defended by two protruding towers. The façade, or at least the pillars which were observed during the excavation, was covered with a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> sandstone and adorned with a frieze of military trophies: Shields, leggings and reastplates.|$|E

Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose to such an angle that her lifeboats could not be lowered.

25|$|An iceberg or ice {{mountain}} is a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water.

Also, about 91% of an iceberg is {{below the surface of the}} water.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps one of {{the more}} {{interesting}} discoveries were the avian remains found in Unit II.

Another bird skeleton was found along with carefully arranged sticks parallel to one another. Two more sets of avian related materials were found: a large amount of bird guano and a scattering of bird down.|$|E

25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin.

25|$|The land at Lenabo was a <b>large</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bog {{land and}} when it was decided to {{commission}} it to be used as the most northerly British air base station before any building could start, the land had to be cleared. The meaning of Lenabo is taken from the Gaelic 'Lannam bo' that means 'wet meadow of the cows' and was an apt description of the land. The excavations were carried out by thousands of Irish and Scottish labourers drafted into the area. A large amount of peat was removed from the 950acre site using basic equipment such as steam scoops and bucket cranes.|$|E
