25|$|The lead–acid battery was {{the first}} {{practical}} secondary (rechargeable) battery that could have its capacity replenished from an external source. The electrochemical reaction that produced current was (to a useful degree) reversible, allowing electrical energy and chemical energy to be interchanged as needed. Common <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> contain a mixture of acid and water, as well as lead plates. The most common mixture used today is 30% acid. One problem however is if left uncharged acid will crystallize within the lead plates of the battery rendering it useless. These batteries last an average of 3 years with daily use however it is not unheard of for a lead acid battery to still be functional after 7–10 years. Lead-acid cells continue to be widely used in automobiles.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{extremely}} important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry, like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and {{the detection of}} alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the established electrochemical technologies (like deep cycle <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>batteries)</b> {{there is also a}} wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial. Electrochemistry has also important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the determination of free acidity in olive oil.|$|E

The final objective of the optimization process is the identification of the most efficient vehicle management strategy in order to reduce the emissions, fuel consumption without deteriorating the batteries. In order to achieve this objective the whole system modellization is mandatory. The considered vehicle can be roughly divided in 5 blocks: engine, alternator, <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> pack, electric wheels, vehicle body structure. The choice of series design and <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> instead of the more performing parallel architecture with lithium battery was due to the aims of producing an low cost and very small vehicle. For the same reason supercapacitor and regenerative brake are not considered. Each block will be modelled with opportune Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). The derived model of each block will be validated with experimental measurements.
