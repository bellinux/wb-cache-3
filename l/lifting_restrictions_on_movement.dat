Examples include the role of international remittances (Harrison et al 2003) or those immigrant-links underpinning the migration-trade nexus (Gould 1994).

Although an important result, the lack of bilateral labour migration data forced Walmsley and Winters (2005) to make approximations in important areas and naturally precluded their tracking bilateral migration agreements. In this paper we incorporate bilateral labour flows into the GMig model developed by Walmsley and Winters (2005) to examine the impact of liberalizing the temporary movement of natural persons.

Quotas on skilled and unskilled labour in the developed economies are increased by 3 % of their labour forces, with the additional labour supplied by developing economies. This paper improves upon the previous work of Walmsley and Winters (2005). A critical weakness of the previous work {{was that it was}} unable to capture the impacts of specific bilateral migration flows or liberalizations between countries. This paper uses a bilateral global migration model that exploits migration data obtained from Parsons, Skeldon, Winters, and Walmsley (2007) that allow the model to account for bilateral migration flows. The results confirm that <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> migration impose significant costs on nearly all countries, with the modest liberalization increasing global GDP by US$ 288 billion.

Speaker {{returned to the}} U.S. against the instructions of the CDC, and he was served with a federal order of quarantine by the CDC at a New York hospital, the first such order to be issued in nearly half a century. Speaker challenged the diagnosis, resulting in a new diagnosis of a milder form of tuberculosis and the <b>lifting</b> of <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> his <b>movements.</b> The Speaker case drew significant public attention, and Congress held formal hearings about the incident.

In a new technical paper, Walmsley, Winters, and Ahmed incorporate bilateral labor flows into the GMig model developed by Walmsley and Winters (2005) to examine the impact of liberalizing the temporary movement of natural persons. Quotas on both skilled and unskilled temporary labor in the developed economies are increased by 3 % of their labor forces. This additional labor is supplied by the developing economies. The results confirm that <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>movement</b> of natural persons impose significant costs on nearly all countries, and that those on unskilled labor are more burdensome than those on skilled labor. Developed economies increasing their skilled and unskilled labor forces by 3 % raise the real incomes of their permanent residents. Most of those gains arise from the lifting of quotas on unskilled labor. On average the permanent residents of developing countries also gain in terms of real incomes from sending unskilled and skilled labor, albeit the gains are lower for skilled labor. While results differ across developing economies, most gain {{as a result of the}} higher remittances sent home. ...|$|R
25|$|In December 2007, 33,678 people (13.5% of {{the total}} population) living in Iceland had been born abroad, {{including}} children of Icelandic parents living abroad.

40|$|Senecavirus A (SV-A), formerly, Seneca Valley virus (SVV), {{has been}} {{detected}} in swine with vesicular lesions and {{is thought to}} be associated with swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD), a vesicular disease syndrome that lacks a defined causative agent. The clinical presentation of SIVD resembles that of other more contagious and economically devastating vesicular diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS), that typically require immediate rule out diagnostics to <b>lift</b> <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> animal quarantine, <b>movement,</b> and trade. This study presents the development of a sensitive, SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay suitable for detection of SV-A in diagnostic swine specimens. After testing 50 pigs with clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease, 44 (88 %) were found to be positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR as compared to none from a negative cohort of 35 animals without vesicular disease, indicating that the assay is able to successfully detect the virus in an endemic population. SV-A RNA was also detectable at a low level in sera from a subset of pigs that presented with (18 %) or without (6 %) vesicular signs. In 2015, there has been an increase in the occurrence of SV-A in the US, and over 200 specimens submitted to our laboratory for vesicular investigation have tested positive for the virus using this method. SV-A RNA was detectable in all common types of vesicular specimens including swabs and tissue from hoof lesions, oral and snout epithelium, oral swabs, scabs, and internal organ tissues such as liver and lymph node. Genome sequencing analysis from recent virus isolates was performed to confirm target amplicon specificity and was aligned to previous isolates...|$|R
