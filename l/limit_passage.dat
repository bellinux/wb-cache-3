50|$|Plant {{cells are}} {{surrounded}} by cell walls which are barriers for cell-cell communication. This barrier is overcome by specialized junctions called plasmodesmata. They are similar to gap junctions, connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Small molecules (<1000 Da), such as ions, amino acids, and sugars, can diffuse freely through plasmodesmata. These small molecules include signaling molecule and transcription factors. The size of the channel is also regulated to allow molecules up to 10,000 Da in size. The permeability of these channels is dependent on many factors, including Ca2+ concentration. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration will reversibly <b>limit</b> <b>passage</b> through the plasmodesmata.

This {{increase in the number of}} bands was due chiefly to an improved separation of glycosylated polypeptides from nonglycosylated polypeptides with which they co-electrophoresed on methylenebisacrylamide cross-linked gels. Purified virions of HSV- 1 [F 1] had a protein/DNA mass ratio of 10. 7 ± 0. 96, and based on a DNA molecular mass of 85 × 106 to 100 × 106 the estimated weight of virion polypeptides ranges from 16. 4 to 19. 4 × 10 − 16 g.

For a fixed time step h> 0, a large-deviations rate functional Jh characterizes the behaviour of the particle system at t = h in terms of the initial distribution at t = 0. For the diffusion equation, a single step in the time-discretized entropy-Wasserstein gradient flow is characterized by the minimization of a functional Kh. We establish a new connection between these systems by proving that Jh and Kh are equal up to second order in h as h → 0.

40|$|Studies of the {{pathogenicity}} of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae {{would be}} facilitated by an in vitro method of identifying and classifying isolates of this organism, {{and it is}} with the development of such a method, and its possible applications, that this thesis is mainly concerned. The method chosen was Restriction Endonuclease Analysis (REA) which has already been successfully applied to the identification of some viruses and bacteria. Initially the REA patterns of 2 strains of M. ovipneumoniae were observed. They differed markedly in restriction pattern, but the pattern exhibited by any one of them was recognisable and reproducible. Furthermore, patterns did not change significantly after <b>limited</b> <b>passage</b> in vitro. An extension of this study to 8 isolates from widely differing sources, showed that all gave markedly different patterns. It was concluded that, unlike the findings for Leptospira and Rhizobium, REA could not be used for the identification of species, but is an extremely powerful method for identifying strains of M. ovipneumoniae. Despite the marked heterogeneity of isolates from different sources, the relative stability of pattern of an individual isolate, suggested that REA could be used to examine the epidemiology of individual strains of M. ovipneumoniae within a flock of sheep. Hence, we undertook a study of M. ovipneumoniae isolates obtained by serial swabbing of the nasal cavities of a flock of lambs over a 6 -month period, and from the lungs of the same lambs at slaughter. It was shown that 54 isolates from the nasal cavities fill into 7 major groups with respect to restriction pattern (although minor differences were detected within a group). There was a tendency for these groups to occur sequentially. None of the isolates were shown to persist for long periods, but a later strain could replace an earlier one. The isolates from the lungs were more homogeneous and the predominant strain fell within one of the 7 "nasal" groups. This suggests that nasal isolates may vary in their pathogenicity for the lungs, although other explanations are possible (see General Discussion). Notwithstanding the apparent stability of mass cultures of M. ovipneumoniae following <b>limited</b> <b>passage</b> in vitro, the unexpectedly large number of restriction patterns found with field strains, led us to re-examine, in more detail, the stability of cloned isolates. A multiply-cloned isolate was propagated in vitro and 8 sub-clones selected before and, a further 8 sub-clones after 20 <b>passages.</b> Some <b>limited</b> heterogeneity was detected among the 8 sub-clones selected before passage, and a somewhat greater degree of heterogeneity was detected among sub-clones selected after passage.
