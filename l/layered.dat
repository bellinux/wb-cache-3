5|$|Arsenal faced {{cup holders}} Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round. A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute saw the home side progress in a match <b>layered</b> with controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were all sent off in the space of ten minutes, the latter for hurling back a coin at the crowd. Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled out, before Tony Adams scored the winning goal of the match.|$|E

Recent histological study of <b>layered</b> plates from a probable subadult indicates that they may have started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
