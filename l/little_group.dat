5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect relevance to physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears as the <b>little</b> <b>group</b> of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations of the}} (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E

Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the Haitian army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men.|$|E
25|$|Now Montrose {{found himself}} {{apparently}} master of Scotland. After Kilsyth, the king's secretary arrived with letters from Charles documenting that Montrose was lieutenant and captain general. He first conferred knighthood on Alasdair. Then he summoned a parliament {{to meet at}} Glasgow on 20 October, in which he no doubt hoped to reconcile loyal obedience to the King {{with the establishment of}} a non-political Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. Charles had been defeated at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June, and Montrose had to come to his aid if there was to be still a king to proclaim. David Leslie, the best of the Scottish generals, was promptly dispatched against Montrose to anticipate the invasion. On 12 September he came upon Montrose, who had been deserted by his Highlanders and was guarded only by a <b>little</b> <b>group</b> of followers, at Philiphaugh. He won an easy victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to organise an army. In September 1646 he embarked for Norway.|$|E

25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses before the jury. In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a <b>little</b> <b>group</b> of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a <b>little</b> <b>group</b> of us together and it felt like our <b>little</b> <b>group</b> was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

For many Black Americans, {{it was the first time}} they were able to positively identify with Africa. [...] Angelou describes the group of Black American expatriates as [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>group</b> of Black folks, looking for a home". [...] Reviewer Jackie Gropman has stated that Angelou presents her readers with [...] "a wealth of information and penetrating impressions of the proud, optimistic new country of Ghana".

Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] " [...] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit." [...] A notable alternate performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, [...] "Load up on guns, bring your friends" [...] became [...] "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"). [...] Cobain later said {{he was trying to}} sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] as the third greatest in the show's history.

2500|$|Pelléas et Mélisande {{received}} its first {{performance at the}} Opéra-Comique in Paris on 30 April 1902 with André Messager conducting. The sets were designed in the Pre-Raphaelite style by Lucien Jusseaume and Eugène Ronsin. The premiere received a warmer reception than the dress rehearsal because a group of Debussy aficionados counterbalanced the Opéra-Comique's regular subscribers, who found the work so objectionable. Messager described the reaction: [...] " [...] certainly not a triumph, but no longer the disaster of two days before...From the second performance onwards, the public remained calm and above all curious to hear this work everyone was talking about...The <b>little</b> <b>group</b> of admirers, Conservatoire pupils and students for the most part, grew day by day..." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{decomposition}} of unitary irreps of (super) tensorial (i. e. extended with tensorial charges) Poincaré algebra w. r. t. its different subalgebras is considered. This requires calculation of <b>little</b> <b>groups</b> for different configurations of tensor charges. Particularly, for preon states (i. e. states with maximal supersymmetry) in different dimensions the particle content is calculated, i. e. {{the spectrum of}} usual Poincaré representations in the preon representation of tensorial Poincaré. At d= 4 results coincide with (and may provide another point of view on) the Vasiliev’s results in field theories in generalized space-time. The translational subgroup of <b>little</b> <b>groups</b> of massless particles and branes is shown to be (and coincide with, at d= 4) a subgroup of <b>little</b> <b>groups</b> of ”pure branes ” algebras, i. e. tensorial Poincaré algebras without vector generators.

[...] Many Oregonians were similarly incensed, and an outcry erupted for Lane's recall from office.

Let us suppose {{that there was a}} man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned about being an heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he knew that if he was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal. Can we talk about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, [...] "every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being {{in the sense that it}} is a matter between God and him; and let no third person, himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference. [...] If there was a person who embittered my life early and late and thought nothing but the worst of me, would his also being saved be able to disturb my salvation? ...|$|E

2500|$|Maclean saw {{his task}} as {{arranging}} supplies and air {{support for the}} Partisan fight, to tie up the Axis forces {{for as long as}} possible. The Royal Air Force was reluctant to risk landing on what they saw as an amateur airstrip at Glamoj (Glamoč), although Slim Farish was in fact an airfield designer, and night air drops were sporadic. [...] The Royal Navy was approached, and they offered to bring supplies to an outlying island off the Dalmatian coast. Maclean and a couple of companions set off on foot for Korčula, being passed from guerilla group to guerilla group. [...] They passed through battle-scarred villages and towns that had changed hands many times, some so recently that corpses still lay on the ground: Bugojno and Livno and Aržano. Once, they were billeted with a landlady whose sympathies clearly did not lie with the Partisans; she would not sell them food, but there was no question of simply commandeering it. Eventually, after an all-night march across noisy stony ground, dodging German patrols as they crossed a major road, the <b>little</b> <b>group</b> reached Zadvarje, where they were greeted with astonishment as creatures [...] from another world [...] "as indeed in a sense we were". After a few hours' sleep, they continued over the final range of hills to the coast, and down to Baška Voda, where a fishing boat took them circuitously to Korčula. There, all seemed in order for a Navy supply drop, but the wireless set developed problems. Maclean was on the point of [...] returning to Jajce when the motor launch arrived, with a crew that included Sandy Glen (also, like Maclean, thought {{to be one of the}} inspirations for James Bond) and David Satow. [...] By this point the enemy were closing in to take the remaining access points to the coast, which would throttle the Partisan supply route before it had even begun. He sent top priority requests, asking for air and sea support from Allied bases in Italy, and these took effect. Maclean decided he needed to discuss matters with Tito and then with Allied superiors in Cairo to argue for more resources to push the project forward, and accordingly made his way back to Partisan HQ in Jajce. He returned to the islands, first on Hvar and then on Vis, to wait for the response to his strongly worded signals. On Vis he discovered an overgrown British war cemetery dating from a naval victory over the French in 1811.|$|E
