500|$|Kaufman's wife Rose {{wrote the}} screenplay's first draft. It took her {{several years to}} complete; she found {{adapting}} the entire novel difficult. Some of the characters and stories from the novel were either changed or given retroactive continuity. Despite the differences, Richard Price approved of Kaufman's adaptation, saying, [...] "I love that picture. It's not my book, and I don't care. The spirit is right, and the way Phil Kaufman directed it showed me another way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{the defense}} nor the victim's family had {{immediate}} {{comment on the}} verdict or sentencing.

[...] Jean was faced with three possible outcomes {{as a result of her}} planned meeting with the prime minister on December 4, 2008: dissolving parliament, proroguing parliament, or asking him to resign and inviting the opposition parties to form a government.|$|E

2500|$|Over time, Log {{acquired}} a kick-drum and a homemade foot cymbal which he custom-outfitted with a kick pedal of its own. These instruments, combined with his slide guitar work, telephone microphone vocals, and drum machine accompaniment, form the framework on which Bob Log constructs his songs. Log describes his on-stage setup {{in the song}} [...] "One Man Band Boom", introducing himself to the audience as, [...] "Bob Log the third, one-man band, Tucson, Arizona. Heyeeeh! Lemme introduce the band to ya. On cymbals, left foot. Over here on the bass drum we got right foot. Shut up! This is my left hand that does all the slide work, right hand does the pickin'.

2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? <b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> career so far, I mean, if you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2012 Brit Awards, Mark Foster {{said that}} Foster the People's second album would be {{released}} in 2013. In June 2013, the band played at the Firefly Music Festival—as well as at a secret show at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, performing four new songs: [...] "A Beginner's Guide To Destroying The Moon", [...] "Pseudologia Fantastica", [...] "Fire Escape", and [...] "Coming of Age". Their second album {{was supposed to be}} released in November 2013, but Columbia decided to delay the release until January 2014 because they [...] "didn't want them to be stumbling a hurtle too intense like that fourth-quarter competition. The record's so beautiful, we didn't want to take a gamble of potentially losing it in the rush." [...] Foster told Rolling Stone, [...] "This record still has the joy that our first album did, but it's been thrown into a pit and forced to dance among wolves." [...] Foster said that the new album, which is [...] "more organic and more human", {{would be released}} in early 2014. He hinted at a few new tracks, including [...] "A Beginner's Guide to Destroying the Moon" [...] and [...] "Are You What You Wanna Be?", and stated that the first single should be on radio by January. Foster also told Rolling Stone that, [...] "In the first record, I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> vision for the project through a piece of opaque glass," [...] and that the next album will be [...] "a clearer picture of what I've had in my head when it comes to that vision." ...|$|E
