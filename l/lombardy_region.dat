25|$|Outside Piedmont {{there are}} {{significant}} plantings of Nebbiolo in the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>region</b> of Valtellina where the grape is known as Chiavennasca. The high yields and sub-alpine climate tends to produce Nebbiolo lacking ripeness with bracing acidity. Nebbiolo {{is also used to}} make a deeply concentrated Amarone-type wine known as Sfursat. In the Franciacorta, Nebbiolo is a permitted grape variety along with Barbera, Cabernet Franc and Merlot in the rosso wines of the region. Northwest of Piedmont, in the Valle Aosta, some Nebbiolo is grown in the Donnaz region near the border with Carema.|$|E
50|$|The Bianca Modenese or Modenese is a {{breed of}} dual-purpose cattle from the Po Valley, in the Emilia Romagna and <b>Lombardy</b> <b>regions</b> of {{northern}} Italy. It is raised for beef and milk production, {{but in the}} past was a triple-purpose breed, used also as a draught animal. The name derives from that of the province of Modena, where it is thought to have originated. In the nineteenth century it was concentrated in the area of Carpi, and was sometimes known as the Carpigiana. It was later distributed through much of the Po Valley, and thus also known as the Bianca della Val Padana.|$|R
40|$|The Italian {{viticulture}} {{is characterized}} by a high number of autochthonous varieties (about 1700), some of them renowned throughout the Country, some other only of local importance. Nevertheless, the real estima-tion of this biodiversity is made difficult due to the great amount of synonyms, homonyms and misnomers. The aim of this work was to undertake a comparison for va-rietal identity of minor, lesser cultivars in two field col-lections of neighboring <b>regions</b> (<b>Lombardy</b> and Pied-mont) located in northern Italy, verifying synonyms in different areas. Forty-seven accessions were described by morphological (OIV descriptors) and genetic (mic-rosatellites) characteristics. Thirty-eight varieties were identified belonging to three categories: varieties of great importance in Italy and locally misnamed, varie-ties important in the region of Piedmont and misnamed in Lombardy, and currently minor grapes but of his-torical significance in both Piedmont and <b>Lombardy</b> <b>regions.</b> K e y w o r d s: autochthonous; identification; SSR; Vitis vinifera...|$|R

In December 2000 several {{buildings}} in Pisogne have reported damage due to vibration and soil subsidence caused by excavation. The builder company must slow down the work. Due to limestone water infiltration, also the Pisogne variant suffers a delay. In November 1999, the citizens protest for the delay and the heavy rains in October and November 2000 worsen the situation.

Also, the city's hinterland is Italy's largest industrial area, and the FieraMilano fair is considered the largest in Europe. Milan, also, has Italy's highest GDP (per capita), about €35,137 (US$52,263), which is 161.6% of the EU average GDP per capita.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{there were}} 608 {{hectares}} (1,502 acres) of Uva Rara planted throughout Italy {{with the vast}} majority in the Piedmont and <b>Lombardy</b> <b>regions.</b> Here the grape is a permitted blending variety in several DOCs and can be made as a varietal in the Colline Novaresi DOC. In the Oltrepò Pavese and San Colombano al Lambro DOC, Uva Rara is usually blended with Croatina and Barbera while in the Boca, Fara, Coste della Sesia DOC and Sizzano DOCs, it plays a secondary role to Nebbiolo. It is also permitted in the DOCG wine of Ghemme where it plays a similar role in softening the Nebbiolo-based wines of the region.|$|R

25|$|Any {{motor vehicle}} built before the Euro {{emission}} standards were in force (called pre-E) {{is not allowed}} to enter the restricted zone (ZTL) from October 15 to April 15, as these vehicles have the worst polluting engines and the weather during this period worsens air quality. This is a restriction in force in the entire <b>Lombardy</b> <b>region</b> since 2007. Cleaner vehicles are exempted from the pollution charge and there is free access for all vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays, except as noted above. The amount of the charge payable depends on the type of vehicle according with their compliance with the European emission standards, and there is a discounted annual pass for residents within the restricted zone (ZTL). The following table details the daily and annual charges and the type of vehicles that are exempted.|$|E
25|$|Outside Piedmont, Barbera {{is found}} {{throughout}} Italy, {{often as a}} component in mass vino da tavola blends. In the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>region,</b> {{it is seen as}} a varietal in Oltrepò Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to semi-sparkling frizzante. Elsewhere in Lombardy it is blended with Croatina and {{as part of a larger}} blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in Emilia-Romagna in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina as it is in the Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names Perricone or Pignatello made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to mechanical harvesting. Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used.|$|E

The younger Cárcano attended the Colegio Nacional de Monserrat, and later enrolled at the National University of Córdoba Law School, graduating in 1881. His doctoral thesis, [...] "Of Natural Children, Adultery, Incest and Sacrilege," [...] advocated equality between legitimate and illegitimate children, and sparked public debate, as well as ad hominem attacks by the Bishop of Córdoba.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{using the}} {{definition}} of [...] "light pollution" [...] from some Italian regional bills (i.e., [...] "every irradiance of artificial light outside competence areas and particularly upward the sky") only full cutoff design prevents light pollution. The Italian <b>Lombardy</b> <b>region,</b> where only full cutoff design is allowed (Lombardy act no. 17/2000, promoted by Cielobuio-coordination {{for the protection of}} the night sky), in 2007 had the lowest per capita energy consumption for public lighting in Italy. The same legislation also imposes a minimum distance between street lamps of about four times their height, so full cut off street lamps are the best solution to reduce both light pollution and electrical power usage.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008 {{the mayor}} of Milan, Letizia Moratti and her deputy for {{mobility}} and environment Edoardo Croci, launched the Ecopass program [...] expecting a 30% cut in pollution levels and a 10% reduction in traffic. She {{said that it was}} part of a wider project to reduce smog in the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>region</b> and increase the use of public transportation. The mayor forecast that the scheme would raise € 24 million a year, two thirds of which would be invested into public transportation. Because of opposition, even among her own political allies, the original plan had to be scaled down as the traffic restricted zone (ZTL) was reduced from a planned 60km2 to 8km2. The implemented Ecopass ZTL represents just 5% of the city's area. Also the launch was delayed from October 2007 until after the Christmas and New Year holidays, and the mayor was forced to include discounts for local residents.|$|E
2500|$|Barbera is {{believed}} to have originated in the hills of Monferrato in central Piemonte, Italy where it has been known from the thirteenth century. Documents from the cathedral of Casale Monferrato between 1246-1277 detail leasing agreements of vineyard lands planted with [...] "de bonis vitibus barbexinis" [...] or Barbera, as it was known then. However, one ampelographer, Pierre Viala, speculates that Barbera originated in the <b>Lombardy</b> <b>region</b> of Oltrepò Pavese. In the 19th and 20th century, waves of Italian immigrants brought Barbera to the Americas where the vine took root in California and Argentina among other places. Recent DNA evidence suggest that Barbera {{may be related to the}} French-Spanish vine Mourvedre. In 1985, the Piedmont region was rocked by a scandal involving Barbera producers illegally adding methanol to their wines, killing over 30 people and causing many more to lose their sight. The bad press and publicity saw a steady decline in Barbera sales and plantings, allowing the grape to be eclipsed by the Montepulciano grape as Italy's second most widely planted red grape variety in the late 1990s.|$|E
