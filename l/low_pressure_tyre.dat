40|$|During 1988 - 1992 eight field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at the Ultuna property outside Uppsala. The {{experiments were}} financed by Stiftelsen Svensk Oljeväxtforskning. The objectives were to study effects of different harrowing intensities, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> and seed rates on quality of seedbed, plant establishment, mechanical resistance, harvest yield and harvest quality. The experiments lasted for one year and they were carried out on heavy day soils with high humus content. The results from the experiments indicate: - A more intense tillage has in all cases and in all soil layers increased penetration resistance due to soil compaction. However the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> has not affected the penetration resistance. This is {{probably due to the}} <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres,</b> which are broader and thereby pack a larger area. - <b>Low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> influenced only to a small ex tent qualities of the seedbed. - The number of emerged plants raised with an increased number of harrowings. - The use of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> did not improve the harvest yield. - There were no difference in harvest yield between two and three harrowings. One harrowing resulted in lower yield. - Normal seed rate improved emergence of seedlings, harvest yield and harvest quality compared to a lower seed rate. Further research should be concentrated to field experiments which are carried out for a longer time period. The experiments should also, if possible, be carried out on soils more susceptible to soil compaction...|$|R

50|$|Structurally, the Hummel was {{a wooden}} aircraft. The wing were {{built around a}} wooden {{monospar}} with plywood covered leading edges and ailerons, with fabric covering elsewhere. The fuselage was a plywood covered wooden structure, as were the fixed tail surfaces, rudder and elevators being fabric covered. The horizontal tail surfaces were set noticeably aft of the rudder, rather like the more recent Piper PA-28. The enclosed cabin had dual controls, a single central control column being shared via horizontal extensions. There was a generous baggage space behind the seats. The fixed undercarriage had main wheels on split axles, with <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> and brakes. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|R
50|$|Easy-clean {{pressed steel}} wheels carried extra <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> 5.50—16 <b>tyres</b> of a {{slightly}} smaller section than previously.

50|$|The LeO H-23-2 was an amphibious {{aircraft}} {{with conventional}} tailwheel landing gear. Each wheel, fitted with <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> and brakes, {{was on a}} cranked axle with a drag strut, both hinged from the hull side, and another leg which was vertical when the gear was down; the fuselage hinge also mounted an inverse V-strut, its vertex {{on the top of}} the vertical leg. All three joined the bottom end of an oblique Messier retracting shock absorber which projected inwards above the wing. Retracted, the wheel was exposed under the wing, at about 30° to it. The castoring tailwheel was attached just aft of the rear step and had a rubber shock absorber.|$|R
2500|$|The Auster AOP.9 was {{designed}} as a successor to the Auster AOP.6. Like its predecessor, it was a braced high-wing single engined monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Although having the same general appearance, the AOP.9 was a new design, with larger wing area and a more powerful engine. The wing and tail were metal-skinned, but the fuselage and ailerons were fabric-covered. [...] The fin and rudder assembly were more angular in the new aircraft with a noticeable dorsal fillet. A combination of the more powerful 180hp (134kW) Blackburn Cirrus Bombardier engine, larger wings and large flaps gave it an improved take-off and landing performance compared with the AOP.6. It could operate from ploughed fields and muddy surfaces using <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> and strengthened undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|A new three-speed syncromesh gearbox {{was fitted}} along with {{standard}} Jackall built-in hydraulic jacks and Magna wired wheels. (It {{should be noted}} that a 3-speed gearbox produced at least a 25% reduction in anxiety level for most drivers. Suburban streets shivered to the sound of grating gears in pre-syncromesh gearboxes). Easy-clean pressed steel wheels with six-stud fixing became available, initially as an option but in either case they carried 5.75—16 extra <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> of a smaller section than the previous model. A spare wheel with its tyre was carried in a sunken panel {{on the back of the}} car and a steel cover was supplied for it on the dearer sliding head model which also carried toughened glass in its side and rear windows.|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} of the Couzinet 100 had fixed, tailwheel landing gear. When the Couzinet 100, powered by [...] Salmson 9 ADb radials made its first flight it had mainwheels in trouser fairings and relied on <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> to absorb landing shocks. One flight was enough to see its return to the factory, where a more conventional three strut arrangement was installed. The Couzinet 101 had similar gear, each wheel with a near-vertical oleo strut to the forward spar in the inner wing and a cranked axle and drag strut from the lower fuselage. The wheels, in spats, were below the outer engines with a track of 2.83 m. The mainwheels had independent brakes and the tailwheel castored on its oleo strut.|$|R

The main wheels had <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> and were fitted with wheel brakes; there was a small tailwheel. As a seaplane, it had a single central float, braced by two forward struts to the rear of the engine and a pair of aft struts joining the float to the rear wing spar. This float, almost as long as the aircraft and projecting well forward of the nose, had a single step and a water rudder. A pair of stabilizing floats were mounted outboard, braced to the wings spars under the outer interplane struts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- All-terrain {{vehicles}} (ATVs) are motorized {{vehicles with}} large, <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres.</b> ATVs {{are designed to}} carry one rider on uneven surfaces. ATVs weigh up to 600 pounds and can reach speeds of 75 mph. The uses of ATVs are increasing day-by-day and it is spreading across worldwide. As the use of ATV is increasing day-by-day, there is a black side also which increases number of accidents and injuries happened during riding. The main objective of this research work is to perform a structural analysis on an ATV frame considering mainly the safety features including total safety of driver during any crash or any accident, to have a compact structure with less weight and with good aesthetics as well. To achieve this objective the material selection for roll cage structure is based on good strength to weight ratio as compared between various tubing international grades. The numerical analysis of the frame is accomplished in ANSYS software using structural model prepared in CREO software. The frame is analysed under various type of crash tests like front impact, side impact etc. to check its strength and required safety features of the frame. The Impulse-momentum equation is considered for the forces which act on the body during any collision...|$|R
5000|$|The main design {{criteria}} were {{set by the}} disposable nature of the aircraft's load and its rugged and hazardous working environment. The first required the load in its hopper to be placed at the aerodynamic center, about 25% chord; safety demanded a good view from the cockpit in all directions but particularly forwards, so the cockpit was placed high behind the hopper with the forward fuselage sloping downwards at 15°. The seat was designed to withstand 40g's [...] The cockpit was open but with two strong, curved longitudinal frames to ease any obstructions, cables and the like, safely over the pilot's head. The leading edges of the undercarriage legs were sharpened to cut through similar hazards. Good low-speed flight characteristics, even with a heavy load, were also essential, calling for a high-lift wing. The all-metal Ag-1 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with an unusually thick (thickness/chord 21%), constant chord wing, fitted with full span slotted flaps and slot-lip ailerons. [...] It had a short centre section with no dihedral and outer panels with 5° of dihedral. The legs of the fixed, conventional undercarriage, with wheels fitted with <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres,</b> were mounted on this inner wing section, which also contained internal tanks, capacity 150 UG gal (125 Imp gal, 568 L) for crop spraying liquid. The wing tip tip to tip spray boom was contained within the wing profile.|$|R
25|$|The F28 {{was similar}} in design to the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9, {{as it had}} a T-tail and engines mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. The {{aircraft}} had wings with a slight crescent angle of sweep with ailerons at the tip, simple flaps, and five-section liftdumper only operated after landing to dump the lift. These were employed rather than reverse thrust as the designers felt that doing so not only reduced weight, but maintenance also. Having no reversers also meant that on unpaved airstrips there was less chance of the engines ingesting debris. The leading edge was fixed (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was anti-iced by bleed air from the engines. The tail cone could split and be hydraulically opened to the sides to act as a variable air brake – also used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer. This design was also used on the HS-146, which became the BAe-146. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher RPM which helped eliminate 'lag time'. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or go-arounds on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear which used large <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres</b> enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. Large wheel brakes also helped in shortening the landing run.|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to compare the effects of different types of forestry machine chassis on the compaction of the top layers of soil and to define the soil moisture content level, at which machine traffic results in maximum compaction. Area of study: Measurements were conducted in eight forest stands located in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The soil types in the stands subjected to the study were luvisols, stagnosols, cambisols, and rendzinas. Material and Methods: The measurements were focused on tracked and wheeled (equipped with <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tyres)</b> cut-to-length machines, and skidders equipped with wide and standard tyres. The bulk density of soil was determined from soil samples extracted from the ruts, the centre of the skid trail, and the undisturbed stand. To determine soil moisture content, at which the soil is the most susceptible to compaction, the Proctor standard test was employed. Main results: The moisture content for maximal compaction fluctuated from 12 % to 34. 06 %. Wheeled machines compacted the soil to 1. 24 – 1. 36 g. cm - 3 (30. 3 – 35. 4 % compaction) in dried state. Bulk density of soil in stands where tracked machine operated was lower, ranging from 1. 02 to 1. 06 g. cm - 3 (25. 3 % compaction). Research highlights: All wheeled machines caused the same amount of soil compaction in the ruts, despite differences in tyres, machine weight, etc. Maximum compaction caused by forestry machines occurred at minimal moisture contents, easily achievable in European climatic conditions.    Keywords: soil compaction; bulk density; soil moisture content limits; cut-to-length machines; skidders. </p...|$|R
5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> desert <b>tyres,</b> sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|R

40|$|The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV {{carried out}} an {{inspection}} of the tyres of approximately 6000 cars in the Netherlands during November 1976 {{in order to measure}} their tread-depths. The sample was taken at the parking lots of roadside restaurants, motels, and modern shopping centres and showed a slight bias in favour of newer cars. By weighting the sample a representative picture was obtained for all cars used on the roads. The weighting was carried out using data from the monthly car survey of the central bureau of statistics in the Netherlands. The percentage of cars with smooth tread tyres was much smaller than obtained by other inspections of select samples. Only 1. 3 per cent of the cars had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1 mm (the legal minimum); a further 4. 9 per cent had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of 1 to 1. 6 mm. These percentages were slightly lower than the results which the SWOV obtained in 1974 during a comparable inspection. There are indications that the situation in 1979 hardly differs from that in 1976. Although the percentage of smooth tread tyres is small, the annual number of fatal and injury accidents in the Netherlands would decline by about 500 if all tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1. 6 mm were to be replaced. The SWOV emphasizes that an insufficient tread-depth is not the only tyre aspect which threatens the safety of car occupants. Other tyre characteristics which can {{have a negative effect on}} road safety are: <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure,</b> dried-out <b>tyres,</b> holes and tears, irregular wear, and combining diagonal-ply and radial-ply tyres on the same car...|$|R

40|$|Tyres are a {{final output}} torque {{of the vehicle}} before all the forces are {{distributed}} to the road surface as a tractive force. When the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changed, it had a direct effect on rolling resistance force of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total resistance force between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”. The results from calculation showed the total resistance force when the vehicle speed was zero from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi increased by 48. 52 % from reference value and the total resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 45 psi decreased by 13. 46 % from the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The different resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 35 psi with the other 2 values of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in the research were called the different rolling resistance force because the vehicle changed only <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different rolling resistance force along the test speed from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased.

The slope from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi was 0. 2358 which was steeper than the slope of 0. 0828 from 45 psi <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> These were the effect of tyre characteristic that made from rubber. When the vehicle speed was low, the frequency of tyre deformation was also low and resulted in high energy loss from hysteresis phenomena. Therefore high rolling resistance force was generated. Considering the effect of tyre under high vehicle speed, the frequency of tyre deformation increased and made the molecule of rubber vibrate more than low vehicle speed. These effects made the tyre stiffer than low frequency and resulted in decreasing the rolling resistance force. In additional, high frequency that caused by high <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> had effected on driving comfort in a real driving condition...|$|R

The studies were conducted on three different soils with different textures and soil compactibilities. Traffic pressure was applied with a game drive vehicle loaded with 10 sand bags, each weighing 70 kg, plus the driver. This gave a total vehicle mass of 3795 kg, simulating a vehicle fully laden with tourists. The results of the study reported here included comparing of the effects of four different <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> on the root area distribution below each <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> At all sites, root density fractions under the tracks were reduced significantly at all <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures,</b> compared with the control values.
