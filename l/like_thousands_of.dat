25|$|When George Musulin {{organized}} the 1944 final rescue of 500 American airmen called Operation Halyard, Draža Mihailović sent a political mission to Bari, Italy aboard an American plane. The arrival of Pribićević (now former President of the Independent Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Dr. Vladimir Belajčić (former Justice of the Superior Court of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Ivan Kovač (a Chetnik representative), and Major Zvonko Vučković (one {{of the principal}} Chetnik commanders) caused the British concern since they had already chosen who to back. At the Bari stopover, Ivan Šubašić, who signed the Treaty of Vis, {{also known as the}} Tito-Šubašić Agreement, earlier that year, met with the members of Mihailović's political mission but the Prime Minister-in-exile said nothing about the agreement he signed months earlier compromising the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Pribićević and his team remained in the West after the war ended, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> other soldiers who managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|After 1910 steady {{population}} decline {{was driven}} {{by the lack of}} significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. The hardware store closed in 1928 and the bank, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> other undercapitalized small-town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 {{in the aftermath of the}} stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney's population at 19. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the main drag is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A. Klugman general store, which also housed the post office until its closing in 1980. The building was vacant for several years, but was recently purchased and is being rehabilitated.|$|E

500|$|In his biographer Ben Harker's view, [...] "It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to overstate the extent to which MacColl was shaped by the 1930s." [...] MacColl was a keen rambler, travelling out of Manchester by bus into the Peak District, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> other young unemployed people with time on their hands. For MacColl, rambling was integral to his politics; he did not simply find nature beautiful and the urban world ugly: instead, it was an objective of the hoped-for revolution: ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But {{do you know how many}} packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E

"So long as {{the class}} {{struggle}} flowed between the peaceful shores of parliamentarism, Kautsky, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others, indulged himself in the luxury of revolutionary criticism and bold perspectives: in practice these did not bind him to anything. But when {{the war and the}} after-war period brought the problems of revolution onto the field, Kautsky took up his position definitively {{on the other side of}} the barricade. Without breaking away from Marxist phraseology he made himself, instead of the champion of the proletarian revolution, the advocate of passivity of a crawling capitulation before Imperialism." ...|$|E

60|$|After {{that came}} a downpour of water, {{when the wind}} drove the rain-drops in solid sheets, as you might say, which stung one's face <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> needles. The roaring of thunder, for after the first {{outburst}} of the tempest {{it seemed to be}} almost continuous, the blinding flashes of light, together with the deluge of water, all served to confuse one, and I believe I stood there struggling against the elements to hold my footing, a full minute before gathering my wits sufficiently to turn about in order to rejoin Uncle 'Rasmus.|$|E
60|$|In my case, I foresaw {{that the}} {{situation}} would inevitably {{become more and more}} difficult year by year. My father could not live in any city, and for me to give up my life in Chicago and New York in order to establish a permanent home in West Salem, involved a sacrifice which I was not willing to make,--either on my own account or Zulime's. I had no right to demand such devotion from her. <b>Like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> other men of my age I was snared in circumstances--forced to do that which appeared unfilial and neglectful.|$|E
60|$|Edward Burrough, {{called a}} son of thunder and of consolation, {{answered}} both these treatises of Bunyan's,--denying, {{on the part of}} the Quakers, many of the charges made against them, as connected with the Ranters. He was a man of great talent--fearless, devoted, and pious. He became extensively useful; and <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> most excellent men, was sacrificed at the shrine of that fanatical church over which the profligate and debauched Charles the Second was the supreme head. He died in the prime of life, receiving the crown of martyrdom, when his happy spirit ascended from Newgate in 1662: aged 28 years.|$|E

60|$|The {{association}} between the vices is intimate. There really {{appears to be a}} kind of modesty in sin that makes it ashamed of good company. If we are unable to reconcile a favorite propensity to our principles, we are apt to abandon the unpleasant restraint on our actions, rather than admit the incongruous mixture. Freed entirely from the fetters of our morals, what is there that our vices will not prompt us to commit? Egerton, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others, went on from step to step, until he found himself in the world; free to follow all his inclinations, so he violated none of the decencies of life.|$|E

We had perforce to alter our ways, to alter our surroundings, our amusements, our ideals. Joy came with her, and pain may find a secret place in our hearts now that she has gone, but I {{do not think that}} either of us would willingly blot out from his life these last two years.

60|$|And, you know, {{there was}} no game, no game of any sort, or shape or kind. It came out plainly at the trial. As I've told you before, he was a clerk in a bank, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others. He got that berth as a second start in life and there he stuck again, giving perfect satisfaction. Then one day as though a supernatural voice had whispered into his ear or some {{invisible}} fly had stung him, {{he put on his}} hat, went out into the street and began advertising. That's absolutely all that there was to it. He caught in the street the word of the time and harnessed it to his preposterous chariot.|$|E

25|$|Still, {{what the}} {{province}} {{is known for}} is its massive tourism sector.

60|$|Truly, I {{should have}} been happy, and in my sour, big-fisted way I was happy. I tried, honestly, to grasp and hold the ecstasy which these days offered. I who had lived for twelve years on railway trains, in camp, on horse-back or in wretched little city hotels, was now a portly householder, a pampered husband and a {{prospective}} parent. And yet--such is my perverse temperament--I could not overlook {{the fact that this}} tranquil village <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others scattered over the West, was but a half-way house, a pleasant hospital into which many of the crippled, worn-out and white-haired farmers and their wives had come to rest for a little while {{on their way to the}} grave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you have}} never thought of the {{responsibilities}} of a great name. This man, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others in the city, idealized you. He looked up to you as the soul of honour, as a self-made man who by his own unaided efforts--as you yourself have just pointed out--rose from a poor boy {{to a position of}} power and trust in the community. He saw you a prominent layman in the Church of God. He was dazzled by the brilliancy of your success, inspired by a civilization which--gave such opportunities. He recognized that he himself had not the brains for such an achievement,--his hope and love and ambition were centred in his boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact I need not have been anxious on this point, since if Goza, who I may state, was a kind of secret service officer as well as a head messenger, knew, as I think probable, he had been {{commanded}} by Zikali to hold his tongue under penalty of a curse. Perhaps the same was true of the soldiers who had come with him to take me to Ulundi. The hint of Zikali was as powerful as the word of the king, since they, <b>like</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others, believed that whereas Cetewayo could kill them, Zikali, like Satan, could blast their spirits as well as their bodies. But how was I to guess all these things at that time? ...|$|E

25|$|Diamonds {{also helped}} to arm the Revolutionary United Front rebels. The RUF used funds {{harvested}} from the alluvial diamond mines to purchase weapons and ammunition from neighboring Guinea, Liberia, and even SLA soldiers.
