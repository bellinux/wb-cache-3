5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd of}} people {{assembled}} below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers, merchants, craft persons, peasants, and women and sick children. As the balcony was set high, the king would stand on a platform so that people gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable; even when the sovereign was ill. He {{felt that it was}} necessary to see them publicly {{at least once a day}} in order to maintain his control, and guard against immediate anarchy. It also had a symbolic purpose. During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar, or present him with petitions for some cause. Akbar, therefore, began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him. Sometimes, while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan, he would <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> thread down the jharokha so that people could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice. It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process, which Badauni, a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan. Akbar's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular.|$|E

25|$|Moose often show {{aggression}} {{to other}} animals as well; especially predators. Bears are common predators of moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose {{have been reported}} to successfully fend off attacks from black bears, brown bears and grizzlies. Moose have been known to stomp attacking wolves, which makes them less preferred as prey to the wolves. Moose are fully capable of killing bears and wolves. A moose of either sex that is confronted by danger may <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loud roar, more resembling that of a predator than a prey animal. European moose are often more aggressive than North American moose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated {{at the sight of a}} predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack predators, the more aggressive individuals are always darker in color.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
25|$|At about 4:00 PM, a {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} flying the red flag with children in the lead had assembled but when {{at the behest of}} their leaders they <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> shout and tried to descend on the riverfront, a Japanese naval landing force came ashore and firstly shot blanks but then fired off several live rounds. The rioters then retreated and surged like an avalanche out of the concession, plundering all the way. Though the rioters stubbornly refused to move out once they had reached Pinghe Street, when the Japanese landing party was compelled to fire off warning shots with their machine guns {{in the direction of the}} Honganji temple’s embankment the crowd fled. The crowd which was thus driven from the Japanese concession attacked Japanese businesses located in the concessions of other countries. They attacked a restaurant where six sailors were dining, beat them mercilessly, and then carried them away and imprisoned them at the headquarters of the communist-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions. That night, 25 Japanese people escaped to the British ship HMS Bee and were protected. Dojin Hospital also pulled out from Hankou.|$|E

Over the next several weeks, Magnus began showing signs of a face turn when Bram would throw weapons into the ring and encourage him to <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> more intense side but Magnus would refuse. More signs began to show from Magnus when he first attacked Bram in a backstage segment, and then when Magnus saved Tigre Uno from an assault from Bram the following week. On the edition of 5 June of Impact Wrestling, {{it looked as though}} Magnus would finalize his face turn and save Willow from Bram, but would in fact remain heel and attack Willow himself with a steel pry bar. Since developing a more violent persona, Magnus and Bram began a rivalry with Willow and the returning Abyss. Magnus defeated Willow on 15 June 2014, at Slammiversary XII. on 26 June 2014, episode of Impact Wrestling Magnus and Bram defeated Willow and Abyss in a tag team Monster's Ball match. On 20 August 2014, at Hardcore Justice, Magnus was a participant in a six-sides of steel match to determine a number 1 contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, the match was ultimately won by Eric Young and Bobby Roode.|$|E
