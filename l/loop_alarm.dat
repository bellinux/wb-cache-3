When <b>alarmed</b> the larva essentially jumps from the host and continues to wreathe and wriggle wildly. Prepupal larvae take on a pinkish cast. Pupation occurs in a silken cocoon below (usually) or at the soil surface. Sand and/or plant debris are interwoven into the cocoon wall.|$|R
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider makes {{extensive}} use of superconductors, in magnets for bending and focusing the particles, and in RF cavities for accelerating them, which are operated at 1. 9 K and 4. 5 K. The process automation for the cryogenic distribution around the accelerator circumference is based on 16 Programmable Logic Controllers, each running 250 control <b>loops,</b> 500 <b>alarms</b> and interlocks, and a phase sequencer. Spread along 27 km and under ionizing radiation, 15 000 cryogenic sensors and actuators are accessed through industrial field networks. We describe the main hardware and software components of the control system, their deployment and commissioning, together with the project organization, challenges faced, and solutions found...|$|R

For each unit, the process automation {{is based on a}} Programmable Logic Con-troller implementing more than 30 closed control <b>loops</b> and handling <b>alarms,</b> in-terlocks and overall process management. More than 160 sensors and actuators are distributed over 150 m on a Profibus DP/PA network. Parameterization, cali-bration and diagnosis are remotely available through the bus. Considering the diversity, amount and geographical distribution of the instru-mentation involved, this is a representative approach to the cryogenic control system for CERN's next accelerator...|$|R
40|$|The Respond and Pump in Days (RAPID) {{project was}} {{initiated}} to pump {{part of the}} contents of tank 241 -SY- 101 into tank 241 -SY- 102. This document establishes the basis for all set points and ranges used in the RAPID project. There are 23 instrument and/or control loops utilized by the RAPID project. These range from the simple indication loop with two components to complex indication, control, and <b>alarm</b> <b>loops</b> with up to eight components. Several loops include safety class elements. This document is intended to describe the loops in full and to provide the basis for each of the element setpoints, ranges and accuracies identified in the RAPID project Master Equipment List (MEL). These values are developed in two steps. First, the base value is identified with reference to the supporting document providing that value. Second, a spreadsheet calculation is performed on each element and loop, utilizing a standard methodology described below, that takes into account known and suspected variance in output and establishes the actual setpoint used on a given element. The results of the spreadsheet are reported directly in this document...|$|R
40|$|Measurements by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) {{on board}} the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{may be used to}} {{provides}} a radiometric measurement of Mars in addition to the topographic measurement. We will describe the principle of operation, a mathematical model, and the receiver calibration in this presentation. MOLA was designed primarily to measure Mars topography, surface roughness end the bidirectional reflectance to the laser beam. To achieve the highest sensitivity the receiver detection threshold is dynamically adjusted to be as low as possible while keeping a predetermined false alarm rate. The average false alarm rate 29 monitored in real time on board MOLA via a noise counter, whose output is fed to the threshold control <b>loop.</b> The false <b>alarm</b> rate at a given threshold {{is a function of the}} detector output noise which is the sum of the photo detector, shot noise due to the background light seen by the detector and the dark noise. A mathematical model has been developed that can be used to numerically solve for the optical background power given the MOLA threshold setting and the average noise count. The radiance of Mars can then be determined by dividing the optical power by the solid angle subtended by the MOLA receiver, the receiver optical band-width, end the Mars surface area within the receiver field of view. The phase angle which is the sun-Mars-MOLA angle is available from the MGS database. MOLA also measures simultaneously the bidirectional reflectance of Mars vie its 106 -lum loser beam at nadir with nearly zero phase angle. The optical bandwidth of the MOLA receiver is 2 um full width at half maximum (FWHM) and centered at 106 -lum. The receiver field of view is 0. 95 mrad FWHM. The nominated spacecraft altitude is 100 km and the ground track speed is about 3 km/s. Under normal operation, the noise counter are read and the threshold levels are updated at 1 Hz. The receiver sensitivity is limited by the detector dark noise to about 0. 1 nW, which corresponds to less than 2 % the maximum radiance during daytime from the brightest area on Mars. The results from the mathematical model agree well with the prelaunch measurements at several calibrated optical power levels. The radiance of sunlit Mars estimated with this technique correlates well with the measurement from the MGS.
