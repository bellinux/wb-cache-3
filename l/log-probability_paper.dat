40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the analysis of available rainfall and runoff data for selected watersheds in the state of Minnesota to assist in the evaluation of peak rates of runoff for design purposes. Six watersheds were selected for study. Rainfall and runoff data were analyzed for 51 flood events in five of the six watersheds. AN optimization program prepared by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center was used to optimize nine variables associated with the watersheds, develop characteristic unit hydrographs, and evaluate loss rates for the watershed in terms of the mathematical model represented by the optimization program. Data on annual maximum floods as well as maximum summer floods were plotted on <b>log-probability</b> <b>paper</b> and theoretical flood-frequency curves determined by the log-Pearson Type III distribution. Approximately 200 figures relating to the rainfall-runoff data and analysis thereof have been included in Appendices for future use. This might involve further work with the same program or possibly other programs. A limited number of copies of the Appendices has been prepared for reference purposes.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{describing}} the size composition of salmonid spawning gravel was developed. For gravel samples from Idaho and Washington streams, cumulative distributions of particle sizes for gravel smaller than 25. 4 mm were consistently plotted as straight lines on <b>log-probability</b> <b>paper.</b> Because of the lognormal {{distribution of the}} particle sizes in this range, the size composition of material smaller than 25. 4 mm was closely approximated by two points on a regression of cumulative particle size distribu tion. The two size classes that best reflected {{the composition of the}} spawning gravel size were the percentage of the substrate smaller than 9. 50 mm and the percentage smaller than 0. 85 mm. Salmonid embryo survival was related to these two groups of particle size in laboratory tests. In these tests, 90 - 93 % of the variability in embryo survival was correlated with changes in substrate size composition. Equations were developed to describe the effect of spawning gravel size composition on chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (Salrno gairdneri) survival to emergence {{in a wide range of}} spawning gravel mixtures. Gravel mixtures containing high percentages of fine sediment produced slightly smaller steelhead fry than gravels containing low percentages of fine sediment, but the difference was not significant (P...|$|E
