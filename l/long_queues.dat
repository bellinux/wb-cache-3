5|$|Soviet {{citizens}} {{had only}} three days from 23 - 25 January to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes for the new currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, <b>long</b> <b>queues</b> formed in front of Soviet savings banks, {{even though it was}} also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices. This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 8,000 people {{commuted}} between Sotra and Bergen, and {{the bridge}} {{had an average}} daily traffic of 22,000 vehicles. On National Road 555 between Straume, the municipal center of Fjell, and Storavatnet, where National Road 555 becomes a motorway, there are <b>long</b> <b>queues</b> during rush hour. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has proposed a four-lane motorway along National Road 555 from Stoavatnet to Straume. This will require a new crossing across Knarreviksundet. Such a motorway extension is estimated to cost between NOK3 and 4 billion, {{and the government has}} allocated NOK400 million in National Transport Plan 2010–2019 for the project. It is presumed that most of the project will be financed as a toll road.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The <b>long</b> <b>queues</b> have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{juxtaposed}} controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because {{a check of}} all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates <b>long</b> <b>queues</b> if done at arrival.|$|E

25|$|A {{few hours}} after the {{beginning}} of the confusion, aircraft began to fly out of London Heathrow, although in reduced numbers.

25|$|US {{retail price}} gas prices rose from a {{national}} average of 38.5cents in May 1973 to 55.1cents in June 1974. State governments requested citizens not to put up Christmas lights. Oregon banned Christmas and commercial lighting altogether. Politicians called for a national gas rationing program. Nixon requested gasoline stations to voluntarily not sell gasoline on Saturday nights or Sundays; 90% of owners complied, which produced <b>long</b> <b>queues.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 1 September 1997 {{security}} controls were introduced {{on a limited}} number of domestic passengers and all international passengers. This led to the physical separation of the check-in and departure halls. For passengers this had a dramatic effect on travel times. Passengers without check-in baggage had previously been able to meet at the airport five to ten minutes before boarding time and reach their aircraft. Security controls became a bottle-neck, with peaks just before departures and otherwise minimal traffic. <b>Long</b> <b>queues</b> were commonplace.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a block-fading homogeneous broadcast channel with n users each receiving packets randomly and independently with {{a rate of}} λ. Packets are stored in separate queues to await transmission using an opportunistic scheduling which exploits the multiuser diversity of the channel by serving the user with the most favorable channel condition at each coherence interval. In this paper, we {{consider a}} stochastic model in which mean packet transmission time is n − 1 and establish a convergence result for the occupancy distribution of all n queues under opportunistic scheduling. It is shown that if λ < 1 then the expected length of the <b>longest</b> <b>queue</b> is less than log 1 /λ n + O(1) for large n. In order to improve the occupancy distribution while exploiting the multiuser diversity, we also study a scheme that serves the user with the <b>longest</b> <b>queue</b> among the d users with the most favorable channel conditions. It is shown that upper bound on the expected length of the <b>longest</b> <b>queue</b> improves to log d/λ n + O(1). Simulation results are presented to validate our asymptotic results. I...|$|R

25|$|There {{followed}} {{some years}} of penury and struggle which are recounted in her autobiography published in 1934 She worked variously {{as a house}} maid, sold matches and hired a barrel organ to entertain crowds on Armistice Day in 1918 earning a meagre living for several years. In 1923, she spotted an opportunity with the <b>long</b> <b>queues</b> that used to form outside London theatres and cinemas and hired out chairs and stools for the waiting patrons to sit on, thereby earning the sobriquet 'Peggy the Chair Lady'. Her enterprise drew her into a criminal underworld that flourished {{in the aftermath of}} the Great War.|$|E
25|$|At 15, Cox {{became a}} regular at The Cavern Club, and remembered the <b>long</b> <b>queues</b> and violent {{competition}} {{for access to the}} Beatles. Although she got a kiss from Ringo, whom she called ‘Ritchie’ (for Richard), he did not immediately notice her among his numerous fans. All the Beatles were supposed to be officially unattached, for image purposes, and when Ringo started dating Cox, she was often threatened, and once scratched in the face by a vicious rival. She even had to stop working as a hairdresser because of the threats. In September 1963, with her parents' permission, she travelled to Greece with Starr, McCartney, and Jane Asher.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} {{suffered from}} road and motorway closures. In the United Kingdom, the major motorways M1, M6 and M18 were closed in several places, {{as well as}} the M25 ring road around London {{and a number of other}} motorways. Bridges including the M6 Thelwall Viaduct in Warrington, the M25 Dartford Crossing in London and the M1 Tinsley Viaduct in Sheffield were closed due to high winds. All Pennine Passes were closed. Closures were largely due to the toppling of multiple high-sided vehicles. Other motorways were affected by significant delays. <b>Long</b> <b>queues</b> developed around blackspots, in particular replacement crossings of the Manchester Ship Canal including routes through Warrington and over the Runcorn Bridge.|$|E
