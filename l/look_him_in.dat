500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} we would go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you to}} your face that we would pay you if we thought we were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong. We just wanted to essentially <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|New York {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making {{headlines}} off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, Hank Bauer and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management's patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the Kansas City Athletics. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel could not <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the eye as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, {{a sister}} {{of one of}} the victims {{expressed}} her desire to visit and forgive him, saying [...] "I want to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the eye and make sure he knows our pain... God will judge him". She said the decision to release him was [...] "more than we could ever expect from Libya if the tables were turned." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{religious}} {{paintings were}} sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ {{in the sky}} in his painting of Saint-Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of Simon Vouet for having [...] "Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy". Poussin responded that [...] "he could {{not and should not}} imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face".|$|E
2500|$|Diaghilev {{was known}} as a hard, demanding, even {{frightening}} taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too afraid to ever <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face. George Balanchine said he carried around a cane during rehearsals, and banged it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914–18 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballet Russes and would later say that she had called Diaghilev [...] "Sergypops" [...] and he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.|$|E
2500|$|Republican candidates, running {{concurrently}} {{with the}} 1964 federal election, were {{undermined by the}} unpopularity of Barry Goldwater, the Republican challenger for the US Presidency, {{and the leader of}} their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should [...] "duck" [...] Goldwater as they feared any association with the Arizona Senator would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his [...] "political Godfather", reportedly told his aides, [...] "Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him now, I could never <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face again. I would rather lose." [...] The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) [...] Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes. [...] The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Sir Michael," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "this won't do at all. You can't <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{the face}} and run. Mr. Ducaine, this is Sir Michael Trogoldy." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{caught his}} arm and <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face. In another second she had loosed it.|$|R
60|$|She did not flinch {{from before}} <b>him.</b> She <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face, coldly and without fear.|$|R

60|$|Garnache paid no heed to him. He {{stepped to}} the girl, and roughly raised her chin with his hand so that {{she was forced to}} <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face.|$|E
60|$|Under Jet's example Jim {{was rapidly}} {{recovering}} his presence of mind, {{and since the}} visitor did not immediately set about killing them, he dared to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face.|$|E

6000|$|Dunham vainly {{struggled}} to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the eye. [...] "Staniford," [...] he faltered, {{with much more}} culpability than some criminals would confess a murder, [...] "I lent him five dollars!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, indeed. I {{will not}} be {{responsible}} for such usage! It must be your own doing,' said Lord Martindale, thoroughly displeased. 'I should be ashamed to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I,--I almost hope he will not. I {{shall be}} so afraid to see him. The first {{meeting will be}} so awful. I shall not dare to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face." ...|$|E
60|$|But Akoon countered his {{strength}} {{on the wheel}} and <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the eyes. The captain slowly released the spokes.|$|R

6000|$|Agatha <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the eyes, {{and spoke}} with quick intensity. [...] "We can't {{contemplate}} your not coming back. It's unthinkable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you made}} it with Rogers's money; and when you'd made it you took his share of it. I guess you thought of that when you saw him, and that's why you couldn't <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘O!’ she cried, ‘I have abominably used him—I know that; it is {{not that}} I mean. But if you admire my husband, I insist that you shall {{understand}} me: I can <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face without a blush.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mamma, I think papa is ill." [...] Then {{the wife}} took her {{drooping}} husband by both arms and strove to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the face. [...] "He has walked all the way, {{and he is}} ill," [...] said Jane.|$|E
