40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{distribution}} in Spain, of the European Regional Development Fund community structural help, considering its importance in volume. This survey {{is carried out}} in each autonomous community and in two five-year periods, being the first period 1989 - 1992 and the second one 1994 - 1999. First of all we work out measures of concentration in order {{to point out the}} difference in the concentration of the ERDF per capita, assigned by the European Union to the Autonomous Communities in the two periods which are analysed. The indicators propose are measures derive from the concentration graph, so that we can observe the existence of greater or minor concentration depending on the degree of convexity of the graph line, and obtaining distances of interest between the straight <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution</b> and the graph line which reflect the inequality in the distribution of the ERDF per capita. Secondly, a typological analysis of the Autonomous Communities is carried out, for the two periods, taking into account the economic variables which affect the distribution of the European Regional Fund and with the purpose of describing repercussions of the implementation of the MAC...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the moving-finite-element method (MFE) {{is used to}} solve the heat equation, with an {{artificial}} time component, to give a non-uniform (steady-state) grid that is adapted to a given profile. It is known from theory and experiments that MFE, applied to parabolic PDEs, gives adaptive grids which satisfy an equidistribution type law. This property is used to create nonuniform finite-element grids that are dictated by second-order derivatives of the solution. The proposed procedure {{could be used to}} create an initial grid for MFE itself, to define a regridding strategy for MFE in case of a distorted grid, or to prescribe a new adaptive grid method where the heat quation is used as a "monitor function".

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} thermodynamical {{formalism}} to {{show that}} there exists a unique equilibrium state μ_ϕ for each expanding Thurston map f: S^ 2 → S^ 2 together with a real-valued Hölder continuous potential ϕ. Here the sphere S^ 2 is equipped with a natural metric induced by f, called a visual metric. We also prove that identical equilibrium states correspond to potentials which are co-homologous upto a constant, and that the measure-preserving transformation f of the probability space (S^ 2,μ_ϕ) is exact, and in particular, mixing and ergodic. Moreover, we establish versions <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution</b> <b>of</b> preimages under iterates of f, and a version <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution</b> <b>of</b> a random backward orbit, with respect to the equilibrium state. As a consequence, all the above results hold for a postcritically-finite rational map with no periodic critical points on the Riemann sphere equipped with the chordal metric.

40|$|One of {{the central}} results in {{holomorphic}} dynamics in several variables is the <b>equidistribution</b> <b>of</b> preimages theorem, which constructs invariant probability measures for a large class of interesting dynamical systems, namely the class of polarized dynamical systems.

In recent years, as interest in nonarchimedean dynamics has grown, it has become apparent that an analogue <b>of</b> the <b>equidistribution</b> <b>of</b> preimages theorem should hold for polarized dynamical systems over nonarchimedean fields, and, indeed, an analogue has been shown for endomorphisms <b>of</b> the projective <b>line</b> over these fields.

40|$|The 32 -bit Mersenne Twister {{generator}} MT 19937 is {{a widely}} used random number generator. To generate numbers with more than 32 bits in bit length, and particularly when converting into 53 -bit double-precision floating-point numbers in [0, 1) in the IEEE 754 format, the typical implementation concatenates two successive 32 -bit integers and divides them by a power of 2. In this case, the 32 -bit MT 19937 is optimized in terms <b>of</b> its <b>equidistribution</b> properties (the so-called dimension <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution</b> with v-bit accuracy) {{under the assumption that}} one will mainly be using 32 -bit output values, and hence the concatenation sometimes degrades the dimension <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution</b> compared with the simple use of 32 -bit outputs. In this paper, we analyze such phenomena by investigating hidden F_ 2 -linear relations among the bits of high-dimensional outputs. Accordingly, we report that MT 19937 with a specific lag set fails several statistical tests, such as the overlapping collision test, matrix rank test, and Hamming independence test.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to obtain optimal {{estimates}} on the speed <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution</b> <b>of</b> nilflows on higher step nilmanifolds. Under a Diophantine condition on the frequencies of the toral projection of the flow, we prove that for almost all points on the nilmanifold orbits become equidistributed at polynomial speed with exponent which decays quadratically as a function of the number of steps. The main novelty is the introduction of new techniques of renormalization (rescaling) in absence of a truly recurrent renormalization dynamics. Quantitative equidistribution estimates are derived from bounds on the scaling of invariant distributions (in Sobolev norms) and on the geometry of the nilmanifold under the rescaling.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we discuss a {{two-dimensional}} adaptive grid method that is based on a tensor-product approach. Adaptive grids are a commonly used tool for increasing the accuracy and reducing computational costs when solving both partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations. A traditional and widely used form of adaptivity is the concept <b>of</b> <b>equidistribution,</b> which is well-defined and well-understood in one space dimension. The extension <b>of</b> the <b>equidistribution</b> principle to two or three space dimensions, however, is far from trivial and {{has been the subject of}} investigation of many researchers during the last decade. Besides the nonsingularity of the transformation that defines the nonuniform adaptive grid, the smoothness of the grid (or transformation) plays an important role as well.
