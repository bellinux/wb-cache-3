At least 41 bills or resolutions were introduced into the state legislatures, with some states facing the issue repeatedly.

In their annual report, the Board has criticised many governments, including Canada, for permitting the medicinal use of cannabis, Australia for providing injecting rooms and the United Kingdom for proposing to downgrade the classification of cannabis, which it has since done (although this change was reversed by the Home Secretary on 7 May 2008 against the advice of its own commissioned report).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a first {{comprehensive}} analysis of legal change in shareholder and creditor rights protection in transition economies {{and its impact}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> propensity of firms to raise external finance. The paper uses the investor rights indices developed by La Porta et al. (1998) as a starting point, but expands them to capture a greater range of potential conflicts between different stakeholders of the firm. It supplements the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> with {{an analysis of the}} effectiveness of legal institutions (legality). For assessing financial market development we use common measures of stock and credit market development. We find that external finance is still very underdeveloped in transition economies, despite legal change that has substantially improved shareholder and creditor rights. The only legal index with a significant positive impact on capital market development is the index that codes securities legislation (SMINTEGR). There is also some indication that credit market development benefited from improvements in <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> <b>The</b> effectiveness of legal institutions (legality) has a much stronger impact on external finance than <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> This is true especially for debt, but also for equity finance. This finding contrasts with studies in market economies showing that the quantitative effect of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> is greater than legality at least for capital market development (La Porta et al. 1997; Levine 1998). Instead, it supports the proposition that legal transplants and extensive legal reforms are not sufficient for the evolution of effective legal and market institutions (Berkowitz, Pistor and Richard, 1999). corporate finance and governance, corporate and securities law, law enforcement, socialist transition...|$|R

2500|$|After World War II, {{public opinion}} towards {{eugenics}} and sterilization programs became more negative {{in the light}} of the connection with the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany, though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. The Oregon Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983, with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.

Some states continued to have sterilization <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used.

2500|$|The government's {{argument}} was that VAWA had been enacted {{in response to}} [...] "gender-based disparate treatment by state authorities," [...] while in contrast there was [...] "no indication of such state action" [...] in the Civil Rights Cases. [...] According to the Court, however, the Civil Rights Cases held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not allow Congress to target private parties in order to remedy the unequal enforcement of state laws. [...] To support this interpretation of the Civil Rights Cases, the Court quoted one of the Congressmen who had supported the law that the Civil Rights Cases struck down: [...] "There were state <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> bespeaking equality of treatment, but {{in the administration of}} these laws there was discrimination against newly freed slaves." [...] To the majority, this quote indicated that the law deemed unconstitutional in the Civil Rights Cases was meant to combat the same kind of disparate treatment against which VAWA was aimed.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien had {{authorized}} {{a paperback}} edition of The Hobbit in 1961, though that edition was never made available outside the U.K. Eventually, he supported paperback editions of The Lord of the Rings {{and several of}} his other texts, {{but it is difficult to}} say whether he was persuaded to do so by the manifest economic wisdom evident in sales of the Ace editions. In any case, Ace was forced to cease publishing the unauthorized edition and to pay Tolkien for their sales following a grass-roots campaign by Tolkien's U.S. fans. A 1993 court determined that the copyright loophole suggested by Ace Books was invalid and its paperback edition was found to have been a violation of copyright under US law. (At this time, the U.S. had yet to join the International Copyright Convention, and most <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> existed to protect domestic creations from foreign infringement.

40|$|Leaving aside {{difficult}} to interpret doctrinal developments, such as the abrogation of traditional immunities, liability insurance has at least the following six impacts <b>on</b> tort <b>law</b> in action. First, for claims against all but the wealthiest individuals and organizations, liability insurance is a de facto element of tort liability. Second, liability insurance limits are a de facto cap on tort damages.

Fourth, liability insurance makes lawsuits against ordinary individuals and small organizations into repeat player lawsuits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defense side, making tort law in action less focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault of individual defendants and more focused on managing aggregate costs. Fifth, liability insurance personnel transform complex tort rules into simple rules of thumb, also with the result that tort law in action is less concerned with the fault of individual defendants than tort <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> Sixth, negotiations over the boundaries of liability insurance coverage (which appears nowhere in tort <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>books)</b> drive tort <b>law</b> in action...|$|R
