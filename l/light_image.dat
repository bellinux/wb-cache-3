Its companion Fomalhaut b was thought to be the first extrasolar planet ever detected by a visible <b>light</b> <b>image,</b> thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope, but infrared observations have since retracted this claim: it is instead a spherical cloud of dust. TW Piscis Austrini can be seen close by and is possibly associated with Fomalhaut as it lies within a light-year of it. Of magnitude 6.5, it is a BY Draconis variable.|$|E

30|$|The {{detection}} {{accuracy of}} the light stripe centers {{is an important factor}} based on the structured light vision measurement, {{and the quality of the}} <b>light</b> stripe <b>images</b> is a prerequisite for accurately detecting the light stripe centers; this paper separately proposes image enhancement methods for linear and arc <b>light</b> stripe <b>images.</b> For linear <b>light</b> stripes, the <b>image</b> with better quality is captured and the gray-scale distribution of the normal section corresponding to the light stripe centers is used as a template for <b>light</b> stripe <b>images</b> with poor quality. The poor quality <b>light</b> stripe <b>images</b> are finally optimized by linear interpolation. For arc-shaped light stripes, this paper proposes a positioning method for light stripe centers on arc, and then the gray-scale distribution of the normal cross-section of corresponding center which is on a good quality <b>light</b> stripe <b>image</b> is used as templates to improve the poor quality <b>light</b> quality stripe <b>images.</b> In order to verify the effectiveness of the <b>light</b> stripe <b>image</b> enhancement algorithms, this paper respectively presents verification methods to linear light stripe and arc light stripe. Finally, the quality of the <b>light</b> stripe <b>images</b> could be improved by image enhancement algorithms through experiments.|$|R

40|$|Recently, an {{emerging}} light field imaging technology, which enables capturing full light {{information in a}} scene, has gained a lot of interest. To design, develop, implement, and test novel algorithms in <b>light</b> field <b>image</b> processing and compression, the availability of suitable <b>light</b> field <b>image</b> datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available <b>light</b> field <b>image</b> dataset is introduced and described in details. The proposed dataset contains 118 <b>light</b> field <b>images</b> captured by using a Lytro Illum light field camera. Based on their content, acquired <b>light</b> field <b>images</b> were classified into ten different categories with various features covering wide range of potential usage, such as image compression and quality evaluation...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{reducing}} GEOS satellite plates is described. The catalog positions of stars, whose images were measured, are updated {{to the time}} of the photographic observation. The plate constants are used to compute the positions of the seven (or fewer) flashing <b>light</b> <b>images</b> which were measured. There are corrected for refraction, parallax, and radial and decentering lens distortions. With sidereally tracking cameras, the exterior orientation is further corrected {{to the time of}} the particular flash, and the change of refraction with time is allowed for. First and second differences and standard deviations and covariances for the flashing <b>light</b> <b>images</b> are developed as a measure of accuracy...|$|R
