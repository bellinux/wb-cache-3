50|$|An {{important}} <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> as {{with all}} studies that collect data via the internet, is that the samples {{tend to be more}} educated and from higher socioeconomic background because these individuals {{are more likely to have}} access and knowledge of the internet.|$|E
50|$|A notable <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that the}} {{researchers}} examined young adults, rather than the population at-large. According to the researchers, young adults in Japan are more active participants in a more global, Americanized culture than the older generations. This could explain the commonalities found between young adults in Japan and the US.|$|E
50|$|The main <b>{{limitation}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{is that it}} is a self-report measure {{which means}} that answers and results may be biased. Another limitation is that one version is filled out by a child and depending on the age and maturity of the child they may have trouble recognizing the frequency or severity of both external and internal symptom presentation. The parent may also be limited in recognizing the internal symptoms of their child's anxiety.|$|E
30|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> {{provided}} {{valuable insights}} in attitudes of Dutch teachers towards diversity. There are however some <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> We {{look more closely}} to three <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> because we feel they {{should be taken into}} account in further research.|$|R
30|$|The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{were the}} {{retrospective}} {{nature and the}} absence of a control group.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> hybrid–zirconia surface {{enhanced}} osseointegration in rabbit model. The proposed {{hypothesis was}} accepted.|$|R
50|$|Useful {{to study}} transgenerational {{inheritance}} patterns of epigenetic marks. A main limitation of EWAS is deciphering if a phenotype {{is associated with}} epigenetic changes {{as a result of}} a variable in question or a result of previous genomic variants leading to epigenetic alterations. Comparisons between parent and offspring genomic and epigenomic data allows one to rule out the possibility that a disease or phenotype is due to genomic variation. A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> design is that very few cohorts which are large enough exist.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, ConsumerLab.com {{submitted}} 12 red yeast rice product {{samples to}} a third party testing lab. Red yeast rice contains a compound called lovastatin. The study finds that 12 samples sent for testing had a per-capsule lovastatin level of: mean 2.54 mg, median 2.12 mg {{with a standard deviation}} of 2.60 mg and a range of 0.10 mg to 10.01 mg. The major <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is that it does not account for batch-to-batch variation as only one batch per sample was tested.|$|E
50|$|Ankyloglossia {{can result}} in {{mechanical}} and social effects. Lalakea and Messner studied 15 people, aged 14 to 68 years old. The subjects were given questionnaires {{in order to assess}} functional complaints associated with ankyloglossia. Eight subjects noted one or more mechanical limitations which included cuts or discomfort underneath the tongue and difficulties with kissing, licking one’s lips, eating an ice cream cone, keeping one’s tongue clean and performing tongue tricks. In addition, seven subjects noted social effects such as embarrassment and teasing. The authors concluded that this study confirmed anecdotal evidence of mechanical problems associated with ankyloglossia and it suggests that the kinds of mechanical and social problems noted may be more prevalent than previously thought. Furthermore, the authors note that some patients may be unaware of the extent of the limitations they have due to ankyloglossia, since they have never experienced normal tongue range. A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the small sample size that also represented a large age range.|$|E
30|$|The main <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{lie in the}} exiguity of {{the sample}} and in its {{retrospective}} nature.|$|R
30|$|The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> offer {{opportunities}} for improvement. They can be subdivided into two dimensions: methods and interpretations.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> results {{suggested}} that screw loosening increases with increasing abutment angulations and collar lengths after dynamic cyclic loading.|$|R
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the small}} size of the patients.|$|E
30|$|The biggest <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that each}} tooth was not {{assessed}} individually.|$|E
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{was that}} cone-beam {{computed}} tomography {{was not used}} to examine discision and piezocision cuts. Although cone-beam computed tomography is a reliable method in three-dimensional imaging, we did not prefer it to not give the patients extra radiation doses. Another <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was that disc saw may damage alveolar soft tissues, so the operator must consider it.|$|E
30|$|The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include factors {{relating}} to the retrospective nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> Preoperative functional outcome scores were not measured, {{and there was no}} control group.|$|R
30|$|The major <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> are {{the small}} sample size, the lack of inter- and {{intraobserver}} data, {{and the absence of}} patients treated with tendon autografts.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> we {{recommend}} the combined use of zirconia implants, PEEK structures and PMMA coatings {{in patients with}} intolerance to or rejection of metal alloys.|$|R
30|$|The exact {{duration}} of breastfeeding {{and frequency of}} NNS habits were not reported, which is another <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
30|$|The main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the {{retrospective}} design. Furthermore, record {{analysis was performed}} in a single hospital reviewing only clinical charts.|$|E
30|$|The major <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the fact}} that there are many {{determinants}} and confounding variables in problem gambling, other than casino proximity.|$|E
30|$|Despite the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> (low number <b>of</b> patients, {{possible}} {{presence of}} radioactive urine in the bladder and urethra, resolution limitation), {{it was possible}} to make some considerations.|$|R
30|$|<b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include {{imprecision}} in measurements due {{to point}} selection subjectivity, lack of meniscus in {{determination of the}} orientation of the articular surface, and latent registration error.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> judicious use <b>of</b> platform-switched narrow {{implants}} with a {{conical connection}} {{must be considered}} an alternative for wide-diameter implants to restore a posterior edentulous region.|$|R
30|$|The obvious <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the small}} number of {{patients}}. However, this is a complex subset of patients not commonly seen in routine practice.|$|E
30|$|The basic <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> are: first, {{the study}} cannot able {{us to make}} {{generalization}} about the whole youth in Ethiopia. Since the study has collected data from limited households.|$|E
3000|$|One <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that the}} {{registration}} algorithm may not correct {{the change in the}} whole breast volume over time, e.g., due to hormonal fluctuations over the menstrual cycle [...]...|$|E
30|$|The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were; {{it was a}} {{retrospective}} study, and due to vitamin B 12 not routinely checked for patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, there were no preoperative values for comparison.|$|R
30|$|Certain <b>{{limitation}}s</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> must be acknowledged. One {{limitation is}} {{the reliance on}} a subjective self-reporting survey. Therefore, to confirm {{the validity of the}} results, further studies are needed to replicate our findings.|$|R
30|$|One <b>of</b> the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was {{the small}} sample size and gender heterogeneity. For this reason, {{statistical}} evaluation of changes in oseltamivir brain uptake by poly I:C treatment could not be strictly performed.|$|R
30|$|The major <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was the {{relatively}} small sample size and lack of follow-up of patients with dysphagia especially the asymptomatic group {{and the effect of}} different dopaminergic drugs on dysphagia.|$|E
3000|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{seems to}} be the high kidney uptake of the {{investigated}} monomer and dimer. There are numerous examples of variably labeled urea-based molecules with extremely high murine kidney uptake [...]...|$|E
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the absence}} of data on neural growth factor expression. Further {{research}} is needed about the relation and influence of the identified destructive and adaptive nerve changes on fracture healing.|$|E
30|$|The main <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> are {{the small}} sample size and the short follow-up; furthermore, its {{strength}} is blunted by all the implications of its retrospective design and the lack of a control group.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> is a {{retrospective}} study {{in a single}} center using a single ethnic group. Detailed inflammatory clinical phenotypes such as CRP levels or pathological findings could not be gathered.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> {{the results}} {{demonstrated}} a high long-term survival for sinus augmentation procedures and significant improvement <b>of</b> OHRQoL after <b>this</b> procedure. Therefore, sinus augmentation procedures are highly valuable treatment options in implant dentistry.|$|R
