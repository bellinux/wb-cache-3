'I'm {{bringing}} sexy back, yeah! I'm bringing[...] [...]' It's a very physical song, meant to provoke... sexual dance. 'Sex Machine' is the closest reference." [...] Timberlake {{said that the}} lyric, [...] "bringing sexy back", {{was one of the}} first lines he came up with. In addition, he admitted that the song was not going to be titled [...] "SexyBack", saying, [...] "We weren't originally going to call it 'SexyBack'. I definitely didn't think it would become the most worn-out phrase of 2006. It just sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> opening to the song." ...|$|E

But we had a chat and he seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> enough guy. But I never heard back from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the battle}} against Hellbringer a demon {{overloaded}} his neural net with all the repressed guilt from his long career, almost killing him before {{he took out his}} fury on the demon. He also discovered the other Warriors had all known he was being tortured but had deliberately not come to save him, as [...] "Nobody <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy!" [...] - Morrigun even informed him that his innate goodness was against the order of things and this was why bad things happened to him.|$|R
60|$|The {{three of}} 'em came round next evening to see it, and they {{was so afraid}} of its being lost that when they stood me a pint at the Bull's Head we 'ad to take it with us. Ginger was {{going to buy a}} sausage-roll for it, but, arter Sam 'ad pointed out that they was paying me fourpence a day for its keep, he didn't. And Sam 'ad the cheek to tell me that it <b>liked</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bit o' fried steak as well as anything.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2005, Bon Jovi {{released}} the album Have <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Day. The album cover contains a red smiley face which guitarist Richie Sambora stated echoes its title song. Sambora explained that [...] "It's <b>like</b> 'Have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day; {{get out of}} my face'—therefore the smirk. To me, it's much more of a Clint Eastwood 'Have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day' than <b>a</b> smiley face 'Have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "This {{debut album}} from singer {{songwriter}} Brendan James is not exception {{with a very}} well written and beautiful album.

6000|$|... "And after all," [...] he said, {{speaking}} for the whole company in the generous, comprehensive way enthusiasts have, [...] "what more do we want in weather <b>like</b> this? <b>A</b> <b>nice,</b> light, cold, dinner is ever so much better for us {{than a lot of}} hot things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I <b>like</b> is <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> prim little woman, {{who never}} had a pin {{in the wrong place}} in her life. Her cuffs and collars are always as stiff as steel, and she never rubs the sleeves of her dresses by leaning about, like some young ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean any}} harm, Mr. Ranger; we hobos {{have a whole}} lot of time to gossip, and I'm old enough to <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> girl in a fatherly way. I reckon the whole valley rides in to see her, just the way you do." ...|$|E

60|$|So, when I {{once asked}} Dora, {{with an eye}} to the cookery-book, what she would do, if we were married, and I were to say I should <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> Irish stew, she replied that she would tell the servant to make it; and then clapped her little hands {{together}} across my arm, and laughed in such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will, dear; I'm {{lying in}} wait for all three boys today, like an old spider; and I will have a good talk with each. They know I {{understand}} them, and they always open their hearts sooner or later. You look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> plump little Quakeress, Meg; {{and no one will}} believe that big boy is your son,' added Mrs Jo, as Demi came in shining with Sunday neatness, from his well-blacked boots to his smooth brown head.|$|E
5000|$|The ideal Mini Lop is {{described}} as being a [...] "basketball with <b>a</b> head". Judges <b>like</b> to see <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> rounded body with thick depth, long thick ears, a wide head and thick bone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> remedy, anyhow," [...] shuddered Cecily. [...] "I'd {{rather have}} the warts. But do you know, I believe if you didn't cry so much over every little thing, you'd be ever {{so much better}} looking. Crying spoils your eyes and makes {{the end of your}} nose red." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is not right, I suppose, to {{wish to be}} {{anything}} but what we are,' said Jane, rather puzzled by the appeal; 'and perhaps that poor beggar-boy would only <b>like</b> to have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> room, and kind mother and sister, like you, Alfred.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take your time, Mr. Platt," [...] said Zizzbaum. [...] "Think it over to-night. You won't find {{anybody else}} meet our prices on goods like these. I'm afraid you're having a dull time in New York, Mr. Platt. A young man like you--of course, {{you miss the}} society of the ladies.

6000|$|... "Amanda! I'll {{never do}} it again, never to any one, so long as I live. It's dead, same as the card tricks. Forgive me, Amanda, and marry me. I'm so fond of you, and I'm so lonely, and those meadow lots of mine, they'll make me rich. Amanda, would you marry me? Would you love an old duffer like me? Would you <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little home, and an {{occasional}} silk dress, and no more teaching, and some one to love you--always? Would you, Amanda, would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be flippant, Bayliss," [...] he protested. [...] "Try to cure {{yourself}} of this passion for being funny {{at the wrong}} time. Your comedy is good, but tact is a finer quality than humour. Perhaps you think I have forgotten that morning when I was feeling just as I do to-day and you came to my bedside {{and asked me if}} I would <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> rasher of ham. I haven't and I never shall. You may bring me a brandy-and-soda. Not a large one. A couple of bath-tubs full will be enough." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Polly Neefit was {{not subject}} to this idolatry.

6000|$|... "Wouldn't you young gentlemen <b>like</b> to take <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ride this afternoon?" [...] he asked, in a business-like tone.

[...] And {{he held up a}} handful of tickets.|$|R
