5|$|It {{must have}} enough <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> to carry three people {{and all their}} {{scientific}} equipment, advanced cameras for aerial photography, provisions for four months, and ballast, altogether about 3000kilograms (about 3.5short tons).|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
25|$|Financed by his shows, Cody {{significantly}} developed Lawrence Hargrave's double-cell box kite {{to increase}} its <b>lifting</b> <b>power,</b> especially by adding wings on either side. He also developed a sophisticated system of flying multiple kites up a single line, which was capable of ascending to many thousands of feet or of carrying several men in a gondola. He patented his design in 1901, and it {{became known as the}} Cody kite.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Makai Ocean Engineering was {{contracted}} to construct computer models {{to evaluate whether}} a Mist <b>lift</b> <b>power</b> generation plant would be competitive with the dominant OTEC approaches being pursued by researchers. The study estimated that a Mist <b>lift</b> <b>power</b> generation plant could be 17% to 37% cheaper than a closed cycle plant. [...] In submerged mist flow plants, close to 40% of the cost is devoted to creating a strong enough pressure vessel.|$|R
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere, and has approximately 60% of the <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> of hydrogen or helium. Ammonia {{has sometimes been}} used to fill weather balloons as a lifting gas. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ice on {{aircraft}} are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are {{an increase in}} stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form {{on the leading edge}} of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a genetically}} {{enhanced}} human being gives the Agent various skills namely Strength (punching and <b>lifting</b> <b>power),</b> Agility (jumping and movement speed), Driving (handling vehicles), Explosives (the use of grenades and rocket launchers), Firearms (shooting ability). These {{skills can be}} upgraded by collecting specific orbs and killing enemies. Upgrading strength and agility increases the Agent's physicality, while upgrading Driving, Explosives and Weapons gives unlocks new vehicles and weapons. The Agent is also covered in a high-tech armor with a rechargeable shield that protects him from melee attacks, firearms and explosions. The armor also evolves as the Agent upgrade his skills, becoming more thicker and bulkier. Crackdown 2 improved upon this gameplay by allowing the player to unlock new armor abilities as they upgrade their armor, such as a ground and pound ability that causes powerful shockwaves, a charge ability, and a wingsuit and thrusters that gives the Agent the ability to fly. The player can also play various minigames such as on-foot and vehicle racing as well as street and aerial stunts.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum airship, {{also known}} as a vacuum balloon, is a {{hypothetical}} airship that is evacuated rather than filled with a lighter-than-air gas such as hydrogen or helium. First proposed by Italian Jesuit priest Francesco Lana de Terzi in 1670, the vacuum balloon would be the ultimate expression of displacement <b>lift</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Picoo Z {{features}} a self-stabilized main rotor with a weighted airfoil-type stabilizer bar that removes {{the need for}} corrective pilot input to achieve stable flight. Because of this full-cyclic-authority stabilizer design, merely applying enough <b>lift</b> <b>power</b> to cancel gravity allows the Picoo Z to hover almost immediately making it very simplistic for a beginner.|$|R

50|$|Appendages {{of aquatic}} organisms propel them in two main and biomechanically extreme mechanisms. Some use <b>lift</b> <b>powered</b> swimming, {{which can be}} {{compared}} to flying as appendages flap like wings, and reduce drag {{on the surface of the}} appendage.

5000|$|Further {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} {{despite the fact that}} the <b>lift's</b> <b>power</b> had been cut and the brakes were on, the four ton box was quite merrily making its way between floors, just as it did before the hotel was closed. [...] "That made the men really jittery!" [...] added Mr Smith. A more prosaic explanation than supernatural intervention is that the lift had an auxiliary (or 'back up') power supply.|$|R

60|$|It is {{a mistake}} to suppose that when a gale has ceased, all danger to man and {{destruction}} to his property is over. We are apt to attribute too much influence to the winds. Undoubtedly they are the origin of the evil that befalls us in storms, but they are not the immediate cause of the wholesale destruction that takes place annually among the shipping of the kingdom. It is the mighty hydraulic force of the sea,-- the tremendous <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> of the waves, that does it all.|$|E
60|$|But we {{are told}} to wait a bit; the Socialist Party in Germany is only three millions. How many will there be in ten years' time? That is a fair argument. I should like to say this. A great many men can jump four feet, but very few can jump six feet. After a certain {{distance}} the difficulty increases progressively. It is so with the horse-power required to drive great ships across the ocean; it is so with the <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> required to raise balloons in the air. A balloon goes up quite easily for a certain distance, but after a certain distance it refuses to go up any farther, because the air is too rarefied to float it and sustain it. And, therefore, I would say let us examine the concrete facts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{different}} parameters like size of actuator and rail, current density, no of turns of coil, permeability of magnetic material, winding dimension etc. has been studied. An FEM analysis of U-I structure of rail (guide-way) and actuator for electromagnetic levitation system has been performed by the utilizing of the ANSYS software. The design of electromagnets is primarily controlled by the input <b>power</b> to <b>lift</b> <b>power</b> ratio and <b>lift</b> <b>power</b> magnet weight ratio. These factors are dependent on the magnet dimensions, required gap flux and hence the required current density in the winding. The magnet configurations chosen {{on the basis of}} required pole-face area and necessary window area to house the excitation coils. In this work a FEM based analysis has done to find out the flux pattern, working flux density, field intensity, force etc. for single actuator based levitation system. The changing of different parameters of rail and actuator the flux pattern, working flux density, field intensity and force will change.

50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{was added}} to the engine to <b>lift</b> <b>power</b> from 100 kW to 193 kW. The body was made from fibreglass, with carbon fibre panels and numerous air scoops leading to the engine bay. The front took style cues from Toyota's Formula 1 car, having a pointed nose and a front wing close to the ground with Formula 1 style wing-lets in front of semi-exposed tyres. The rear mirror was replaced with a camera.|$|R
60|$|I now {{began to}} try to reach the screw in my {{knapsack}} {{in order to reduce the}} force of the negative gravity; but, do what I would, I could not get my hand to it. The machine in the knapsack had been placed so as to support me in a well-balanced and comfortable way; and in doing this it had been impossible to set the screw so that I could reach it. But in a temporary arrangement of the kind this had not been considered necessary, as my wife always turned the screw for me until sufficient <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> had been attained. I had intended, as I have said before, to construct a negative-gravity waistcoat, in which the screw should be in front, and entirely under the wearer's control; but this was a thing of the future.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was well}} known to Mr Rudyerd, however, {{that it was not}} {{possible}} to fit his timbers so perfectly to the rock and to each other as to exclude water altogether; and that if the water should manage to find entrance, it would exert a tremendous <b>lifting</b> <b>power,</b> which, coupled with the weight of the falling billows, would be apt to sweep his foundation away. He resolved, therefore, to counteract this by means of weight; and, in order to do this, he next piled five courses of Cornish moor-stone above the timber courses. The stones were huge blocks, which, when laid and fastened in one solid stratum, weighed 120 tons. They were not laid in cement; but each block was fastened to its fellow by joints and similar to the first. The whole of this fabric was built round a strong central mast or pole, which rose from the rock. The two timber courses above described terminated the [...] "solid" [...] part of the lighthouse. It rose to the height of about fourteen feet from the rock, at the centre of the building.|$|E
60|$|Caswall {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that there had been some sort of dual action of his mind, which might lead to some catastrophe or some discovery of his secret plans; so he resolved to forgo for a while the pleasure of making discoveries regarding the chest. To this end, he applied himself to quite another matter--an investigation of the other treasures and rare objects in his collections. He went amongst them in simple, idle curiosity, his main object being to discover some strange item which he might use for experiment with the kite. He had already resolved to try some runners other than those made of paper. He had a vague idea that with such a force as the great kite straining at its leash, this might be used to lift to the altitude of the kite itself heavier articles. His first experiment with articles of little but increasing weight was eminently successful. So he added by degrees more and more weight, until he found out that the <b>lifting</b> <b>power</b> of the kite was considerable. He then determined to take a step further, and send to the kite some of the articles which lay in the steel-hooped chest. The last time he had opened it in sleep, it had not been shut again, and he had inserted a wedge so that he could open it at will. He made examination of the contents, but came to {{the conclusion}} that the glass objects were unsuitable. They were too light for testing weight, and they were so frail as to be dangerous to send to such a height.|$|E

50|$|Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as airplanes, {{must find}} some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a {{reaction}} occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards.

There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust: aerodynamic <b>lift,</b> and <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> in the form of engine thrust.|$|R
