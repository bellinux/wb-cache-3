40|$|Loran is a radio-based {{navigation}} system originally designed for naval applications. We show that Loran-C’s high-power and high repeatable accuracy are fantastic for security applications. First, we show how to derive a precise location tag—with a sensitivity of about 20 meters—that {{is difficult to}} project to an exact location. A device can use our <b>location</b> <b>tag</b> to block or allow certain actions, without knowing its precise location. To ensure that our tag is reproducible we make use of fuzzy extractors, a mechanism originally designed for biometric authentication. We build a fuzzy extractor specifically designed for radio-type errors and give experimental evidence to show its effectiveness. Second, we show that our <b>location</b> <b>tag</b> is difficult to predict from a distance. For example, an observer cannot predict the <b>location</b> <b>tag</b> inside a guarded data center from a few hundreds of meters away. As an application, consider a location-aware disk drive that will only work inside the data center. An attacker who steals the device and is capable of spoofing Loran-C signals, still cannot make the device work since {{he does not know}} what <b>location</b> <b>tag</b> to spoof.

40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>tagging,</b> {{also known}} as {{geotagging}} or geolocation, {{is the process of}} assigning geographical coordinates to input data. In this paper we present an algorithm for <b>location</b> <b>tagging</b> of textual documents. Our approach makes use of previous work in natural language processing by using a state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagger and named entity recognizer to find blocks of text which may refer to locations. A knowledge base (OpenStreatMap) is then used to find a list of possible locations for each block. Finally, one location is chosen for each block by assigning distance-based scores to each location and repeatedly selecting the location and block with the best score. We tested our geolocation algorithm with Wikipedia articles about topics with a well-defined geographical location that are geotagged by the articles' authors, where classification approaches have achieved median errors as low as 11 km, with attainable accuracy limited by the class size. Our approach achieved a 10 th percentile error of 490 metres and median error of 54 kilometres on the Wikipedia dataset we used. When considering the five <b>location</b> <b>tags</b> with the greatest scores, 50 % of articles were assigned at least one tag within 8. 5 kilometres of the article's author-assigned true location. We also tested our approach on Twitter messages that are <b>tagged</b> with the <b>location</b> from which the message was sent. Twitter texts are challenging because they are short and unstructured and often do not contain words referring to the location they were sent from, but we obtain potentially useful results. We explain how we use the Spark framework for data analytics to collect and process our test data. In general, classification-based approaches for <b>location</b> <b>tagging</b> may be reaching their upper accuracy limit, but our precision-focused approach has high accuracy for some texts and shows significant potential for improvement overall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{location}} proximity test service allows mobile users {{to determine whether}} they are in close proximity to each other, and has found numerous applications in mobile social networks. Unfortunately, existing solutions usually reveal much of users ’ private location information during a proximity test. They are also vulnerable to location cheating where an attacker reports false locations to gain an advantage. Moreover, the initial trust establishment among unfamiliar users in large scale mobile social networks has been a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enables a user to perform (1) a location based handshake that establishes secure communications among strangers, who do not have a pre-shared secret, and (2) a privacy-preserving proximity test without revealing the user’s actual location to the server or other users not within the proximity. The proposed scheme is based on a novel concept, i. e., spatial-temporal location tags, and we put forward a <b>location</b> <b>tag</b> construction method using environmental signals that provides an unforgeable location proof. We use Bloom filters to efficiently represent users ’ location tags and vicinity regions. We exploit fuzzy extractor, a lightweight cryptographic primitive, to extract shared secrets between matching location tags. We conduct extensive analysis, simulation, and real experiments to demonstrate the feasibility, security, and efficiency of our scheme.

A {{protocol}} for private proximity testing allows two mobile users communicating through an untrusted third party {{to test whether}} they are in close physical proximity without revealing any additional information about their locations.

Due {{to the need to}} perform privacy-preserving threshold set intersection, their scheme was not very efficient. We provably reduce threshold set intersection on location tags to equality testing using a de-duplication technique known as shingling. Due to the simplicity of private equality testing, our resulting scheme for location tag-based private proximity testing is several orders of magnitude more efficient than previous solutions.
