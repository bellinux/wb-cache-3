5|$|World of Motion was an {{attraction}} that {{was located in}} the current building of Test Track and was sponsored by General Motors. When the sponsorship expired, GM {{was in the process}} of conducting <b>lay-offs</b> and cutbacks forcing the company to question whether or not to sign another sponsorship agreement. Upon deciding to sign another agreement, GM wanted Disney to construct a new ride (in the location of World of Motion) that focused specifically around their automobiles, rather than the fanciful history of transportation from the pre-historic (animal transportation) to modern age (automobiles, planes, etc.) previously housed in the space. In 1976, Disney Imagineers had visited the Milford Proving Ground (owned by General Motors) and later made a second trip to the facility and worked with GM to create Test Track. After numerous problems encountered during the construction of the ride, Test Track soft-opened on December 19, 1998 but didn't officially open until March 17, 1999, nearly 2 years after the original scheduled opening date.|$|E

As of this writing, we are still looking at a <b>lay-off</b> date of February 26, 2000. This date is a worst case scenario date. Employees will work through Friday, February 25, 2000, or Saturday, February 26, 2000, depending upon their regular work schedule. Please note: If additional funds become available to __________________ _ in the near future, staff level <b>lay-off</b> numbers and/or the <b>lay-off</b> date could change. What will happen to employees slated for <b>lay-off?</b> Affected employees will continue to be employed and paid until the <b>lay-off</b> target date of February 26, 2000, unless that employee gives notice prior to that date. When will I receive my official <b>lay-off</b> notice? Based on a <b>lay-off</b> date of February 26, 2000, you should receive your <b>lay-off</b> notice by December 27, 1999.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of <b>lay-off</b> risks on wages. Portfolio as well as search theoretic {{modelling}} predicts higher exogenous <b>lay-off</b> risks to go along with higher wages. But, an impact of wages on <b>lay-off</b> risks (e. g., endogenous job destruction) is also plausible. Using the German BA Employment Panel (2008), we estimate a wage equation with exogenous <b>lay-off</b> risks for the most important industries in West Germany. We address the mutual causality by controlling for endogeneity via an instrumental variable approach. Furthermore, we restrict our analysis to the high skilled to avoid a high impact on tariff commitment. Our findings suggest the presence of risk premiums in three of five industries. The level of impact and its significance depends on the industry and on the gender of the employee...|$|R

25|$|The Stock Market {{crash in}} New York led people to hoard their money; as {{consumption}} fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic {{links between the}} two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of Ontario and Quebec, whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive <b>lay-offs</b> occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not as sharp as that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world.|$|E
25|$|During its {{original}} release in January 1959, Sleeping Beauty grossed approximately $5.3 million in theater rentals (the distributor's {{share of the}} box office gross). Sleeping Beauty's production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features: Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp. The high production costs of Sleeping Beauty, coupled with the underperformance {{of much of the}} rest of Disney's 1959–1960 release slate, resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and there were massive <b>lay-offs</b> throughout the animation department.|$|E

25|$|The District {{had been}} battling its staff {{annually}} over summer <b>lay-offs</b> and this, {{coupled with the}} pay equity concept in vogue at the time (“Comparable Worth”) came to a boil when their contract expired in summer, ’81. Right {{in the middle of}} the strike was held election for three School Board members. As well as walking picket lines daily, members endorsed incumbent Joe Canciamilla (now a member of the State Assembly) and newcomer Dana Hunt (a county sheriff and union member). Their election was pivotal in settling a strike that gained a contract with wage increases that exceeded the CoLA, redressed imbalances in the male-female hourly rate inequities and provided lay-off protections for summer workers.|$|E
25|$|Falling ore prices {{caused the}} company's first post-war deficit in 1976, of NOK214.7million. In wait for better times, {{production}} was continued and the pellets stored for later export. The company {{invested in a}} HP 3000 minicomputer in 1977 and the following year transferred its public utility services to the municipality. The company transferred its residential real estate to a housing cooperative. A mining strike in Canada caused increased demand {{and part of the}} surplus was sold in 1978. <b>Lay-offs</b> were avoided, but some employees took out early retirement and there was a recruitment stop. From 1981 the company received a NOK50-million subsidy over the state budget, which increased to the double from the next year.|$|E
25|$|Fred. Olsen leased their Viscounts to Austrian Airlines {{when it was}} {{established}} in 1958. The wet leases ended in April 1960, when Austrian received its own Viscounts. The charter market for the size of aircraft was limited and they were sold to Indian Airlines in January 1962. This was a significant downsizing in the airline, resulting {{in a series of}} <b>lay-offs.</b> FOAM was liquidated in 1962, with some employees being transferred to FOF and a large number going to Kenya, where {{there was a lot of}} need for aviation personnel because of the Shifta War. The last C-47 was sold in 1961. Heavy maintenance was thereafter subcontracted to SAS for the Curtisses.|$|E

40|$|A wide {{class of}} models with On-the-Job Search (OJS) predicts that workers {{gradually}} select into better-paying jobs, until <b>lay-off</b> occurs, when this selection process starts over from scratch. We develop a simple methodology to test these predictions. Our inference uses two sources of identification {{to distinguish between}} returns to experience and the gains from OJS: (i) time-variation in job-finding rates and (ii) the time since the last <b>lay-off.</b> Conditional on the termination date of the job, job duration should be distributed uniformly. Using extreme value theory, we can infer {{the shape of the}} wage-offer distribution from the effect of the time since the last <b>lay-off</b> on wages. This methodology is applied to the NLSY 79. We find remarkably strong support for all implications. The offer distribution is Gumbel, which has an unbounded support, which is inconsistent with pure sorting models. The standard deviation of wage offers is 7 to 15 % (depending on educational level and urbanisation). OJS accounts for 30 % of the experience profile and 9 % of total wage dispersion. The average wage loss after <b>lay-off</b> is 11 %...|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{immediate}} efforts of the Aquino administration was directed in reforming {{the image of the}} country and paying off all debts, including those that some governments were ready to write-off, as possible. This resulted in budget cuts and further aggravated the plight of the lower class because the jobs offered to them by the government was now gone. Infrastructure projects, including repairs, were halted in secluded provinces turning concrete roads into asphalt. Privatization of many government corporations, most catering utilities, was the priority of the Aquino administration which led to massive <b>lay-offs</b> and inflation. The Aquino administration was persistent in its belief that the problems that arose from the removal of the previous administration can be solved by the decentralization of power.|$|E
25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change to the {{corporate}} culture. While ND previously had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round of layoffs was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of <b>lay-offs</b> took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced to call back to the office to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E
