50|$|<b>Linear</b> low-density <b>polyethylene</b> (LLDPE) is a {{substantially}} <b>linear</b> polymer (<b>polyethylene),</b> with {{significant numbers of}} short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with longer-chain olefins. <b>Linear</b> low-density <b>polyethylene</b> differs structurally from conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) because {{of the absence of}} long chain branching. The linearity of LLDPE results from the different manufacturing processes of LLDPE and LDPE. In general, LLDPE is produced at lower temperatures and pressures by copolymerization of ethylene and such higher alpha-olefins as butene, hexene, or octene. The copolymerization process produces an LLDPE polymer that has a narrower molecular weight distribution than conventional LDPE and in combination with the linear structure, significantly different rheological properties.|$|R

5000|$|Polymers {{which are}} {{branched}} but not crosslinked are generally thermoplastic. Branching sometimes occurs spontaneously during synthesis of polymers; e.g., by free-radical polymerization of ethylene to form polyethylene. In fact, preventing branching to produce <b>linear</b> <b>polyethylene</b> requires special methods. Because {{of the way}} polyamides are formed, nylon {{would seem to be}} limited to unbranched, straight chains. But [...] "star" [...] branched nylon can be produced by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with polyamines having three or more amino groups. Branching also occurs naturally during enzymatically-catalyzed polymerization of glucose to form polysaccharides such as glycogen (animals), and amylopectin, a form of starch (plants). The unbranched form of starch is called amylose.|$|E
50|$|Polymers are {{composed}} of long molecular chains which form irregular, entangled coils in the melt. Some polymers retain such a disordered structure upon freezing and thus convert into amorphous solids. In other polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions with a typical size of the order 1 micrometer. Although it would be energetically favorable for the polymer chains to align parallel, such alignment is hindered by the entanglement. Therefore, within the ordered regions, the polymer chains are both aligned and folded. Those regions are therefore neither crystalline nor amorphous and are classified as semicrystalline. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are <b>linear</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or isotactic polypropylene (PP).|$|E
50|$|Polymers {{can also}} be {{crystallized}} from a solution or upon evaporation of a solvent. This process depends {{on the degree of}} dilution: in dilute solutions, the molecular chains have no connection with each other and exist as a separate polymer coils in the solution. Increase in concentration which can occur via solvent evaporation, induces interaction between molecular chains and a possible crystallization as in the crystallization from the melt. Crystallization from solution may result in the highest degree of polymer crystallinity. For example, highly <b>linear</b> <b>polyethylene</b> can form platelet-like single crystals with a thickness on the order 10-20 nm when crystallized from a dilute solution. The crystal shape can be more complex for other polymers, including hollow pyramids, spirals and multilayer dendritic structures.|$|E

50|$|For the NAA {{procedure}} to be successful, the specimen or sample must be selected carefully. In many cases small objects can be irradiated and analysed intact {{without the need}} of sampling. But, more commonly, a small sample is taken, usually by drilling in an inconspicuous place. About 50 mg (one-twentieth of a gram) is a sufficient sample, so damage to the object is minimised. It is often good practice to remove two samples using two different drill bits made of different materials. This will reveal any contamination of the sample from the drill bit material itself. The sample is then encapsulated in a vial made of either high purity <b>linear</b> <b>polyethylene</b> or quartz. These sample vials come in many shapes and sizes to accommodate many specimen types. The sample and a standard are then packaged and irradiated in a suitable reactor at a constant, known neutron flux. A typical reactor used for activation uses uranium fission, providing a high neutron flux and the highest available sensitivities for most elements. The neutron flux from such a reactor is {{in the order of}} 1012 neutrons cm−2 s−1. The type of neutrons generated are of relatively low kinetic energy (KE), typically less than 0.5 eV. These neutrons are termed thermal neutrons. Upon irradiation, a thermal neutron interacts with the target nucleus via a non-elastic collision, causing neutron capture. This collision forms a compound nucleus which is in an excited state. The excitation energy within the compound nucleus is formed from the binding energy of the thermal neutron with the target nucleus. This excited state is unfavourable and the compound nucleus will almost instantaneously de-excite (transmutate) into a more stable configuration through the emission of a prompt particle and one or more characteristic prompt gamma photons. In most cases, this more stable configuration yields a radioactive nucleus. The newly formed radioactive nucleus now decays by the emission of both particles and one or more characteristic delayed gamma photons. This decay process is at a much slower rate than the initial de-excitation and is dependent on the unique half-life of the radioactive nucleus. These unique half-lives are dependent upon the particular radioactive species and can range from fractions of a second to several years. Once irradiated, the sample is left for a specific decay period, then placed into a detector, which will measure the nuclear decay according to either the emitted particles, or more commonly, the emitted gamma rays.|$|E

The emphasis in the analysis of the results is placed on blends containing mLLDPE to address the lack of CL information on these blends. The CL data are consistent with the thermal and physicomechanical properties of the blends, with a decreased blend miscibility being reflected in the CL data as a departure from the idealized behavior observed for more miscible blends. Furthermore, the results suggest that immiscibility in the solid state is reflected to some extent in the behavior of the melt. Preliminary experiments conducted to determine the level of consistency of CL results with respect to both variability between instruments and variability between techniques indicate a high degree of correlation in each case. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>linear</b> polymers, linear-low-density <b>polyethylenes</b> (with more than similar to 10 branches per 1000 C atoms) crystallizing from linear nuclei to form row structures do not crystallize uniformly. Instead {{they pass through}} a series of morphological changes, accompanied by a continuously declining growth rate, because of the accumulation of more branched molecular sequences segregated at the growth front and the consequent progressive decrease in isothermal superfooling. Different concentrations of segregants, reflecting the different interfacial geometries, give spherulites-with their more open construction-a faster growth rate than rows and render the rows more susceptible to morphological instability. Nevertheless, cellulation does occur in spherulites of a metallocene polymer with 28 ethyl branches per 1000 C atoms. Systematic differences in morphology and relative growth rate between metallocene and Ziegler-Natta-catalyzed polymers are attributed to less mobile segregants for the former.
