[...] He did grant, however, that [...] "Soul Singing" [...] and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] were written with Hudson in mind, and explained that the album's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own. [...] Producer Don Was said of Chris, [...] "I realized he was taking on something that was significant. [...] He was writing about becoming a man...

[...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot.

2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers to mix and match them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. I wanted something with more flair and elegance. I remember looking at a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Takiff from The Philadelphia Inquirer {{praised the}} album for being [...] "serious and reflective, at times heavily laden with psychic trauma.

Sal Cinquemani, from Slant Magazine, described the album as [...] "a collection of pop confections layered with live instrumentation, sophisticated arrangements, deeply felt lyrics, and a stronger, more assured vocal." [...] The review concluded by declaring Like a Prayer [...] "one of the quintessential pop albums of all time. Barry Walters from the San Francisco Examiner, named the album [...] "'s best and most consistent collection yet [...] the album [...] crosses the line between craft and inspiration. From the start, she's had an intuitive grasp of how {{to put on a}} good show. Now she's got the guts to show us what's inside". Senior editor from The Cavalier Daily Chaz Repak, praised Madonna's [...] "improved" [...] songwriting; [...] "her religious faith and her marriage to Sean Penn, are completely well written", however, he ended his review on a more critical note by saying: [...] "Like a Prayer constitutes Madonna's best work to date. But after such work as [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart", that's not saying much." [...] Negative criticism came from [...] Spin magazine. Reviewer Christian Logan wrote: [...] "On Like a Prayer your relationship to Madonna changes from to song to song, and it makes you uncomfortable. It's like sitting on a table with a friend who's telling too much about herself to people she doesn't know". Joe Levy, from the same magazine, was also critical, writing that [...] "there's not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> Madonna, nothing of the generation of women who grew up in her wake: Regina, Debbie Gibson, and Taylor Dayne", but highlighted [...] "Keep It Together" [...] as [...] "the only great dance song on the record".
