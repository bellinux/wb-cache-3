5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new <b>laryngoscope</b> blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a <b>laryngoscope</b> he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill <b>laryngoscope</b> blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved <b>laryngoscope</b> blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used <b>laryngoscope</b> blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with <b>laryngoscope</b> blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video <b>laryngoscope.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved <b>laryngoscope</b> blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved <b>laryngoscope</b> blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh <b>laryngoscope</b> blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Several {{indirect}} <b>laryngoscopes</b> {{have recently}} been developed, but relatively few have been formally compared. In this study we evaluated the efficacy and the usability of the Macintosh, the Glidescope, the McGrath and the Airtraq <b>laryngoscopes.</b> Sixty anaesthesia providers (20 staff, 20 residents, and 20 nurses) were enrolled into this study. The volunteers intubated the trachea of a Laerdal SimMan manikin in three simulated difficult airway scenarios. In all scenarios, indirect <b>laryngoscopes</b> provided better laryngeal exposure than the Macintosh blade and appeared to produce less dental trauma. In the most difficult scenario (tongue oedema), the Macintosh blade {{was associated with a}} high rate of failure and prolonged intubation times whereas indirect <b>laryngoscopes</b> improved intubation time and rarely failed. Indirect <b>laryngoscopes</b> were judged easier to use than the Macintosh. Differences existed between indirect devices. The Airtraq consistently provided the most rapid intubation. Laryngeal grade views were superior with the Airtraq and McGrath than with the Glidescope...|$|R
50|$|Indirect {{laryngoscopy}} {{is performed}} whenever the provider visualizes the patient's vocal cords by a means other than obtaining {{a direct line}} of sight. For the purpose of intubation, this is facilitated by fiberoptic bronchoscopes, video <b>laryngoscopes,</b> fiberoptic stylets and mirror or prism optically-enhanced <b>laryngoscopes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>laryngoscopes</b> used a {{straight}} [...] "Magill Blade", and this design {{is still the}} standard pattern veterinary <b>laryngoscopes</b> are based upon; however the blade is difficult to control in adult humans and can cause pressure on the vagus nerve, which can cause unexpected cardiac arrhythmias to spontaneously occur in adults.|$|R
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional <b>laryngoscope</b> consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E

5000|$|Reinke's edema {{is often}} {{diagnosed}} by an Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT) specialist or an Otolaryngologist by {{examination of the}} vocal cords. First, the doctor will review the patient's medical history and symptoms, such as hoarseness, dysphonia, and reduced vocal range. There is no familial or hereditary link to Reinke's edema. Because Reinke's edema is linked heavily to smoking, the doctor will {{need to know if}} the patient is a habitual smoker. Once the patient's history is reviewed, the vocal cords will be visualized using laryngoscopy, a technique in which a tube with a camera (endoscope) is passed through the nose and down the larynx. [...] <b>Laryngoscopes</b> can be rigid or flexible. Flexible <b>laryngoscopes,</b> such as fiber <b>laryngoscopes,</b> allow the patient to produce sound as the tube is placed, and therefore allows the doctor to visualize movement of the vocal cord.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several {{video and}} optical <b>laryngoscopes</b> have been {{developed}} but few have been compared {{in terms of their}} learning curves and efficacy. Using a manikin with normal airways we compared the Glidescope, the McGrath, the Airtraq and the Macintosh <b>laryngoscopes.</b> METHODS: Sixty anaesthetists (20 staff, 20 residents and 20 nurses) participated in the study. All subjects were novice with the new devices. They intubated a Laerdal SimMan manikin (with normal airway) five times in a row with all <b>laryngoscopes.</b> The sequence of use of the devices was randomized. Before using a device, a presentation and a demonstration were provided. Outcome measures were: duration of intubation attempt, modified Cormack grades, dental trauma and difficulty of use. RESULTS: The Airtraq had the most favourable learning curve and mirrored the Macintosh after two intubation attempts. The Glidescope and McGrath had steep learning curves but, after five attempts, differences persisted when compared with the Macintosh and Airtraq. Time taken to visualize the glottis was similar but time taken to position the endotracheal tube was shorter for the Airtraq when compared with the Glidescope and McGrath. Indirect <b>laryngoscopes</b> seemed to have advantages over the Macintosh blade in terms of laryngeal exposure and potential dental trauma. CONCLUSIONS: In a 'normal airway' model, intubation skills with the new devices appeared to be rapidly mastered. The three indirect <b>laryngoscopes</b> provided a better glottic exposure than the Macintosh. The Airtraq displayed the most favourable learning curve, probably reflecting differences in the techniques of endotracheal tube placement: guiding channel versus steering technique...|$|R
25|$|Also in 1913, Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) {{published}} results he {{had achieved}} using a <b>laryngoscope</b> {{he had recently}} developed. An American anesthesiologist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Janeway was {{of the opinion that}} direct intratracheal insufflation of volatile anesthetics would provide improved conditions for otolaryngologic surgery. With this in mind, he developed a <b>laryngoscope</b> designed {{for the sole purpose of}} tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of batteries within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.|$|E
25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved <b>laryngoscope</b> blade in 1943. The Macintosh blade remains {{to this day}} {{the most widely used}} <b>laryngoscope</b> blade for orotracheal intubation. In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.|$|E

30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at a major academic referral center with a 20 -plus bed medical ICU, which is staffed by two teaching teams. This ICU service is affiliated with ACGME-accredited 3 -year pulmonary/critical care medicine (Pulm/CCM) and 2 -year critical care medicine (CCM) fellowship programs {{with a total of}} 16 fellows. Each teaching team is staffed with an attending (Pulm/CCM or CCM), a fellow (postgraduate year (PGY) 4 to 6), and resident (internal medicine PGY 1 to 3 and emergency medicine PGY 2) physicians. Occasionally, fellows from anesthesiology or surgical critical care fellowships rotate through the medical ICU service. All intubations are performed under attending supervision. For the duration of the study period, direct <b>laryngoscopes</b> were available in all sizes of Macintosh and Miller blades. Video <b>laryngoscopes</b> were available throughout the entire study period and are the preferred device used in the medical ICU. The following video <b>laryngoscopes</b> were available during the study period: GlideScope (GVL) (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA) with both reusable and disposable blade configurations in sizes 3 and 4, and the C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) with Macintosh-type blade sizes 3 and 4. In addition to direct and video <b>laryngoscopes,</b> flexible fiber-optic bronchoscopes are available and occasionally chosen as the initial device for suspected anatomically difficult airways.|$|R

50|$|Besides the {{conventional}} <b>laryngoscopes,</b> many other devices {{have been developed}} as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. These include a number of indirect fiberoptic viewing <b>laryngoscopes</b> such as the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or rhinoscope {{can be used for}} office-based diagnostics or for tracheal intubation. The patient can remain conscious during the procedure, so that the vocal folds can be observed during phonation. Surgical instruments passed through the scope can be used for performing procedures such as biopsies of suspicious masses. These instruments have become indispensable within the otolaryngology, pulmonology and anesthesia communities.|$|R
25|$|After World War I, further {{advances}} {{were made}} in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986). Working at the Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries in Sidcup with plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gillies (1882–1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation. Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation {{in a manner that is}} little changed from Magill's original technique. Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill <b>laryngoscope</b> blade, as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.|$|E
25|$|Until 1913, {{oral and}} maxillofacial surgery was {{performed}} by mask inhalation anesthesia, topical application of local anesthetics to the mucosa, rectal anesthesia, or intravenous anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients {{to the risk of}} pulmonary aspiration of blood and mucus into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new <b>laryngoscope</b> blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein. This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.|$|E
500|$|Because {{it is an}} {{invasive}} {{and uncomfortable}} medical procedure, intubation is usually performed after administration of general anesthesia and a neuromuscular-blocking drug. It can however be performed in the awake patient with local or topical anesthesia or in an emergency without any anesthesia at all. Intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional <b>laryngoscope,</b> flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, or video <b>laryngoscope</b> to identify the vocal cords and pass the tube between them into the trachea instead of into the esophagus. [...] Other devices and techniques may be used alternatively.|$|E

500|$|Fiberoptic layngoscopes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} available since the 1990s. In contrast to the conventional <b>laryngoscope,</b> these devices allow the laryngoscopist to indirectly view the larynx. This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. Video laryngoscopes are specialized fiberoptic layngoscopes that use a digital video camera sensor to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor. Other [...] "noninvasive" [...] devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the laryngeal mask airway (used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement) and the Airtraq.|$|E

Each device was tested three times using a paediatric manikin with a Cormack-Lehane grade 4 view. The order to use each device was randomised by a computer-generated random sequence. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intubation. Secondary endpoints included the time taken to intubate, percentage of glottic opening score, and severity of potential dental trauma. The successful intubation rates of the Airtraq®, McGrath®, and Macintosh <b>laryngoscopes</b> were 100 %, 72 %, and 45 %, respectively. The risk ratio of the success rates of Airtraq® compared with McGrath® and Macintosh <b>laryngoscopes</b> were 1. 40 (95 % CI; 1. 19 - 1. 64, P < 0. 001) and 2. 22 (95 % CI; 1. 68 - 2. 94, P < 0. 001), respectively. The modified Cormack-Lehane grade and percentage of the glottic opening score were better for the Airtraq® than for the other devices. The dental trauma score was lower for the Airtraq® than for the other devices. There {{were no significant differences in}} the intubation time among the groups.

It was a country doctor's office, with the usual country doctor's supply of drugs on a shelf, but very much more than the country doctor's usual library: the {{standard}} works were there, and there were also the principal periodicals and the latest treatises of note in the medical world. In a long, upright case, like that of an old hall-clock, was the anatomy of one who had long done with time; a <b>laryngoscope</b> and some other professional apparatus of constant utility lay upon the leaf of the doctor's desk. There was nothing in the room which did not suggest his profession, except the sword and the spurs which hung upon the wall opposite where Grace sat beside one of the front windows. She spent her time in study of the room and its appointments, and in now and then glancing out at Mr. Libby, who sat statuesquely patient in the buggy. His profile cut against the sky was blameless; and a humorous shrewdness which showed in the wrinkle at his eye and in the droop of his yellow mustache gave its regularity life and charm. It occurred to her that if Dr. Mulbridge caught sight of Mr. Libby before he saw her, or before she could explain that she had got one of the gentlemen at the hotel--she resolved upon this prevarication--to drive her to Corbitant in default of another conveyance, he would have his impressions and conjectures, which doubtless the bunch of lilies in her hand would do their part to stimulate. She submitted to this possibility, and waited for his coming, which began to seem unreasonably delayed. The door opened at last, and a tall, powerfully framed man of thirty-five or forty, dressed in an ill-fitting suit of gray Canada homespun appeared. He moved with a slow, pondering step, and carried his shaggy head bent downwards from shoulders slightly rounded. His dark beard was already grizzled, and she saw that his mustache was burnt and turned tawny at points by smoking, of which habit his presence gave stale evidence to another sense. He held Grace's card in his hand, and he looked at her, as he advanced, out of gray eyes that, if not sympathetic, were perfectly intelligent, and that at once sought to divine and class her. She perceived that he took in the lilies and her coming color; she felt that he noted her figure and her dress.|$|E
