40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} complexities of identity development of {{elementary and middle school}} preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> during their teacher education program using a poststructural feminist theoretical lens. This research investigated two questions: 1) How do preservice teachers develop their identity as <b>teachers</b> of <b>literacy</b> in the midst of authoritative discourses? 2) What kinds of strategies and discourses do preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> use to negotiate the competing discourses of literacy during student teaching? The results indicated that the identities of the preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> were in transition during their teacher education program and authoritative discourses were at work constituting their subjectivities throughout this process. These discourses were heard as the preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> used deconstructive and reconstructive literacy discourses and strategies from their personal literacy biographies, literacy coursework, and student teaching practices. Their agency as <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> was demonstrated through the strategies they used to negotiate and perform their identities during student teaching—working within and outside of the literacy structures of their cooperating teachers’ classrooms. The research also indicated the power of time and space in relation with others, as a means for continued identity transformation...|$|R
40|$|English {{language}} learners (ELLs) {{at a public}} elementary school in the southeastern United States had not been passing state tests on literacy. Researchers have found that teachers must be adequately prepared to use instructional practices in mainstream classrooms to help ELLs increase language acquisition and pass state tests in literacy. The purpose of this case {{study was to examine}} the experiences of Grade 3 <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> teaching ELLs in a mainstream classroom at the study elementary school in order to understand their instructional challenges. The conceptual framework was based on Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s social cognitive theory in order to understand how these teachers might improve their instructional practices. A purposive sampling technique was used to identify potential participants. Data were collected through individual semistructured interviews with 4 Grade 3 <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> teaching ELLs. Data were analyzed using open coding and thematic analysis to identify emergent themes. The themes identified were inadequate professional development, lack of support at school, and lack of parental support impacting language acquisition of ELLs. Findings of this study can be used by school administrators, curriculum planning educators, and area superintendents to make decisions regarding the training of <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> who teach ELLs. Based on findings from the study, a professional development program was developed for <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> who teach ELLs to help them prepare students to graduate from high school.

This research investigated two questions: 1) How do preservice teachers develop their identity as <b>teachers</b> of <b>literacy</b> in the midst of authoritative discourses? 2) What kinds of strategies and discourses do preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> use to negotiate the competing discourses of literacy during student teaching? 	Data for this research were collected over nine months and were taken from five main sources: course documents, the researcher’s teaching notebook and journal, focus groups, and individual student interviews. Discourse analysis using poststructural feminism concepts of discourse, subjectivity, and agency were used to interpret the data. The validity of this research was re-framed using poststructural feminist concepts of reflexivity; ethical considerations; multiple perspectives; praxis-focused research; and partial, situated knowing. 	 	The results indicated that the identities of the preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> were in formation during their graduate teacher education program and authoritative discourses were at work constituting their subjectivities throughout this process. These discourses were heard as the preservice <b>literacy</b> <b>teachers</b> used deconstructive and reconstructive literacy discourses and strategies from their personal literacy biographies, literacy coursework, and student teaching practices.
