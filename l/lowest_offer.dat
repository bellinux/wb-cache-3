40|$|Evolutionary {{explanations}} of anger as a commitment device hinge on two key assumptions. The {{first is that}} it is observable ex-ante whether someone will get angry when feeling badly treated. The second is that anger is associated with destructive behavior. We test the validity of these assumptions by studying whether observers are able to detect who rejected a <b>low</b> <b>offer</b> in an ultimatum game. We collected photos and videos of responders in an ultimatum game before they were informed about the game that they would be playing. We showed pairs of photos or videos, consisting of one responder who rejected a <b>low</b> <b>offer</b> and one responder who accepted a <b>low</b> <b>offer,</b> to an independent group of observers. We find support for the two assumptions. Observers do better than chance at detecting who rejected the <b>low</b> <b>offer,</b> especially for rejecters who get angry at <b>low</b> <b>offers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Following the {{discovery}} of a large quantity of ironstone in Northamptonshire in 1851, a proposal was made by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR) for an 18 mi line from Market Harborough to Northampton which received Parliamentary approval in 1853. The line's terminus in Northampton was to be on part of the old orchard of Northampton Castle which had been purchased in 1852 by the Reverend Havilland de Sausmarez, the absentee Rector of the Parish of St Peter, as the site of a new rectory. The L&NWR agreed to purchase the land for £5,250, to complete the parsonage and to rent it back to the Reverend. Tenders were advertised for the line in 1858 and the <b>lowest</b> <b>offer</b> of £81,637 by Richard Dunkley of Blisworth was accepted. The contractor had been an unsuccessful bidder for the contract to build Bridge Street station. Dunkley was also the successful tenderer for the line's stations, including Castle station at a cost of £612.|$|E

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{faces the}} risk that the contractor goes bankrupt before the completion of the work. The possibility to declare bankruptcy makes the contractors behave more aggressively. This leads to abnormally low tenders and to the break-down of revenue equivalence. Upon this result we investigate frequently used public procurement methods that were designed to avoid the bankruptcy of the winning contractor. We show that the averagebid-method or methods that exclude the <b>lowest</b> <b>offer</b> fare quite badly. We also show that — in contrast to standard auction theory — multi-sourcing, rationing and other means to soften competition may fare better than a standard auction. ...|$|E
40|$|Young male CEOs {{appear to}} be combative: they are 4 % {{more likely to be}} acquisitive and, having {{initiated}} an acquisition, they are over 20 % more likely to withdraw an offer. Furthermore, a young target male CEO is 2 % more likely to force a bidder to resort to a tender offer. We argue that this combative nature is a result of testosterone levels that are higher in young males. Testosterone, a hormone associated with male dominance seeking, has been shown to influence prospects for a cooperative outcome of the ultimatum game. Specifically, high-testosterone responders tend to reject <b>low</b> <b>offers</b> even though this is against their interest. It has been argued that this is consistent with a <b>low</b> <b>offer</b> being seen as dominance seeking. The acts of attempting or resisting an acquisition can be viewed as striving to achieve dominance. We argue that the evidence reported in this paper is consistent with the presence of a significant hormone effect in mergers and acquisitions. mergers and acquisitions, male dominance seeking, CEO testosterone, bid initiation, bid withdrawal, tender offers...|$|R
