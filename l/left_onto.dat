5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} M-108 {{designation}} was commissioned along a rare three-legged route connecting the State Highway Ferry Docks with the Fort Michilimackinac State Historic Park and US 31. At one point while traveling westbound on M-108, motorists could turn right onto northbound M-108 or <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> southbound M-108. In {{preparation for the}} opening of the Mackinac Bridge, the Michigan State Highway Department transferred all of M-108 to local control in late 1957, decommissioning the designation at the same time. In 1960, the current M-108 was commissioned along the final routing.|$|E
5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E
5|$|The half {{marathon}} {{course was}} designed in a double-looped, or , format which had Wuxiang Square {{as the central}} start and finish point for the race, situated just off Nanning's Minzu Avenue. The route left the square in a westerly direction along Minzu Avenue, before turning north on Binhu Road. It turned <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Changu Road and followed Dongge Road up to the Guangxi People's Hall, which was around the 8km mark. Turning back eastwards via Minsheng Road and Gonghe Road, the route ran along the straightway of Minzu Avenue, passing the halfway marker at this point.|$|E

5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining {{between it and the}} railroad tracks. Turning <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate {{to the site of the}} next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the south}} at Business I-85/US29/US70, the route travels north out of Thomasville in Davidson County as National Highway, a name which {{referred}} to the former routing of US 29/70 (later US 29A/70A) along this segment. Crossing from Davidson County into neighboring Guilford County {{and the city of}} High Point, NC 68 is cosigned with English Road. Approximately one mile within the city limits, NC68 turns <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Westchester Drive, a boulevard that bypasses High Point's downtown area. Arriving at the Main Street interchange, the city's busiest, NC68 continues onto Eastchester Drive, another boulevard. After passing Oak Hollow Mall, I-74/US311 (High Point East Belt), and the Wendover Avenue interchange, NC68 and Eastchester Drive continue north into neighboring Greensboro.|$|E
5|$|On Shelter Island itself, NY114 acts as {{the main}} thoroughfare, once again turning along {{different}} local roads. It traverses {{the length of the}} island, and ends in historic Shelter Island Heights at the North Ferry terminal. Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, again just a block or so from the heart of the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E

5|$|SR 243 {{begins at}} SR 74 in the San Jacinto Wilderness near Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The highway {{traverses}} north along a winding road through {{the community of}} Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left turn at the intersection with Circle Drive and continues through Pine Cove. The road continues through the forest past Mount San Jacinto State Park through Twin Pines and the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a few switchbacks and descending {{en route to the}} city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The highway continues as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Lincoln Street and a right onto 8th Street and terminating at a diamond interchange with I-10.|$|E
5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train stabling, converging from the <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> the northbound line {{just south of}} the station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} line, as {{it existed}} {{at the end of}} 1885, traveled from Fulton Ferry in Downtown Brooklyn east to East New York, passing over York Street, turning right onto Hudson Avenue (the relevant section is now called Navy Street), <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Park Avenue, right onto Grand Avenue (which has now been fragmented), <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Lexington Avenue, right onto Broadway, and slight <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Fulton Street. The structure above Broadway and Fulton Street is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. East of Alabama Avenue in East New York, the original structure still exists (albeit reinforced), and is the oldest such structure in the subway system.|$|E

25|$|When U.S. 52 {{went through}} Downtown Indianapolis, it went onto Brookville Road, then turned right onto English Avenue. It then joined U.S. 421 when it turns right onto Southeastern Avenue. US 52/421 joined U.S. 40 {{when it turned}} <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Washington Street. It then splits into Washington Street (westbound) and Maryland Street (eastbound). US 52 then turned right onto West Street (from West Street, it turned <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Maryland Street). U.S. 52 turned left on either Indiana Avenue or 16th Street (US 136). Eventually, U.S. 52 would overlap U.S. 136 on 16th Street. It then turned right onto Lafayette Road, which became Indianapolis Road when {{reaching}} Zionsville. When I-65 was completed through Downtown Indianapolis, U.S. 52 got on I-65 from the Lafayette Road interchange, and traveled on I-65 {{the rest of the}} way. In 1970, the route was re-routed onto the south belt of I-465 from Brookville Road to I-65. It was re-routed again on its current route around Indianapolis in either 2000 or 2001.|$|E
25|$|Delancey Street in Manhattan has two lanes on the {{eastbound}} side {{adjacent to}} the median used for westbound traffic in the morning rush hour between the Williamsburg Bridge and Allen Street. All traffic in these lanes must continue to and then turn <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Allen, during these times left turns are prohibited from the regular westbound roadway onto Allen Street.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 2004, the {{interchange}} {{from the}} Indiana Toll Road to southbound I-65 required making a physical <b>left</b> turn <b>onto</b> I-65 via a traffic signal; traffic from northbound I-65 to I-90 bypassed the traffic signal via an isolated right-turn lane. This deficiency {{has since been}} corrected by a grade-separation.|$|R
25|$|The 3.2-mile parade route {{starts at}} Andrew Square (at Broadway MBTA Red Line stop), at the {{intersection}} of Dorchester Avenue and Broadway in South Boston, Massachusetts, and travels Dorchester Street to Telegraph Street looping through Dorchester Heights and then bearing right onto East Fourth Street it continues down to 'P' Street bearing <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> East Broadway where it ends (at the Andrew MBTA Red Line stop).|$|E

SH 46-C turns towards the east after turning <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Landa Street. Just outside of downtown, the highway merges onto Seguin Avenue and runs through the central business district of New Braunfels. Near the Comal County Courthouse, Bus. SH 46-C runs along a traffic circle, known locally as Main Plaza, where the highway intersects San Antonio Street. Bus. SH 46-C continues to run southeast along Seguin Street before ending at an intersection with BL I-35/FM 725.|$|E
25|$|In Sparta, New Jersey Department of Transportation {{commissioner}} Jack Lettire {{and state}} senator Robert Littell announced {{the completion of}} a project of restructuring the NJ 15-Houses Corner Road intersection, which began ground breaking in 2002 by James E. McGreevey, then-governor of New Jersey. The project was completed in August 2004. The original intersection was a signalized intersection with a blinking light and no left turn-off lanes from NJ 15. Because of heavy traffic, turning <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> Houses Corner Road became dangerous for motorists. The intersection has a full traffic light. The project cost a total of $15.5 million.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 18 April, a FAL C-46 {{delivered}} arms and equipment to the Girón airstrip occupied by Brigade 2506 ground forces, and took off before daybreak on 19 April. The C-46 also evacuated Matias Farias, the pilot of B-26 serial '935' (code-named Chico Two) that had been shot down and crash-landed at Girón on 17 April. The crews of the Barbara J and Blagar had done their best to land what ammunition they had <b>left</b> <b>onto</b> the beachhead, but without air support the captains of both ships reported {{that it was too}} dangerous to be operating off the Cuban coast by day.|$|E
50|$|Most Route 60 buses make a <b>left</b> turn <b>onto</b> Richmond Street and {{terminate}} at the Richmond-Westmoreland Loop, {{which is}} also the eastern terminus for SEPTA Route 15.
