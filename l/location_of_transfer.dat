40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} case studies of two participants, students at a large land-grant university, as they transfer their knowledge of writing skills and practices across contexts {{as evidence of the}} shifting nature of writing. This project proposes that, as many have theorized, the study of writing transfer needs to be longitudinal; simultaneously, the project also puts forth the idea that studies of writing transfer also need to demonstrate an understanding of the variety of transformations writing knowledge undergoes when it is put to use. The findings in this research point to a methodology for analyzing intersections between commonly held concepts about writing transfer and self-efficacy as indicated in interview transcripts; this analysis is then connected to extensive document collection and, when possible, observations, in order to verify patterns of intersection between themes and practices indicated in the transcripts and documents collected.

40|$|International audienceThe {{phenology}} of temperate {{woody plants}} is commonly {{assumed to be}} locally adapted to climate. 2 However, the high gene flow expected in forest tree species, the high between year variance of thermal conditions at a given place and the high plasticity of phenology regarding temperature, lead us to hypothesize that genetic variation of phenology between populations {{is likely to be}} insignificant for many lowland tree species. 3 Using phenological models, we investigated variation in the timing of flowering between locations for four European clonal tries and between different populations of a further five species. 4 Models were also used to study the responses of the different populations to climate change by simulating transfers of each population to different locations. 5 While clinal variations can be observed in the phenological response to temperature between populations, only one species (Corylus avellana) showed significantly different responses between populations and even then only one of three populations could be separated from the others. 6 Hypothetical transfers show that the differences observed between populations depend on the thermal conditions at the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer,</b> and that these differences are less marked in warmer conditions. 7 Our results indicate that local adaptation will probably not be a serious constraint in predicting the phenological responses of temperate lowland tree species to global warming...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a novel {{approach}} to the characterization of structural damage in civil structures is presented. The proposed method is scalable, automated, and well suited to implementation within a low power, low cost wireless sensing network. Structural damage often results in subtle changes to structural stiffness and damping properties that are manifested by changes in the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> function characteristic equation roots (poles) upon the complex plane. Using structural response time-history data collected from an instrumented structure, transfer function poles can be estimated using traditional system identification methods. Comparing the location of poles corresponding to the structure in an unknown structural state {{to those of the}} undamaged structure, damage can be accurately identified. Pattern classification methods that have been increasingly popular in recent years for damage detection are leveraged to quantify damage existence, location, and severity. To validate the proposed methodology, response data from the Z 24 Bridge is adopted as a test case. Utilization of forced vibration data corresponding to the bridge in various controlled damaged states allow the damage detection methods to be tested; in this study, they are shown to be capable of accurate and robust damage assessment in such a complex civil structure.

40|$|C 4 {{photosynthesis}} affords higher photosynthetic carbon {{conversion efficiency}} than C 3 photosynthesis and it therefore represents an attractive target for engineering efforts aiming to improve crop productivity. To this end, blueprints are required that reflect C 4 metabolism {{as closely as}} possible. Such blueprints have been derived from comparative transcriptome analyses of C 3 species with related C 4 species belonging to the NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) and NADP-ME subgroups of C 4 photosynthesis. However, a comparison between C 3 and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK) subtype of C 4 photosynthesis is still missing. An integrative analysis of all three C 4 subtypes has also not been possible to date, since no comparison has been available for closely related C 3 and PEP-CK C 4 species. To generate the data, the guinea grass Megathyrsus maximus, which represents a PEP-CK species, was analysed in comparison with a closely related C 3 sister species, Dichanthelium clandestinum, and with publicly available sets of RNA-Seq data from C 4 species belonging to the NAD-ME and NADP-ME subgroups. The data indicate that the core C 4 cycle of the PEP-CK grass M. maximus is quite {{similar to that of}} NAD-ME species with only a few exceptions, such as the subcellular <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> acid production and the degree and pattern of up-regulation of genes encoding C 4 enzymes. One additional mitochondrial transporter protein was associated with the core cycle. The broad comparison identified sucrose and starch synthesis, as well as the prevention of leakage of C 4 cycle intermediates to other metabolic pathways, as critical components of C 4 metabolism. Estimation of intercellular transport fluxes indicated that flux between cells is increased by at least two orders of magnitude in C 4 species compared with C 3 species. In contrast to NAD-ME and NADP-ME species, the transcription of photosynthetic electron transfer proteins was unchanged in PEP-CK. In summary, the PEP-CK blueprint of M. maximus appears to be simpler than those of NAD-ME and NADP-ME plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of {{municipal solid waste}} presents serious challenges for municipalities in most countries. Inadequate service coverage and operational inefficiency have led to uncollected solid waste on the roads and in other public areas which poses threats to {{human health and the}} environment. Maseru city in Lesotho faces the same challenges. Poor management has resulted in illegal dumping of waste, and littering can be seen on the public places. Maseru City Council is constructing a sanitary landfill that will respond to the challenges presented by the poor {{management of}} the solid waste. The proposed sanitary landfill is about 45 kilometers away from Maseru. For this landfill to be effective, transfer stations have to be established within the metropolitan area for collecting, separating and sorting of solid waste. This study aimed at identifying suitable sites on which solid waste transfer stations could be located Selecting the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> facility sites is a complex process which involves technical, physical, economical, social, environmental and political requirements that may result in conflicting objectives. Such complexities necessitate the simultaneous use of several decision support tools such as Geographical Information System (GIS) and Multi Criteria Decision Method (MCDM). In this study the model was developed using GIS and MCDM to identify the possible location for construction of transfer station sites. The criteria used included; Topography, Land use, Distance from rivers and Distance from roads. Fifteen sites with varying land suitability were identified as potential locations for required transfer stations. These sites were ranked in descending order to indicate the priority of different options available to decision makers. However, only two sites suited almost all the criteria for selection and they can be used for the construction of the transfer facilities The results achieved by this study may help urban planners and decision makers by availing a variety of options to be considered for transfer facility locations for proper waste management in the city...|$|E

40|$|In {{municipal}} solid waste management system, decision makers have to develop an insight into the processes namely, waste generation, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal methods. Many parameters (e. g., waste generation rate, functioning costs of facilities, transportation cost, and revenues) in this system are associated with uncertainties. Often, these uncertainties of parameters need to be modeled under a situation of data scarcity for generating probability distribution function or membership function for stochastic mathematical programming or fuzzy mathematical programming respectively, with only information of extreme variations. Moreover, if uncertainties are ignored, then the problems like insufficient capacities of waste management facilities or improper utilization of available funds may be raised. To tackle uncertainties of these parameters in a more efficient manner an algorithm, based on interval analysis, has been developed. This algorithm is applied to find optimal solutions for a facility location model, which is formulated to select economically best <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> stations in a hypothetical urban center. Transfer stations {{are an integral part}} of contemporary {{municipal solid}} waste management systems, and economic siting <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> stations ensures financial sustainability of this system. The model is written in a mathematical programming language AMPL with KNITRO as a solver.

40|$|Recently, {{oxy-fuel}} combustion has received increasing attention {{as one of}} the short-term solutions for capturing CO 2 from power plants. Despite their quick development, there are several issues that need further research. Combustion characteristics, heat transfer, emissions levels, optimum oxygen concentration and flue gas recycle are the main concern of the literature. All these issues may introduce several changes in power plant and boiler configuration that causes uncertainty in the final design of future installations. In this respect, {{oxy-fuel combustion}} in fluidized bed seems to present advantages in terms of flexibility, operational adaptability and simplicity of design modifications respect to air combustion. These issues have been though scarcely analysed in open literature. Oxy-fuel combustion in fluidized beds would require the use <b>of</b> additional heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces in order to control the bed temperature and the pollutant formation, minimising the CO emission and taking advantage of the fuel energy in the steam cycle.
