5|$|The Decepticon {{campaign}} {{begins in}} Shanghai with Sideways searching {{the area for}} fuel and power, and also for Megatron's lost body. He learns of Autobots {{in the area and}} hunts and eliminates them. He then learns that Grindor has gone missing and that Sideways must find, repair, and transport Grindor to the extraction site. Once Grindor is safe, he attacks Autobots protecting NEST arrays and infects the arrays with a virus, giving the Decepticons access to NEST communications. Elsewhere, <b>Long</b> <b>Haul</b> destroys NEST bases located around Shanghai. Ironhide emerges to fight <b>Long</b> <b>Haul</b> but is defeated, and Starscream proclaims the victory as a warning to Optimus Prime.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is Saskatchewan's main {{industry}} and taking grain to elevators was first accomplished by horse and cart, {{to be replaced}} around World War I by truck travel. <b>Long</b> <b>haul</b> trucking flourished between 1950 and 1970. Since the 1970s, 17 {{times the number of}} grain trucks and 95 percent of goods transported now are hauled by truck across the Saskatchewan.|$|E

It is located near the settlement of Ittoqqortoormiit, where short trips and <b>long</b> <b>hauls</b> provide access to the cape. Cape Tobin is located opposite Cape Brewster (Kangikajik). It is called Uunartoq because {{it is home to}} the hottest hot spring in Greenland, where the water temperature is 62 C.|$|R
5000|$|At its peak, it {{operated}} 5,958 {{vehicles and}} carried about 12,500 tons of supplies per day. Colonel Loren Albert Ayers, known {{to his men}} as [...] "Little Patton," [...] {{was in charge of}} gathering two drivers for every truck, obtaining special equipment, and training port battalion personnel as drivers for <b>long</b> <b>hauls.</b> Able-bodied soldiers attached to other units whose duties were not critical were made drivers. Almost 75% of Red Ball drivers were African Americans.|$|R
5|$|A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 {{were the}} first {{aircraft}} in Biman's fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> routes. The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the <b>long</b> <b>haul,</b> and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
5|$|The Decepticons {{learn from}} NSA Chief Galloway that Megatron is buried {{deep in the}} Laurentian Abyss. Starscream {{disables}} the Deep-6 aircraft carriers that guard Megatron's remains in the Laurentian Abyss, allowing the Decepticons {{to gain access to}} Megatron's remains. Megatron is revived, and the Decepticons return to the east coast. Megatron disables Optimus Prime and has Starscream destroy a museum that Sam entered, but he is not among the ruins. They learn he was transported to Cairo, Egypt via a space bridge created by Jetfire. Megatron arrives on the outskirts of Cairo and engages Autobots in combat. Jetfire and Bumblebee challenge him, but are defeated. Elsewhere, <b>Long</b> <b>Haul</b> destroys the Axion Gun that the Autobots gave to the NEST Troops. Megatron learns that The Fallen has betrayed him by promising to make him a Prime, learning that Primes are born, not made. Megatron then destroys him before he can fully activate the Sun Harvester, later hearing from Starscream that Optimus Prime has deactivated the machine. Victorious, he begins plans to form an army of new Decepticons.|$|E

5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the <b>long</b> <b>haul.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four Fokker F27s {{joined the}} fleet in 1973, {{enabling}} Biman {{to double the}} frequency of the Kolkata flight to a twice daily service. A Boeing 707 was added to the fleet in September and the flight to London became twice-weekly, while a Chittagong–Kolkata flight also began operating. In 1974, operations were extended to Kathmandu (February), Bangkok (November) and Dubai (December). In 1976, Biman sold two of its Fokker F27s and bought another Boeing 707 to extend international services to Abu Dhabi, Karachi and Mumbai. Singapore was added to Biman's list of international destinations, when a third Boeing 707 was purchased in February 1977, followed by Jeddah, Doha and Amsterdam the following year, which also saw the purchase of its fourth Boeing 707. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation to be governed by a board of directors appointed by the government. The airline broke even {{for the first time in}} 1977–78, and made a profit the following year. International destinations expanded to include Kuala Lumpur, Athens, Muscat and Tripoli in 1979, followed by Yangon, Tokyo and Dhahran in 1980. Biman took delivery of its first 85-seater Fokker F28-4000 in 1981. In 1983, three Douglas DC-10s joined the fleet and the airline started to phase out the Boeing 707s. The flight network expanded further to include Baghdad (1983), Paris (1984) and Bahrain (1986). On 5 August 1984, Biman faced its worst accident ever when a Fokker F27 flying in from Chittagong crashed near Dhaka, killing all 49 on board. The <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> fleet was then supplemented by the purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996, followed by the addition of two more in 2000, from Singapore Airlines and Air Jamaica, and another in 2003.|$|E
60|$|As {{the swell}} {{of the sea}} {{came in from the}} eastward, there was a belt of smooth water {{on the west side of}} the rock.

50|$|The act {{was passed}} in {{response}} to rising public concern with the growing power and wealth of corporations, particularly railroads, during the late nineteenth century. Railroads had become the principal form of transportation for both people and goods, and the prices they charged and the practices they adopted greatly influenced individuals and businesses. In some cases, the railroads were perceived to have abused their power {{as a result of}} too little competition. Railroads also banded together to form pools and trusts that fixed rates at higher levels than they could otherwise command. Railroads often charged a higher price per mile for short <b>hauls</b> than for <b>long</b> <b>hauls.</b> The practice was decried as one that discriminated against smaller businesses.|$|R

40|$|How far do the {{contractual}} {{implications of}} hold-up-based theories (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian (1978), Williamson (1979, 1985)) extend? I investigate {{this in the}} context of trucking. Quasi-rents in trucking are generally smaller than in the contexts studied in the previous empirical literature. They vary with hauls' distance and the thickness of local markets. I find that doubling the thickness of the market increases the likelihood that simple spot arrangements govern transactions by about 30 % for <b>long</b> <b>hauls.</b> I find weaker evidence of relationships between local market thickness and contractual form for short hauls [...] hauls for which quasi-rents are particularly small. Contracts' role as protectors of quasi-rents becomes less important as quasi-rents decrease, but exists over a surprisingly large range. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the contractibility of actions affecting {{the value of}} an asset affects asset ownership by examining how truck ownership has changed with the diffusion of on-board computers (OBCs). We develop and test the proposition that driver ownership should decrease with OBC adoption, particularly for hauls where drivers have the greatest incentive to drive in non-optimal ways or engage in rentseeking behavior. We present evidence consistent with this proposition: driver ownership decreases with OBC adoption, especially for <b>long</b> <b>hauls.</b> In contrast, driver ownership falls less with adoption for hauls that use trailers for which demands are unidirectional than bi-directional, corresponding to differences in the rent-seeking costs of driver ownership. We also find that non-owner drivers with OBCs drive better than those without them. These results suggest that increases in contractibility may lead to less independent contracting and larger firms...|$|R
