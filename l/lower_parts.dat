5|$|An angular {{unconformity}} truncates progressively older (<b>lower)</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the underlying}} Pahrump Group starting {{in the southern part}} of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E
5|$|He is {{also one}} of the main protagonists of the story. Flynn is a {{childhood}} friend of Yuri's, as well as a friend to Estelle. He joined the Imperial Knights in order to uphold law and justice. The two were once childhood friends, brought up in the <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the Empire. He was voiced by Mamoru Miyano in Japanese and Sam Riegel in English.|$|E
5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} some protection to the connecting sections {{and to the}} <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|E

The traditional staple food is barley flour called tsampa, often combined with buttered tea and made into a paste.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wall}} that {{separated}} the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> was a gate {{that led to the}} upper part. The upper part did not have buildings, but there remains a pathway to the stairs up to gateIV, which is 2metres off the ground, right next to tower 3.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the project in 2013, the Air-Cobot robot is dedicated to inspect the <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of an aircraft. In the continuation of the project, there is the prospect of coupling with a drone to inspect an aircraft's upper parts. In October 2016, Airbus Group launches its research project on the hangar of the future in Singapour. The robots from the Air-Cobot and Aircam projects are included in it.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper part}} of Japanese islands was created {{at the edge of}} Eurasian plate 180 million years ago.Then, 50 million years later, the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> was created at the {{southern}} part of Yangtze continent. The <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> then rode on Izanagi plate and moved to the upper part. These islands were incorporated and formed the Japanese islands 70 million years ago. The boundary line between the upper <b>part</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> is the MTL.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, {{based on}} the theory of energy dissipation, results show that upper part of tunnel {{cross-section}} has larger wave energy dispersion than the points at <b>lower</b> <b>part,</b> which means plastic damage of upper part is more serious than the <b>lower</b> <b>part.</b>|$|R
5|$|The female Eurasian {{treecreeper}} forages {{primarily on}} the upper parts of the tree trunks, while the male uses the <b>lower</b> <b>parts.</b> A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was {{not dangerous}} {{to life on}} Earth. Even if it had headed towards <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the atmosphere it would have heated {{so much that it}} would have exploded high above the ground and only some small particles (meteorites) eventually might have made it to Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{region in}} which the Mont Blanc massif is located has been {{occupied}} by man for at least 70,000 years, although, as now — {{and because of the}} great height and glaciated nature of the mountains — only the <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the valleys around its perimeter would have been inhabited or used as routes of communication.|$|E

5|$|The {{white-eyes}} {{are small}} birds of rather drab appearance, the plumage above being typically greenish-olive, but some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast or <b>lower</b> <b>parts,</b> and several have buff flanks. As the name suggests, many species have a white ring around each eyes.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The <b>lower</b> <b>parts,</b> including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E

30|$|We applied PCA on {{a subset}} of markers: in the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the face (jaw, lips, and cheeks - see Figure 1). The {{movements}} of markers on the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the face are tightly connected to the speech gestures. As this synthesis technique was designed for neutral speech (affirmative sentences) and not expressive speech, markers on {{the upper part of}} the face move very little. We retained the 12 first principal components, which explain about 94 % of the variance of the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the face.|$|R
5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal mining area during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, although there are no working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} {{surrounding}} areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon {{at the sides}} of the breast. The rear flanks and undertail-covert feathers are rufous. In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.|$|E
3000|$|... (1) A highly {{conductive}} {{region that}} extends to shallow levels beneath the Jigokudani valley. This conductor {{is divided into}} a conductive upper part and a less conductive <b>lower</b> <b>part.</b> The upper part most likely represents clayey sediments containing hydrothermal acid fluids, whereas the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> is probably associated {{with the presence of}} rather resistive volcanic gases. The less permeable nature of the clay in this area means that the upper clayey sediments act as a cap that stores the magmatic gases in the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of this zone.|$|R
5000|$|The EISA bus slot is a {{two-level}} staggered pin system, {{with the}} upper part of the slot corresponding to the standard ISA bus pin layout. The additional features of the EISA bus are implemented on the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the slot connector, using thin traces inserted into the insulating gap of the upper / ISA card card edge connector. Additionally the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the bus has five keying notches, so an ISA card with unusually long traces cannot accidentally extend down into the <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> of the slot.|$|R

5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland {{habitats}} (in Switzerland {{it occurs}} up to 275 m a.s.l.) and calcium-rich waters. This small snail inhabits {{the central and}} <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of rivers (up to 13 m deep), including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries. It sometimes lives in lakes on unvegetated bottoms. Rarely, it lives in springs (rheocrenes), in ground water, and in caves. For example, in the Åland Islands, Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living in lakes with a pH of 7.8–8.9. In streams and rivers in Ireland, the species lived in water with a pH of 7.0–8.4.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and <b>lower</b> <b>parts</b> of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et Cosmos, Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform for the <b>lower</b> <b>parts,</b> and a drone for the upper parts. If funding is allocated then this second phase would take place during the period 2017–2020.|$|E
