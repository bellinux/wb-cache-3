The island was linked to Harris when the Scalpay Bridge was opened in 1997, connecting Scalpay to the settlement of Kyles on Harris.|$|E
25|$|The topic {{had been}} stimulated by Huxley seeing the cytoplasmic {{streaming}} in plant cells, which {{is indeed a}} sensational sight. For these audiences Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals {{as the key to}} understanding what cells do, but <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was known in the nineteenth century.|$|E

A new island platform was provided encompassing the southern wall of the station; the two platform faces are divided so as to provide four numbered platforms, 5 to 8, generally used for local trains.|$|E

25|$|The Great Wall of China is {{a series}} of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, {{generally}} built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th centuryBC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the system of fortifications built in 220–206BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. <b>Little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> wall remains. The Great Wall has been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced over various dynasties; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).|$|E
25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|E
25|$|The work at Dartford thus {{came to a}} halt. In {{a report}} in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern {{research}} has shown that the real problem was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the assay method was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did not mine at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.|$|E

[...] David Robinson of The Financial Times criticised the appearance of Connery and his effectiveness to play Bond in the film, remarking: [...] "It's not just that Sean Connery looks a lot more haggard and less heroic than he did {{two or three years}} ago, but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy. Apart from the off-handed order for Beluga, there is <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> comic display of bon viveur-manship {{that was one of the}} charms of Connery's almost-a-gentleman 007." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> Troy remains {{due to an}} 1820 fire {{which started}} in a First Street stable and {{eventually}} consumed much of the extant village. A column at 225 River Street bears a stone indicating that this was where the fire was stopped after it had gone on for weeks. Unlike its classical namesake, Troy rebuilt quickly, with newer brick homes and commercial buildings, built to stricter standards, replacing the old ones and expanding again. The Hart-Cluett Mansion, an 1827 Federal style house on Second Street, {{is one of the}} best surviving buildings from this era. [...] Although it was previously attributed to Philip Hooker, new research has determined that the house's architect was Martin Euclid Thompson and the builder was John Bard Colegrove.|$|E

500|$|By 1869, the Mint Act of 1837 {{was deemed}} outdated, and Treasury Secretary George Boutwell had Deputy Comptroller of the Currency John Jay Knox {{undertake}} {{a draft of}} a revised law, which was introduced into Congress by Ohio Senator John Sherman. Due to {{the high price of}} silver, <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> metal was presented at the Mint, but Knox and others foresaw that development of the Comstock Lode and other rich silver-mining areas would lower the price, causing large quantities of silver dollars to be struck and the gold standard to be endangered. During the almost three years the bill was pending before Congress, it was rarely mentioned that it would end bimetallism, though this was not concealed. [...] Congressmen instead debated other provisions. [...] The legislation, in addition to ending the production of the silver dollar, abolished three low-denomination coins. The bill became the Act of February 12, 1873, with the signature of President Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, Gallitzin had {{received}} some {{money from his}} mother, Princess Gallitzin. From time to time he borrowed against his expected inheritance. Upon his father's death, Father Gallitzin, as a Catholic priest, was not allowed, according to Russian law, to receive the inheritance from his father. His representatives in Europe assured him {{this was not an}} insurmountable problem, and his sister Maria Anna had pledged to see that he received [...] his share. However, circumstances changed when her subsequent marriage to an insolvent German prince absorbed most of the estate, although he did receive periodic remittances from her. William I of the Netherlands was persuaded to purchase some valuable items from Princess Gallitzin's estate with the understanding that the proceeds were to be sent to his old friend. However the funds were delivered to Gallitzin's brother-in-law, and he saw little of it. His sister bequeathed him an annual stipend, but he saw <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> either. Gallitzin was often encouraged to return to Europe to claim his rights, but as he was reluctant to abandon his flock, he left the matter in the hands of his representatives, who were sometimes less than assiduous.|$|E
