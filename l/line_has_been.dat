5|$|The route crosses major {{earthquake}} {{zones and}} {{is subjected to}} extreme temperatures of cold and heat, as well as inhospitable terrain, making it a challenging engineering project. The railway <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> under construction since 2002 when it was declared a national project. It will link the state's winter capital, Jammu, with the summer capital, Srinagar, and beyond. The railway <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> built from Jammu to Katra, and the line from Katra to Banihal may be completed by 2020.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Fjord City and {{redevelopment}} of Bjørvika, the Ekeberg <b>Line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{proposed to}} follow a new line {{on the south side}} of Oslo Central Station to Jernbanetorget, with stops at Sørengautstikkeren and Bjørvika. As an alternative, it has been proposed that the tracks along Schweigaards gate be kept and that the trams along the Ekeberg Line alternate running via Bjørvika and Schweigaards gate.|$|E
5|$|Installation of {{centralized}} {{traffic control}} is scheduled to take place as part of nationwide implementation of European Train Control System, {{which is scheduled to}} be completed within 2023. Capacity and efficiency on the line require more passing capacity, especially for longer freight trains. Thus the passing loop at Gudå Station has been proposed lengthened. To allow trains to run from the Meråker Line directly northward on the Nordland Line, a triangular <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed at Hell Station. All regular freight trains on the line come from the north.|$|E
25|$|To date {{more than}} 20 000 {{absorption}} <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> listed for the Sun between 293.5 and 877.0nm, yet only approximately 75% of these <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> linked to elemental absorption.|$|R

50|$|Most {{downtown}} buses use {{numbers to}} specify the lines, while suburban buses and a few downtown bus lines use Chinese characters. In the recent decade, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increased activity in network optimization and as a result, many bus <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cut, shorted, and combined. Many named bus <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> converted to number lines with a flat fare. Some regular <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> changed to rush-hour only, while still keeping their original line numbers.|$|R
5|$|The <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{suggested}} preserved as {{a cultural}} heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact. However, all stations have been demolished; Flekkefjord in 1970, Sirnes in 1977 and Flikkeid in 1988. The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since {{the closure of the}} line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira takes about three hours. However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in.|$|E
5|$|The rail <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{important}} {{since its}} opening, and during World War II the Curve was targeted by Nazi Germany in 1942 {{as part of}} Operation Pastorius. The Curve was later owned and used by Pennsylvania Railroad successors Penn Central, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern. Horseshoe Curve {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966, and became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Until December 2001, {{this was}} the second-to-last stop of the line, which {{terminated}} one stop east at 21st Street–Queensbridge. In 2001 the 63rd Street Tunnel Connection opened, allowing trains from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to use the line. Since {{the opening of the}} connection, the <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> served by F trains, and the subway then became the second means for direct travel between the island and Queens, supplementing the buses that had been operating over the Roosevelt Island Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Construction of new railway <b>lines</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> scarce, {{and most}} new {{construction}} is concentrated on double- and quad-tracking of existing railway lines. Most {{of the former}} tramway <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> closed, reducing the mileage from about 7000 km to only 3000 km.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} light rail and urban {{streetcar}} {{projects have been}} proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed Purple <b>Line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in planning since the 1980s. The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly mirroring the Capital Beltway. The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> converted to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E
5|$|M-51 is {{maintained}} by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. As {{a part of}} these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-51 were the 20,298vehicles daily south of US12; the lowest counts were the 2,658vehicles per day west of Decatur. M-51 between US12 and the state <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|More than 150 {{years after}} its creation, the {{original}} main <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described by an historian {{as one of the}} masterpieces of railway design. Working westwards from Paddington, the line crosses the valley of the River Brent on Wharncliffe Viaduct and the River Thames on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, which at the time of construction was the largest span achieved by a brick arch bridge. The line then continues through Sonning Cutting before reaching Reading after which it crosses the Thames twice more, on Gatehampton and Moulsford bridges. Between Chippenham and Bath is Box Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel driven by that time. Several years later, the railway opened the even longer Severn Tunnel to carry a new line between England and Wales beneath the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, {{he stares at the}} thin slot and grins.|$|E
5|$|The Foch Line was {{negotiated}} with the Polish war mission, led by General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski in Paris, while Lithuanian representatives were not invited. The Foch Line had two major modifications compared to the June 18 line: first, the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway and second, the Suwałki Region, including the towns of Sejny, Suwałki, Puńsk, was assigned to Poland. Despite assurances {{at the time that}} the line was just a temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations could take place, the southern Foch <b>Line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> regarded since then as the border between Lithuania and Poland.|$|E

5|$|The {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998, and the Asker <b>Line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> completed in 2011. Between 1989 and 1996, the Østfold Line south of Ski to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds. To take full advantage of this and allow the rest of the Østfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds, it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski. The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995, and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63%, and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks daily from European Route E18.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and Røros were soon {{discarded}} and the Meråker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879 {{and the line}} was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line gave a boom to the local economy, allowing for same-day transport of produce to Trondheim. The <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> upgraded several times to increase the axle load. During World War II, the line {{was the scene of}} both the Hommelvik train disaster and the Meråker train disaster. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005 Meraker Smelteverk was a major customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopperå to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have electrified and installed centralized traffic control by 2023.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Kuala Lumpur and {{the rest}} of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the opening of 2 light metro (LRT) extension lines on 30 June 2016. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light metro (LRT), monorail, commuter rail and Airport rail link. The LRT system has 2 lines namely, Kelana Jaya Line and Ampang Line, connecting many locations in the city with major suburbs in Greater Kuala Lumpur. The Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter runs between the city and the suburbs. The main rapid transit hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the rail systems. KL Sentral is also a hub for intercity railway service namely KTM Intercity and KTM ETS. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more train lines due for completion or in the pipeline. In December 2016, the 1st phase of Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Project, Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line was completed, the remaining phases of the <b>line</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> open in July 2017, providing a more efficient ride around Greater Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
