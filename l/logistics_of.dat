40|$|As {{the third}} profit source, {{logistics}} plays {{an extremely important}} role to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance the enterprise market competitiveness. This study describes the <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> the supply chain in food production enterprise. The logistics capability is summarized {{as the ability to}} control the logistics cost, the ability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> service, the ability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> elements and the ability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> organization and management. Through the analysis <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> the supply chain in food production enterprise, this study establishes an evaluation system <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> the supply chain from the above four aspects. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine weights of the subspace dimension indicators and the membership function in fuzzy theory is used to determine the indicators of the level of the matrix. Combined with the theory of entropy, integrated weight <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> the supply chain of the matrix can be determined and quantified indicators will be achieved as an evaluation criterion. Finally, the indicator system and evaluation method are integrated to analyze the <b>logistics</b> capabilities <b>of</b> the supply chain in food production enterprise via a case study, which proves to be valid...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their {{mobilisation}} centres or in their concentration areas, and {{only a small number of}} units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. The <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly due to a lack of livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the relationship between}} the level <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> and the solu-tions applied in the agribusiness enterprises. The research was conducted in 504 companies.

On October 14, 2008, Vick attorney Lawrence Woodward filed a motion to enter a plea via two-way electronic video with the Surry County Courts. Vick planned {{to plead guilty to}} state charges {{in an effort to get}} early release from federal prison and enter a halfway house. The request for a trial without Vick physically present was denied, but Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if Vick bore the costs of his transportation to Virginia and related expenses.|$|E

Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E

Personally {{overseeing}} the <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the tanks in their first combat use by U.S. forces, and reconnoitering the target area for their first attack himself, Patton ordered that no U.S. tank be surrendered. Patton commanded American-crewed Renault FT tanks at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, leading the tanks from the front for much of their attack, which began on September 12. He walked in front of the tanks into the German-held village of Essey, and rode on top of a tank during the attack into Pannes, seeking to inspire his men.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} is {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> costs in production of semiconductor materials using example of two Ukrainian enterprises. The article studies influence <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> management and logistics costs upon formation of the final cost value (price) of a commodity (service). It gives an assessment <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> costs <b>of</b> Ukrainian semiconductor enterprises and establishes its structure by types of main expenditure items: material, transport, production and storehouse. It establishes the generalised quantitative structure <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> costs <b>of</b> Ukrainian semiconductor enterprises with various forms of ownership under conditions of a situational growth of cost value of products and reduction of profitability of production, caused by common crisis tendencies in economy. Prospects of further studies in this direction are analysis of costs in production of semiconductor products and establishment of the specific feature of their grouping and classifying from the point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> and justification <b>of</b> the model of assessment of cost value of products, which takes into account mutually contradictory influence <b>of</b> direct <b>logistics</b> costs and logistics management upon the final result...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{unblocked}} reliability {{theory of}} the road network, combined with the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>logistics</b> distribution <b>of</b> expressway service areas, the concept of network unblocked reliability on logistics distribution was put forward. Under the reliability analysis, the optimization model of multi objective, multi depot and open vehicle scheduling on <b>logistics</b> distribution <b>of</b> highway service areas was established, and the ant colony algorithm was designed. In the end an example was analyzed to validate the usability of the optimization model by comparing with saving mileage, which demonstrates the established optimization model of multiple depot vehicle scheduling is of a better practical value to guide the optimization decision making <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> distribution network and to improve the reliability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> distribution <b>of</b> expressway service areas...|$|R

5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E
5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved the <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock. Two years later, there were 400 separate items in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various candied peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E
