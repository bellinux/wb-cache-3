5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument.</b> Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Japan, secret teachings on the I Ching were publicized by Rinzai Zen master Kokan Shiren and the Shintoist Yoshida Kanetomo. I Ching {{studies in}} Japan took on new {{importance}} in the Edo period, during which over 1,000 books were published on the subject by over 400 authors. The majority of these books were serious works of philology, reconstructing ancient usages and commentaries for practical purposes. A sizable minority focused on numerology, symbolism, and divination. During this time, over 150 editions of earlier Chinese commentaries were reprinted in Japan, including several texts that had become lost in China. In the early Edo period, writers such as Itō Jinsai, Kumazawa Banzan, and Nakae Toju ranked the I Ching the greatest of the Confucian classics. Many writers attempted to use the I Ching to explain Western science in a Japanese framework. One writer, Shizuki Tadao, even attempted to employ Newtonian mechanics and the Copernican principle within an I Ching cosmology. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> was later taken up in China by the Qing scholar and official Zhang Zhidong.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the position of}} scientific realism and presents the basic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> for the position. Simply put, scientific realism is {{the view that the}} aim of science is knowledge of the truth about observable and unobservable aspects of a mind-independent, objective reality. Scientific realism is supported by several distinct <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument.</b> It derives from a non-anthropocentric conception of our place in the natural world, and it is grounded in the epistemology and metaphysics of common sense. Further, the success of science entitles us to infer both the approximate truth of mature scientific theories and the truth-conduciveness of the methods of science...|$|R
5000|$|Aristotle's {{definition}} of rhetoric, [...] "The faculty of observing, {{in any given}} case, the available means of persuasion", presupposes a distinction between an art (τέχνη, techné) of speech-making and a cognitively prior faculty of discovery. That is so because, before one argues a case, one must discover what is at issue. How, for example, does one discover available means of persuasion? One does not simply frolic through fertile fields of τόποι (topoi), randomly gathering materials with which to build <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument.</b> There is a method endemic to rhetoric which guides the search for those <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> that speak most directly to the issue at stake.|$|R
25|$|Using {{a similar}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument,</b> Langley and Hungate (2003) {{argued that the}} {{abundance}} of chitin in ectomycorrhizal tissues may reduce decomposition rates of these fungi, {{under the assumption that}} chitin is recalcitrant.

Fernandez and Koide (2012) show that chitin does not decompose more slowly than other chemical compounds in ectomycorrhizal tissues, and that chitin concentrations positively correlated with mycorrhizal biomass decomposition rates, rather than negatively.|$|E
25|$|A violent debate {{developed}} from this request and also involved {{the president of}} the Humboldt University.

25|$|One <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> in Parliament {{was that}} Americans should pay {{a share of}} the costs of the French and Indian War, and that {{therefore}} taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the French and Indian War alone.|$|E
25|$|Barry {{acknowledged}} {{the introduction of}} the Native Police, and the institution of the Port Phillip Protectorate, but said that in reality those measures were intended more for the protection of white settlers than for the Aboriginal people. Barry also raised the example of laws which prohibited the sale or supply of alcohol to Aboriginal people, but which did not introduce any penalty for Aboriginal people possessing alcohol, and similar laws relating to firearms. As a final point on that <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument,</b> Barry referred to the writings of James Kent on the corresponding position under American law with respect to Native Americans.|$|E

Joseph Inikori provided a new <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument,</b> estimating counterfactual demographic developments in case the Atlantic slave trade had not existed. Patrick Manning has shown that the slave trade did have a profound impact on African demographics and social institutions, but criticized Inikori's approach for not taking other factors (such as famine and drought) into account, and thus being highly speculative.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{criticism}} regarding the rhetoric justifying the War on Terror was religionism, or more specifically Islamophobia. Theologian Amir Hussain, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that “Islam is reduced {{to the concept of}} jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West.” This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> echoes Edward Said’s famous piece Orientalism in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's main <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> {{was that}} the {{tremendous}} displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen {{in a short period}} of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge from Psychoacoustics has {{recently}} {{gained increasing attention}} in technology. In this context it can be observed that, on the one hand, scientific Psychoacoustics is overestimated regarding it's application potency and, thus, contributions are expected from it which it cannot render. On the other hand, Psychoacoustics is also underestimated {{in that it is}} considered to be primarily "subjective " and, hence, not based on solid scientific grounds. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to point out the position of Psychoacoustics and, in a more general way, of Psychophysics- in the concert of sciences and arts. In doing so, a stringently phenomenal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> will be presented, i. e., a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> which is solely based on actual perception and not on fiction.

25|$|As well as combating the Neptunists, he also {{opened up}} the concept of deep time for {{scientific}} purposes, in opposition to Catastrophism. Rather than accepting that the earth {{was no more than}} a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Before long, scientific inquiries provoked by his claims had pushed back the age of the earth into the millions of yearsstill too short when compared with the accepted 4.6 billion year age in the 21st century, but a distinct improvement.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} petitions on record dates to 1644. A group of eleven petitioners, not including their children, entreated the Council of New Netherland for freedom, based on the claim {{that it was impossible}} for them to support their growing families under slavery. The Dutch West India Company released these slaves on a plan of half-freedom; this allowed slaves their liberty in exchange for payment of an annual tributary to the company. During early America and the first two decades of the colonial period, slavery had not become a racial caste within the area of Dutch authority. The Dutch West India Company freed many slaves between 1644 and 1664, when they lost control of their colony to England. These early petitioners did not base their claim for freedom on ethnicity but on the monetary realities of living in slavery and caring for a family. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> quickly faded from the records.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{successes and}} {{one-time}} popularity, Harold Wilson's reputation {{took a long}} time to recover from the low ebb reached immediately following his second premiership. Some accuse him of undue deviousness, some claim he did not do enough to modernise the Labour Party's policy positions on issues such as the respective roles of the state and the market or the reform of industrial relations. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> partly blames Wilson for the civil unrest of the late 1970s (during Britain's Winter of Discontent), and for the electoral success of the Conservative party and its ensuing 18-year rule. His supporters argue that Wilson's skilful management (on issues such as nationalisation, Europe and Vietnam) allowed an otherwise fractious party to stay politically united and govern. This co-existence did not long survive his leadership, and the factionalism that followed contributed greatly to the Labour Party's electoral weakness during the 1980s. The reinvention of the Labour Party would take the better part of two decades, at the hands of Neil Kinnock, John Smith and – electorally, most conclusively – Tony Blair.|$|E
