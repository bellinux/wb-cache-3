50|$|The {{technology}} of protection can {{range in price}} dramatically but where the type of device is rational to use, would typically be from least to most expensive solutions: explosion doors and vents (dependent on quantities and common denominators, either may end up the wise price choice); inerting: explosion suppression; isolation - or combinations of same. To focus on the most cost effective, doors typically have lower release pressure capabilities; are not susceptible to fatigue failures or subject to changing release pressures with changes in temperature, as “rupture membrane” type are; capable of <b>leak</b> <b>tight</b> service; service temperatures of up to 2,000°F; and can be more cost effective in small quantities. Rupture membrane type vents can provide a <b>leak</b> <b>tight</b> seal more readily in most cases; have a relatively broad tolerance on their release pressure and are more readily incorporated into systems with discharge ducts.|$|E

The main advantages of an aluminum screen are: simple manufacturing processes, low cost, elimination of millions of small slots and of TEM waves, no adhesion problem, no helium <b>leak</b> problem (vacuum <b>tight),</b> non-magnetic, and others. The available aperture is equivalent to the present design when a non-uniform wall thickness is adopted. A prototype was built to demonstrate the design and the end connections.

50|$|During weaning, {{decreased}} prolactin, missing mechanical stimulation (baby suckling), {{and changes}} in osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and <b>leaking</b> of <b>tight</b> junctions cause cessation of milk production. It is the (passive) process of a child or animal ceasing {{to be dependent on}} the mother for nourishment. In some species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning, in humans there is only partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual. The glands in the breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women. In some other species (such as cows), all alveoli and secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy for lack of growth promoting factors either from the ECM or circulating hormones. At the same time, apoptosis of blood capillary endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds. Shrinkage of the mammary duct tree and ECM remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors. This major structural change leads loose fat tissue to fill the empty space afterward. But a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is pregnant again.|$|R
40|$|Objective: One of {{the controversies}} in foramen magnum {{decompression}} (FMD) is {{the management of}} dura. Graft adhesion {{is the most common}} finding in revisions after FMD with duraplasty. Furthermore, certain number of patients after FMD without dural opening required revision surgery. The most common cause is excessive fibrosis over the preserved dura. On the other hand, FMD with dura left open could reduce the risk for symptomatic recurrence, although it was generally abandoned because of the higher risk of postoperative CSF leakage or meningitis. Purpose {{of this study was to}} re-evaluate FMD with dura left open after the application of tight fascial closures in order to reduce the risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. We compared CSF-related complications of this surgery with other FMD techniques based on literature review. Patients and methods: Our retrospective study included 13 patients who underwent FMD with dura left open. We paid particular attention to prevent CSF <b>leak</b> by the <b>tight</b> suturing of fascial layers especially at both ends of each layer and keeping muscle attachments to inion intact. Results: CSF-related complications and symptomatic recurrence were not observed. The postoperative CSF collection contained within the tightly closed fasciae became of limited size over several months. Conclusion: FMD with dura left open did not show higher rate of CSF leakage as compared to other FMD techniques. The tight closure of fascial layers is essential to minimalize CSF leakage in this surgery. Moreover, it has the advantage of reducing symptomatic recurrence over other FMD techniques...|$|R

40|$|Glass-metal joints {{are a part}} of ITER optical {{diagnostics}} windows. These joints must be <b>leak</b> <b>tight</b> for {{the safety}} (presence of tritium in ITER) and to preserve the vacuum. They must also withstand the ITER environment: temperatures up to 220 °C and fast neutron fluxes of ∼ 3 · 10 9 n/cm 2 ·s. At the moment, little information is available about glass-metal joints suitable for ITER. Therefore, we performed mechanical and thermal tests on some prototypes of an aluminium diffusion bonded optical window. Finite element modeling with Abaqus code was used to understand the experimental results. The prototypes were helium leaking probably due to very tiny cracks in the interaction layer between the steel and the aluminium. However, they were all able to withstand a thermal cycling test up to 200 °C; no damage could be seen after the tests by visual inspection. The prototypes successfully passed push-out test with a 500 N load. During the destructive push-out tests the prototypes broke at a 6 - 12 kN load between the aluminium layer and the steel or the glass, depending on the surface quality of the glass. The microanalysis of the joints has also been performed. The finite element modeling of the push-out tests is in a reasonable agreement with the experiments. According to the model, the highest thermal stress is created in the aluminium layer. Thus, the aluminium joint seems to be the weakest part of the prototypes. If this layer is improved, it will probably make the prototype helium <b>leak</b> <b>tight</b> and as such, a good ITER window candidate. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|In {{subatomic}} particle physics, unstable particles {{can be detected}} with a so-called vertex detector, placed inside a particle accelerator. A detecting unit close to the accelerator bunch of charged particles must {{be separated from the}} accelerator vacuum. A thin sheet with a complex 3 D shape prevents the detector vacuum from polluting the accelerator vacuum. Therefore, this sheet has to be completely <b>leak</b> <b>tight.</b> However, this can conflict with restrictions concerning maximum sheet thickness of the product. To produce such a complex thin sheet, superplastic forming can be very attractive in cases where a small number of products is needed. In order to predict gas permeability of these formed sheets, many mechanical experiments are necessary, where the gas leak has to be measured. To obtain insight in the mechanical behaviour of the used material, ALNOVI- 1, tensile experiments were performed to describe the uniaxial stress–strain behaviour. From these experiments, a high strain rate sensitivity was measured. The flow stress of this material under superplastic conditions was low and the material behaved in an isotropic manner upon large plastic strains. The results of these experiments were used to predict the forming pressure as a function of time in a free bulge experiment, such that a predefined target strain rate will not be exceeded in the material. An extra parameter within these bulging experiments is the application of a hydrostatic pressure during the forming process. Such a pressure postpones the nucleation and growth of internal cavities, which means that higher plastic strains can be reached before failure. Results from these experiments showed that at higher hydrostatic pressures, higher bulges were made. All these bulges were leak tested, showing also that higher hydrostatic pressures lead to a lower void volume fraction at higher hydrostatic pressures, since these bulges were more <b>leak</b> <b>tight</b> at the same bulge height than bulges made without the application of this pressure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first study}} on how the unbalance of temperature recovery after air charged has {{a significant effect on}} the accuracy and repeatability of air leak detection. From this viewpoint, temperature recovery time is derived and affecting parameters are investigated. In a leak detection based on differential pressure measurement, the leak is detected by measuring pressure difference between a reference component, which is <b>leak</b> <b>tight,</b> and a tested component using a differential pressure sensor. When the tested component is leaking, the pressure inside it decreases and the pressure difference with the reference is measured. However, when the required temperature recovery time is not satisfied, unbalance of temperature recovery due to a possibly small difference of heat transfer coefficient between the reference and tested component can produce pressure difference that is similar in size as a real leak and larger uncertainty. This phenomenon is described theoretically and the experimental data are in satisfactory agreement with the calculated results...|$|E
