5000|$|... "Everybody <b>Loves</b> <b>My</b> Baby", {{also known}} as [...] "Everybody <b>Loves</b> <b>My</b> Baby, but <b>My</b> Baby Don't <b>Love</b> Nobody but Me", is a popular and jazz {{standard}} song composed by Spencer Williams in 1924. Lyrics were written by Jack Palmer.|$|R
5000|$|The song title (more specifically, {{the double}} {{negative}} grammatically corrected [...] "...but <b>my</b> baby <b>loves</b> nobody but me" [...] in some covered versions) has frequently led {{teachers and students}} of predicate logic to jestingly accuse the song's narrator of narcissism: The {{first half of the}} title, [...] "everybody <b>loves</b> <b>my</b> baby," [...] implies [...] "my baby <b>loves</b> <b>my</b> baby." [...] The second half, [...] "my baby loves nobody but me" [...] (formally, [...] "if I am not a given person, then my baby does not love that person"), is logically equivalent to [...] "if <b>my</b> baby <b>loves</b> a given person, then I am that person." [...] The latter statement implies [...] "if <b>my</b> baby <b>loves</b> <b>my</b> baby, then I am my baby." [...] From [...] "if <b>my</b> baby <b>loves</b> <b>my</b> baby, then I am my baby" [...] and [...] "my baby <b>loves</b> <b>my</b> baby" [...] it follows that [...] "I am my baby." [...] (Throughout the above, the universe of discourse is restricted to persons.) ...|$|R
