Like vista points, which appear as green spheres and triangles, <b>liveries</b> are usually positioned offroad, forcing the player to sometimes go to the edge of a cliff to get <b>liveries</b> or vista points. This usually comes down to the right combination of vehicle and approach route.|$|R

5000|$|From the 1970s, {{the overall}} colour idea {{began to spread}} worldwide, largely {{in the form of}} [...] "Eurowhite" [...] <b>liveries</b> in which white was the {{dominant}} colour.

It did so by facilitating the hiring-out (chartering in 1960s parlance or leasing from the 1970s) of individual fleet members during seasonal traffic troughs or economic downturns. Overall white aircraft could readily accept major elements of lessee <b>liveries,</b> and could equally rapidly revert to lessor <b>liveries</b> on return.|$|R
