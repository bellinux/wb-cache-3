It has also {{been used in the}} anticonvulsant preparation barbexaclone in combination with phenobarbital to offset sedation. <b>Levopropylhexedrine</b> is the S-enantiomer of propylhexedrine.|$|E
50|$|Propylhexedrine {{has also}} seen use in Europe as an {{appetite}} suppressant under the trade name Obesin {{and in the}} anticonvulsant preparation barbexaclone its S-isomer (<b>levopropylhexedrine</b> or L-propylhexedrine) is bonded with phenobarbital {{for the purpose of}} offsetting the barbiturate-induced sedation. <b>Levopropylhexedrine</b> is also used as an anorectic under the brand name Eventin.|$|E
50|$|Propylhexedrine is a chiral {{compound}} (the Î±-carbon is chiral), {{and active}} ingredient contained in Benzedrex inhalers is racemic (RS)-propylhexedrine as the free base. (S)-Propylhexedrine, {{also known as}} <b>levopropylhexedrine,</b> {{is believed to be}} the more biologically active isomer of the two. (S)-Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from methamphetamine.|$|E
5000|$|Barbexaclone (Maliasin) is a salt {{compound}} of phenobarbital and <b>levopropylhexedrine.</b> It {{was introduced in}} 1983. It {{has been reported to}} be as effective as phenobarbital but better tolerated; however, as of 2004, these [...] "promising results" [...] had not yet been confirmed nor denied in controlled trials.|$|E
