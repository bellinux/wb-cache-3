5000|$|He is {{credited}} with being the first physician to use a laryngeal stroboscope for examination of the larynx. He combined a stroboscopic lamp with a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirror</b> in order to study [...] "vocal movements" [...] in different registers. Application of the strobe light allowed him to view the vibrating vocal cords in slow motion, thus enabling detailed views of the larynx in an open or closed position.|$|E
30|$|The {{advances}} {{in the area of}} diagnosis of otorhinolaryngology and speech therapy have been focusing in improving image acquisition devices, aimed at the observation of vocal folds and their functioning. Initially the ENT (Ear-Nose and Throat) specialist used a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirror</b> and performed the evaluation and diagnosis based on the information they could obtain with this device. Today we have other techniques for the acquisition and recording of images, which allow a posteriori evaluation, being Videolaryngostroboscopy (VLS) and Digital High-Speed videoendoscopy (HSV) the main ones.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{epiglottitis}} though relatively {{common in}} pediatric patients {{as compared to}} adults, present with almost similar clinical presentations. They include voice change, difficulty or painful swallowing and sometimes with upper airway obstruction. Physical finding of swollen epiglottis is difficult to be obtained owing to the danger of introducing <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirror</b> into the oropharynx as to avoid contact spasm. The diagnostic thumb sign appearance on lateral neck radiograph is considered pathognomonic of epiglottitis. We report a case of an adult with clinical features and radiological finding of an acute epiglottitis, which did not resolve with antibiotic treatment. Subsequent imaging confirmed {{the presence of an}} abscess in the epiglottic mucosa...|$|E
50|$|OPA is {{commonly}} used as a high-level disinfectant for medical instruments. Disinfection with OPA is indicated for semi-critical instruments that {{come into contact with}} mucous membranes or broken skin, such as specula, <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirrors,</b> and internal ultrasound probes.|$|R
40|$|The {{human voice}} is a tool that not only {{communicates}} ideas and feelings, but also expresses and elicits emotions. Since the age of Manual Garcia (1805 - 1906), {{the inventor of the}} <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirror,</b> singers and voice teachers have discussed, argued and philosophized about the most efficient manner in which to train any voice to reach its optimum capability. Singing techniques and the subsequent voice qualities have been strongly divided by cultural and personal preferences. Empiricists carefully guarded their teaching methods and shunned ideas that any other fields might have anything worthwhile to contribute to voice instruction. Voice teachers have been slow to embrace the use of visual feedback that is generated by technological sources. A review of literature published since 1967 traces the trends of acceptance of assistive real-time technology in the voice studio...|$|E
40|$|Legend has it {{that one}} day Garcia was strolling down the street. He was {{thinking}} of his sister, a famous opera diva and wondering how people could create such beautiful sounds. Could he {{find a way to}} look inside the instrument and see how it worked? Just at that moment, the sun caught the tip of his walking stick and the light was reflected onto his face. The idea of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirror</b> was conceived and voice science bom. These early efforts in voice research took place {{in the first half of}} the 19 C. By the late 1800 's incandescent light was used with stroboscopy to provide more answers, but it wasn't until the development of microtechnology such as fiberoptics, digital analysis and imaging techniques in the 20 C that voice science has made the greatest strides. This century William Vennard, was one of the American pioneers in singing research. He looked at the acoustics and physiology o...|$|E
40|$|In 1962 Hytrast, an aqueous {{suspension}} containing 50 % w/v of combined iodine as {{a mixture of}} N-(2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl) - 3, 5 -diiodopyridone- 4 and 3, 5 -diiodopyridone- 4, was introduced as a contrast medium for bronchography. Extensive clinical trials had suggested that this agent was superior to products usually employed for this purpose. At the Nova Scotia Sanatorium, Hytrast {{was used as a}} bronchographic contrast medium in 31 consecutive cases. For comparison purposes, the records of the first 50 patients in whom another contrast medium, Dionosil Oily, was used were reviewed. In all cases the contrast medium was introduced through a catheter passed into the bronchus {{with the aid of a}} <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mirror,</b> after local anesthesia was induced by pontocaine 2 %. Experience in this limited number of cases was at variance with most published results. Hytrast was more irritating than Dionosil Oily, had a greater tendency to produce alveolarization, caused more frequent undesirable sequelae, and was retained in the lung for prolonged periods...|$|E
