50|$|Born in Holstebro {{in central}} Jutland, Hvidberg was a self-taught artist. In the early 1960s, he first painted in a Constructivist style {{inspired}} by Gunnar Aagaard Andersen {{and other members}} of the Linien II artists association. His sculptural creations were mobiles made of roof gutters, plexiglass and iron driven by electric motors with shining lights. One, developed together with William Soya, also had a sound and <b>light</b> <b>component,</b> predating later installations. His 1965 POEX exhibition combined avant-garde developments in art, poetry and drama. Hvidberg sought to give his mobiles associations with the cosmos and with ancient civilisations. While in Rome in the early 1979s, he again became interested in Symbolism which had characterized his early works with crosses and swastikas.|$|E

50|$|Volvo LCP2000 (<b>Light</b> <b>Component</b> Prototype) was {{a concept}} car built by Volvo in 1983. It was a project which {{comprised}} many engine {{options for the}} testing of different fuel types.

The engineers started work in 1979; {{they were given a}} clean sheet to create a car meant for the year 2000, maximizing low fuel consumption. Especially magnesium was used to a large extent; this was a result of Volvo's aborted Norwegian affair (Norway would take forty per cent of the company in return for cash and ten per cent of one of the North Sea oil fields). Norsk Hydro, one of the world's foremost magnesium producers provided the technical know-how. The wheels were developed in collaboration with Campagnolo. The floor plate was a single plastic casting, to which aluminium and magnesium elements were glued. The steering was by Germany's ZF, while Moulton's Hydragas suspension was also installed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{existing}} {{models of}} fabric’s optical behaviors are classified and estimated briefly.

The physical model describes the light falling on fabrics splits into six components, which compose another four components. The ten light components divided by the incident light yields ten <b>light</b> <b>component</b> parameters, which are functions of the wavelength. The mathematical model connects the ten <b>light</b> <b>component</b> parameters and gives formulas to calculate them. Thus, the <b>light</b> <b>component</b> parameters are connected with the basic optical parameters and structural parameters of fabric.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} effects of superimposing the Estes-Skinner Conditioned Emotional Response (CER) procedure on one of two components of a multiple schedule. The question was whether CER conditioning occurred under contextual control. The procedure had four experimental phases: (1) baseline of operant responding under a two-component multiple schedule (mult VI 30 VI 30), one component correlated with the house light on and the other correlated with the house light off (light/dark components), (2) introduction of tone-shock pairings during the <b>light</b> <b>component</b> only, (3) return to baseline contingencies, and (4) reintroduction of the tone (but not shock) in the <b>light</b> <b>component.</b> Three Wistar rats showed robust suppression of responding in the <b>light</b> <b>component,</b> and the suppression also partially generalized to the dark component. The suppression was stronger during the pre-aversive stimulus than during the intervals immediately before and after its presentation. Responding partially recovered under baseline contingencies, but response rates remained lower in the <b>light</b> <b>component</b> than in the dark component. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, {{the context in which}} CER conditioning occurred (i. e., the house light-illuminated chamber) also produced conditioned suppression, and contextual control of suppressed responding generalized to another context, one that shared some but not all elements of the first context (i. e., the same chamber not illuminated by a house light). These results have direct implications for our understanding of emotional conditioning produced in the laboratory and for analysis of related phenomena addressed in the clinic...|$|E
