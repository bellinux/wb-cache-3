5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather <b>liked</b> <b>that!</b> I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began with}} a split stage {{on the island of}} Elba, where Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled briefly in 1814. This {{was the first time the}} race began on the island of Elba. The race last visited in 1980 where the race {{finished}} in Portoferraio with a sprint finish won by Carmelo Barone. The route contained less time trials than the 1992 route, which Italian rider Claudio Chiappucci had requested. The race's fourteenth stage, which began and ended in Corvara, was named the queen stage for the amount of difficult mountains contained in the stage. Italian rider Franco Chioccioli <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> there were more points of attack in the race and believed that played into Miguel Indurain's hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} filmed over a seven-week period at the couple's home in Malibu and nearby locations. Production began in August 2011, with an {{original}} release date scheduled for January 2012. The title was set as Shannen Says before its premiere, and the wedding took place and was filmed on October 15, 2011. The series {{was produced by}} Doherty's company, No Apologies Production. Although she was initially hesitant {{about the lack of}} privacy during filming, she felt more comfortable when the bedroom was set as off-limits for the show. David Tutera, a wedding planner and host of My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, acted as Doherty's event planner. The series also featured Doherty's friends, Roxana Zal, Tim Bitici, and Roger Castillo, and her mother, Rosa. According to Doherty, her mother was well-received by fans on Twitter. Doherty explained that viewers <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> her mother appeared more naturally rather than being styled by the show's crew.|$|E

5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
25|$|The Jets' first-place {{finish in}} their {{division}} in 1968 {{set up a}} rematch with the Raiders – {{the winners of the}} AFL West – for the league championship. Namath threw three touchdowns as the Jets won 27–23, putting them through to the third World Championship, a matchup between the winner of the AFL and NFL now known as Super Bowl III. The Jets were 17-point underdogs to the Colts, who had continued to succeed after Ewbank's departure with Unitas at quarterback and Shula as head coach. Nevertheless, Namath publicly guaranteed a Jets win before the game, which rankled Ewbank. Ewbank <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> the Colts were favored, thinking it would make them complacent, {{and did not want to}} agitate them by boasting about the Jets' chances.|$|E

He <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> Parker was {{connected}} to the building in some way and to think of it as [...] "a Tower of Babel in the middle of Manhattan that has something dark and seedy going on in there."

500|$|Former show runner of The Simpsons David Mirkin {{thought the}} episode was [...] "really fun" [...] {{because there were}} [...] "lots of characters" [...] in it and it {{featured}} [...] "lots of terrific animation".

Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.|$|E

The salt taste {{is produced by}} a combination of the sweet taste with another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.|$|R
500|$|Many of the series' {{scenes were}} filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego, California. Producer Paul Kurta said {{that most of}} the scenes taking place in Neptune were filmed in Oceanside, California. Kurta <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven." [...] It was {{estimated}} that the series spent $44 million a year shooting each season in San Diego, which made {{more than half of the}} revenue generated by film production in the area in 2006.|$|E
500|$|PBS {{expressed}} interest in obtaining the show. Although ABC asserted rights to the name [...] "Our World," [...] Ellerbee said [...] "We never <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> title to begin with" [...] and stated that the name [...] "Your World" [...] was under consideration. Ellerbee planned to co-produce the show through her production company, Lucky Duck Productions, in partnership with WNET. Ultimately, Ellerbee was unable to secure the estimated $5 million needed to produce the first season of 13 episodes and Our World {{did not make the}} transition to PBS.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} the song were mostly positive.

He added that he thought the song had a [...] "catchy beat" [...] and an [...] "infectious chorus." [...] The Long Beach Press-Telegrams Patricia Smith called [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] a [...] "surprisingly funky tune."

Banks and Baker roomed together on road trips {{and became the}} first all-black double-play combination in major league history. When Steve Bilko played first base, Cubs announcer Bert Wilson referred to the Banks-Baker-Bilko double play combination as [...] "Bingo to Bango to Bilko". Banks hit 19 home runs and finished second to Wally Moon in Rookie of the Year voting. Banks participated in a trend toward lighter baseball bats after he accidentally picked up a teammate's bat and <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> it was easy to generate bat speed.|$|E
500|$|Caldwell and Anderson {{deliberately}} did {{not meet}} before their reunion scene in [...] "Collision" [...] as they {{wanted it to be}} as authentic as possible. In the following episode, Hurley comments that he did not expect Rose's husband to be white, before Jack quickly changes the subject. The producers felt it was important to address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was saying what the audience would be thinking. Caldwell agreed with them and thought it would be odd if the issue was not addressed. Anderson also was glad that Hurley brought up the issue, and <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> Jack did not pay any attention.|$|E
500|$|Comic book writer/artist Dave Stevens {{created the}} Rocketeer in 1982 and {{immediately}} viewed the character {{as an ideal}} protagonist for a film adaptation. Steve Miner purchased the film rights from Stevens in 1983, but he strayed {{too far from the}} original concept and the rights reverted to Stevens. In 1985 Stevens gave writers Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo a free option on The Rocketeer rights. Stevens <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> [...] "their ideas for The Rocketeer were heartfelt and affectionate tributes to the 1930s serials with all the right dialogue and atmosphere. Most people would approach my characters contemporarily, but Danny and Paul saw them as pre-war mugs." ...|$|E

500|$|Ward's {{goal for}} the episode was [...] "to weird it up" [...] and play off bizarre ideas and imagery. Ward latter {{revealed}} on his Twitter that many scenes were inspired by popular [...] "YouTube Poops", which are idiosyncratic and often nonsensical mashups which have been uploaded on the video site YouTube; Ward explained that he enjoyed the concept of Poops and wanted {{to put them in}} the episode. While storyboarding the episode, Xayaphone exaggerated the elongation of Finn's ears; this was originally going to be revised, but Ward <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> the effect because it fit in with the concept of an unstable and unreliable dream world.|$|E

Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
