40|$|International audienceVolcanic rocks {{from the}} Maghnia region of {{northwest}} Algeria consist of fresh to altered rhyolitic units that were emplaced during late Miocene time. Petrographic observations and geochemical {{data indicate that}} rhyolitic rocks were derived from a hybridized peraluminous magma.

Rhyolitic units are partially weathered and form an economic deposit of montmorillonite. Spectroscopic data and stable isotopes (O, H) of glass and montmorillonite indicate that the residual glass was partially hydrated by meteoric water at temperatures between 31 and 54 °C. The chemical mass balance indicates that rhyolitic rocks were altered to montmorillonite by meteoric water enriched in Ca, Mg and Sr. The combination of the chemical mass balance and the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial ratios of rhyolite and montmorillonite indicate that continental water/rock interaction was related to the surrounding Miocene <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestone...</b>|$|E
40|$|Oxygen isotopic {{compositions}} {{of upper}} Miocene (9. 2 m. y.) <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestone</b> from northwestern Wyoming range from - 21. 5 to - 35. 2 % (PDB) {{and are the}} lightest yet reported for a non-marine carbonate sequence. These values require that lake water was greatly depleted in 18 O relative to modern meteoric precipitation and indicate that most inflow was sourced as meltwater from glaciers in the adjacent Gros Ventre range. Assessment of climatic factors influencing the isotopic composition of global meteoric water indicates either that nearly all of Miocene precipitaaion in the southern Rocky Mountains was derived from large lake systems in the Snake River Plain and northern Great Basin to the west, or that Gros Ventre catchment elevations were up to 2300 m higher than at present. Because erosion rates in modern alpine regions suggest that subaerial denudation could only account for up to 1200 m of post-Miocene elevation reduction, any additional lowering must reflect the influence of post-Laramide epeirogeny during Basin and Range extentional tectonism. Lacustrine isotopic data therefore provide boundary conditions on the timing and magnitude of changes in late Cenozoic paleoclimate, topography, hydrology, and tectonism in the western Wyoming portion of the Rocky Mountains...|$|E
40|$|The Cretaceous (Mercedes Formation) and Paleogene (Queguay Formation) {{deposits}} cropping out inWand S Uruguay comprise two terrestrial limestone {{units that}} are very rich in trace fossils. The study of these units permits to propose a sedimentological model for palustrine limestones and calcretes in which the distribution {{of different types of}} trace fossils is considered. The study units include three main types of deposit: <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestones,</b> palustrine limestones and calcretes. The <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestones</b> are relatively homogeneous and contain gastropods, charophytes and ostracods, but no trace fossils. They were deposited in a relatively more perennial lacustrine environment. The palustrine limestones include four different facies: desiccated mudstones, nodular limestones, granular limestones and gravel-sheets. The desiccated mudstones indicate a lesser degree of pedogenic modification and the granular limestones a higher degree. The gravel-sheets are an indication of the reworking of previous limestones deposits during low lakewater levels. Most of the palustrine limestones (except the gravel sheets) contain the same bioclasts as the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestones</b> plus a variety of trace fossils such as Rebuffoichnus sciuttoi, Fictovichnus gobiensis and different ichnospecies of Celliforma. The calcretes are either massive (groundwater) or laminar. The massive calcretes are sandy limestones made up of a carbonate matrix and cements. The laminar calcretes (root mats), which contain alveolar septal structures, occur as centimetre-thick layers and can be seen in all types of deposit. They contain the same trace fossil association as the palustrine limestones; the massive calcretes are poorer in such fossils. The distribution of trace fossils in these environments is under strong facies control and provides good evidence of subaerial exposure and semi-arid climates. All the limestones are partially replaced and cemented by opal and quartz, but in all cases the primary structure is preserved. Silicification occurred under groundwater meteoric conditions. Overall, the limestones facies (calcretes, palustrine and lacustrine) and their lateral distribution likely reflect the existence of wetland environments in semiarid to sub-humid climates. These climatic conditions were interrupted by a period of increased precipitations, probably the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum...|$|R

Lissodus sardiniensis sp. nov. is erected on the basis of about 500 teeth, which show a unique feature of only one pair of lateral cusps that are bent {{in the direction of the}} prominent central cusp. Weak heterodonty allows distinction of symphyseal, mesial to anterolateral, and lateral teeth. Lissodus sardiniensis sp. nov. was a freshwater−adapted durophagous shark of bottom dwelling habit, an interpretation supported by general construction of the dentition and the morphology of the der− mal denticles. The association with Acanthodes, diplodoselachid sharks and branchiosaurs allows the reconstruction of a five−level trophic chain for the Guardia Pisano Basin. The discovery of Lissodus in Sardinia is presently the southernmost known occurrence of that genus in the Late Palaeozoic of Europe.

40|$|Tectono-stratigraphic {{models of}} {{foredeep}} sedimentation have generally presumed {{a direct link}} between changing rates of tectonism and concomitant sedimentological response as manifested by change in thickness, composition or depositional environment of sediment accumulating in adjacent basins. <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>limestone</b> units within the early Cretaceous fluvial/lacustrine Gannett Group of western Wyoming exhibit systematic variation in several geochemical proxies of relative rates of precipitation and evaporation, indicating that lakewater chemistry was controlled by variation in regional climate. Change in proportion of allochthonous terrigenous clastic vs. autochthonous carbonate deposition, as well as carbonate Mg/Ca ratio and stable isotopic composition, occurs at two scales. Metre-scale alternation of micritic limestone and argillaceous marl is accompanied by mineralogical and isotopic variation within individual beds, indicating preferential carbonate accumulation during intervals of decreased regional meteoric precipitation relative to lake-surface evaporation. Limestone deposition began during intervals of maximum aridity, and decreased as increased meteoric precipitation-driven flux of terrigenous clastic sediment overwhelmed sites of carbonate accumulation. Similar upsection variation in limestone mineralogy and isotopic composition at a scale of tens of metres reflects the multiple processes of long-term increase in meteoric precipitation and lakewater freshening prior to influx of terrigenous sediment, across-basin fluvial-deltaic progradation, and renewed accumulation of riverine terrigenous units. Such trends suggest that formation-scale alternation between fluvial clastic and lacustrine carbonate deposition was controlled by climate change...|$|E
40|$|Outcrops of {{the upper}} Yucca Formation in the Indio Mountains near Van Horn, Texas provide temporal, tectonic, and climatic {{similarities}} to Lower Cretaceous, synrift, greenhouse pre-salt lacustrine strata along in the subsurface of the South Atlantic margin. These “pre-salt” strata hold prolific petroleum reservoirs but despite extensive seismic studies performed for regional scale hydrocarbon exploration in these lacustrine reservoirs, sedimentologic and stratigraphic analyses have rarely been published. The Upper Yucca Formation in the Indio Mountains contain lacustrine reservoir analogs that intertongue with fluvial and deltaic sandstones. Near Squaw Canyon, fluvial-deltaic sandstones are reduced in abundance to lacustrine carbonates by nearly 70 % over less than 1 km of exposure. This change is either accommodated by delta progradation into the Cretaceous lake or through climatic and tectonic events resulting in channel erosion and redeposition of mudstone and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestone</b> on the lake floor. A detailed facies analysis and stratigraphic architecture of the fluvial/lacustrine depositional system {{of the upper}} Yucca Formation was performed to distinguish how the fluvial channels sands interact with the lacustrine muds; three stratigraphic transitions are documented revealing 1) conglomeratic cross-bedded fluvial channel sands downcut into lacustrine muds marked by an erosional unconformity 2) burrowed and laminated lacustrine shoreface muds onlap meandering channel sands 3) fluvial channel sands bearing lacustrine rip-up clasts intertongue with draping delta-front and lacustrine muds indicating a lacustrine delta.

The pedostratigraphic approach can be very useful to comprehend the formation of the Quaternary soil cover, the environmental evolution of a territory, and to estimate the age of paleosols. A pedostratigraphic study of a Terra Rossa was carried out to understand the soil–parent material origin and to estimate the time of the beginning of pedogenesis. Besides soil and geomorphological survey, the Terra Rossa was analyzed for Fe forms, geochemistry, clay mineralogy, micromorphology, and with scanning electron microscope. Optical dating was applied to obtain age estimates for the deposition of the parent material of soil formation. The insoluble residue of limestone was obtained and analyzed for geochemistry and clay mineralogy. The bedrock is constituted by Quaternary <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestone,</b> showing pronounced karst landforms. The soil profile is situated in a little dissolution doline and was divided into three PLs: PL 1 (0 – 110 cm) is constituted by cambic and ochric horizons, formed during Holocene in a mixture of colluvial soil sediments and fresh limestone, with aeolian components; PL 2 (110 – 290 cm) includes two argic horizons, which began to form during Late-Middle Pleistocene in colluvial soil sediments, with few aeolian additions; PL 3 (290 – 330 cm) is constituted by a red argic horizon, with nitic properties, which developed from the insoluble residue of the limestone. The age of PL 3 was calculated through a mass balance and an estimation of the limestone-dissolution rate during the Quaternary, which led to an approximate age of Middle Pleistocene, between 250 and 500 ky BP.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of a detailed carbonate petrographic study of an Upper Miocene lacustrine mixed carbonate-siliciclastic succession in the Teruel Basin (Spain) {{with the aim}} of constraining lake-level variability at different stratigraphic scales. Regular alternations of red to green mudstone and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestone,</b> termed the 'basic cycle', reflect lake-level variations at the metre-scale. In an earlier study, the basic cycle was shown to be controlled by the climatic precession cycle. Petrographic analysis made it possible to distinguish two main carbonate microfacies groups characteristic of very shallow transient and shallow permanent lake environments, respectively. In addition to the basic cyclicity, the microfacies analysis reveals lake-level variations on a larger scale. As a consequence, the astronomical forcing hypothesis of the cyclicity in the Cascante section is explored further. A climate modelling study of orbital extremes indicates that high lake levels could relate to enhanced net winter precipitation and runoff during precession minima, consistent with Mediterranean geological data. Using this phase relationship, an astronomical tuning of the cycles is established starting from astronomical ages of magnetic reversal boundaries. Subsequently, successive basic cycles are correlated to precession minima. The tuning reveals an identical number of basic cycles in the Cascante section as precession-related sapropel cycles in the deep marine succession at Monte dei Corvi (Italy), corroborating the precessional control of the basic cycles at Cascante. Lake-level highstands in the large-scale cycle identified by the microfacies analysis relate to maxima in both the ca 100 and 405 kyr eccentricity cycles, again consistent with Mediterranean geological data. Subtraction of the identified astronomically related (lake-level) variations from the palaeoenvironmental record at Cascante indicates a shift to deeper and more permanent lacustrine environments in the upper half of the section. The cause of this shift remains unclear, but it may be linked to tectonics, non-astronomical climate, long-period astronomical cycles or autogenic processes. © 2008 The Authors.

Here we redescribe the only available specimen, and clarify features, such as absence of palatines, nine presacrals, and procoelous vertebral centra, that have been the subject of previ− ous debates. We consider the specimen to be a postmetamorphic individual and make developmental interpretations of some of its characters. In particular, we provide evidence of a living anuran (Rana iberica) that resembles Neusibatrachus in the development of intervertebral articulations.

40|$|Stratigraphic relations, {{detailed}} petrography, microthermometry {{of fluid}} inclusions, and fine-scale isotopic analysis of diagenetic phases indicate a complex thermal history in Tithonian fluvial sandstones and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Tera Group (North Spain). Two different thermal events {{have been recognized}} and characterized, which are likely associated with hydrothermal events that affected the Cameros Basin during the mid- Cretaceous and the Eocene. Multiple stages of quartz cementation were identified using scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence on sandstones and fracture fills. Primary fluid inclusions reveal homogenization temperatures (Th) from 195 to 350 C in the quartz cements of extensional fracture fillings. The high variability of Th data in each particular fluid inclusion assemblage is related to natural reequilibration of the fluid inclusions, probably due to Cretaceous hydrothermal metamorphism. Some secondary fluid inclusion assemblages show very consistent data (Th = 281 – 305 C) and are considered not to have reequilibrated. They are likely related to an Eocene hydrothermal event or to a retrograde stage of the Cretaceous hydrothermalism. This approach shows how multiple thermal events can be discriminated.

40|$|<b>Lacustrine</b> <b>limestones</b> were {{formerly}} {{identified by}} their faunistic (limnea, planorbis) and floristic (Charophytes) content. For 30 years, indications of pedogenesis {{have been found}} in many lacustrine deposits, and consequently the concept of palustrine <b>limestone</b> was defined. <b>Lacustrine</b> fabrics are not that numerous: varved, laminated, homogeneous, peloidal, brecciated, gravelly, bioturbated (burrows), bioclastic, algal, and stromatolitic. Detrital beds are sometimes present and are interpreted as bottomset deposits. Palustrine fabrics result from exposure and pedogenesis of lacustrine mud. The main processes involved in this evolution are: cracking, with planar, curved, craze and skew planes, colonization by plants resulting in root traces, marmorization (redistribution of iron due to water table fluctuation), and redistribution of carbonates (needles, subspherical or cylindrical vertical nodules, carbonate coatings, early and late diagenetic crystals, Microcodium). Carbonate palustrine features can be associated with other minerals: palygorskite, gypsum, or silica. Alternation of lacustrine sedimentation and exposure/pedogenesis leads to the pseudo-microkarst facies resulting from enlargement of the complex network of root traces and horizontal cracks. The voids in the pseudo-microkarst facies are infilled with a polyphased internal sediment composed of carbonate and vadose silt and phreatic and vadose cements. Traces of exposure and pedogenesis are less in evidence in lacustrine bioclastic sands and algal-stromatolitic limestones. Finally, under certain conditions, the surficial laminar horizon and its associated perlitic crust (ooids) develops on palustrine muds and form a desert stromatolite...|$|R
2500|$|The Piçarras Formation is [...] {{thick and}} {{consists}} of clastic and carbonate rocks. The formation includes reddish polymictic conglomerates, with clasts of basalt and quartz in a clay-sandy matrix. It also includes white, reddish <b>lacustrine</b> coquinas (shelly <b>limestones)</b> and sandstones, siltstones and shales of stevensite composition. Its age, based on the ostracod assemblages, is Hauterivian to Aptian.|$|R
