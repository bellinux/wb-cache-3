5|$|In 1922, the American {{explorer}} Roy Chapman Andrews led a {{well documented}} expedition to China and Mongolia {{sponsored by the}} American Museum of Natural History. Various indricothere remains were found in formations of the Mongolian Gobi Desert, including the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specimen standing in an upright position, indicating that it had died while trapped in quicksand, {{as well as a}} very complete skull. These remains became the basis of Baluchitherium grangeri, named by Osborn in 1923.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo (PAX), Game Director Todd Papy, Lead Game Designer Mark Simon, Principal Character Artist Patrick Murphy, {{and writer}} of the God of War series Marianne Krawczyk, hosted the first God of War panel, {{discussing}} the origins of Ascension, and provided {{an overview of the}} evolution of Kratos. The Fury Megaera was revealed, and Mark Simon discussed the new combat system. Papy said he had considered using the goddess Artemis as a playable female character, which would have offered the player alternative combat options. Artemis would have been depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lioness. Artemis was ultimately cut from the game, but Papy {{said he would like to}} explore the possibility of using other gods in the future.|$|E

Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he {{decided he wanted to}} go to West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on April 24, 1962.|$|E

5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the Gorgon, Medusa, was to have five feet, but due to {{perceived}} animation difficulties, the final version had one tail. Other Gorgons in the game adhered to this design. The goddess Artemis was considered for inclusion in God of War: Ascension as a playable female character, offering alternative combat options. Game Director Todd Papy said {{she would have been}} depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lioness. However, she was ultimately cut from the game and thus only appears in the original God of War as a translucent head.|$|E

5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous {{base of the}} leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E

The white <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the eight}} <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
5|$|The 2013–14 UEFA Europa League {{campaign}} {{started in}} record-breaking fashion. In July 2013, the club won 2–0 {{away from home}} against ÍF Fuglafjørður of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round. This was the Blues' first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated Vålerengen 4–1 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. In the second leg at Windsor Park, the Blues won 3–0 to go through to the next round 5–0 on aggregate. This was the club's largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris Bonnevoie 9–4 on aggregate {{in the first round}} of the 1966–67 European Cup. It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European tie in any competition. They followed this up in the next round by winning away from home again. Despite being massive underdogs for the tie, a 1–0 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe, without conceding a goal in the process – another first for the club. However, in the second leg at home they went down 2–1 after extra time, which eliminated them on the away goals rule. The following season, Linfield's first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against B36 Tórshavn in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round, which was also Feeney's first competitive game in charge of the club. Linfield came out 2–1 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon's ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1–1 draw, but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1–0 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since 1959.|$|E
