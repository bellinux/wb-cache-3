500|$|On November 8, 2011, a {{demo version}} of the song, named [...] "Give Me All Your Love", was leaked. According to Keith Caulfield from Billboard, [...] "Within a few hours, [...] was among {{one of the top}} 10 {{trending}} topics worldwide on Twitter." [...] Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, addressed the leak on Twitter adding the singer's statement on the situation: [...] "My true fans wouldn't do this". Oseary also clarified that their initial plan was for new music to come out in 2012 itself. He was happy with the positive reaction to the demo, but asked fans to help him police any more leaks. The leaked demo lacked vocals from both Minaj and M.I.A. which Madonna reflected upon, [...] "It's really disappointing because you don't want things to come out till you're done with them, till you're ready. It's like everybody <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> unfinished painting. It's like, 'Wait a minute. I didn't finish that. That's not fair." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
2500|$|The second rank {{describes}} {{the recognition of}} the Absolute within [...] "the midst of the variety of different situations in action; you see everything before your eyes as your own original true clean face, just as if you were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> face in the mirror". That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions. However, seeing the absolute within the relative does not extend to one's behavior towards others. Hakuin describes that at this point one [...] "is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land. Although he has a clear understanding of the Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas." ...|$|E
