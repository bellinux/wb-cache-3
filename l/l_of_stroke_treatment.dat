40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{summarize}} the methodological approaches used in published decision-analytic models evaluating interventions for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment,</b> to highlight {{key components of}} decision-analytic models <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment,</b> and to discuss challenges for developing stroke decision models. MethodsA review of the published literature was performed using Medline, to identify studies involving mathematical decision models to evaluate interventions for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment.</b> Articles were analyzed to determine key components <b>of</b> a <b>stroke</b> model and to note areas in which data are lacking. ResultsWe identified 13 published models <b>of</b> acute <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment.</b> These models typically possessed a short-term treatment module and a long-term post-treatment module. The following aspects of economic modeling {{were found to be}} relevant for developing a stroke model: modeling approach and health state; health state transition probabilities; estimation of short-term, long-term, and indirect costs; health state utilities; poststroke mortality; time horizon; model validation; and estimation of parameter uncertainty. ConclusionsData gaps have limited the development of economic models in stroke to date. In order to more accurately assess the long-term incremental impact of a new <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke,</b> future research is needed to address these data gaps. We recommend that the complexity of models for examining the cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> an acute <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment</b> be kept to a minimum such that it can incorporate the currently available data without making a large number of assumptions around the data...|$|R
40|$|The study {{objective}} is to conduct a pharmacoeconomic analysis of naftidrofuryl effectiveness in patients with ischemic stroke. Materials and methods. The work {{is based on the}} results of clinical studies of effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of naftidrofuryl in patients who suffered an ischemic stroke. The study design included data on 1000 patients of 45 and older with first-time acute cerebrovascular disease of ischemic type. Results. Direct medical costs for the chosen patient cohort per the Standard <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment</b> current at the time of the study were 730 575 189 rubles, in case of naftidrofuryl inclusion they were 476 467 620 rubles. Cost minimization is 254 107 569 rubles. Indirect nonmedical costs associated with temporary incapacity for work for treatment per the Standard <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>treatment</b> were 124 156 950 rubles, and 64 559 180 rubles for naftidrofuryl use which demonstrates the drugâ€™s economic benefit. Budget impact analysis has shown that the possible savings constitute 7. 59 %. Conclusion. Inclusion of naftidrofuryl into treatment of patients with ischemic stroke is justified as it decreases duration of rehabilitation. This leads to a positive economic effect expressed as decreased direct and non-direct medical costs. </p...|$|R

In order to analyse the effects of putative neuroprotective genes, a novel transfection-based approach was established in primary cortical neurons.

This approach enables the analysis of transfected neurons independent of the total population of cells. This cotransfection / cocultivation approach was used to investigate the effect of overexpressed Hexokinase II on neuronal survival under hypoxic conditions. Hexokinase II mediated a glucose-dependent protection from neuronal cell death under hypoxic conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Many {{trials in}} {{patients}} with acute myocardial infarction have demonstrated that thrombolytic therapy is not associated with an excessive risk <b>of</b> <b>stroke,</b> as compared with conventional treatment. However, the incidence of various forms <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> in patients treated with different thrombolytic and antithrombotic regimens and the associated effect of risk factors for stroke are largely unknown. METHODS. Strokes occurring in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction who were enrolled in either of two large trials were analyzed. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive streptokinase (1. 5 million units) or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (100 mg) and also randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous heparin or no heparin. Ninety-one percent of the patients also received aspirin. RESULTS. Complete data were available on 20, 768 patients. A total of 236 (1. 14 percent) had strokes in the hospital; 0. 36 percent had hemorrhagic strokes, 0. 48 percent ischemic strokes, and 0. 30 percent <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> undefined cause. Patients treated with t-PA had a small but significant excess <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> as compared with those who received streptokinase (1. 33 vs. 0. 94 percent; adjusted odds ratio, 1. 42; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 09 to 1. 84). The administration of subcutaneous heparin in addition to a thrombolytic agent did not increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> (risk with heparin, 1. 13 percent; without heparin, 1. 14 percent). Older age, a higher Killip class, and the occurrence of anterior infarction significantly increased the risk <b>of</b> <b>stroke,</b> whereas a higher body-mass index or a history of hypertension, diabetes, or smoking did not. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with acute myocardial infarction who receive thrombolytic therapy have a small risk <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with t-PA as compared with streptokinase resulted in a small but significant excess <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> Subcutaneous heparin, given together with t-PA or streptokinase and aspirin, did not result in an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Only 65 % of the CT scans from 14 stroke patients were correctly identified as normal or abnormal (95 % CI 60 - 69 %). Neither observer experience nor knowledge of symptoms significantly improved recognition of abnormality, although experience did significantly improve the observers' ability to reproduce their results.
