40|$|The {{collinear}} <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> L 3 of the sun-earth+moon {{system is}} an ideal place for some space missions.

In this paper, the dynamics of the <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> was briefly introduced first. Then a way to transfer the spacecraft to the collinear <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> L 3 via the invariant manifolds of the other two collinear <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> was proposed.

The <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> staging strategy being considered would eliminate the lunar mid-latitude accessibility constraint for long duration missions. Staging options for such a strategy are discussed with particular emphasis {{on the impact of}} the libration points' stability. The equations of motion for a <b>satellite</b> at the <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> are numerically integrated to investigate the stability and to determine the station-keeping requirements. These requirements are presented, and overall requirements for <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> staging briefly summarized.

40|$|In this Note we {{consider}} using solar sail propulsion to stabilize a spacecraft about an artificial <b>libration</b> <b>point.</b> It {{has been demonstrated}} that the constant acceleration from a solar sail {{can be used to}} generate artificial <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> in the Earth-Sun three-body problem. This is achieved by directing the thrust due to the sail such that it adds to the centripetal and gravitational forces. These <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> have the potential for future space physics and Earth observation missions. Of particular interest is the possibility of placing solar reflectors at the L 1 artificial <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> to offset natural and human driven climate change. One engineering challenge that presents itself is that these artificial <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> are highly unstable and require active control for station-keeping. Previous work has shown {{that it is possible to}} stabilize a solar sail about artificial <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> using variations in both pitch and yaw angles. However, in a practical sense, solar sails are large structures and active control of the sail's attitude is a challenging engineering problem. Passive stabilization of such reflectors is to be investigated here to reduce the complexity of space-based geo-engineering schemes...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedA Halo orbit about a <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> of a restricted three-body system provides additional opportunities for surveillance, communication, and exploratory missions {{in lieu of}} the classical spacecraft orbit. Historically <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> missions have focused on Halo orbits and trajectories about the Sun-Earth System. This thesis will focus on <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> orbit solutions in the Earth-Moon system using the restricted three body equations of motion with three low-thrust control functions. These classical dynamics are used to design and optimize orbital trajectories about stable and unstable <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> of the Earth-Moon system using DIDO, a dynamic optimization software. The solutions for the optimized performance are based on a quadratic cost function. Specific constraints and bounds were placed on the potential solution set in order to ensure correct target trajectories.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is {{proposed for the}} systematic detection and refinement of natural connections between the <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> eml 1, 2 of the Earth-Moon system and sel 1, 2 of the Sun-Earth system. It makes use of the Quasi-Bicircular Problem, a coherent periodic four-body dynamical model of the Sun-Earth-Moon system. The dynamics about the <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> are described by high-order periodic semi-analytical expansions obtained via the parameterization method. In their domain of convergence, such series directly yield initial conditions about the departure <b>libration</b> <b>point.</b> They also allow to estimate the distance between any state along the trajectories and the set of staging orbits (center manifold) at the targeted <b>libration</b> <b>point.</b> The potential connections can then be located and refined in the parameterization space.

40|$|INTRODUCTION As {{part of the}} {{trajectory}} design, some current missions {{and a number of}} recent proposals have included halo or Lissajous orbits {{in the vicinity of the}} L 1 or L 2 <b>libration</b> <b>points,</b> most notably in the Sun-Earth/Moon barycenter system. This effort is directed toward comparison and further development of two particular station [...] keeping approaches that can be used to maintain spacecraft near such <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> trajectories. Each type of analysis offers unique insights into the problem that may be mutually beneficial. In this case, the investigation is conducted in the quicker-Earth-Moon system; the reference orbit is a halo orbit computed in a full solar system model. Halo and Lissajous orbits are solutions that represent bounded motion in the vicinity of a collinear <b>libration</b> <b>point.</b> The problem of controlling a spacecraft moving near an inherently unstable <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> orbit is of current interest.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to demonstrate the use of sail propulsion to stabilize a spacecraft about an artificial <b>libration</b> <b>point.</b> It was demonstrated that the constant acceleration from a solar sail had the potential to be used to generate artificial <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> in the Earth-sun three-body problem. This was achieved by directing the thrust due to the sail such that it added to the centripetal and gravitational forces. A potential alternative to stabilizing a sail about an artificial <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> was to fix the attitude of the solar sail and actuate the lightness number. Sail lightness number β was the ratio of the solar radiation pressure acceleration to the solar gravitational acceleration. This lightness number control, called β, offered the potential of passive stabilization of a sail about artificial <b>libration</b> <b>points.</b> The setting of the circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) was also used to assess the use of β control where the massless body was a solar sail and the primaries were the Sun and Earth...|$|R

40|$|The {{invariant}} manifold {{structures of}} the collinear <b>libration</b> <b>points</b> for the restricted three-body problem {{provide the framework for}} understanding transport phenomena from a geometric point of view. In particular, the stable and unstable invariant manifold tubes associated to <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> orbits are the phase space conduits transporting material between primary bodies for separate three-body systems. Tubes can be used to construct new spacecraft trajectories, such as a “Petit Grand Tour ” of the moons of Jupiter. Previous work focused on the planar circular restricted three-body problem. The current work extends the results to the three dimensional case. Besides providing a full description of different kinds of libration motions in a large vicinity of these points, the paper shows the existence of heteroclinic connections between pairs of libration orbits, one around the <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> L 1 and the other around L 2. Since these connections are asymptotic orbits, no maneuver is needed to perform the transfer from one <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> orbit to the other.

Initially, {{the analysis is}} based in the circular restricted three-body problem to utilize {{the framework of the}} invariant manifolds. Various departure scenarios are compared, including arcs that leverage manifolds associated with the Sun-Earth L(sub 2) orbits as well as non-manifold trajectories. For the manifold options, ballistic transfers from Earth-Moon L(sub 2) <b>libration</b> <b>point</b> orbits to Sun-Earth L(sub 1) /L(sub 2) halo orbits are first computed.
