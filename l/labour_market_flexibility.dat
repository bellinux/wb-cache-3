Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were made in public finances.

2500|$|Not all judges {{took the}} same view. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner home-working ladies {{stitching}} flaps onto trousers were held to be employees {{within the meaning of}} the Act. The leading judge, Stephenson LJ, held that [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] was {{nothing to do with the}} promise of future work, but simply the exchange of work for a wage, and control over one's job by the employer in the employment contract. Before the case reached the Court of Appeal, a young Tony Blair had been arguing the exact opposite in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, that O'Kelly's case should be followed. Agency workers were presumed to fall outside the scope of protective employment legislation. In 1997, when Tony Blair led New Labour to election victory, the approach to employment policy he brought was one of upholding <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>flexibility.</b> The position of agency workers was reaffirmed when Derry Irvine was appointed Lord Chancellor, and he sat in on, and gave the leading judgement in, Carmichael v National Power plc. He reasserted his view of [...] "mutuality of obligation". It is notable that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 removed the power of the Lord Chancellor to decide on cases in this manner; it now being an incursion on the separation of powers within government.|$|E
2500|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft Temporary and Agency Worker Directive (...) [...] This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to agency regulation, {{in the interests of}} <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>flexibility.</b> According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the draft Directive in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its [...] and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6 week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights click in (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City have been calling for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12 week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant step back from the protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only for pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E

40|$|The paper takes a {{comparative}} {{perspective on the}} <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> impact on G 20 and EU countries of the financial and economic crisis that began in 2008. It starts from the observation that the decline in employment and rise in unemployment in relation to output or GDP reductions varies significantly across countries. It examines the impacts from an institutional perspective taking into account different channels of external, internal and wage flexibility determined by both the institutional arrangements in place before the crisis and discretionary reforms implemented during the crisis. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} role of permanent and temporary jobs, working time adjustment, wage flexibility and active and passive <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies. The paper shows that, {{at least for the time}} being, unemployment increases have been contained in countries with comparatively strong internal flexibility. At the same time, however, it appears that the crisis has – at least in some cases – contributed to a further dualization of <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> given that risks are allocated unequally across types of employment. crisis, employment, EPL, institutions, dual <b>labour</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>flexibility...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} was to analyze {{differences}} in <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> performance in various <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> regimes during and after the latest recession.

40|$|Politicians of all shades {{argue that}} the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> should be more {{flexible}} and workers more mobile. But {{what does this mean}} in reality? How flexible and mobile are workers likely to be? Is there an ideological base to the language of flexibility? These are some of the issues covered in this book.

The analysis takes place in three chapters, dealing with recruitment for work, skills used in work and perceptions of different types of work and workers. The findings suggest that non-economic forces (such as institutional, social, historical and political phenomena) strongly influence the creation of separate work cultures. Furthermore, it is argued that the reason for differences between work groups being articulated in a defensive fashion reflects the climate of fear in the <b>labour</b> <b>market,</b> where <b>flexibility</b> is associated with a loss of the (often limited) power, control and influence workers have over their position in the <b>labour</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R
40|$|Whether European <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> are {{sufficiently}} flexible to adjust efficiently to adverse shocks and thus avoid {{a rise in}} unemployment has been hotly debated {{for a couple of}} decades. Many studies have argued that European <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> were less flexible that <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> in other OECD countries. As a result of those rigidities, it was argued, the rate of employment corresponding to a given rate of inflation (the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment or NAIRU) was uncomfortably high in most EC member states. Whereas most studies have been based on indirect measures of flexibility, Rudy Douven of the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Analysis (CPB) has attempted to directly measure the responsiveness to shocks of five EU member states, the EU as a whole, the US and the OECD. In a paper published as an ENEPRI Working Paper, Douven, presents calculations of four indicators for <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> performance: <b>flexibility,</b> defined as the responsiveness of wages to change in unemployment, the equilibrium rate of unemployment, and the variability and persistence of this equilibrium rate.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an investigation into}} the potential linkages between the short-run (cyclical) and long-run (secular) movements in economic activity. The investigation is based on an analytically solvable stochastic monetary growth model in which learning-by-doing accounts for endogenous technological change. The dynamic general equilibrium of this model implies that both the first and second moments of disturbances have first-order effects on both the first and second moments of variables. Given this, it is shown that the correlation between the mean and variance of output growth depends fundamentally on two main factors - the source of stochastic fluctuations (real shocks or nominal shocks) and the functioning of the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> (wage <b>flexibility</b> or wage rigidity). These results contradict certain common presumptions and may help to explain certain empirical evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|The low interregional labour {{mobility}} and the incapacity of the Community Budget {{to act as}} a stabilization tool imply that the Spanish <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> should have a high wage flexibility to react quickly in response to asymmetric shocks in the framework defined by the Monetary Union. In this paper, we study the rigidity of wages and its possible determinants using empirical evidence on wage rigidity for the OECD countries from the estimation of wage equations following a Phillips curve specification augmented with expectations. The obtained results permit to affirm that the Spanish <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> performs poorly with a high wage rigidity and as a result with a low capacity to react in response to recessive shocks. The analysis of the determinants of this high rigidity permits to obtain the following conclusions. First, a higher wage flexibility could be obtained through a coordinated and consensuated action of social and economic agents in the wage bargaining process. Second, active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies, specially related to formation, or passive policies, like a decrease in the duration of unemployment subsidies, can also increase wage flexibility.
