50|$|In 1968, the Council of Europe {{began to}} {{study the effects of}} {{technology}} on human rights, recognizing the new threats posed by computer technology that could link and transmit in ways not widely available before. As well, in 1969 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began to examine the implications of personal information leaving the country. All this led council to recommend that policy be developed to protect personal data held by both the private and public sectors, leading to Convention 108. In 1981, Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) was introduced. One of the first privacy laws ever enacted was the Swedish Data Act in 1973, followed by the West German Data Protection Act in 1977 and the French <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> <b>Informatics,</b> Data Banks and Freedoms in 1978.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The European <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> {{privacy and}} {{personal}} data protection and the Italian <b>law</b> <b>on</b> {{personal data protection}} in particular, together with the wide employment of informatics and telematics technologies in Health Care systems, require strong authentication solutions in order to grant access to medical information in a secure way. Many technologies are available, some having been used for years, some others being relatively new. In this paper a critical outline of them is made, focusing on Smart Card technologies and standards. New hardware-token devices are considered and the tests performed at our Health Telematics Laboratory are presented. Technical and economic comparisons and considerations are made, in order to underline new possibilities to deploy security services inside Health Care structures and to the citizen. Mature technologies (such as web access to clinical data, and usage of e-mail to exchange private information) {{can take advantage of}} strong authentication, to be used in critical Health Care environments, thus allowing for wide implementation, acceptance and usage of services based <b>on</b> <b>informatics</b> and telematics technologies in medicine...|$|R
