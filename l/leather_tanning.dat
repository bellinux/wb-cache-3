In May 1861, Gilman turned over the tanning business to his brother Winthrop; George moved his tea business to 129 Front Street. Initially, Gilman & Company was a wholesaler. In early 1863 the firm became a retailer, Great American Tea Company. Quickly, it opened five stores, moving its office and warehouse to 51 Vesey Street.|$|E

25|$|Historically part of {{the hundred}} of Wallington in the county of Surrey, {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest of England Croydon had a church, a mill, and around 365 inhabitants, as {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book of 1086. Croydon expanded in the Middle Ages as a market town and a centre for charcoal production, <b>leather</b> <b>tanning</b> and brewing. The Surrey Iron Railway from Croydon to Wandsworth opened in 1803 and was the world's first public railway. Later nineteenth century railway building facilitated Croydon's growth as a commuter town for London. By the early 20th century, Croydon was an important industrial area, known for car manufacture, metal working and Croydon Airport. In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the service economy, brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the Whitgift Centre, the largest shopping centre in London until 2008. Croydon was amalgamated into Greater London in 1965.|$|E

40|$|The {{vegetable}} tannins are {{the oldest}} tanning agents used in leather industry. They give their natural character and colour to the leathers {{which they are}} applied to, but they have the disadvantage of colour change when {{they are exposed to}} light for prolonged times. In this study light fastness properties of <b>leathers</b> <b>tanned</b> with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured. Lightfastness properties of mimosa and quebracho tannins were found lower. Then these tannins were modified with sulphitation, novalac synthesis and sulphomethylation processes. Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of sulphated total ash and sulphated water-insoluble ash, determination of water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the <b>leathers</b> <b>tanned</b> with modified mimosa and quebracho tannins. From comparison of results, it was understood that sulpmethylation process can be used for production of leathers with higher lightfastness and without major change on chemical properties. When chemical properties of <b>leathers</b> <b>tanned</b> with modified quebracho and mimosa are considered: volatile matter, sulphated total ash and sulphated water- insoluble ash, water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, hide substance and formaldehyde contents were found compatible with standard mimosa and quebracho. However degree of tannage and matter soluble in dichloromethane values were found lower, which means some enhancements in modification or fatliquoring process should be considered. ...|$|R

Notley constructed a landing {{at the mouth of}} the Palo Colorado River like that at Bixby Landing to the south. The tanbark was loaded by cable onto waiting vessels anchored offshore at Notley's Landing. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of tanbark were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds. A small village grew up around Notley's Landing from 1898 to 1907. [...] Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created.|$|E

The plating was carried out by spraying using spraying-gun one, two, and three times, and repeated three times for each treatment to chrome plated metal, gold plated metal and roasted metal. The smaples were then pinned on a piece of chrome <b>tanning</b> <b>leather</b> and vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leather,</b> whereas the test carried out was wet and dry rub fastness. Data from completely randomized design are analyzed by factorial pattern according to Gasperz (1991), showed that there was not significant effect on plating neither metal on chrome and vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> having been stored for one, two, or three months, neither on similar things having not been stored yet.
