40|$|Many brands today {{introduce}} <b>limited</b> <b>edition</b> (<b>LE)</b> {{products as}} part of their product line. However, {{little is known about the}} conditions under which a brand should introduce an LE product or the competitive implications of doing so. We investigate this issue using a game theoretic model of a market where two brands compete for consumers who desire exclusivity. Our analysis shows that adding an LE product has a positive direct effect on brand profits through the increased willingness of consumers to pay for such a product, but also has a negative strategic effect by increasing price competition between brands. These effects result in different conclusions depending on the nature of brand differentiation. When brands differ in quality, we show that only the high-quality brand may gain in comparison to a scenario where there are no LE products. Although a low-quality brand may offer an LE product as a defensive strategy, its profits are lower than would be in a world without LE products because of the negative strategic effect. When we consider brands that are differentiated on a horizontal attribute such as taste, we find that the negative strategic effects cause lower equilibrium profits if both brands introduce LE products. Yet brands cannot avoid introducing LE products because they face a. game theory, marketing strategy, product management, pricing research, limited edition products...|$|E
5000|$|Schon's first guitar was an {{acoustic}} Stella, followed {{two years later}} by a Gibson ES-335. When the 335 was stolen, he {{replaced it with a}} '56 Les Paul Goldtop reissue that he used for many years. Schon has used Gibson guitars over the years, and had a <b>limited</b> <b>edition</b> signature <b>Les</b> Paul model called the Neal Schon Signature Model Custom Les Paul, of which Gibson made only 35, according to the Gibson Custom website (80 according to Neal Schon's website). He has previously employed Godin guitars on his 1995 solo album Beyond the Thunder, and more recently uses Paul Reed Smith guitars. In the late 1980s, Schon manufactured (through Jackson Guitars and later Larrivee) and played his own line of guitars. Simply named Schon, about 200 of the Jackson-produced models were made. A white Schon guitar can be clearly seen in the music video for the Journey song [...] "Girl Can't Help It", as well as a gold version in the Journey videos for [...] "I'll Be Alright Without You" [...] and [...] "Be Good to Yourself". A Gibson Les Paul Super Custom {{can be seen in the}} video for the Journey song [...] "Anyway You Want It." [...] Recently he has been seen using a Seven String Ibanez Universe, which was a gift from Steve Vai as documented in the liner notes of the Hardline - Double Eclipse album. On the song [...] "Lights", he uses a Fender Stratocaster later equipped with a Floyd Rose tremolo.|$|R

50|$|Holden had {{a limited}} number of HJ coupe panel sets in 1975 and the {{decision}} was made to do something special with them The solution was to create the <b>Limited</b> <b>Edition,</b> or <b>LE,</b> which was not released until 27 September 1976. 600+ body shells were assembled at the Pagewood body plant as HJ bodies in white late in 1975, but due to delays the HX series came around before LE production begun, thus the cars had to be converted to HX which meant body shell changes. Some of those bodies were utilized to build HJ coupes prior to the cessation of HJ coupe production partway through 1976 and prior to the end of the HJ series. All LE were painted an exclusive metallic colour called LE Red. The LE was not badged or officially referred to as a Monaro. The LE was an amalgam of prestige and surplus parts (including an eight-track cartridge player well after cassette tapes were common), in effect a combination of Monaro GTS and Statesman Caprice components. The LE had a price tag to match: AUD$11,500. The cars were built at the now-defunct Pagewood (Sydney) plant. Production totalled 580 vehicles. The distinctive US sourced honeycomb wheels fitted to the LE, which resembled those of the second generation Pontiac Firebird, were created by a plastic mould adhered to the outside of conventional steel wheel rims. These were a gold painted version of the same wheel that had been available as an option on passenger vehicles since HJ release. The front end styling of this pillarless hardtop resembles a smaller-scale 1971 U.S. specification Chevrolet Caprice.|$|R
