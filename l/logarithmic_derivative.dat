2500|$|A more {{quantitative}} analysis of LEED experimental {{data can be}} achieved by analysis of so-called I-V curves, which are measurements of the intensity versus incident electron energy. The I-V curves can be recorded by using a camera connected to computer controlled data handling or by direct measurement with a movable Faraday cup. The experimental curves are then compared to computer calculations based on the assumption of a particular model system. The model is changed in an iterative process until a satisfactory agreement between experimental and theoretical curves is achieved. A quantitative measure for this agreement is the so-called reliability- or R-factor. A commonly used reliability factor is the one proposed by Pendry. It is expressed in terms of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>derivative</b> of the intensity: ...|$|E

40|$|A gauge {{field is}} usually {{described}} as a connection on a principal bundle. It induces a covariant derivative on associated vector bundles, sections of which represent matter fields. In general, however, {{it is not possible}} to define a covariant derivative on non-linear fiber bundles, i. e. on those which are not vector bundles. We define <b>logarithmic</b> covariant <b>derivatives</b> acting on two special non-linear fiber bundles — on the principal bundle and on the local gauge group bundle. The <b>logarithmic</b> <b>derivatives</b> map from sections of these bundles to the sections of the local gauge algebra bundle.

40|$|We prove some {{interesting}} multiplicative relations which hold between the coefficients of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>derivatives</b> obtained {{in a few}} simple ways from F_q-linear formal power series. Since the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>derivatives</b> connect power sums to elementary symmetric functions via the Newton identities, we establish, as applications, new identities between important quantities of function field arithmetic, such as the Bernoulli-Carlitz fractions and power sums {{as well as their}} multi-variable generalizations. Resulting understanding of their factorizations has arithmetic significance, as well as applications to function field zeta and multizeta values evaluations and relations between them. Using specialization/generalization arguments, we provide much more general identities on linear forms providing a switch between power sums for positive and negative powers. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

Several distinct examples of such systems are presented, and a theorem on the transcendence degree of the differential closure of the eld generated by all thetanulls is established.
