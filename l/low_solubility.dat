5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes {{with food and}} water, but because of its <b>low</b> <b>solubility,</b> this exposure is negligible.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of titanium is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100°C, the {{concentration of}} titanium in water {{is estimated to be}} less than 10−7 M at pH 7. The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.|$|E

50|$|Dissolution rates vary by {{orders of}} {{magnitude}} between different systems. Typically, very low dissolution rates parallel <b>low</b> <b>solubilities,</b> and substances with high solubilities exhibit high dissolution rates, {{as suggested by the}} Noyes-Whitney equation. However, this is not a rule.|$|R

5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
5|$|While {{balloons}} {{are perhaps}} the best known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, <b>low</b> <b>solubility,</b> high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E

Because {{of the unique}} molecular structure, all-aromatic thermotropic liquid crystal polymers exhibit outstanding processing properties, excellent barrier properties, <b>low</b> <b>solubilities</b> and <b>low</b> coefficients of thermal expansion in the processing direction.

40|$|Classical {{diffusion}} measurements in {{intermetallic compounds}} are often complicated by low diffusivities or <b>low</b> <b>solubilities</b> {{of the elements}} of interest. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry for measurements over a relatively shallow spatial range may be used {{to solve the problem of}} low diffusivity. In order to simultaneously obtain measurements on important impurity elements with <b>low</b> <b>solubilities,</b> the authors have used ion implantation to supersaturate a narrow layer near the surface. Single crystal NiAl was implanted with either {sup 12 }C or both {sup 56 }Fe and {sup 12 }C in order to investigate the measurement of substitutional (Fe) versus interstitial (C) tracer diffusion and the cross effect of both substitutional and interstitial diffusion. When C alone was implanted negligible diffusion was observed over the range of times and temperatures investigated. When both Fe and C were implanted together significantly enhanced diffusion of the C was observed, which is apparently associated with the movement of Fe. This supports one theory of dynamic strain aging in Fe alloys NiAl...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 109 - 114). Sulphide as a {{precipitating agent}} is effective as it facilitates {{the removal of}} heavy metals to very low residual concentrations (ppm - ppb levels) over a wide pH range, owing to the <b>low</b> <b>solubilities</b> (Ksp) of metal sulphides. However, previous work on metal sulphide precipitation has highlighted a number of challenges. The <b>low</b> <b>solubilities</b> of metal sulphides {{in combination with the}} rapid kinetics of sulphide precipitation leads to rapid, uncontrolled metal sulphide precipitate formation. The extremely high supersaturations result in high rates of nucleation, leading to the formation of particles with undesirable characteristics. In this thesis, to gain insight on the metal sulphide precipitation of nickel and cobalt from the RES, a simplified model system, consisting of a synthetic NiS 04 solution with a concentration of 200 ppm Ni 2 +, was utilised to determine the effect of H 2 S(g) as a precipitating agent...|$|R
5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} have <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} {{lipid bilayer}} and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E

40|$|Two sorghum cultivars, Tababt (low tannin) and Wad Ahmed (high tannin) were {{employed}} for this study. Difference in protein content between the cultivars was observed. Amino acid composition {{showed that the}} cultivars were rich in glutamic acid and deficient in lysine. The proteins of the two cultivars was isolated and digested by chymotrypsin. Then, the native and digested proteins were polymerized by microbial transglutaminase (TGase). Structural and functional properties of the native, digested and polymerized proteins were also investigated. SDS-PAGE pattern of the polymerized proteins showed that, TGase treatment resulted in proteins of higher molecular mass above the stacking gel, indicating that the enzyme catalyses the cross link of the protein units even after digestion. Moreover, the free amino groups of the polymerized proteins were greatly reduced. The native and chymotrypsin digested protein {{were found to be}} soluble at acid and alkaline pH, with the <b>lowest</b> <b>solubility</b> observed at pH 4. The solubility of the protein digest polymer improved significantly at all pH levels, with the shift of the <b>lowest</b> <b>solubility</b> to pH 6. The protein polymer started to coagulate when the heating temperature exceeded 50 oC. The digest polymer, on the other hand, resisted heat-induced aggregation up to 60 oC; thereafter, its solubilit...|$|R

25|$|Particularly {{for active}} fibers, pure silica {{is usually not}} a very {{suitable}} host glass, because it exhibits a <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> for rare-earth ions.

50|$|Granular MgO {{is often}} blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material, {{which is also}} {{commonly}} of a low (acidic) pH, in order to drive the pH into the 8-10 range where most metals are at their <b>lowest</b> <b>solubilities.</b> Metal-hydroxide complexes {{have a tendency to}} precipitate out of aqueous solution in the pH range of 8-10. MgO is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to Portland cement, lime, kiln dust products, power generation waste products, and various proprietary products due to MgO's superior buffering capacity, cost effectiveness, and ease/safety of handling.|$|R
50|$|Titanium nitride is also {{produced}} intentionally within some steels by judicious addition of titanium to the alloy. TiN forms {{at very high}} temperatures because of its very low enthalpy of formation, and even nucleates directly from the melt in secondary steelmaking. It forms discrete, micrometre-sized cubic particles at grain boundaries and triple points, and prevents grain growth by Ostwald ripening up to very high homologous temperatures. Titanium nitride has the <b>lowest</b> <b>solubility</b> product of any metal nitride or carbide in austenite, a useful attribute in microalloyed steel formulas.|$|R
25|$|The {{end-product}} of catabolism {{of protein}} metabolism in animals is nitrogen. Animals must excrete this {{in the form of}} nitrogenous compounds. Ostriches are uricotelic. They excrete nitrogen as the complex nitrogenous waste compound uric acid, and related derivatives. Uric acid's <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> in water gives a semi-solid paste consistency to the ostrich's nitrogenous waste.|$|E
25|$|Distinct phases {{may also}} exist {{within a given}} state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be {{differentiated}} based on solubility as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a <b>low</b> <b>solubility</b> in water. Solubility is {{the maximum amount of}} a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase.

50|$|Since {{the drug}} is transported in aqueous media like blood and {{intracellular}} fluid, {{it has to be}} sufficiently water-soluble in the absolute sense (i.e. must have a minimum chemical solubility in order to be effective). Solubility in water can be estimated from the number of hydrogen bond donors vs. alkyl sidechains in the molecule. <b>Low</b> water <b>solubility</b> translates to slow absorption and action. Too many hydrogen bond donors, on the other hand, lead to <b>low</b> fat <b>solubility,</b> so that the drug cannot penetrate the cell membrane to reach the inside of the cell.|$|R
