40|$|Vehicle {{noise and}} {{vibration}} levels are basic parameters in passenger comfort. Both static and dynamic stiffness of sheet metal parts is commonly increased by means of <b>stiffening</b> <b>ribs.</b> Vibrations are also reduced by adding a layer of damping material on the floor, the roof, the firewall {{and other parts of}} the vehicle. In common practice the panels to be treated are ribbed according to criteria based on the designer’s experience, rather than on well defined design procedures and are uniformly covered by a layer of damping material. However, these are not efficient design solutions, especially with regard to the effectiveness of vibration reduction and to weight containment.

In particular, an effort is made here to study {{the characteristics of a}} die cast automotive front seat backrest frame and develop a method for predicting the optimized material and support rib distribution which provides a lightweight seat which satisfies both strength and deflection requirements in a design space which includes the action of multiple load cases. An existing commercially available die cast backrest frame serves as the reference design space.

Stress {{analysis}} {{is an essential}} part of the design process and is also an indispensable tool for optimizing structural design to meet multidisciplinary performance requirements. The purpose of this study is to determine natural vibration frequency of intake manifold on the natural gas motorcycle by using finite element modal analysis. Besides that, the stress and displacements of the manifold structure are also been determined. When the motorcycle engine is running, the engine will cause some vibration due to unbalance condition of the engine. Vibration created by the engine will be transmitted to all neighboring component including intake manifold as well as the air fuel mixer. Intake manifold is next to the engine which is the source of the vibration. Thus, it takes greater impact of the transmitted vibration as compare to other components. Computer simulation technique using Finite Element method has been used to simulate this problem. Finite Element structure analysis was employed to study the stress distribution and natural frequency of the intake manifold. Finite Element model of the intake manifold is developed and analyzed. The effect of localize <b>stiffening</b> with <b>ribs</b> on intake manifold is considered to reduce the level of the vibration.
