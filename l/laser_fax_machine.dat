50|$|UFPs {{are both}} {{manufactured}} and naturally occurring. Hot volcanic lava, ocean spray, and smoke are common natural UFPs sources. UFPs {{can be intentionally}} fabricated as are fine particles to serve a vast range of applications in both medicine and technology. Other UFPs are byproducts, like emissions, from specific processes, combustion reactions, or equipment such as printer toner and automobile exhaust. In 2014, an air quality study found harmful ultrafine particles from the takeoffs and landings at Los Angeles International Airport to be of much greater magnitude than previously thought. There are a multitude of indoor sources that include {{but are not limited}} to <b>laser</b> printers, <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> photocopiers, the peeling of citrus fruits, cooking, tobacco smoke, penetration of contaminated outdoor air, chimney cracks and vacuum cleaners.|$|R
40|$|The 34700 is a compact, high-efficiency {{power supply}} with on-chip power MOSFETs that {{features}} three step-down switching regulators and one low dropout linear regulator. The switching regulators utilize {{voltage mode control}} with external compensation, allowing flexibility in optimizing {{the performance of the}} 34700 for a given application. The 34700 is ideal for space constrained applications where multiple power rails are required and simplicity of design and implementation of the power supply is necessary. Over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature protection features ensure robust and reliable operation. Fixed switching frequency, internal soft-start, and internal power MOSFETs enable rapid power supply design and development. The 34700 is well suited for power supply designs in wide variety of applications, including set top boxes, cable modems, <b>laser</b> printers, <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> point-of-sale terminals, small appliances, telecom line cards, and DVD players...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{everyone}} has them [...] an old relic 286 or 386 -based personal computer collecting dust; a {{dot matrix printer}} {{that has long been}} replaced by ink jets and <b>laser</b> jets; a <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> or copier that is considered a dinosaur by current technology standards. Rapid hardware and software changes have resulted in the rapid obsolescence of computer systems and peripheral devices. This rapid turnover of computer systems generates increasing quantities of computer and electronic scrap. What is computer and electronic scrap? Computer and electronic scrap is defined as used and unwanted computers, mainframes, monitors, printers, <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> copiers and related accessories such as motherboards, keyboards, and disk drives. It is {{one of the fastest growing}} waste streams and is expected to continue increasing as society becomes more reliant on technology. What are the consequences of disposing computer and electronic scrap? Computer and electronic scrap contains many resources that can be recovered and reused. It also contains many toxic and hazardous substances that can be released to the environment when disposed in landfills. Currently, companies are losing millions of dollars each year because they do not recycle their computer and electronic assets which contain recoverable amounts of many materials, including precious metals such as silver and gold. By recycling computer and electronic scrap, you may be able to recover some of the initial costs of the computer system or qualify for potential tax deductions...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} the power draw, power quality, and operating profiles {{of a number}} of <b>fax</b> <b>machines.</b> Our aim was to quantify <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> energy consumption and to evaluate the potential of energy conservation through power management. The results established that <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> when idle, draw between 7 and 30 % of nameplate rated power, with power factors around 0. 5, and total harmonic distortion in the current of over 150 %. We then used <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> activity reports to analyze the usage of 32 <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> over a 12 week period. These <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> were active for an average of only 3. 7 % of the time they were switched on, although there was considerable variation about this mean. Further, an average of 86. 4 % of on-time could be eliminated by automatically switching off the <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> after 15 minutes of inactivity. Such power management could realize savings of around $ 19 per <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> per year. In addition, we found that around 9. 3 % of fax transactions were halted due to transaction errors, and that up to 23. 8 % of faxed pages were cover sheets. Efforts to reduce transaction errors and the use of cover sheets could realize additional energy, time and paper savings, and reduce telephone charges. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

5000|$|In {{multifunction}} or all-in-one printers, <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> photocopiers and scanners, {{an automatic}} document feeder or ADF is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page {{at a time}} into a scanner or copier, allowing the user to scan, and thereby copy, print, or fax, multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page. Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen (the [...] "glass") or through a document feeder. The vast majority of <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes. Due to the ubiquity of ADF in <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> some <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> owners use the <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> as a scanner, faxing multi-page documents to themselves. Document feeders are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200.|$|R
50|$|The law {{has often}} been {{illustrated}} using the example of fax machines: a single <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> is useless, but the value of every <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> increases with {{the total number of}} <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> in the network, because the total number of people with whom each user may send and receive documents increases.
