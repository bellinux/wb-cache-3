The excavator GJW 111 was taken example in this article, the measures of the Automated lubricate System based on {{the control of the}} testing of working states was studied, that is, the automated pouring grease, the working state test and the alarm when wrong of the every <b>lubricating</b> <b>point</b> on the machine is accomplished together by the control sub-system,lubricating system and some correlated components. The principle and the function of the system was described. The work condition was analyzed, and at last it was about the plan of the software and the hardware of the system. At present, the pumping grease lubrication of engineering machine are mostly done by manual work, which have disadvantages of long shut down maintaining time and low laboring productivity. In addition, the manual grease pouring quantity is difficult to be nicely controlled; the lubrication statuses of the lubricating points are difficult to check; and the labor load is heave too.

Time and human resource constraints and sometimes the physical location on machine often makes it impractical to manually <b>lubricate</b> the <b>points.</b> As a result, production cycles, machine availability, and manpower availability dictate the intervals at which machinery is lubricated which is not optimal for the point requiring lubrication.

5000|$|The {{design process}} {{leading to the}} GAZ 21 began in November 1953. Alexander Nevzorov, head of the design team, was given a free hand to develop {{whatever}} he wanted to reach the objective of competing with American automobiles. The designer Lev Eremeyev decided to follow the fashion set by the Chevrolet Bel Air, Plymouth Savoy, and Ford Mainline; the finished product bears a resemblance to the 1955 Mainline, although according to archive documents the latter was purchased for comparison and onroad testing by GAZ only in the mid-1954, after the prototypes of the GAZ-21 had already been built and tested. The prototype appeared {{in the first quarter}} of 1954, powered by an inline four with overhead camshaft (driven by chain) and cross-flow hemi head. Since the OHV engine was not ready in time, production M21s had a [...] sidevalve four, based on the GAZ-20's. The Volga was offered with a three-speed transmission, either manual (a [...] "crash box" [...] with no synchromesh) or automatic. Front suspension was independent, while the rear was a live axle with semi-elliptical springs; there were lever shock absorbers on all four corners. Lubrication was by a central oiling system, from a drum and foot-operated pump; the oil lines were prone to puncturing, and not all of the nineteen <b>lubricated</b> <b>points</b> were supplied equally. The Volga offered front seats able to fold flat(an idea also found in the early Plymouth Barracuda - 10 years later) and came standard with cigarette lighter and a radio (at a time when most American-built cars did not have a radio). There were three variants: the standard M21G, an M21B taxi (with a taximeter in place of the radio and bucket seats in front instead of a bench), and a tropical model, the M21GYU, all with the GAZ leaping deer hood ornament. Drag coefficient was a surprisingly good 0.42.|$|R
40|$|The {{rheology}} of soap thickened greases {{has been}} investigated in a cone and plate rheometer and a model that includes base oil viscosity and temperature has been suggested and fitted to the results. With {{the use of a}} bouncing ball apparatus, the pressure coefficient of the limiting shear stress of the greases was determined. It is related to friction in EHL and the results verified the friction reducing properties of the soap thickeners of the grease. Film thickness in EHL of a grease <b>lubricated</b> <b>point</b> contact was measured in a ball and disc apparatus. The initial film thickness was thicker than the film thickness given by the base oil. After some seconds of running the film thickness dropped far below the base oil film thickness, because of insufficient replenishment. Replenishment was studied by looking at the distribution and flow of lubricant around the contact in the ball and disc apparatus. Primary reservoirs and primary bands close to the track of the contact, on the ball and the disc, contained small amounts of grease that constituted a potential supply of lubricant to the inlet of the contact. The majority of the grease was pushed away from the contact initially and seemed no to participate in the lubrication. Soap thickener formations were observed entering the contact in the ball and disc apparatus and cause a local increase in the film thickness that disturbed the normally horseshoe-shaped film thickness map. For lithium greases, the amount and size of the film disturbances were found to be connected with the manufacturing process of the grease and the soap thickener content. A method to evaluate the pressure fluctuations induced by the film thickness disturbances was proposed. The method was verified by comparing film thickness measurements from an oil lubricated contact and the pressure profile calculated from that, with the results from a fully numerical solution. Good agreement was found. The method was applied to a grease lubricated contact and showed significant variations in the pressure, caused by the soap thickener formations.

40|$|The {{introduction}} and {{further development of}} algorithms based on multigrid (multilevel) techniques has resulted in fast and efficient solvers for elastohydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> (EHL) <b>point</b> contact problems. As a result the capability to simulate steady state and transient point contact problems numerically has greatly increased in the past decade.

In this article an overview is given of the essential ingredients of an efficient multigrid algorithm for an EHL point contact problem. Results are presented for some characteristic problems that illustrate today's numerical simulation capability. It is concluded that, with respect to EHL, one of the main questions of {{the last part of the}} century has been answered, i. e. how to solve efficiently the modelling equations such that realistic and highly loaded situations can be simulated. The challenge that researchers and engineers now face is how to translate the new insights into simple rules for design and engineering, and to establish clearly the limits of validity of the models that are used in simulations both on the scale of the contact as a whole as well as on a subcontact scale...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{investigating}} {{the capabilities of}} the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) -R 123 refrigerant for lubricating rolling elastohydrodynamic circular contacts. The viscosity pressure and temperature dependence of this fluid, used in oil-free compressors, are first studied in its liquid phase. Complementary data like density variations are taken from the thermo-physics literature. Besides, film thickness measurements using a ball-on-disk tribometer equipped with an interferometry facility have been performed under pure rolling conditions. For the same operating conditions, film thickness is then predicted from a numerical elastohydrodynamic model in which the viscosity and density dependencies with pressure and temperature are described using physics-based relationships, allowing a quantitative approach. The results obtained from the full numerical model, from the analytical elastohydrodynamic film-thickness expressions, and from the experiments show an acceptable agreement. They clearly reveal that indeed refrigerants can build up a reasonable film thickness for <b>lubricating</b> elastohydrodynamic rolling <b>point</b> contacts...|$|R
40|$|Line and <b>point</b> <b>lubricated</b> {{contacts}} are investigated under steady-state and transient {{conditions with}} an experimental rig employed in previous studies. New data acquisition and signal processing programmes are developed to record and filter the experimental results under transient conditions. Tests {{are carried out}} by varying simultaneously the speeds of both lubricated elements (a spherical or a cylindrical specimen and a disc) {{in order to maintain}} the slide-to-roll ratio constant. With the experimental apparatus used, encouraging results are obtained thanks to the new methodology developed. In particular the arising of friction loops with increasing magnitude by increasing the frequency of the sinusoidal speed variation is found, in agreement with some literature results. The results obtained with the spherical specimen, working mainly in full lubrication regime, show friction loops present at low but not at high values of the slide-to-roll ratio, while the ones carried out by the cylindrical specimen show always a presence of loops under mixed lubrication conditions...|$|R

50|$|Methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) are gaseous at ambient {{temperatures}} and cannot be readily liquefied by pressure alone. Propane (C3H8) is however easily liquefied, and exists in 'propane bottles' mostly as a liquid. Butane (C4H10) is so easily liquefied {{that it provides}} a safe, volatile fuel for small pocket lighters. Pentane (C5H12) is a clear liquid at room temperature, commonly used in chemistry and industry as a powerful nearly odorless solvent of waxes and high molecular weight organic compounds, including greases.

40|$|Dynamic {{effects are}} present in both {{simulated}} and real contacts. The influence of vibrations and other interferences on experimental results of <b>lubricated</b> non conformal <b>point</b> contacts have been investigated. Tests with theoretically constant speed and load have been carried out. Friction force and speed signals have been analysed in particular. Signals have been analysed in the time and frequency domains by investigating firstly some preliminary aspects such as {{the influence of the}} sample rate. Peaks in the frequency domain of the measured quantities have been compared with the theoretical ones calculated considering possible defects of moving elements. The analysis has evidenced the presence of some misalignments and bearing problems. The friction fluctuations have been put in relation to the film thickness variations revealed by the interference images recorded by a new high speed camera. The presence of a part of the friction force generated by dynamic forces directly acting on the load cell, and therefore not related to the lubricated contact, is revealed, evidencing the usefulness of studies combining different methodologies. The detection of the sources of the different signal variations can indicate the ways of possible reduction of the unwanted effects that can also be separated from the effects relevant to the real contacts by opportune filtering methods...|$|R
40|$|Wear is {{considered}} one of the main challenges in the twenty-first century for engineers and designers of mechanical systems. The objective is to understand the wear mechanisms and to seek new solutions - materials, lubricants, additives - to extend the lifetime of components, enable scheduled maintenance and replacement intervals. Research conducted during the past decades shows that wear can be minimized but not eliminated from systems operation due to a large number of parameters which are influencing the evolution of this phenomenon: load, velocity, temperature, type of lubrication as well as the surface roughness. Depending on operation conditions, the occurrence of wear leads to a change in the macro contact geometry of the components. In time, this will affect the functioning of the components, for example: high friction for brakes, clutches and transmissions or low friction for cylinder-piston contact, cam-follower and gears. In this thesis the influence of macroscopic wear on friction in lubricated sliding concentrated contacts is investigated. Experimental wear and friction tests were conducted on different types of <b>lubricated</b> contacts: line, <b>point</b> and elliptical. These tests have shown a change in contact geometry and in operating regime of the systems, i. e. friction level. To understand this, a relation between wear, contact geometry and minimum film thickness is made. In a lubricated contact three zones are distinguished: inlet, contact and outlet zone. The inlet zone dictates the formation of the minimum film thickness between contacting surfaces. When wear is present the contact geometry changes, leading to a modification in pressure distribution. Changes in separation due to wear are modeled based on hydrodynamic theory and are incorporated in a deterministic mixed lubrication friction model. Using this model the transition between the lubrication regimes, as shown in a Stribeck curve, can be predicted. The experimentally obtained results are in agreement with the theoretical simulations. It is shown that increased wear leads to a decreased friction level resulting from the occurrence of the hydrodynamic effects due to a reduced contact pressure. This causes a change in the operating regime of the system. In the one case this changed regime can be considered to be the main cause of failure in a system, whereas in another system it means smooth operation after a period of running-in. The theoretical results are presented in a generalized Stribeck curve. From this, it is possible to select the parameters such that the components of a lubricated system operate in the preferred regime in order to control friction and minimize wear...|$|R
