40|$|This {{report is}} about {{logistic}} efficiency in companies without own production. The authors have interviewed employees working at two companies, Telias store in Skärholmen and Orion Diagnostica AB. The {{purpose of the}} report {{is to find out}} which <b>logistic</b> <b>functions</b> the two companies are using to create efficiency. Today’s markets are more global. Different parts of a product can be made {{in different parts of the}} world. This makes companies more focused on <b>logistic</b> <b>functions.</b> With more competitors on every market, forces organizations to create advantages against the competitors. It’s not enough to reduce the production cost, they have to focus on new areas that are not directly connected to their mane business to have a chance to compete. What <b>logistic</b> <b>functions</b> can make a company without own production more efficient? Theories that are used in this report are about <b>logistic</b> <b>functions</b> that can give positive effects to the company, and that are not directly connected to production. One theory deals with complications such as recourse shortage that makes the business dependent to the supplier. That is an organization theory. The authors have interviewed the employees at the two companies asking questions about how their perspective of their organization is working compared to the theories. From the answers the authors where able to se differences and resemblances between the two companies and make some conclusions based on the theories. The two companies have different customers and sell very different types of products. Telia are a phone operator that sells mobile phones, home telephones and internet connections, along with contracts and services connected two the products. Orion Diagnostica is selling test equipment to diagnose a patient’s condition. They are selling mostly to hospitals and local doctors. Not for private use...|$|R

As a specific example, we have studied TSI for the doubling and the <b>logistic</b> <b>functions,</b> which are standard functions in studying chaos.

Among these activities, walking is the most important daily motion. Studying the evolution of the gait cycle through the analysis of the human center of force is beneficial to predict any abnormal walking pattern. The analysis is based on the use of pressure-based mapping system that collects pressure and force measurement during the gait cycle. This paper deals mainly with the detection of the main characteristics of the gait phases. To this end, a segmentation of the center of force of the human body measure through the in-shoe pressure mapping system is performed to identify the gait phases. The proposed segmentation approach consists in modeling each segment by a regression model and using <b>logistic</b> <b>functions</b> to model the transitions between segments.
