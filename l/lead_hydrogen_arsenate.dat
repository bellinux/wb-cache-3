40|$|Abstract Background The genome of Arthrobacter sp. strain FB 24 {{contains}} a chromate resistance determinant (CRD), {{consisting of a}} cluster of 8 genes located on a 10. 6 kb fragment of a 96 kb plasmid. The CRD includes chrA, which encodes a putative chromate efflux protein, and three genes with amino acid similarities to the amino and carboxy termini of ChrB, a putative regulatory protein. There are also three novel genes {{that have not been}} previously associated with chromate resistance in other bacteria; they encode an oxidoreductase (most similar to malate:quinone oxidoreductase), a functionally unknown protein with a WD 40 repeat domain and a lipoprotein. To delineate the contribution of the CRD genes to the FB 24 chromate [Cr(VI) ] response, we evaluated the growth of mutant strains bearing regions of the CRD and transcript expression levels in response to Cr(VI) challenge. Results A chromate-sensitive mutant (strain D 11) was generated by curing FB 24 of its 96 -kb plasmid. Elemental analysis indicated that chromate-exposed cells of strain D 11 accumulated three times more chromium than strain FB 24. Introduction of the CRD into strain D 11 conferred chromate resistance comparable to wild-type levels, whereas deletion of specific regions of the CRD led to decreased resistance. Using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, we show that expression of each gene within the CRD is specifically induced in response to chromate but not by <b>lead,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide or <b>arsenate.</b> Higher levels of chrA expression were achieved when the chrB orthologs and the WD 40 repeat domain genes were present, suggesting their possible regulatory roles. Conclusion Our findings indicate that chromate resistance in Arthrobacter sp. strain FB 24 is due to chromate efflux through the ChrA transport protein. More importantly, new genes have been identified as having significant roles in chromate resistance. Collectively, the functional predictions of these additional genes suggest the involvement of a signal transduction system in the regulation of chromate efflux and warrants further study. </p...|$|R

The mineral is an arsenate mineral formed as a secondary mineral in the oxidized zone of sulphide deposits. We have studied the barahonaite mineral using a combination of Raman and infrared spectroscopy.

2500|$|The chart shows {{solubility}} curves {{for some}} typical solid inorganic salts (temperature is in degrees Celsius i.e. kelvins minus 273). Many salts behave like barium nitrate and disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>arsenate,</b> and show a large increase in solubility with temperature. Some solutes (e.g., sodium chloride in water) exhibit solubility that is fairly independent of temperature. A few, such as calcium sulfate (gypsum) and cerium(III) sulfate, become less {{soluble in water}} as temperature increases. This {{is also the case}} of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) whose solubility at 70°C is about half of its value at 25°C. The dissolution of calcium hydroxide in water is also an exothermic process and obeys to the Le Chatelier's principle. A lowering of temperature will thus favour the dissolution heat elimination and increases the equilibrium constant of dissolution of Ca(OH)2, and so increase its solubility at low temperature. This temperature dependence is sometimes referred to as [...] "retrograde" [...] or [...] "inverse" [...] solubility. Occasionally, a more complex pattern is observed, as with sodium sulfate, where the less soluble decahydrate crystal loses water of crystallization at 32°C to form a more soluble anhydrous phase.|$|R

40|$|Band 3 is the anion {{exchange}} protein in red blood cells. It {{is the most}} abundant protein in the erythrocyte membrane and is the most heavily used ion transport protein in vertebrates. Physiologically, it transports Cl- into {{or out of the}} red blood cell and then transports HCO 3 - in the opposite direction so that electroneutrality is maintained {{on both sides of the}} membrane. The {{anion exchange}} mechanism of band 3 is unique among the ion transport proteins. It transports anions by a 'ping-pong' mechanism, meaning it is a gated protein which effects the one-for-one exchange of anions across the membrane. It is also unusual because it transports a wide variety of anions in a very efficient manner (up to 200 sec- 1). An arginine has been implicated in the binding and transport of chloride across the red blood cell membrane. The primary goal of this work was to determine the location of that arginine. A second goal was to investigate divalent anion binding to the active site. 35 Cl NMR was used to investigate the competition of chloride with divalent anions at the chloride binding site of band 3. These studies were performed to determine if divalent anions compete with chloride for binding at the active site. These investigations indicate that molybdate, sulfate, and sulfate's analogue selenate interfere with chloride's binding to the transport site. Hydrogen phosphate and its analogue <b>hydrogen</b> <b>arsenate</b> also appear to compete with chloride for binding at the transport site. However, it appears that chloride binding is only fractionally inhibited by these two dianions. This is demonstrated by the inability of hydrogen phosphate and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>arsenate</b> to saturate the transport site and completely inhibit transport site linebroadening. pH profiles of chloride competition with divalent anions were also obtained. It appears that these large, inorganic, hydrated, approximately spherical molecules can reach the transport site in the band 3 channel but not as effectively as chloride. The goal of the biochemical studies was to determine the location of the band 3 arginine anion binding site. The complete sequence of human band 3 is was not known until very recently, but it has been available for chickens and mice since 1986. On the basis of these sequences, Vogelaar and Chan have modeled transmembrane helices to determine the number of times the protein traverses the membrane(1). In order to insure that an arginine preferentially labeled by 14 C-phenylglyoxal was indeed at a transmembrane peptide and to verify the model, many of the transmembrane sequences have been isolated. This was accomplished by modification of a technique developed to separate hydrophobic synthetic peptides(2). The band 3 transmembrane helices are tightly associated and very similar in hydrophobicity. Of a probable total of 14 transmembrane helices, the N-termini and/or C-termini have been determined for 6 of them. Because x-ray crystallography has been difficult to achieve for membrane systems (rhodopsin and the reaction center are two that that have been crystallized), this method provides a simple and relatively inexpensive method of studying membrane protein topography. Finally, 14 C-phenylglyoxal has shown the location of at least one arginine in band 3 when labeled by the method of Zaki(3). (By this method, two to three arginines are labeled per band 3 monomer.) The location of the second arginine has been restricted to two possible other transmembrane peptides (modeled helices 10 and 14). The active site arginine is probably at position R 748 in the mouse erythrocyte band 3 sequence...|$|R
