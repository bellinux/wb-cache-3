40|$|The partial fuel stratification, {{by means}} of direct fuel injection, {{is one of the}} most {{suitable}} combustion strategies in order to overcome the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> control and operating range of HCCI engines. In this work, a multidimensional model, coupled with a detailed kinetic mechanism for ethanol oxidation, is used to investigate the performance of a partially stratified charge CI engine fueled by ethanol. The model, which accounts for turbulence effects on combustion, has been validated in a previous work, against experimental results in terms of both HCCI engine performance and emissions. In this work, computations have been carried out by varying the fraction of the fuel stratified charge and the injection timing and by considering different flow structures within the cylinder. By increasing the amount of stratified fuel, the rate of the pressure rise and the heat release rate reduce, while the peak of the heat release rate delays, since the zones of the chamber, where the liquid fuel is located, are relatively cold and rich to ignite, thus the combustion process slows down. However, the ignition timing remains nearly constant, since the remaining zones of the combustion chamber are characterized by nearly uniform conditions, in terms of temperature and mixture composition, typical of an HCCI combustion. On the other hand, by increasing the fraction of the directly injected fuel, higher values of the maximum temperature are reached, thus producing an increase of NOx emissions. In order to avoid high values of temperature during combustion, the fuel stratification can be coupled with both swirl and early injection timing since, in both cases, a more uniform distribution of the injected fuel is obtained before ignition. Finally, simulations have been performed by increasing the fuel load up to 30...|$|R
40|$|Analytical work is {{presented}} for the spontaneous <b>ignition</b> <b>of</b> a hydrogen jet emanating from a slot into air. A similarity {{solution of the}} flowfield was obtained. This was combined with the species and energy conservation equations, which were solved using activation energy asymptotics. <b>Limits</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>ignition</b> were identified as functions of slot width, flow rate, and temperatures of the hydrogen jet and ambient air. Two scenarios are examined: a cool jet flowing into a hot ambient and a hot jet flowing into a cool ambient. For both scenarios, ignition is favored with an increase of either the ambient temperature or the hydrogen supply temperature. Moreover, for the hot ambient scenario, a decrease in local fuel Lewis number also promotes ignition. The Lewis number of the oxidizer only has a weak effect on ignition. Because spontaneous ignition is very sensitive to temperature, ignition is predicted to occur {{near the edge of}} the jet if the hydrogen is cooler than the air and on the centerline if the hydrogen is hotter than the air...|$|R
40|$|Using diluted methane/air {{mixtures}} {{in internal}} combustion engines has a potential of reducing emissions and increasing efficiency. However, the ignition systems used today show difficulties igniting lean mixtures. For this purpose {{a new high}} frequency (HF) ignition system using pulse generators and a resonance circuit to achieve a controlled number of sparks during a controlled period of time has been developed. A first prototype of this high frequency system has been tested in a flow-reactor and compared to a conventional ignition system. Results show that the high frequency system improves the flame development under lean conditions compared to the conventional system. Higher frequencies have higher capability of igniting lean mixtures than lower frequencies. Lower spark frequencies were found to travel faster across the electrodes than high frequencies and also compared to the conventional system. High pressure and high flow rates affected the lean <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> all <b>ignition</b> strategies, but especially high spark frequencies had difficulties igniting the charge under high pressures, due to the resonant frequency changing with pressure.

Three different regions are shown to occur in supersonic diffusive combustion. The first region is close to the injector exit, where the flow may be considered frozen for the main reacting species and where the radical concentration is being built up. This is the ignition delay region. A simplified kinetic scheme of the H 2 -air reaction is deduced for this region. The linear differential equation giving the H concentration has been discussed and integrated in a representative case. In terms of this solution the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ignition</b> region may be determined. Far from the injector exit the flow is close to chemical equilibrium. The reaction region is very thin, so that convection effects may be neglected.

40|$|Spark-ignited {{internal}} combustion engines {{are in the}} use for over 130 years (first example was presented by Otto in 1876). The engine development is directed to more power, better efficiency and lower emissions. Mixture formation and in-cylinder motion are the main parameters of the combustion process improvement. One of the effective methods of engine development is lean combustion. Application of lean-burn combustion systems in spark ignitron engines has been proposed many times. Such systems have several important advantages in comparison with conventional systems. Lean-burn combustion makes possible engine operation at high compression ratio, equivalent to high thermal efficiency and at low emission of toxic components of the combustion gases. Lean-burn combustion is also a subject of serious limitations, requiring remedial steps. General limitations are introduced by a fall of the reaction rate, equivalent to increased time of combustion. Lean-burn combustion introduces also changes to flame structure: it contributes with increased flame thickness and with a rise of quenching distance. These changes influence <b>limit</b> conditions <b>of</b> spark <b>ignition.</b> The only solution omitting this threat might be obtained by replacing <b>of</b> a spark <b>ignition</b> by another ignition system or by application <b>of</b> a spark <b>ignition</b> system with increased distance between electrodes and with much higher ignition energy.

40|$|Mine explosions {{remain a}} threat to {{underground}} coal miners, requiring constant vigilance to prevent accumulations of combustible gasses and dusts and to <b>limit</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b> Accumulations <b>of</b> combustible dust in coal mines create the risk of large-scale explosions that can result in multiple deaths and traumatic injuries. The explosion hazard can be effectively controlled {{through the application of}} rock dust, such as limestone dust, to render inert the combustible coal dust generated during the mining and transport of coal (see publication 2011 - 196 at www. cdc. gov/niosh/docs/impact). Traditionally, determining when additional rock dust should be applied or evaluating the effectiveness of existing rock dust application has been limited to a subjective visual evaluation or to the collection and laboratory analysis of dust samples - a process that requires days or weeks to identify a hazard. For decades, miners have been able to monitor the concentrations of methane and other combustible gasses using handheld, direct reading gas detectors. These detectors have allowed miners to take immediate action to dilute gasses and prevent explosions. With this same purpose in mind, researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a real-time dust explosibility measuring instrument to provide instant feedback to miners on the relative hazard of dust accumulations in the mine and the effectiveness of their rock dusting practices. This instrument, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM), is a simple-to-use handheld device that provides a pass/fail assessment of coal mine dust samples. With this device, miners, mine operators and regulators will have the information necessary to take immediate action to eliminate an explosion hazard. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "August 2011.

Accurate prediction <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> phenomenon requires a robust ignition model. Therefore, detailed and semi-detailed chemical kinetics {{have been developed for}} various fuels, such as [1 - 3]. These kinds of kinetics models are able to reasonably predict ignition performance in engines. However, detailed or semi-detailed kinetics models usually include many species and reactions. The use of these kinds of detailed or semi-detailed models in the prediction <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> and combustion process in engines is still too computationally expensive today. Therefore, reduced or simplified kinetics models that include <b>limited</b> number <b>of</b> species and are capable <b>of</b> reasonably describing <b>ignition</b> and combustion performance in engines are still important. Given the fact that simplified one- or two-step models usually cannot reasonably describe the main features <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> process, especially for those fuels with two stage combustion processes, such as diesel fuels, reduced kinetic model is a more appropriate choice for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> process in practical applications.
