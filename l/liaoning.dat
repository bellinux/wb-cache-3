5|$|Before {{his death}} in 926, Abaoji greatly {{expanded}} the areas that the Khitans controlled. At its height, the Liao dynasty encompassed modern-day Mongolia, parts of Kazakhstan and the Russian Far East, and the Chinese provinces of Hebei, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, <b>Liaoning,</b> and Shanxi.|$|E
5|$|All known fossil {{material}} of A. longicervia originates from the Jianshangou Formation in Beipiao, western <b>Liaoning,</b> China. These Early Cretaceous beds constitute {{the lower part}} of the Yixian Formation, which is dated at 124.6 million years old. Nine specimens of A. longicervia have been found, including holotype CBO0220 and paratype CBO0754.|$|E
5|$|At its height, the Liao dynasty {{controlled}} {{what is now}} Shanxi, Hebei, <b>Liaoning,</b> Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia provinces in China, as well as northern {{portions of}} the Korean peninsula, portions of the Russian Far East, {{and much of the}} country of Mongolia. The peak population is estimated at 750,000 Khitans and two to three million ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of 21st century, the Chinese bikini {{industry}} became a serious international threat for the Brazilian bikini industry. Huludao, <b>Liaoning,</b> China set the world record for the largest bikini parade in 2012, with 1,085 participants and a photo shoot involving 3,090 women.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx {{lived in}} what is now northeastern China during the early Cretaceous period. It was among the first dinosaurs {{discovered}} from the Yixian Formation in <b>Liaoning</b> Province, and {{was a member of the}} Jehol Biota. Well-preserved fossils of this species illustrate many aspects of its biology, such as its diet and reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The Qinghe Special Steel Corporation {{disaster}} was {{an industrial}} disaster that occurred on April 18, 2007, in Tieling, <b>Liaoning,</b> China. Thirty-two {{people were killed}} and six were injured when a ladle used to transport molten steel separated from an overhead rail in the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation factory.|$|E
5|$|The integument, or body covering, of Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from a Chinese specimen, which most likely {{comes from the}} Yixian Formation of <b>Liaoning</b> Province, China. The specimen, which is not yet {{assigned}} to any particular species, was illegally exported from China, in violation of Chinese law, but was purchased by the Senckenberg Museum in Germany. It was described while awaiting repatriation.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the <b>Liaoning</b> Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E
5|$|Bo Xilai (born 3 July 1949) is {{a former}} Chinese politician. He came to {{prominence}} through his tenures as the mayor of Dalian and then the governor of <b>Liaoning.</b> From 2004 to November 2007, he served as Minister of Commerce. Between 2007 and 2012, {{he served as a}} member of the Politburo and Communist Party Secretary of Chongqing, a major interior municipality. In 2013, Bo was found guilty of corruption, stripped of all his assets, and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{tenure in}} Chongqing was {{dominated}} by a protracted war against organized crime and corruption known as dahei ("striking the black"). Between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries. The campaign was overseen by Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in <b>Liaoning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong {{allegations}} that <b>Liaoning</b> was {{the epicenter of}} organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, suggested {{that he may have}} used his involvement as a way of building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|In early 2012, the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection bolstered its {{presence}} within Chongqing as the city's leaders came under investigation. Much {{of the attention}} focused on Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, {{who may have been}} under investigation for his role in a corruption case in <b>Liaoning.</b> Growing scrutiny over the city's wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang. Although details are scarce, several sources have suggested that Wang's resentment against Bo grew amidst the investigations—resentment that was compounded when Wang realized {{that he and his wife}} had also been targets of wiretapping under Bo's orders.|$|E
5|$|Official {{documents}} {{support the}} allegation of interference by the 610 Office. In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and <b>Liaoning</b> Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 150 {{important}} fossil sites from the Jurassic, the majority in Eastern Europe and North Asia. Outstanding sites include Solnhofen in Upper Bavaria, Germany, Karatau in South Kazakhstan, the Yixian formation in <b>Liaoning,</b> North China, {{as well as the}} Jiulongshan formation and further fossil sites in Mongolia. In North America {{there are only a few}} sites with fossil records of insects from the Jurassic, namely the shell limestone deposits in the Hartford basin, the Deerfield basin and the Newark basin.|$|E
5|$|Three {{specimens}} {{have been}} assigned to Sinosauropteryx prima: the holotype GMV2123 (and its counter slab , NIGP127586), NIGP127587, and D2141. Another specimen, IVPPV14202, {{was assigned to the}} genus but not to the only species by Zhang and colleagues. The assignment of an additional larger specimen to S. prima, GMV2124, was later found to be in error. All of the fossils were found in the Jianshangou or Dawangzhangzi Beds of the Yixian Formation in the Beipiao and Lingyuan regions of <b>Liaoning,</b> China. These fossil beds have been dated to 124.6–122million years ago, during the late Barremian to early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|When Abaoji {{conquered the}} Balhae state in 926, {{most of the}} {{population}} was relocated to what is now <b>Liaoning,</b> China. At least three groups remained in the former Balhae territory, one of which formed the state of Ding'an. Despite launching two invasions, in 975 and 985, the Liao forces were unable to defeat the Ding'an. Unable to eliminate the threat, and weary of Jurchen groups also inhabiting the region, the Liao established three forts with military colonies in the Yalu River valley area.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in <b>Liaoning,</b> Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of <b>Liaoning</b> Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a {{crowd of}} about 100 journalists, supporters, and friends who had {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to <b>Liaoning</b> to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of <b>Liaoning,</b> China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
5|$|McBreen scored {{twice in}} 12 {{appearances}} for the Mariners in 2013–14 before signing for Shanghai East Asia permanently on a one-season contract {{for a fee}} of $250,000 on 31 January 2014. His second debut came when starting their 1–1 away draw with <b>Liaoning</b> Whowin on 9 March 2014, before scoring his first goal of the 2014 Chinese Super League with a left-footed volley from outside the penalty area in a 1–1 draw at home to Shanghai Greenland Shenhua on 26 April. He went without scoring in the final {{three months of the}} season, which he finished with five goals from 28 appearances as Shanghai ranked in fifth place in the 2014 Chinese Super League table. McBreen stated his desire to stay for another season, but admitted he might not be retained after the club was taken over by new owners.|$|E
5|$|The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) {{appeared}} in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million {{years after the first}} therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; The Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, was a near-relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the Nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids. The earliest known metatherian is Sinodelphys, found in 125 million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern <b>Liaoning</b> Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|Đurić {{signed for}} Singapore Armed Forces in November 2004. The Warriors won the league four times, {{achieving}} the S.League and Singapore Cup double in 2007 and 2008 {{as he finished}} league top-scorer three times in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Đurić scored 129 goals in 150 league appearances with the club. His prolific form was recognised with the S.League Player of the Year award in 2007 and 2008. He scored his 200th domestic goal with a 5-minute hat-trick over <b>Liaoning</b> Guangyuan on 9 July 2007. and broke Mirko Grabovac's league record of 244 goals in local competitions with two goals in a 2–2 draw with ex-club Geylang United on his 38th birthday. The club also defeated Home United 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in regulation time in the 2008 Charity Shield.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx was {{the first}} fossil found that {{revealed}} a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a transitional fossil, in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for Compsognathus. Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation, <b>Liaoning,</b> northeastern China, {{which was part of}} an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{pterosaur}} reproduction, and pterosaur eggs are very rare. The first known pterosaur egg was found in the quarries of <b>Liaoning,</b> the same place that yielded feathered dinosaurs. The egg was squashed flat with no signs of cracking, so evidently the eggs had leathery shells, as in modern lizards. This was supported by the description of an additional pterosaur egg belonging to the genus Darwinopterus, described in 2011, which also had a leathery shell and, also like modern reptiles but unlike birds, was fairly small compared {{to the size of the}} mother. In 2014 five unflattened eggs from the species Hamipterus tianshanensis were found in an Early Cretaceous deposit in northwest China. Examination of the shells by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of a thin calcareous eggshell layer with a membrane underneath. A study of pterosaur eggshell structure and chemistry published in 2007 indicated that it is likely pterosaurs buried their eggs, like modern crocodiles and turtles. Egg-burying would have been beneficial to the early evolution of pterosaurs, as it allows for more weight-reducing adaptations, but this method of reproduction would also have put limits on the variety of environments pterosaurs could live in, and may have disadvantaged them when they began to face ecological competition from birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} rebuilt and {{commissioned}} into the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as <b>Liaoning</b> on 25 September 2012. Its Chinese ship class designation is Type 001.

25|$|Zheng Zhi {{started his}} {{football}} career in 1990 playing for various <b>Liaoning</b> youth academies before playing for <b>Liaoning</b> Youth in 1998 {{where he started}} out playing as a defender. Despite being the reserve side of <b>Liaoning</b> Whowin, the <b>Liaoning</b> Youth team were allowed {{to take part in}} the third tier where they found it difficult within the league system and the club were involved in legal trouble that saw all their assets frozen, including player transfer rights. This saw Zheng spend a year without playing professional football and he was transferred to top tier club Shenzhen Jianlibao who were coached by then manager Zhu Guanghu, his former manager during his time with the Chinese under-23 national team. While he was initially deployed as a defender at first, he successfully made the transition as a playmaker and aided Shenzhen to the 2004 league title for the first time in the club's history. After the title win, Zheng would play for the Chinese national team at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup where then manager Arie Haan deployed him as a defender once again as China finished as runners-up in the tournament.|$|E
