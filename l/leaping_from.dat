5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July, the {{military}} {{launched a new}} assault on Tikrit from Al-Awja. Soldiers and militiamen quickly entered the city, as militants were reportedly retreating, and seized the city's hospital. Following this, the Iraqi government was preparing to declare victory {{in the battle for}} the city. However, ISIL militants sprung an ambush, with suicide bombers reportedly <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> windows into groups of soldiers. Government troops retreated from the city before sunset four kilometers to the south under constant mortar and sniper fire. Several security force vehicles were seen abandoned, with {{at least one of them}} burnt out. 52 soldiers and 40 militants were killed in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

25|$|Because {{at least}} two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and out of the tent, people trying to escape could not bypass them. Some died from {{injuries}} sustained after <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 the German {{zeppelin}} Hindenburg exploded over Lakehurst, New Jersey.

Contrary to popular belief, the Hindenburg had flown an entire year of successful voyages before it caught on fire. Questions and controversy surround the accident to this day: theories for the sudden burst of flames include sabotage against the German Nazis, static buildup, and flammable fabric.|$|E

25|$|On the {{southern}} end of these beaches is the village of Barra de Potosí. There is a lagoon here, called Laguna de Potosí and islets called Morros de Potosí. The lagoon area has a large mangrove estuary filled with bird wildlife. Birdwatching, kayaking and fishing are popular here. The lagoon opens to the ocean and the beaches contain many “enramadas,” palm-thatched outdoor restaurants. Many of these enramadas are decorated with colorful paper or plastic cutouts, especially during the Christmas season. The Morros de Potosí are offshore and is a popular place for snorkeling, with Redbilled Tropicbirds, Brown Boobies and Brown Pelicans nesting on the rocks. In the winter season the bay hosts humpback whales, mother/calf pairs and some males are seen <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> the water. There is a Whale Study Project, Whales of Mexico, that takes place in the winter as well.|$|E
25|$|Batista {{accepted}} an open challenge from The Great Khali at The Great American Bash. Edge relinquished the title {{due to an}} injury {{the week before the}} pay-per-view, and Khali became the new World Heavyweight Champion, winning a Battle Royal and eliminating Batista. Batista and Kane, Edge's title opponent, faced Khali at The Great American Bash in a Triple Threat match where Khali retained the title. Batista received a disqualification victory against Khali at SummerSlam after Khali used a steel chair, thus retaining the title again. Batista finally claimed his third World Heavyweight Championship after eight consecutive attempts, by defeating Khali in a match that included Rey Mysterio at Unforgiven. His first challenge was from The Great Khali in a Punjabi Prison Match at No Mercy where Batista retained his title. He won the match by <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> the inner bamboo structure to the outer one, shortening his escape route and beating Khali to the floor.|$|E

25|$|Sabu {{competed for}} the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) {{in a number}} of events during 2002 and 2003. This {{included}} four appearances on PPV and a number of memorable matches. His first appearance was at Revolution PPV in Las Vegas in February 2002. He faced Devon Storm in a hardcore match. He was defeated in this match after his manager Bill Alfonso accidentally hit him with a chair after Storm moved out the way. After the match Sabu and Storm continued to fight onto the ring entrance way. Sabu placed Storm on a table and leaped from the entrance way through Storm and the table. This feud continued on the next PPV, the Eruption, in Australia in April. Sabu fought Storm in a steel cage match. The action spilled out of the ring and the cage with Sabu gaining the victory after <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> the top of the cage through Storm, who was placed on top of two tables on top of each other.|$|E
25|$|Scansoriopteryx fossils {{preserve}} {{impressions of}} wispy, down-like feathers around select {{parts of the}} body, forming V-shaped patterns similar to those seen in modern down feathers. The most prominent feather impressions trail from the left forearm and hand. The longer feathers in this region led Czerkas and Yuan to speculate that adult scansoriopterygids may have had reasonably well-developed wing feathers which could have aided in leaping or rudimentary gliding, though they ruled {{out the possibility that}} Scansoriopteryx could have achieved powered flight. Like other maniraptorans, Scansoriopteryx had a semilunate (half-moon shaped) bone in the wrist that allowed for bird-like folding motion in the hand. Even if powered flight was not possible, this motion could have aided maneuverability in <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> branch to branch. Scales were preserved near the base of the tail, and the Epidendrosaurus specimen also preserved faint feather impressions {{at the end of the}} tail, similar to the pattern found in Microraptor.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the victims}} were found on the second floor, where at least 69 bodies were recovered. Witnesses {{reported}} that many workers had been unable to escape through the narrow exits of the building. Twelve {{of the victims}} died <b>leaping</b> <b>from</b> windows in order to escape the flames, some of whom died of other injuries after being taken to area hospitals. Some workers who had been able to escape to the roof of the building were successfully rescued. The fire department's operations manager Mohammad Mahbub stated that the factory lacked the adequate emergency exits that would have made it possible to escape from the building, especially since the fire broke out in the warehouse on the ground floor and quickly moved up to higher floors. Of the building's three staircases, all three led through the ground floor, making them extremely dangerous and unusable {{in the case of a}} ground floor fire. This left many workers trapped and unable to get safely out of the course of the fire.|$|E
