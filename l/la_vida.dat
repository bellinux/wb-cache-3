5|$|In Viva <b>la</b> <b>Vida</b> or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva <b>la</b> <b>Vida.</b> It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, in stark contrast to the band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E

In North America, the tour sold out twenty-nine out of forty-five concert dates and grossed over US $45.2 million. The tour was able to remain {{as one of the}} hottest tours in the United States during its expansion. The Wonder World Tour's entire, ten-date European leg sold out in only ten minutes. In order to meet demand, an eleventh date was added and scheduled for December 29, 2009. In December 2009, the tour ranked atop Billboards Hot Tours, based on the tour's European performances.
