40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of aqueous suspensions of {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) powder with a <b>lignosulphonate</b> polyelectrolyte was {{studied as}} a function of pH and <b>lignosulphonate</b> dosage. Suspension stability (as indicated by sedimentation behaviour, zeta potential magnitude, and apparent viscosity) increased with increasing pH. At each pH examined, maximal suspension stability was achieved using an optimal amount of <b>lignosulphonate</b> that corresponded to monolayer adsorption onto the PZT particles. The optimal amount decreased with increasing pH {{as a result of the}} expanding conformation and increasing degree of dissociation of the <b>lignosulphonate</b> molecules. Although the zeta potential of PZT particles in lignosulphonate-free suspensions was reasonably large at pH 9. 2, there was insufficient electrostatic repulsion for stabilisation of suspensions. The adsorption of <b>lignosulphonate</b> at this pH marginally increased the zeta potential magnitude but markedly increased the suspension stability, indicating that the stabilisation mechanism was a combination of electrostatic and steric stabilisation.

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{inception}} of metal precipitation by hydrogen, it has been recognized that adding some organic compounds to the reduction solution accelerates the reaction, inhibits plating and helps control the resulting powder properties such as morphology, microstructure and particle size distribution, to name but a few. The powder properties are directly linked to the particulate processes taking place during reduction. Controlling these properties is crucial for downstream processes. For instance, in fuel cell technologies, the porosity of materials used to construct the electrodes is a critical parameter amongst others. However, {{in addition to their}} relatively high cost, additives’ function and mechanism of action are not well understood. Furthermore most of the additives are used on a trial and error basis. Since additives constitute one of the major operational costs, it becomes evident their use should be optimized. One of the most plausible options to achieve this is to develop an understanding of their mechanism of action. This dissertation assesses the effect of calcium <b>lignosulphonate</b> and ethylene maleic anhydride on the particulate processes taking place during the reduction of nickel ammine sulphate solutions by hydrogen gas. Reactions were carried out in an autoclave operated at 28 bar and 180 °C under stirring conditions of 850 rpm. Five densifications were performed for each additive at the dosage of 2, 5, 7 and 10 mg/L. Particulate processes were studied by analysing the particle size distribution and the corresponding normalized moments.

[...] cmartin@irnase. csic. esLignosulphonates {{are complex}} biopolymers which are {{recovered}} from the spent sulphite pulping liquids. In the production of wood pulp using a sulphite pulping process, the lignins are sulphonated so they become water soluble. Lignosulphonates are used as binders, dispersants, emulsifiers and sequestrants {{in a host of}} products such as gypsum board, animal feed pellets and micronutrient systems. The properties of lignosulphonates are strongly affected by their structure, and therefore whether they are produced from softwoods, hardwoods, or grasses. In this work, we are using analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in order to get information on the structure of lignosulphonates. Analytical pyrolysis is a rapid and highly sensitive technique for characterizing the chemical structure of lignin, allowing the analysis of small amounts of sample without prior manipulation and/or isolation. Characteristic features of lignins, including their composition in terms of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units can be established based upon analytical pyrolysis. Four different <b>lignosulphonate</b> samples (one from hardwood and three from softwoods) were selected for this study: # 261 (hardwood calcium lignosulphonate); # 264 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 265 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 266 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+). These samples were analyzed by Py-GC/MS in order to asses the suitability of this technique for their characterization. All the <b>lignosulphonate</b> samples released, upon Py-GC/MS, high amounts of low molecular weight sulphur compounds (sulphur dioxide, dimethyl sulphide, propylene sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide and methanesulphonic acid methyl ester) arising from the sulphonate group.

This study evaluated the possibility of applying a two-step PHAs production process using an industrial by-product, hardwood sulphite spent liquor (HSSL), as feedstock for a MMC. The first step consisted in the selection of PHAs-storing microorganisms using an aerobic dynamic feeding strategy followed by a second step, accumulation. RESULTSThe selected MMC, despite not being able to use the main carbon source of HSSL, <b>lignosulphonates,</b> revealed the capacity to consume acetate and xylose to accumulate poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) and glucose biopolymer. The maximum PHAs content was relatively low, 6. 6 %, with a maximum production yield of 0. 49 C-mmol HA C-mmol S- 1 during the selection stage. CONCLUSIONA MMC was able to adapt to HSSL by consuming acetate and xylose.

Lignin is the main energy carrier in chemical pulp mills. Today, the heat value of lignin is commonly recovered in the recovery boiler of the mill. However, interest in the extraction of lignin for use as an external biofuel and in speciality chemicals is growing. <b>Lignosulphonates</b> have been isolated by ultrafiltration from spent liquor in sulphite pulp mills for decades, whereas kraft lignin is mainly extracted by precipitation. The isolation of kraft lignin by ultrafiltration is currently attracting increasingly greater interest because lignin can be extracted from pulping liquors at almost all positions in a pulp mill using ceramic membranes, without altering the pH or temperature of the liquor. In this work hardwood lignin was recovered from two process streams in a kraft pulp mill by Ultrafiltration with a ceramic membrane with a cut-off of 15, 000 Da. It was shown that lignin can be recovered from a cooking liquor {{at a cost of}} about 60 (sic) per tonne of lignin and from black liquor withdrawn from the evaporation unit at 33 (sic) per tonne...|$|R
40|$|The {{cultivation}} of Trametes versicolor for laccase production and cell growth were strongly dependent on experimental conditions namely {{physical and chemical}} parameters as well as nutrient availability and inducer stimulation. Biomass growth was compared for a rich medium and for a defined medium in two different temperatures. The best temperature was 28 ºC and the maximum specific growth rates were µmax = 0. 083 h- 1 for the rich medium and µmax = 0. 043 h- 1 for the defined medium. It was clearly shown that laccase production is not associated with cell growth, indicating that this ligninolytic enzyme must be produced in the defined medium by a secondary metabolism. In order to obtain laccase induction, addition of solid lignin, <b>lignosulphonates,</b> veratryl alcohol, xylidine and ethanol was tested at different concentrations. To optimise laccase activity, the combined effect of inducer addition and simultaneously glucose suppression was studied. The best result for laccase induction (1240 U/L) was obtained with solid lignin, a by-product of {{pulp and paper industry}} and the higher laccase activity attained (1583 U/L) was obtained with the combined effect of xylidine addition and glucose suppression...|$|R
40|$|Spent {{sulphite}} liquor (SSL) {{is the main}} byproduct of acid sulphite pulping. Its main components are <b>lignosulphonates</b> (LS) and monomeric sugars. SSL is typically intended as binder, emulsifier or additive in concretes due to its high amount of LS. Sugars can be converted into high value-added products such as xylitol, PHB or biofuels among others; by means of fermentation processes. However, a separation step to remove the compounds that can act as fermentation inhibitors, as LS, is needed. Membrane technology allows the separation of sugars and LS from the SSL because of their different size of molecular weight. In the present study, ceramic membranes with different cut-offs (15 kDa, 5 kDa and 1 kDa) were used. 15 kDa membrane offered the best results according to LS concentration in the retentate stream, 5 kDa membrane the highest LS removal in permeate stream, and 1 kDa membrane the minimum sugar losses in the permeate stream. Because of this, {{the combination of the}} three membranes in a series system was proposed. In this way, an increase in LS removal in the final permeate was achieved (72. 78...|$|R
