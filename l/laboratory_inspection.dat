Magnetic susceptibility investigations show rather high magnetic values throughout the core, with peaks unrelated to the occurrence of tephra layers but instead to the relative abundance of detrital magnetic minerals in the sediment. Naked-eye inspection of the core allowed us to identify of two tephra layers, at 896 - 897 cm and 1070 - 1075 cm. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>inspection</b> of the grain-size fraction > 125 µm allowed for the identification of a third cryptotephra at 310 - 315 cm. Major element analyses on glass shards of the tephra layers at 896 - 897 cm and 1070 - 1075 cm show a trachytic composition, and indicate a correlation with the regionally dispersed Y- 3 and Y- 5 tephra layers, dated at ca 30 and 39 cal ka BP. The cryptotephra at 310 - 315 cm has a mugearitic- benmoreitic composition, and was correlated with the FL eruption of Mt. Etna, dated at 3370 ± 70 cal yr BP. These ages are in agreement with five 14 C AMS measurements carried out on plant remains and macrofossils from the lake sediments at different depths along the core. The recognition of distal tephra from Italian volcanoes allows us to link the Lake Ohrid succession to other archives located in the Mediterranean area and in eastern Europe.

40|$|The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) {{quickly and}} {{comprehensively}} transformed its laboratory safety program following a chemistry accident in December 2008 {{that caused the}} death of a researcher. UCLA's Chancellor immediately announced sweeping changes in the laboratory safety program and challenged UCLA to become "Best in Class" in academic laboratory safety. Given the size of UCLA's lab researcher population and the decentralized nature of the campus, it became a daunting task to reach out and improve compliance with newly implemented safety policies. The Office of Environment, Health and Safety (EH & S) improved their operations, enhanced overall inspection procedures, and instituted mandatory laboratory safety training of PIs and researchers. A Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool (LHAT) was implemented to aid in the identification of hazards, track laboratory space and personnel, and guide lab groups in compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) policies. Laboratory inspections were increased by more than 4 -fold in 2012 as compared to 2007 and now followed a comprehensive checklist to improve reproducibility and thoroughness of the inspection process. To provide better customer service to the research community and expedite corrective actions, all <b>laboratory</b> <b>inspection</b> reports are required to be issued the next business day. Unannounced PPE inspections began in 2010, and inspection findings showed a robust decrease in non-compliance with the PPE policy within one year of its implementation. As {{of the first half of}} 2013, all PIs of active laboratory research programs had completed the initial, in-class PI-specific laboratory safety training. In 2012, more than 20, 000 EH & S safety classes were completed either in-class or online by PIs, lab supervisors, research staff, students, and visitors to UCLA's research laboratories. Overall, analysis of outcomes from changes in UCLA's lab safety program indicates rapid improvements in compliance with lab safety regulations such as increased PPE use. Lab safety changes required commitment and cooperation at all levels - from executive leadership, to health and safety experts, to deans and department chairs, and to PIs and researchers. © 2014 The Authors...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the greenhouse and nursery industry in the United States. Two major issues are explored: irrigation and plant disease. The first two essays examine wireless soil-moisture sensor networks, an emerging technology that measures soil moisture and optimizes irrigation levels in real time. The first essay describes a study in which a nationwide survey of commercial growers was administered to generate estimates of grower demand and willingness to pay for sensor networks. We find that adoption rates for a base system and demand for expansion components are decreasing in price, as expected. The price elasticity of the probability of adoption suggests that sensor networks are likely to diffuse at a rate somewhat {{greater than that of}} drip irrigation. In the second essay, yields, time-to-harvest, and plant quality were analyzed to measure sensor network profitability. Sensor-based irrigation was found to increase revenue by 62 % and profit by 65 % per year. The third essay investigates greenhouse nursery growers’ response to a quarantine imposed on the west coast of the United States from 2002 to present for the plant pathogen that causes Sudden Oak Death. I investigate whether growers choose to 1) improve their sanitation practices, which reduces the underlying risk of disease without increasing the difficulty of detecting the pathogen, 2) increase fungicide use, which also prevents disease but makes existing infections much harder to detect, or 3) change their crop composition towards more resistant species. First, a theoretical model is derived to formalize hypotheses on grower responses to the quarantine, and then these predictions are empirically tested using several public data sources. I do not find evidence that growers improve their sanitation practices in response to the quarantine. I do, however, find evidence that growers heavily increase their fungicide use in response to a quarantine policy that requires visual (as opposed to <b>laboratory)</b> <b>inspection</b> for the disease before every crop shipment, suggesting that the quarantine may have the adverse effect of making the pathogen harder to identify. I also do find evidence that growers shift away from susceptible crops and towards resistant crops...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} fresh water in arid and {{semi-arid}} areas, {{similar to the}} Middle East, pushed {{for the use of}} seawater desalination techniques to augment freshwater. Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) is one of the techniques that have been commonly used due to its cost effectiveness. Recently, the use of Ultrafiltration (UF) was recommended as an effective pretreatment for SWRO membranes, as opposed to conventional methods (i. e. sand filtration). During UF operation, intermittent cleaning is required to remove particles and contaminants from the membrane's surface and pores. The different cleaning steps consume chemicals and portion of the product water, resulting in a decrease in the overall effectiveness of the process and hence an increase in the production cost. This research focused on increasing the plant's efficiency through optimizing the cleaning protocol without jeopardizing the effectiveness of the cleaning process. For that purpose, the design of experiment (DOE) focused on testing different combinations of these cleaning steps while all other parameters (such as filtration flux or backwash flux) remained constant. The only chemical used was NaOCI during the end of each experiment to restore the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) to its original state. Two trains of Dow™ Ultrafiltration SFP- 2880 were run in parallel for this study. The first train (named UF 1) was kept at the manufacturer's recommended cleaning steps and frequencies, while the second train (named UF 2) was varied according to the DOE. The normalized final TMP was compared to the normalized initial TMP to measure the fouling rate of the membrane {{at the end of each}} experiment. The research was supported by laboratory analysis to investigate the cause of the error in the data by analyzing water samples collected at different locations. Visual inspection on the results from the control unit showed that the data cannot be reproduced with the current feed water quality. Statistical analysis using SAS JMP® was performed on the data obtained from UF 2 determined that the error in the data was too significant, accounting for 42 %. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>inspection</b> on water samples concluded that the water quality feeding to the UF membranes was worse than that of the raw water. This led to a conclusion that severe contamination occurred within the main feed tank where the water was retained before arriving to the UF modules. The type of contamination present in the feed tank is yet to be investigated. Though, frequent cleaning or flushing of the feed tank is recommended on regular basis...|$|E
