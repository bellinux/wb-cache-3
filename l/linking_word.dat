5000|$|In some languages, the <b>linking</b> <b>word</b> agrees {{in gender}} and number {{with the head}} (sometimes with the dependent, or {{occasionally}} with both). In such cases it shades into the [...] "his genitive" [...] (see below). In Egyptian Arabic, for example, the word bitāʕ [...] "of" [...] agrees with the head noun (masculine bitāʕ, feminine bitāʕit, plural bitūʕ): il-wālid bitāʕ Yaḥyā [...] "John's father" [...] (Yaḥyā is Arabic for [...] "John"); il-wālida b(i)tāʕit Yaḥyā [...] "John's mother"; il-wālidēn bitūʕ Yaḥyā [...] "John's parents". Hindi is similar, using kā/ke/kī, which agrees in case, gender and number with the head noun, e.g. Jŏna kā bēṭā जॉन का बेटा [...] "John's son (dir.)", Jŏna kē bēṭē जॉन के बेटे [...] "John's son (obl.)", Jŏna kī bēṭī जॉन की बेटी [...] "John's daughter (dir./obl.)".|$|E
5000|$|In the 1600s this {{construction}} sometimes {{occurred in}} English, e.g. Ben Jonsons play Sejanus His Fall (i.e. [...] "Sejanuss Fall"). It {{is common in}} spoken German, e.g. dem Mann sein Haus [...] "the mans house" [...] (literally [...] "to the man, his house"). This construction {{can be seen as}} a variation of the above use of a <b>linking</b> <b>word</b> that agrees with the dependent. In some languages, this construction has shifted to the more normal situation for agreeing linking words where agreement is with the head, as in colloquial Norwegian Hilde sitt hus [...] "Hildes house" [...] (lit. [...] "Hilde herREFLEXIVE house", where the possessive pronoun agrees with the head rather than the modifier — in this case hus [...] "house" [...] is neuter). In this case the reflexive form of the possessive pronoun is used to refer to the immediate possessor (Hilde) and not necessarily the subject of the sentence as otherwise would be the case.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is common}} in {{languages}} without grammatical case, {{as well as in}} some languages with vestigial case systems. English uses the preposition of to express many genitival constructions, e.g. [...] "the father of John" [...] or [...] "the capital of the nation". Informal German prefers a preposition also, except with proper names, e.g. der Vater von meinem Freund [...] "My friend's father" [...] (lit. [...] "the father of my friend") but Johanns Vater [...] "John's father". Mandarin Chinese uses a <b>linking</b> <b>word</b> de 的, e.g. Yuēhàn de fùqīn 约翰的父亲 [...] "John's father", where Yuēhàn means [...] "John" [...] and fùqīn means [...] "father". The word de in Chinese is not a preposition (for example, Chinese prepositions precede their dependent nouns, just as in English), but rather a special particle with its own syntax (a bit like the [...] "'s" [...] modifier in English). Japanese similarly uses no の, e.g. Jon no chichi ジョンの父 [...] "John's father".|$|E

It {{seems like the}} flexibility of handmade assessment, but the additional condition is defined depending on the objective.

Curs: 2013 / 2014 <b>Linking</b> <b>words</b> are {{extremely}} important linguistic items which {{help to make}} the connections between sentences and utterances clear and to integrate and establish relations within a whole text. As such, they are essential devices to create complete texts {{as well as to}} ease the conversation flow. Thus, they are directly linked with the speakers' discourse competence and they are key elements to be taught and learnt by our students if we want them to become competent users of a language. This paper is aimed at presenting a pedagogical proposal to teach <b>linking</b> <b>words</b> and to improve and develop their knowledge regarding their effective use and functioning on the part of students. In order to do that, first of all, a preliminary study was carried out by means of observing three different aspects: the students' textbook, a set of written samples, and a questionnaire. The aim was to analyse the students' pre-instruction use of these linking devices considering the established parameters, and to identify their needs and perceptions. After that, from the results obtained, a didactic unit theoretically grounded on “modified inductive learning” and the development of the “communicative-discursive competence” was designed and implemented in order to obtain further results and to draw conclusions about the possible effectiveness of the didactic unit proposed and introduced. Finally, the results of the students' post-unit (post-instruction) writings were firstly analysed by following the same parameters previously applied to the pre-unit (pre-instruction) written samples, and then, compared to the ones obtained in the preliminary study in order to test the efficiency of the didactic unit designed and its implementation. In sum, results suggest that the teaching-learning proposal on <b>linking</b> <b>words</b> was useful and helpful for the students, since their knowledge of <b>linking</b> <b>words</b> seemed to improve {{and they were able to}} integrate different categories, and a wider variety of <b>linking</b> <b>words</b> correctly used in their discourse...|$|R

The computational model developed describes the distinct statistical relationships between three theoretical factors underpinning word learning and AoA distributions. Simply put, this model formulates how different learning processes, characterized by change in learning rate over time and/or by the number of exposures required to acquire a word, likely result in different AoA distributions depending on word type. We tested the model in three respects. The first analysis showed that the proposed model accounts for empirical AoA distributions better than a standard alternative. The second analysis demonstrated that the estimated learning parameters well predicted the psychological attributes, such as frequency and imageability, of words. The third analysis illustrated that the developmental trend predicted by our estimated learning parameters was consistent with relevant findings in the developmental literature on word learning in children. We further discuss the theoretical implications of our model-based approach...|$|E
40|$|In discourse, {{older adults}} {{tend to be}} more verbose and more disfluent than young adults, {{especially}} when the task is difficult and when it places few constraints on the content of the utterance. This may be due to (a) language-specific deficits in planning the content and syntactic structure of utterances or in selecting and retrieving words from the mental lexicon, (b) a general deficit in inhibiting irrelevant information, or (c) the selection of a specific speech style. The possibility that older adults have a deficit in lexical retrieval is supported by the results of picture naming studies, in which older adults have been found to name objects less accurately and more slowly than young adults, and by the results of definition naming studies, in which older adults have been found to experience more tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) states than young adults. The available evidence suggests that these age differences are largely due to weakening of the connections <b>linking</b> <b>word</b> lemmas to phonological word forms, though adults above 70 years of age may have an additional deficit in lemma selection. © 2006 Psychology Press Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the prior}} study {{by a number}} of researchers, it has been found that English complex {{sentence}} are frequently used both in speaking and writing. A number of study also revealed that English Complex Sentences are still a problem for the students, even for the sixth semester students. Because of that reason, this study is conducted. This study provides the information about their problems. This study attempts to find the answer of the type of errors and the dominant of occurrence of errors in each category or classification made by the students’ complex sentence composition. The source of data in this study is documentation from 33 sixth grade students’ final assignment in writing IV classes. Since this study concerns with the analysis of the type of error and type of dominant error, a desscriptive quantitative is used. The study concerns with the classification of the students’ error based on the surface strategy taxonomy, i. e. errors were classified as error of omission, addition, misformation and misordering. Besides, the errors also concern to classify in term of any possible properties of grammar used by the students in constructing English Complex Sentence and any deviations of Complex Sentence Rules. The result shows that in term of any possible properties of grammar the highest frequency of occurrence is omission 52 %, followed by addition 32 %, followed by misformation 14 % and misordering 2 %. It is found that the students still have problems in the use of article a/an, comma, third person singular verb, article the and preposition. The area of misconstruction of complex sentences are: Omission of subordinator 24 %, followed by addition of <b>linking</b> <b>word</b> 19 %, followed by omission of comma 19 %, followed by misformation of subordinator 16 %, followed by addition of subordinator 14 % and followed by addition of comma 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in the development of word lists (Nation’s (2012) BNC/COCA 2000, Brenzina and Gablasova’s (2015) New General Service list, and Dang and Webb’s (2016) Essential word list for beginners). These L 1 -corpora-based word lists are mainly frequency-based. However, they do not take polysemy into account (Cobb, 2013), and are confined to single words. One exception is Benigno and De Jong’s (2016) lexical list, which explicitly distinguishes between a word’s different meanings and links each meaning to one of the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The pedagogical value of the aforementioned lists mainly lies in the lexical coverage they provide for reading and listening, i. e. a focus on learners’ receptive skills,. Yet, no word list has taken oral communicative activities as a starting point. This gap will be addressed in our study. We will report on a topic- and corpus-based methodology for the development of word lists by selecting four oral communicative activities at the B 1 CEFR-level. We used the subtitle part of the Open Parallel Corpus (OPUS) (Tiedemann, 2012) to search for those activities in spoken L 1 data as (1) this corpus contains (semi) -authentic spoken language and (2) word frequencies from this type of subtitles reflect the ‘basicness’ of the vocabulary more adequately than traditional corpora (van Heuven et al., 2014). We used contextualized frequency counts that control for semantic ambiguity by <b>linking</b> <b>word</b> use to the selected activities, resulting in vocabulary lists organized per topic and by frequency and consisting of single words and multiword units. A topic-based approach to developing corpus-based word lists could add {{to our understanding of the}} words learners need to perform oral communicative activities.

40|$|Language {{learning}} strategy (LLS) research {{has provided a}} large body of evidence for the effectiveness of strategy-based instruction (SBI), though the evidence is very limited for pronunciation strategy instruction. For both general and pronunciation LLSs, most research has focused on identifying the strategies used by successful learners. When strategy instruction has been investigated, in most cases the strategies that were taught were not directly linked to specific tasks, learners were not observed using the strategies, and measures of strategy effectiveness often were holistic and did not reveal improvements in specific pronunciation features. The goal {{of this study was to}} extend our understanding of the role of strategy use in L 2 (second language) pronunciation learning by investigating the effectiveness of training future international teaching assistants (ITAs) to critically listen to, transcribe, mark corrections (annotate), and orally rehearse English suprasegmental features in their own speech. The suprasegmental features investigated were message unit boundaries, primary phrase stress, intonation, vowel reduction in content and function words, <b>linking,</b> <b>word</b> stress, and multiword construction stress. Fifteen graduate-level learners of English (14 Mandarin speakers, 1 Korean speaker) from an intact English as a Second Language (ESL) pronunciation class at a Midwestern university were solicited to participate in a repeated-measures design, in which the independent variables were 3 levels of self-monitoring (listening only [L], listening + transcription [LT], and listening + transcription + annotation [LTA]) and rehearsal (R). The strategies were examined in the following combinations: LR-LR-LR, LT-RRR, and LTA-RRR. The dependent variable was the change in suprasegmental accuracy following self-monitoring and rehearsal. Speech data resulting from strategy use were gathered at the beginning and end of a 16 -week semester in order to determine the extent to which strategy use corresponded to improved suprasegmental accuracy. Key findings include the following: (a) All participants made meaningful improvements in suprasegmental accuracy for at least some of the targets following self-monitoring; (b) the LT-RRR combination was most effective for lower proficiency learners and LTA-RRR was most effective for higher proficiency learners; (c) starting proficiency and size of accuracy gains following self-monitoring were negatively correlated; (d) self-monitoring had differential effects on accuracy for the suprasegmental features, with message units, linking, and function words showing the greatest improvement;(e) and observation of individual task performance provided useful insights into how effectively adult L 2 learners utilize self-monitoring strategies.
