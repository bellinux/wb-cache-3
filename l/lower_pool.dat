5|$|The outer bailey of Kenilworth Castle {{is usually}} entered through Mortimer's Tower, today a modest ruin but {{originally}} a Norman stone gatehouse, extended {{in the late}} 13th and 16th centuries. The outer bailey wall, long and relatively low, was mainly built by King John; it has numerous buttresses {{but only a few}} towers, being designed to be primarily defended by the water system of the Great Mere and <b>Lower</b> <b>Pool.</b> The north side of the outer bailey wall was almost entirely destroyed during the slighting. Moving clockwise around the outer bailey from Mortimer's Tower, the defences include a west-facing watergate, which would originally have led onto the Great Mere; the King's gate, a late 17th-century agricultural addition; the Swan Tower, a late 13th-century tower with 16th century additions named after the swans that lived on the Great Mere; the early 13th-century Lunn's Tower; and the 14th-century Water Tower, so named because it overlooked the <b>Lower</b> <b>Pool.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reducing the {{mobilization}} {{strength of the}} army to 120,000 under the New Army Structure plan is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a <b>lower</b> <b>pool</b> of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>pools</b> (A, B, and C) were contested {{annually}} {{beginning in}} 1961 and promotion-and-relegation between the pools started the same year. While the B Pool had been played {{as early as}} 1951, it was not held every year due to a frequent shortage of teams, and no promotion-and-relegation took place {{between it and the}} top division.|$|R

500|$|The IIHF World Junior Championship is {{an annual}} event {{organized}} by the International Ice Hockey Federation for national under-20 ice hockey teams from around the world. It is traditionally held from late December {{to the beginning of}} January. The main tournament features the top ten ranked hockey nations in the world, comprising the [...] "Top Division", from which a world champion is crowned. There are also three lower pools—divisions I, II and III—that each play separate tournaments playing for the right to be promoted to a higher pool with the last place team facing relegation to a <b>lower</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
500|$|To the {{south-east}} of {{the main}} castle lie the Brays, a corruption of the French word braie, meaning an external fortification with palisades. [...] Only earthworks and fragments of masonry remain of what was an extensive 13th-century barbican structure including a stone wall and an external gatehouse guarding the main approach to the castle. The area now forms part of the car park for the castle. Beyond the Brays are {{the ruins of the}} Gallery Tower, a second gatehouse remodelled in the 15th century. The Gallery Tower originally guarded the [...] long, narrow walled-causeway that still runs from the Brays to the main castle. This causeway was called the Tiltyard, as it was used for tilting, or jousting, in medieval times. The Tiltyard causeway acted both as a dam and as part of the barbican defences. To the east of the Tiltyard is a lower area of marshy ground, originally flooded and called the <b>Lower</b> <b>Pool,</b> and to the west an area once called the Great Mere. The Great Mere is now drained and forms a meadow, but would originally have been a large lake covering around , dammed by the Tiltyard causeway.|$|E

2500|$|In Division 2, {{groups have}} only five teams each (usually meaning one home match and one away match in the Autumn, {{and the same}} in the Spring, for each team), it is assumed that the {{majority}} of players are amateurs (meaning scheduling is not as limited), and in addition to the traditional automatic first-promoted-last-relegated system, fourth place from the higher pool will play second place from the <b>lower</b> <b>pool</b> after every two-year competition, with the winner taking the position in the higher pool. [...] From a five-team group, one team is promoted, one team is relegated and two teams play in playoffs. [...] Thus, a maximum of four of a pool's five teams could change from one two-year competition to the next.|$|E

5000|$|These splash pools {{are often}} {{isolated}} from the moderating influence {{of the ocean and}} therefore the pools can vary dramatically in environmental factors such as salinity and temperature over the course of hours or days. T. californicus has the ability to thrive under these variable environmental conditions (factors that limit predators such as fish to <b>lower</b> <b>pools</b> in the intertidal zone). Temperature in the pools that this copepod inhabits tend to track air temperatures more closely than ocean temperatures and salinities in pools can change as pools evaporate, receive freshwater inputs from rain, or saltwater from wave actions.|$|R

All that water-side region of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>Pool</b> below Bridge was unknown ground to me; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's Basin; and I had no other guide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{dinner was}} over the Guards set to work to erect two forts that the Engineers had already marked out. One of these was {{at the mouth of}} the pass leading into the little valley, the other was placed just above the pools. The baggage was piled close to the wells. By evening the work was well advanced, and at eight o'clock the Mounted Infantry and the whole of the camels started on their return journey, leaving the Guards, with fifteen Engineers and six Hussars, to hold the wells and guard the great pile of stores that had been brought up. As soon as work {{was over the}}re was a general {{movement}} to the wells, and there were few who did not indulge in the luxury of a bathe in the <b>lower</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the lower}} end of the crater was our camping spot, in a small grove of olapa and kolea trees, tucked away in a corner of the crater at the base of walls that rose perpendicularly fifteen hundred feet. Here was {{pasturage}} for the horses, but no water, and first we turned aside and picked our way across a mile of lava to a known water-hole in a crevice in the crater-wall. The water-hole was empty. But on climbing fifty feet up the crevice, a pool was found containing half a dozen barrels of water. A pail was carried up, and soon a steady stream of the precious liquid was running down the rock and filling the <b>lower</b> <b>pool,</b> while the cow-boys below were busy fighting the horses back, for there was room for one only to drink at a time. Then it was on to camp at the foot of the wall, up which herds of wild goats scrambled and blatted, while the tent arose to the sound of rifle-firing. Jerked beef, hard poi, and broiled kid were the menu. Over the crest of the crater, just above our heads, rolled a sea of clouds, driven on by Ukiukiu. Though this sea rolled over the crest unceasingly, it never blotted out nor dimmed the moon, for the heat of the crater dissolved the clouds as fast as they rolled in. Through the moonlight, attracted by the camp-fire, came the crater cattle to peer and challenge. They were rolling fat, though they rarely drank water, the morning dew on the grass taking its place. It was because of this dew that the tent made a welcome bedchamber, and we fell asleep to the chanting of hulas by the unwearied Hawaiian cowboys, in whose veins, no doubt, ran the blood of Maui, their valiant forebear.|$|E
