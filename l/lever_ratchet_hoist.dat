50|$|A {{nutcracker}} {{is a tool}} {{designed to}} open nuts by cracking their shells. There are many designs, including <b>levers,</b> screws, and <b>ratchets.</b> A well-known type portrays a person whose mouth forms the jaws of the nutcracker, though {{many of these are}} meant for decorative use.|$|R
50|$|Correspondence to The Musical Times in 1916 debates {{the merits}} of both the <b>ratchet</b> <b>lever</b> and {{balanced}} pedal systems of expression. One writer suggests that balanced expression pedals are either too sensitive or not sensitive enough and are unable to produce effective sforzandos (though many improvements have been made since this letter was written), and that he knows many organists who are having balanced expression pedals removed. One organist most open to the change suggests that real crescendos and diminuendos are not possible with a <b>ratchet</b> swell <b>lever,</b> as the notches provided are always either just under or just above the required dynamic level. Furthermore, he states that the balanced expression pedal affords the ease of use of either foot, whereas the previous correspondent desired two <b>ratchet</b> <b>levers,</b> one at {{either side of the}} pedalboard.|$|R
40|$|The great age of automata, or lifelike machines, began {{toward the}} close of the Middle Ages and lasted into the 17 th century. The {{technological}} marvels of that era were clockwork confections—intricate assemblies of gears, cranks, <b>levers</b> and <b>ratchets.</b> Clocks displayed the phases of the moon and the annual progress of the sun through the zodiac; they had animated figures to strike the hours and entertain onlookers. From machines that imitate life and the heavens, it is an easy step to the idea that life itself might be a mechanical process and that the stars could be driven by some kind of celestial geartrain. The clockwork universe figures in the thinking of Dante, Galileo, Kepler and Newton...|$|R
5000|$|Kick {{start is}} a method of {{starting}} an internal combustion engine (usually that of a motorcycle) by pushing a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>lever</b> with one's foot. Kick start mechanisms were almost universally a part of motorcycle engines before the mid-1970s, and were phased out of production over {{the next twenty years}} or so as electric starters became standard equipment. There are still some motorcycles produced that have both kick and electric starters.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long <b>lever</b> with a <b>ratchet</b> and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|R
40|$|The {{ratchet and pawl}} {{mechanism}} {{plays a crucial role}} in providing one way transmission and safety against heavy loading conditions. At the mechanical <b>hoists</b> <b>ratchet</b> when locked, allows only one way motion explicitly lifting of masses and restricts its falling probability even if the tensions on counter sides are removed. The paper considers ratchet of a 1. 5 ton capacity of hoist. The mechanism constraints are outlined and the modeling is exercised. The finite element analysis is carried to study an assortment of stresses in ratchet wheel. The nalysis results are concluded in detail. KEYWORDS...|$|R
50|$|Ratchet mechanism, which {{prevents}} the spool from rotating {{when there is}} tension on the line. this prevents inadvertent unreeling of line, as the <b>ratchet</b> <b>lever</b> must {{be held in the}} open position to allow unwinding. The ratchet mechanism is usually a ratchet wheel on the spool which engages with a spring-loaded pawl which can either be held open by a trigger lever, or clipped open by a knob or lever on the handle. The ratchet allows the spool to be manually rotated to wind in line when engaged.|$|R
5000|$|The driving {{position}} {{was on the}} right-hand side, the valve gear controlled by a ‘Johnson Bar’ <b>lever</b> and <b>ratchet</b> system. The regulator was a typical American pull-out lever with notched sector plate and graduation. The regulator itself was of the balanced, conically-seated type which, in later years, became the standard for locomotives from the 2-8-2 X-class and onward. When new boilers were fitted to the class, the regulator was changed to the rotating shaft type, with a British-style double-ended lever. With their wheel 2-8-0 arrangement, the V class were Victoria’s first eight-coupled locomotives, pre-dating the much larger C class 2-8-0s by some 18 years. The 2 ft diameter leading wheels were arranged in a Bissel truck, the springs of which were compensated to the heading pair of driving wheels. The 4 ft driving wheels were coupled to two outside 22 in diameter and 26 in stroke low-pressure cylinders, with two 13 in diameter by 26 in stroke high-pressure cylinders.|$|R
2500|$|She {{was built}} in 1900 by Ferguson and Baird at their Connah's Quay, Flintshire yard, for local {{shipping}} company Coppack Bros. Constructed with a doubled frame of oak, these were covered by [...] thick seasoned pitch pine planks, fastened to the frames with treenails and iron bolts. Equipped with the first known fitting of Appledore roller reefing, the sails are reefed by a <b>ratchet</b> <b>lever</b> that engaged the cogs on the Gaff boom, thereby winding the sail around it, and then locked to prevent the sail unwinding from the boom. Launched in April 1900 under Captain John Coppack, she was named Lizzie May after the Captain’s daughters.|$|R
50|$|Rodman {{guns were}} all nearly {{identical}} in design, with a curving soda bottle shape, the only differences being {{the size of}} the gun. They were all smoothbore guns designed to fire spherical shot and shell, primarily against ships. The guns were elevated and depressed by means of a lever called the elevating bar. The point of this <b>lever</b> fits into <b>ratchets</b> on the earliest guns cast, or sockets on the later guns. The fulcrum, called the ratchet post, fit on the rear transom of the upper carriage. The ratchet post was cast iron and had several notches for adjusting the position of the elevating bar.|$|R

5000|$|The German and Scandinavian Medieval armies made {{extensive}} use of mounted crossbowmen. They would act not only as scouts and skirmishers, but also protecting the flanks of the knights and infantry, and chasing away the enemy light cavalry. When the battle was fully engaged, they would charge at the enemy flank, shoot a single devastating volley at point-blank range and then attack the enemy with swords, without reloading. In some instances, mounted crossbowmen can also reload and fire continuously on horseback if they use specific [...] "weak" [...] crossbows that can be reloaded easily with the hand, such as the 13th century Speculum Regale, and {{the invention of the}} goat's foot <b>lever</b> and the <b>ratchet</b> cranequin allowed the mounted crossbowmen to reload and fire heavy crossbows on horseback.|$|R
50|$|Sequential manual {{transmissions}} work {{by providing}} the driver {{with the ability to}} select the gear directly before or after the gear currently engaged. Usually the shift lever is pulled back to select the adjacent higher gear and pushed forwards to select the adjacent lower gear. On a true sequential gearbox, the shift <b>lever</b> operates a <b>ratchet</b> mechanism that converts the fore & aft motion of the shift lever into a rotary motion. This rotary action turns a selector drum (sometimes called a barrel) which has three or four tracks machined around its circumference. Running in the tracks are the selector forks, either directly, or via selector rods. These tracks deviate around the circumference and as the drum rotates, the selector forks running in the tracks are moved to select the required gear. Only a true sequential transmission has a shift mechanism that operates in this way.|$|R
