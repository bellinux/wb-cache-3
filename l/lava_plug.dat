5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as <b>lava</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{explosive}} eruption is a volcanic term {{to describe a}} violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a <b>lava</b> <b>plug</b> will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAfter 3 {{years of}} mild gases emissions, the Ubinas volcano entered {{in a new}} eruptive phase on September 2 nd, 2013. The MIROVA system (a space-based {{volcanic}} hot-spot detection system), allowed us to detect in near real time the thermal emissions associated with the eruption and provided early evidence of magma extrusion within the deep summit crater. By combining IR data with plume height, sulfur emissions, hot spring temperatures and seismic activity, we interpret the thermal output detected over Ubinas in terms of extrusion rates associated to the eruption. We suggest that the 2013 – 2014 eruptive crisis can be subdivided into three main phases: (i) shallow magma intrusion inside the edifice, (ii) extrusion and growing of a <b>lava</b> <b>plug</b> {{at the bottom of}} the summit crater coupled with increasing explosive activity and finally, (iii) disruption of the <b>lava</b> <b>plug</b> and gradual decline of the explosive activity. The occurrence of the 8. 2 Mw Iquique (Chile) earthquake (365 km away from Ubinas) on April 1 st, 2014, may have perturbed most of the analyzed parameters, suggesting a prompt interaction with the ongoing volcanic activity. In particular, the analysis of thermal and seismic datasets shows that the earthquake may have promoted the most intense thermal and explosive phase that culminated in a major explosion on April 19 th, 2014. These results reveal the efficiency of space-based thermal observations in detecting the extrusion of hot magma within deep volcanic craters and in tracking its evolution. We emphasize that, in combination with other geophysical and geochemical datasets, MIROVA is an essential tool for monitoring remote volcanoes with rather difficult accessibility, like those of the Andes that reach remarkably high altitudes...|$|E

30|$|Volcanic eruptions bring {{high-temperature}} gas or magma to {{the surface}} of the earth. Therefore, thermal observations of these eruptions can be used to investigate the timeline of eruptive sequences. Eruptive activity includes processes that can change over short periods of time, which is sometimes related to the eruptive mode or the timing of its transitions. Thus, thermal observation of short-term eruptive processes is very beneficial for analyzing the detailed eruptive sequence of volcanoes. Himawari- 8 is a meteorological satellite operating at a geostationary position approximately 35, 800  km above the equator at a longitude of 140.7 °E. It carries a newly developed sensor, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), that operates in 16 spectral bands from the visible to thermal infrared (Japan Meteorological Agency 2015 a; Okuyama et al. 2018). This instrument has great advantages for carrying out volcano thermal observations (Kaneko et al. 2018). The AHI has several shortwave to thermal infrared bands with improved spatial resolution of 2  km that can observe various scales of volcanic activity. In particular, the capability of capturing full-disk shortwave infrared images every 10  min enables us to observe short-term high-temperature phenomena that have never been measured before. This is expected to provide valuable data for analyzing eruptive processes, such as the explosion of a <b>lava</b> <b>plug</b> in a conduit, a lava-dome collapse, or the exact timing of the onset and reactivation of lava effusion, as well as the precursory signals that precede these events (Kaneko et al. 2018). The real-time high performance of the AHI observations is also effective for obtaining information for unfolding disasters.|$|E
50|$|The volcano {{has been}} {{constructed}} in three main phases.

They are heavily hydrothermally altered and deformed. A gap during which tectonic and climatic degradation of the earlier domes occurred separates this stage from the next. Subsequently, destruction of domes during eruptions generated a unit consisting of coarse dacite in pumice and breccia form spreading out from the centre. On top of this unit, an andesitic cone formed, dated at 9 mya. Some aphyric phenobasalts cover surfaces of the second unit.|$|R
500|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{ended with}} the post-explosive phase.

The collapse of the stratovolcano left a caldera with a diameter of 3,3 km and a depth of 350m that was subsequently occupied by lava domes on its northern edge and covered by tephra layers from numerous volcanoes, both in the Almolonga field and others. Cerro Quemado is the largest (about 2 km3) and youngest lava dome complex formed by eight vents with viscous <b>lava</b> flows and <b>plugs</b> during four distinct volcanic phases - the first two involving effusion of lava and formation of new domes. Cerro Quemado underwent a flank collapse 1,150BP, generating a landslide that went 6 km SSW in the Llano de Pilar valley and occupied an area of 13 km2, generating a lateral blast that affected the neighbouring Volcán Siete Orejas volcano as well. A lava dome emerged inside the collapse scar subsequently. 1818 an eruption formed a block lava flow over half a year that travelled 2.5 km eastward.

50|$|Geologically, Morro Rock, {{located in}} San Luis Obispo County, {{in the town}} of Morro Bay, California, is one of 13 volcanic, {{intrusive}} units that form volcanic plugs (remnant volcanic necks of volcanoes), lava domes, and sheetlike intrusions from Morro Rock southeast 29 km or 18 mi to Islay Hill. The plugs form the distinctive peaks along U.S. Highway 101 just south of San Luis Obispo and south of State Highway 1 from San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay. The rock is composed of dacite, a felsic extrusive rock, intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite, {{and is a member of}} the igneous family. Its lithology and composition is a groundmass of plagioclase with amphibole (hornblende), biotite, pyroxene (augite), quartz, and glass; phenocrysts of plagioclase, amphibole and often quartz. Its silica (SiO2) content can range from 63%-69%. The dacite volcanic <b>plugs,</b> <b>lava</b> domes, intrusive sheets, and felsitic rhyolite-dacite between Morro Rock and Islay Hill are part of the Oligocene (27-23 Ma) Mono Rock-Islay Hill Complex.

40|$|The Massif d'Ambre is {{the largest}} {{stratovolcano}} (similar to 2500 km(2)) in the Cenozoic igneous province of northern Madagascar. It is broadly elongated in a N-S direction and is formed by hundreds of <b>lava</b> flows, <b>plugs,</b> spatter cones, tuff rings, pyroclastic flows, and pyroclastic fall deposits. New Ar- 40 -Ar- 39 age determinations for lavas of Massif d'Ambre and Bobaomby Peninsula (the northernmost tip of Madagascar) yield ages of 12. 1 +/- 0. 2 Ma and 10. 56 +/- 0. 09 Ma. These ages indicate that {{at least part of}} the volcanic activity of the Bobaomby Peninsula occurred later than the beginning of the activity of the Massif d'Ambre. The volcanic products of Massif d'Ambre are mildly to strongly alkaline (with sodic affinity) to tholeiitic with very limited amounts of evolved magmas. The mafic rocks have compositions similar to those of primitive mantle-derived magmas (MgO > 10 wt%, Cr and Ni > 400 and > 200 ppm, respectively). The strongly alkaline suite shows a liquid line of descent from basanite to phonolite, dominated by fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene and olivine. The mafic rocks (basanites, alkali basalts, transitional and tholeiitic basalts) have Zr/Nb (2. 4 - 5. 8), Ba/Nb (7 - 24) and La/Nb (0. 7 - 1. 1) ratios typical of incompatible element-rich within-plate basalts. The primitive mantle-normalized incompatible element patterns of the Massif d'Ambre mafic rocks are characterized by peaks at Nb and troughs at K, and are identical in shape and absolute abundances to those of the Nosy Be and Bobaomby (Cap d'Ambre) basanites. The range of (La/Yb) (n) ratios (9 - 24) indicates that the Massif d'Ambre primitive compositions are the product of variable degrees of partial melting (4 %- 12 %) of a broadly similar and slightly incompatible element-enriched mantle source. Initial Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 and Nd- 143 /Nd- 144 ratios of alkali basalts and basanites vary from 0. 70326 to 0. 70359 and 0. 51279 to 0. 51286, respectively. Alkali basalts and basanites have little variation in Pb- 206 /Pb- 204 (19. 073 - 19. 369), Pb- 207 /Pb- 204 (15. 613 - 15. 616), and Pb- 208 /Pb- 204 (39. 046 - 39. 257).

Attention {{is focused on the}} discrepancies between geochronological data compared with field evidence. Field data provide evidence that the Panarea dome was continuously built up without a significant break in volcanic activity. Continuous extrusion of new magma allowed the dome to emerge subaerially. Subaerial effusive activity followed with the alternation of exogenous and endogenous phases of growth that {{led to the formation of}} radial and tangential <b>lava</b> lobes and <b>plugs.</b> The younger volcanic products are represented by a thick succession of pyroclastic products discontinuously outcropping all over the island, dated here for the first time. Samples were dated through the U/Th disequilibrium method, which is also able to provide information on the geological processes at the origin of U–Th fractionation. The chronology of the volcanic events at Panarea suggests that the volcanic activity developed through two main phases. Effusive activity mainly characterized the first phase of the dome growth, while during the second phase explosive activity prevailed. The second phase occurred from 3177 to 2072 ka. Assessing the age of the first phase is more difficult. The age of 155712 ka, which is in the same time span obtained from K/Ar or Ar/Ar methods, is not consistent with field evidence. Furthermore, although the alignment of the points on the isochron is very good, the initial value of the 230 Th/ 232 Th ratio is very low and does not have a clear meaning. Our data strongly suggest that the age of 155712 ka is not realistic.

The velocity of the compression phase was assumed to be supersonic (ca. 400 m/s) up to 850 m above the crater bottom from other recent explosions. On the other hand, the propagation velocity of the preceding weak signal was regarded to be similar to the air sound velocity because the lack of impulsiveness is unlikely {{to be related to the}} main compression phase. Therefore, the estimated origin time of the main compression phase was delayed by 0. 5 - 0. 7 s from the preceding phase. The origin time of the preceding phase coincided with the onset of the isotropic expansion process of the pressurized gas pocket, which was obtained by the waveform inversion of the explosion earthquake. In contrast, the origin time of the main impulsive phase coincided with the time when the expansion rate reached its peak. This observation suggests that the volumetric increase of the gas pocket caused swelling of the surface of the crater bottom and its subsequent failure. When the expansion velocity exceeded a threshold level, the main impulsive compression phase radiated with a high velocity by the sudden releases of the pressurized gases. The volumetric change at the source was estimated to be 280 - 560 m 3 from the preceding phase of the infrasound. This volume change indicates that the vertical displacement of the swelling ground was on the order of 1. 0 m, assuming the radius of the <b>lava</b> <b>plug</b> was ca. 10 m...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoufrière Hills Volcano had {{two periods}} of {{repetitive}} Vulcanian activity in 1997, during which 88 explosions occurred. Each explosion discharged {{the contents of}} the upper 0. 5 - 2 km of the conduit, two thirds as pyroclastic flows and the rest as fallout from 3 - 15 km high buoyant plumes: frothy pumices from a deep, gas-rich zone, lava and breadcrust bombs from a degassed <b>lava</b> <b>plug,</b> and dense pumices from a transition zone. Vesicles constitute 1 - 66 vol% of breadcrust bombs and 24 - 79 % of pumices, all those larger than a few tens of µm being interconnected. Small vesicles (few hundreds of µm) in pumices are interpreted as pre-dating explosion, implying pre-explosive conduit porosities up to 55 %. About 15 % of large vesicles in pumices, and all those in breadcrust bombs, are angular voids formed by syn-explosive fracturing of amphibole phenocrysts. An intermediate-sized vesicle population formed by coalescence of the small syn-explosive bubbles. Nucleation took place heterogeneously on titanomagnetite, number densities of which greatly exceed those of vesicles, and bubble growth took place mainly by decompression. Growth took place under disequilibrium conditions largely by decompression-driven expansion; diffusive outgassing of melt was limited by the short timescale of the explosions, accounting for the high water contents preserved in matrix glasses. Development of vesicle textures was controlled by the time interval between decompression and onset of clast-surface cooling. Plug fragments entered the air quickly after fragmentation (~ 10 s), so interiors continued to vesiculate once the rinds had quenched. A larger time interval for deep-derived pumices (~ 50 s) allowed complete vesiculation prior to quench, accounting for the textural similarity between flow and fall pumices, despite different thermal histories after leaving the vent. This also allowed syn-explosive coalescence to proceed further in pumices than in the breadcrust bombs. Uniaxial boudinage of some amphiboles implies significant syn-explosive vesiculation of pumices even prior to magma fragmentation and suggests that vesiculation in pumices have been largely confined to the conduit. Syn-explosive decompression rates estimated from vesicle number densities are consistent with those predicted by numerical models. These decompression rates are also consistent with the idea that syn-explosive bubble nucleation during the 1997 explosions was initiated during rapid decompression of conduit magma in a zone of steep pressure gradient beneath the descending fragmentation level...|$|E
40|$|Only one {{eruption}} {{of the island}} Una-Una (Gulf of Tomini, Northern Celebes), in 1898, has been recorded in historical time; it was described in 1902 by Wichmann (l. c.) after data gathered from different witnesses. No lava flowed out, it was an ash-eruption. During that eruption large mud streams, called lahars, descended along {{the slope of the}} volcano and some broad flat-bottomed valleys were eroded (Pl. 44, fig. 4) which are known so very well from some Javanese volcanoes, especially from Mount Kelut. With the latter Una-Una shows many points of resemblance, in shape, structure and in type of the latest eruption. Along one of the large typical lahar valleys we climbed the volcanoe starting near Kololio. Fig. 6 and 7 show the higher parts of our road, typical v-shaped valleys, a product of ordinary water erosion. When seeing such lahar valleys one may presume that the volcano must contain or at least must have contained either a huge crater lake or a filling of loose, sandy, brecciated material strongly impregnated with water. Up to this moment all lava’s, pumice, tuffs and ashes, collected in the island Una-Una are andesitic. The andesite and the andesitic tuffs often show inclusions of carbonated peridotite. It is not impossible that also sediments occur on the island — though on our single trip we did not find them — thus in general structure Una-Una shows some resemblance to the other Togian islands, where, however, the volcanism is now extinct. The crater of the volcano has a diameter of about two kilometers. The textfigure 2 shows a schematic section, a being the western craterrim; b the bottom, consisting of mud, ashes and brecciated volcanic materia] (h) deposited in the crater after the {{eruption of}} 1898, thus giving origin to the flat bottom of the caldera-shaped crater. In {{the central part of the}} crater is an elevation, c of the same material but strongly metamorphosed by the activity of many solfatara’s which break through it. The author thinks that the elevation and the solfatara’s both owe their origin to a <b>lava</b> <b>plug</b> (g) which after the eruption of 1898 and after the filling up of the crater has penetrated through the crater-pipe and tilted the central part of the crater-bottom, itself not reaching the surface, however, as shown in figure 2 (see also Pl. 44, fig. 5 and Pl. 46, fig. 8). Pl. 46, fig. 9 shows the same phenomenon, a detritus plug in the crater lake of the Kelut volcano, Java. Fig. 2, d is a small crater lake; e is a detritus cone; h is a schematic section through the strato-volcano. In 1901 Professor Molengraaff visited Una-Una and made a fine photograph of the crater, which he kindly gave me for publication (Pl. 46, fig. 8). The activity of solfatara’s was somewhat stronger at the time of his visit; within short intervals a little cloud of smoke escaped from Una-Una, as shown in his sketch (fig. 3). Corals are growing on the submarine slopes in separate colonies. However, no true massive coral reef has been developed, owing to the young erosion stage of this volcanic island; still too large quantities of boulders and smaller detritus material are deposited along the submarine slopes and prevent a more luxurious reef growth...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The Benue trough is a graben {{structure}} containing folded Upper Cretaceous sediments. Mid-Tertiary to Recent rift-valley type vulcanicity in {{and near}} the trough was mainly basaltic (in the north at least), salic lavas being now represented mainly by a few eroded plugs. The Nigerian rocks are regarded as a practically extinct sub-province within a larger Gulf of Guinea alkaline province, dominatecl by the voluminous and still active vulcanicity of the Cameroun rift. The two structures have the same trend as other graben features further south along Africa's western margin. Large sodic plagioclase crystals in a basalt plug within the Nigerian sub-province have rounded edges and more caleic overgrowths. They probably crystallized at deep crustal levels bdt are unaccompanied byany of the mafic phases that normally crystallize fi'om basalts under high pressure. However, spinel crystals and olivine nodules found in a nearby plug indicate that the complementary marie assemblage may be found not far away. Sparse published ata on phenocrysts and inclusions in the Jos Plateau lavas offer some support for this suggestion. Crystallization ofsodic feldspars in basalt may have a bearing on the independent genesis of salic liquids, while apatite and magnetite inclusions in them suggest a possible link with carbonatites. T HE principal features of Nigeria's Cenozoic alkaline province are summarized in fig. 1. The Benue trough is a graben structure (Cratchley and Jones, 1965), filled by up to 13 000 feet of Upper Cretaceous ediments, which were folded parallel to the trough axis and uplifted prior to onset of the Cenozoic vulcanicity (Carter et al., 1963). In {{the northern part of}} the province, on the Jos Plateau and the area near Gombe, basic lavas range from olivine basalt to basanite (Falconer, 1926; Carter et al., 1963) and occur as <b>plugs,</b> <b>lava</b> plateaux, and thin flows emanating from small lava and cinder cones, some of which have a very youthful aspect. Trachyte and phonolite are represented only by a small concentration of plugs south of Gombe, and their advanced state of erosion suggests they belong to an early phase of the activity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The Coyote Hills {{are located}} about 46 {{kilometers}} north-northwest of Lakeview, Oregon, within the Basin and Range physiographic province. These hills represent a complex volcanic center of bimodal calc-alkaline igneous activity. The oldest rocks {{recorded in the}} Tertiary succession are horn-blende- bearing andesite and aphanitic basalt flows, laharic breccias, conglomerates, tuffaceous sandstones, and lithic wackes of the late Eocene to early Oligocene Lower Andesite formation. During middle to early late Oligocene time, voluminous eruptions of predominately basaltic andesite formed a large shield volcano. This unit, the Upper Basalt formation, was followed, after a short hiatus, by the Coyote Hills rhyolite of late Oligocene to early Miocene age. The Coyote Hills rhyolite represents a complex spectrum of multi-phase silicic volcanism and comagmatic near-surface plutonism. Magma compositions varied from dacite to rhyolite and include <b>lava</b> flows, volcanic <b>plugs,</b> a flow dome complex, and a hypabyssal quartz monzonite intrusion. Volcanic activity that post-dates formation of the bimodal Coyote Hills complex culminated with the lower slopes of the shield volcano onlapped by the middle Miocene Steens Basalt, the late middle to early late Miocene Plush tuff, and the late Miocene to early Pliocene Upper basalt. A prominent northwest and northeast-trending fault and fracture system formed after emplacement of the Coyote Hills rhyolite, and as early as late Oligocene to early Miocene in time. Basin and Range faults post-date the Steens Basalt and have caused some minor displacement of the younger rocks. Penecontemporaneous with silicic volcanism of the Coyote Hills rhyolite {{was a period of}} hydrothermal activity. Fluids ascended favorable structures, altered the surrounding country rocks, and deposited minor quantities of epithermal gold-silver-copper-mercury-molybdenum(?) - lead(?), and zinc(?) in structurally controlled quartz-pyrite veinlets and as disseminations. Because of the association of mineralization with silicic volcanics in time and space, it is concluded that the two processes were genetically related. The hydrothermal system in the Coyote Hills is related to the late stages of silicic volcanism. Evidence for a genetic relation includes the close association of rock type, and chemical and mineral zonations within the district. Geological and geochemical evidence that includes rock type and alteration patterns, and mineral and trace element zonations, collectively suggest that only the highest level of the hydrothermal system has been exposed. It is entirely possible that a large vein or disseminated-type deposit containing both base and precious metals is present at depth...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{probabilistic}} hazard forecasts for re-awakening volcanoes rely {{on making}} an accurate estimation {{of their past}} eruption frequency and magnitude for a period long enough to view systematic changes or evolution. Adding an in-depth knowledge of the local underlying magmatic or tectonic driving processes allows development of even more robust eruption forecasting models. Holocene tephra records preserved within lacustrine sediments and soils on and surrounding the andesitic stratovolcano of Mt. Taranaki (Egmont Volcano), New Zealand, were used to 1) compile an eruption catalogue that minimises bias to carry out frequency analysis, and 2) identify magmatic processes responsible for variations in activity of this intermittently awakening volcano. A new, highly detailed eruption history for Mt. Taranaki was compiled from sediment sequences containing Holocene tephra layers preserved beneath Lakes Umutekai and Rotokare, NE and SE of the volcano’s summit, respectively, with age control provided by radiocarbon dating. To combine the two partly concurrent tephra records both geochemistry (on titanomagnetite) and statistical measures of event concurrence were applied. Similarly, correlation was made to proximal pyroclastic sequences in all sectors around the 2518 m-high edifice. This record {{was used to examine}} geochemical variations (through titanomagnetite and bulk chemistry) at Mt. Taranaki in unprecedented sampling detail. To develop an unbiased sampling of eruption event frequency, a technique was developed to distinguish explosive, pumice-forming eruptions from dome-forming events recorded in medial ash as fine-grade ash layers. Recognising that exsolution lamellae in titanomagnetite result from oxidation processes within <b>lava</b> domes or <b>plugs,</b> their presence within ash deposits was used to distinguish falls elutriated from blockand- ash flows. These deposits are focused in particular catchments and are hence difficult to sample comprehensively. Excluding these events from temporal eruption records, the remaining, widespread pumice layers of sub-plinian eruptions at a single site of Lake Umutekai presented the lowest-bias sampling of the overall event frequency. The annual eruption frequency of Mt. Taranaki was found to be strongly cyclic with a 1500 - 2000 year periodicity. Titanomagnetite, glass and whole-rock chemistry of eruptives from Mt. Taranaki’s Holocene history all display distinctive compositional cycles that correspond precisely with the event frequency curve for this volcano. Furthermore, the largest known eruptions from the volcano involve the most strongly evolved magmas of their cycle and occur during the eruptive-frequency minimum, preceding the longest repose intervals known. Petrological evidence reveals a two-stage system of magma differentiation and assembly operating at Mt. Taranaki. Each of the identified 1500 - 2000 year cycles represent isolated magma batches that evolved at depth {{at the base of the}} crust before periodically feeding a mid-upper crustal magma storage system...|$|R
