500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the <b>large</b> <b>containers</b> of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|E

40|$|While <b>larger</b> <b>containers</b> {{have been}} found to {{increase}} food intake, it is unclear whether this effect is driven by container size, portion size, or their combination, as these variables are usually confounded. The study was advertised as examining the effects of snack food consumption on information processing and participants were served M&M's for free consumption in individual cubicles while watching a TV show. Participants were served (1) a medium portion of M&M's in a small (n= 30) or (2) in a <b>large</b> <b>container</b> (n= 29), or (3) a large portion in a <b>large</b> <b>container</b> (n= 29). The <b>larger</b> <b>container</b> increased intake by 129 % (199. kcal) despite holding portion size constant, while controlling for different confounding variables. This research suggests that <b>larger</b> <b>containers</b> stimulate food intake over and above their impact on portion size. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

2500|$|In North America, {{containers}} {{are often}} shipped by rail in container well cars. These cars resemble flatcars but the newer ones have a container-sized depression, or well, {{in the middle}} (between the bogies or [...] "trucks") of the car. This depression allows for sufficient clearance to allow two containers to be loaded in the car in a [...] "double stack" [...] arrangement. The newer container cars also are specifically built as a small articulated [...] "unit", most commonly in components of three or five, whereby two components are connected by a single bogie as opposed to two bogies, one on each car. Double stacking is also used in parts of Australia. On some older railways, particularly in the United Kingdom, the use of well cars is necessary to carry single stacked <b>large</b> <b>containers</b> within the loading gauge.|$|E
2500|$|The first truly {{successful}} container {{shipping company}} dates to April 26, 1956, when American trucking entrepreneur McLean put 58 trailer vans [...] later called containers, aboard a refitted tanker ship, the , and sailed them from Newark, New Jersey to Houston, Texas. Independently {{of the events}} in Canada, McLean had {{the idea of using}} <b>large</b> <b>containers</b> that never opened in transit and that were transferable on an intermodal basis, among trucks, ships, and railroad cars. McLean had initially favored the construction of [...] "trailerships"—taking trailers from large trucks and stowing them in a ship's cargo hold. This method of stowage, referred to as roll-on/roll-off, was not adopted because of the large waste in potential cargo space on board the vessel, known as broken stowage. Instead, McLean modified his original concept into loading just the containers, not the chassis, onto the ship; hence the designation [...] "container ship" [...] or [...] "box" [...] ship.

2500|$|According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon {{leaves and}} {{branches}} {{used for the}} black drink were traditionally picked {{as close to the}} time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason coffee beans are roasted. After browning, they were boiled in <b>large</b> <b>containers</b> of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine. Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent [...] In comparison, Ilex vomitoria leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002. Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.|$|E
