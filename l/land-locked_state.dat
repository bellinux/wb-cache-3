50|$|The Declaration {{recognising}} the Right to a Flag of States {{having no}} Sea-coast (Déclaration portant reconnaissance du droit au pavillon des Etats dépourvus de littoral) is a 1921 multilateral treaty which legally recognised that a <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> {{could be a}} maritime flag state; that is, that a <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> could register ships and sail them on the sea using its own flag.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} two decades of the 20th century, there had been {{uncertainty}} as to whether a <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> could register maritime ships and authorise them to sail under its flag: France, the United Kingdom, and Prussia had argued that such a right could not exist because it would place a <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> {{in the position of}} being unable to control the behaviour of ships of bearing its flag because of the state's inability to unreservedly access ports and the sea. Prior to the war, Switzerland had denied several requests from merchant ships to fly the Swiss flag.|$|E

50|$|Tlaxcala is a <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> {{situated}} on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The average altitude for the state is 2,230 meters above sea level, making it a bit higher than the Valley of Mexico just to the southwest. The {{western part of the}} state lies on the central plateau of Mexico while the east is dominated by the Sierra Madre Oriental, home of the 4,461 meter La Malinche volcano. Most of the state is rugged terrain dominated by ridges and deep valleys, along with protruding igneous rock formations. This ruggedness, along with large-scale weather phenomena such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone, gives the state a complex climate. Overall rain patterns for the state are about 400mm in the summer rainy season and 30mm in the winter. Locally, however, this varies dramatically between the drier plateaus and valleys and the wetter mountains. Variations in altitude produce sub-climates between semi-tropical to temperate, with frosts likely in the higher elevations during the winter. Temperate forests of pine, fir (abies religiosa), evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) and junipers (Juniperus communis) dominate the mountain highlands while the flatlands, with their drier climate, are characterized by agaves and prickly pear cactus (opunita).|$|E
50|$|The Jolof Empire was {{organized}} as five coastal kingdoms {{from north to}} south which included Waalo, Kayor, Baol, Sine and Kingdom of Saloum. All of these states were tributary to the <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> of Jolof. The ruler of Jolof was known as the Bour ba, and ruled from the capital of Linguère. Each Wolof state was governed by its own ruler appointed from the descendants of the founder of the state. State rulers were chosen by their respective nobles, while the Bour was selected by a college of electors which also included the rulers of the five kingdoms. There was the Bour of Waalo, the Damel of Kayor, the Teny (or Teigne) of Baol, as well as the two Lamanes of the Serer states of Sine and Saloum. Each ruler had practical autonomy but was expected to cooperate with the Bour on matters of defense, trade and provision of imperial revenue. Once appointed, office holders went through elaborate rituals to both familiarize themselves with their new duties and elevate them to a divine status. From then on, they were expected to lead their states to greatness or risk being declared unfavored by the gods and being deposed. The stresses of this political structure resulted in a very autocratic government where personal armies and wealth often superseded constitutional values.|$|E
40|$|A Macedonian {{friend in}} Skopje {{recently}} observed that his grandmother {{had lived in}} five different states without ever moving house! Macedonia is the smallest state in South Eastern Europe {{with a population of}} only two million inhabitants. Blighted by its economic geography, Macedonia is a <b>land-locked</b> <b>state</b> with poor infrastructure, scarce natural resources, and small market potential. The country was hit by the 2007 Euro crisis and the effects of high youth unemployment at 52 per cent continue to linger. There have been internal rifts, resulting in armed conflict between Albanian separatists and the Macedonian Army in 2001. Macedonia has also been deeply affected by migration. There were 90, 000 from the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina between 1992 - 95; then, in the spring of 2001 a further 360, 000 refugees crossed over the borders from Kosovo, the equivalent of 17 per cent of Macedonia’s population, raising interethnic tensions with the possibility of a permanent change to the ethnic balance of the country and stretching institutional capacities to their limits (Pendarovski, 2011) and Macedonia continues to be affected by the current European refugee crisis that grew exponentially throughout 2015 and 2016. Macedonia is defined by its Foreign relations. It has problems with all five of its immediate neighbours. It has had a long dispute with Bulgaria, which denies the existence of the Macedonian nation and does not recognise the Macedonian language. Since independence in 1991, there has been a long-running naming dispute with Greece, which has delayed Macedonian entry into the European Union and NATO. Albania frequently raises concerns over the rights of the large ethnic Albanian community in Macedonia which make up twenty per cent of the country’s population, added to which there have been security spill overs from Kosovo, dating from NATO’s conflict over Kosovo in 1999 and the conflict in the north-west of Macedonia with the Albanian National Liberation Army in 2001. Meanwhile, Serbia, once the pivot state in the region, denies the autonomy of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. Twenty-five years into its political transition, Macedonia’s future is essential to the future European security architecture (Liotta and Jebb, 2001, p. 50). Yet, Macedonia’s problems are unique and quite different to those of all the other so-called Yugoslav successor states. This paper will set out to explain how this seemingly benighted European state is actually a poorly understood success...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} in order to study the geohistory of a {{transport}} infrastructure network it is necessary to identify the link between networks and territorial scales during a given period. It focuses on the creation of road and rail networks in French West Africa during the colonial period and in the <b>land-locked</b> <b>States</b> during the national period, which involves post-independence development policies. The network is perceived in this paper as the manifestation of the political will to facilitate traffic within a delimited space. Within the colonial and then the national periods roads and railways were thus constructed as part of a process that can be interpreted as the outcome of a compromise between a territorial project and the capacity to implement it. This geohistorical study thus allows us to identify, with reference to the link between borders and networks, the successive geographical linkages (railway and port combinations with their subsequent branches, national roads, economic roads, external connections) which have been applied in the delimited spaces in question. This exercise has concentrated particularly on continental West Africa...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{affecting}} {{and will continue}} to affect the frequency and severity of natural hazard events, a trend that is of increasing concern for emergency managers and hazard mitigation agencies across the United States. Proper response to these hazards will require preparation and planning. Unfortunately, states are not required to include analysis of climate change in their State Hazard Mitigation Plans, which leads to uneven treatment of the issue and missed opportunities for mitigation planning. This survey identifies those state plans that address climate change and climate-related issues in an accurate and helpful manner and those that do not. Several states will be releasing updated State Hazard Mitigation Plans in 2013 and 2014, and this survey forms a basis for improving those plans through shared lessons learned and targeted communication. The results of the survey indicate that coastal states are more likely to include a discussion of climate change, possibly due in part to recent emphasis on and awareness of the relationship between climate change and sea level rise, coastal storms, and related hazards. The relative lack of discussion of climate change in <b>land-locked</b> <b>states</b> may point to a need for greater communication of how risks such as drought, floods, heat events, and non-coastal storms are affected by climate change. State plans that currently include climate change analyses and adaptation plans may be used as examples for improving other plans. This survey provides a basis for further analysis comparing future plans and determining whether they include an improved discussion of climate change...|$|R

Twelve persons, eight female and four male, were affected {{in a chain}} reaction within a span of ten days. The cardinal feature was an episodic trance state of 5 to 15 minutes duration with restlessness, attempts at self-injury, running away, inappropriate behaviour, inability to identify family members, refusal of food and intermittent mimicking of animal sounds. The illness was self-limiting and showed an individual course of one to three days duration. Sociocultural aspects of the epidemic are discussed. Tripura is a <b>land-locked</b> Eastern border <b>state</b> of India and is bounded by Bangladesh in the North, South and West. To the East, it borders on the Indian states of Assam and Mizoram (Figure 1). Agartala is the State capital. It is a terrain of hills and valleys; the hills are covered with dense forests. The climate is generally hot and humid, with plenty of rainfall occurring mainly from June to September during monsoon. The main occupation is agriculture and tea plantation. The population is a mixed one, with tribal and Bengali groups comprising the majority and Christian and Muslims contributing significant minorities. The life of {{the people living in}} the valleys and plains is related to Bengali Hindu culture.
