Besides method validation, emphasis was put on quality control and assessment during routine determination of VOCs in marine water samples. Analytical quality control charts were plotted for all VOCs and a standard addition test was performed, as proposed by the QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information in Marine Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Europe) working group. The analytical charts were incorporated in a working scheme containing guidelines to be applied during routine determinations, ensuring the long time reliability of the analytical method. Results yielded by the QUASIMEME interlaboratory exercise on organohalogen measurements in seawater are presented. The exercise was attended by seven out of eight laboratories who agreed to participate.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{hexachlorocyclohexane}} (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are toxic, {{persistent and}} bioaccumulative long-range atmospheric transport pollutants. These are transported worldwide affecting remote regions {{far from their}} original sources, and can transfer into food webs {{with a wide range}} of acute and chronic health effects. India ratified the Stockholm Convention with the intention of reducing and eliminating persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and encouraged the support of research on POPs. Despite the ban and restriction on the use of these chemicals in India, their contamination of air, water, sediment, biota and humans has been reported. In this study, surface water samples were collected during January 2012 from the Yamuna River in Delhi, India, and analyzed for PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The concentrations of ΣPCBs and ΣOCPs ranged between 2 - 779 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> – 1 and from less than 0. 1 to 618 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> – 1 (mean 99 ± 38 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> – 1 and 221 ± 50 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> – 1, respectively). The PCB homolog was dominated by 3 - 4 chlorinated biphenyls. In calculating the toxicity equivalent of dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) using World Health Organization toxic equivalency factors, dl-PCBs accounted for 10 % of a total of 27 PCBs. The concentration of ΣHCH ranged between less than 0. 1 and 285 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> – 1 (mean 151 ± 32 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> – 1).

In 68 out of 120 samples (56. 7 %) the presence of AFM 1 was detected by concentration ranging from 50 to 352. 3 <b>ng</b> <b>L</b> - 1.

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) such as organochlorine (OCl) insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), {{together with the}} new generation of organophosphorus (OP) insecticides, are of global concern, due to their widespread occurrence, persistence, bioaccumulation and hormone disruption potential. This paper represents an attempt to study the source and transportation of such pollutants in estuarine and coastal environments as an integrated ecosystem, by determining the levels of 18 OCl insecticides, 21 PCB congeners, and 17 OP insecticides in the Pearl River Estuary and South China Sea. The total concentrations varied from 126 – 1198 <b>ng</b> <b>l</b> 21 for OCl insecticides, 33. 38 – 1064 <b>ng</b> <b>l</b> 21 for PCB congeners, and 4. 44 – 6356 <b>ng</b> <b>l</b> 21 for OP insecticides in the Pearl River Estuary. In comparison, their levels in the South China Sea were significantly lower, varying from 57. 09 – 202 <b>ng</b> <b>l</b> 21 for OCl insecticides, 21. 72 – 144 <b>ng</b> <b>l</b> 21 for PCBs, and 1. 27 – 122 <b>ng</b> <b>l</b> 21 for OP insecticides, respectively. The predominance of b-HCH in HCHs, and DDE in DDTs in all water samples was clearly observed, suggesting b-HCH and DDE’s resistance to further degradation. The PCBs were dominated by those with 3 – 6 chlorines. The distribution characteristic of OP insecticides shows that five compounds (methamidophos, dimethoate, malathion, dichlorvos and omethoate) accounted for 56 % and 72 % of the total OP insecticide concentration. The relationship between pollutant concentrations and salinity in the estuary showed that they were all removed during the mixing process, therefore behaving non-conservatively...|$|R

In general, it was observed that 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol were more frequently detected at higher concentrations in the rivers of North China compared with those of South China. High concentration sites of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol mainly Occurred in the Yellow River, Huaihe River, and Haihe River watersheds, while pentachlorophenol contamination mainly occurred in the Yangtze River watershed.
