25|$|In Hawaii, Anagrus optabilis {{has been}} {{successfully}} used to control the sugarcane planthopper (Perkinsiella saccharicida). Anagrus epos has also previously been used effectively against the grape <b>leafhopper</b> (Erythroneura elegans) and the variegated grape <b>leafhopper</b> (Erythroneura variabilis). At first, it met limited success, as the wasps died in winter for lack of hosts. The planting of wild blackberries (Rubus spp.) near vineyards in California brought along with it the blackberry <b>leafhopper</b> (Dikrella cruentata). Though not pests, D. cruentata proved to be sufficient hosts for A. epos in winter, allowing them to survive into the next year. They have {{also been shown to}} be capable of overwintering in prune leafhoppers (Edwardsiana prunicola).|$|E
25|$|BCTV is {{transmitted}} to nymphs of beet leafhoppers when they {{feed on the}} phloem of plants that are infected with the virus. Even though the <b>leafhopper</b> is infected with the virus, the virus does not replicate within the <b>leafhopper</b> and causes no harm to them. BCTV cannot {{be passed on to}} their offspring. The only way for offsprings to be infected with the virus is if they fed on any plants infected with the BCTV. Once the beet leafhoppers ingest the virus, it moves from their digestive tract to the salivary glands. Once the infected leafhoppers migrate and feed on healthy plants, they transmit the virus by eating the phloem. The infected beet leafhoppers are able to infect various plants {{for the rest of their}} lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The beet <b>leafhopper</b> is {{commonly}} found in tropical and subtropical countries that have warm climates. They {{have been found to}} be residing within the Western part of the United States, Mexico, South America, and the Old World (the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East). During the winter in California, the beet <b>leafhopper</b> would migrate to the foothill of the coastal range located on the west side of the Central Valley and lay eggs in the perennial weeds and buckhorn plantains. When the nymphs of beet leafhoppers are born, they would consume the infected weeds and plants causing them to acquire the virus. During the mid to late spring, the adult leafhoppers would travel to the agricultural area of the Central Valley to infect other healthy plants and weeds. As fall approaches, the adult leafhoppers migrate back to the foothill and begin the process again.|$|E

25|$|Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is a {{pathogenic}} plant virus of {{the family}} Geminiviridae, containing a single-stranded DNA. The Geminiviridae family consists of four types (Curtovirus, Mastrevirus, Topocuvirus, and Begomovirus) based on their host range, virus genome structure, and type of insect vector. BCTV is a Curtovirus affecting hundreds of plants. The only known vector is the beet <b>leafhopper,</b> which is native to the Western United States.|$|E
25|$|Some pests, {{such as the}} alfalfa weevil, aphids, armyworms, and {{the potato}} <b>leafhopper,</b> can reduce alfalfa yields dramatically, {{particularly}} with the second cutting when weather is warmest. Registered insecticides or chemical controls are sometimes used to prevent this and labels will specify the withholding period before the forage crop can be grazed or cut for hay or silage. Alfalfa is also susceptible to root rots, including Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, and Texas root rot.|$|E
25|$|Merlot {{thrives in}} cold soil, {{particularly}} ferrous clay. The vine tends to bud early which gives it some risk to cold frost and its thinner skin increases its susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of Botrytis bunch rot. If bad weather occurs during flowering, the Merlot vine {{is prone to}} develop coulure. The vine can also be susceptible to downy mildew (though it has better resistance to powdery mildew than other Bordeaux varieties) and to infection by <b>leafhopper</b> insect varieties.|$|E
50|$|The Cephalelini is a {{tribe of}} <b>leafhoppers</b> {{containing}} several genera found in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Most species associate with plants from the Restionaceae family. The South African Cephalelini are {{commonly known as}} restio <b>leafhoppers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Brochosomes are ultramicroscopic {{particles}} {{produced in}} large quantities by the Malpighian tubules of <b>leafhoppers</b> (Insecta, Hemiptera, and Cicadellidae) and applied by <b>leafhoppers</b> as a coat to their integuments. A recent study has described brochosomes on museum specimens of Heteroptera and Psylloidea, suggesting a wider distribution of brochosomes among Hemiptera. Here, I report {{that the majority of}} adult Sthenarus rotermundi (Scholtz) (Miridae) and Kleidocerys resedae (Panzer) (Lygaeidae) reared in captivity and handled with clean tools had no brochosomes on them, suggesting that the earlier records of brochosomes in these and perhaps other species outside of the Cicadellidae were due to contamination. Additionally, simple experiments demonstrated that insects can become contaminated with brochosomes via entomological tools that had been in contact with <b>leafhoppers</b> and via preservation in ethanol together with <b>leafhoppers.</b> Contamination of host plants, predators, and parasites of <b>leafhoppers</b> with brochosomes is also expected but remains to be demonstrated...|$|R
25|$|Many {{states which}} were afflicted with the BCTV soon began using {{insecticides}} {{to reduce the}} number of BCTV outbreaks. In 1943, California adopted the BCTV management program, which is still running today. This program focuses on the use of insecticides to reduce the amount of beet <b>leafhoppers</b> by spraying chemicals in non-crop areas where the beet <b>leafhoppers</b> reside. Killing the beet <b>leafhoppers</b> before they invade susceptible host crops leads to fewer crops being infected. Slowly, the use of insecticides was questioned due to its effects on the environment, non-target organisms, and endangered species. As the number of beet <b>leafhoppers</b> continued to rise, the EPA ordered the use of clothianidin to help control the insects in 2006, 2007 and 2008.|$|R

40|$|Specific {{areas in}} South America were {{surveyed}} from 2000 - 2005 for egg parasitoids of sharpshooters that are pre-adapted to California’s climate and glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) habitats. At least 20 species were collected; 4 from Argentina readily attacked and bred on GWSS eggs in quarantine. To {{ensure that the}} most promising exotic species do not also attack nontarget <b>leafhoppers</b> and other taxa, tests were conducted in both Argentina and the United States to determine effective host range. Laboratory tests with native fauna in Argentina demonstrated that one promising species, Gonatocerus tuberculifemur, did not attack <b>leafhoppers</b> or other insects outside the sharpshooter tribe, Proconiini. Similar results were found in U. S. quarantine using California and Texas <b>leafhoppers.</b> Field host range tests in Argentina showed that G. tuberculifemur emerged from small numbers of <b>leafhoppers</b> within a different tribe (Cicadellini). Questions regarding the taxonomic status of this parasitoid must be resolved. It s that G. tuberculifemur can attack GWSS but not unrelated <b>leafhoppers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{mountain}} <b>leafhopper</b> survives on winter {{annual weeds}} during winter, usually near stream banks or canals. In late winter or spring, adults {{can be found}} in sugar beet fields and can then migrate to favored weed hosts (curly dock, burclovers) in orchards. The mountain <b>leafhopper</b> is most often the abundant vector found on cherry, however, cherry is not the preferred host and the <b>leafhopper</b> does not reproduce on cherry. Preferred hosts for the mountain <b>leafhopper</b> are; alfalfa, California burclover, clovers, curly dock, and sweet clovers. Of the preferred hosts alfalfa and curly dock cannot become infected with the disease itself but are just a host for the <b>leafhopper.</b> Occasional hosts are; vetches (in legume family) and sweet cherry. It’s believed that the role of this <b>leafhopper</b> is introducing the disease into cherry orchards rather than spreading the disease between cherry trees within an orchard.(http://ucanr.org/sites/cccoopext/files/80935.pdf) ...|$|E
50|$|In a {{follow-up}} study {{to understand the}} exact mechanism of uptake of S. citri cells by beet <b>leafhopper</b> gut cells, researchers developed a line of beet <b>leafhopper</b> cells called the CT1 cell line.
