5|$|On November 17, 1997, {{an empty}} train {{collided}} with another train waiting to depart Union Station with over 800 passengers on board. The empty train's locomotive engineer {{was at the}} opposite end of the train, and the conductor at the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> failed in his attempts to relay the situation to the engineer or apply the emergency brake. The two trains then collided at a speed of , causing a partial derailment and minor injuries to fifty-four passengers and two crew members. The subsequent Transportation Safety Board report made recommendations, including making emergency brakes more accessible and that the locomotive engineer must always control the train from the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> in the Union Station Rail Corridor.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E
25|$|The smaller {{diameter}} of the tube train {{in relation to the}} tunnel allowed the first car to ride up over the hydraulic buffers, with the second coach driving under the first, leading to significant damage at this end. The leading driving car buckled at three points into a V shape and was crushed to less than half its length between the wall and the weight of the train piling up behind it. The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> as it rode over the second car. Forty-two passengers and the driver died and 74 passengers were treated in hospital for their injuries.|$|E

25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> of the fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which {{open and shut}} to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E

Eleven people were cut free from the wreckage.

50|$|The {{traction}} pipe slot and {{the piston}} bracket were handed; {{that is the}} slot closure flap was continuously hinged on one side, and the piston support bracket was cranked to minimise the necessary opening of the flap. This meant that the piston carriage could not simply be turned on a turntable {{at the end of}} a trip. Instead it was double ended, but the piston was manually transferred to the new <b>leading</b> <b>end.</b> The piston carriage itself had to be moved manually (or by horse power) to the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> of the train. At Dartmouth Arms the station platform was an island between the two steam operated lines. Cubitt designed a special system of pointwork that enabled the atmospheric piston carriage to enter the ordinary track.|$|E

50|$|The chimney {{was usually}} located above the smokebox at the <b>leading</b> <b>end</b> of the locomotive, furthest {{away from the}} driver's cab and firebox. The {{earliest}} locomotive chimneys were typically tall enough to sustain temperature-induced density difference draught through a fire-tube boiler while the locomotive was stationary; but following the example of Richard Trevithick's first locomotive in 1804, most designs diverted steam cylinder exhaust upward through the chimney to create a vacuum in the smokebox and accelerate airflow through the firebox while the locomotive was in motion.|$|E
