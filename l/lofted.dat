5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia replaced Brownwho {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings with the all rounder Loxton, {{who had made}} an unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire. England made 363 after electing to bat. On the second day, Australia were in trouble when Hassett came in at 2/13. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in flight by Jack Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and <b>lofted</b> a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar <b>lofted</b> drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Cyril Washbrook at wide mid-off. This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute after}} this, Liverpool scored through captain Gerrard, who {{connected}} with Riise's cross and <b>lofted</b> a header past Dida. Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range {{shot into the}} bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind. Three minutes after Šmicer's goal, Liverpool were awarded a penalty, after Gerrard made a run into the Milan box for Baros' lay-off and was brought down by Gennaro Gattuso. Xabi Alonso's penalty was saved, but he scored from the rebound to equalise for Liverpool. Milan and Liverpool had chances {{to take the lead}} after this, but Clarence Seedorf and Riise failed to score.|$|E
5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris <b>lofted</b> into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Loft</b> {{block is}} an {{overhead}} block that supports a single lift line. A <b>loft</b> block supports and redirects a lift {{line from the}} batten to the head block of a line set. Under-hung <b>loft</b> blocks typically mount to <b>loft</b> block beams (fly <b>loft</b> roof beams). Upright <b>loft</b> blocks typically mount to <b>loft</b> block wells (grid-level structural channels). A spot block is a readily movable <b>loft</b> block for mounting anywhere on the grid deck for spot rigging.|$|R
50|$|A <b>loft</b> can be {{an upper}} storey or attic in a building, {{directly}} under the roof (US usage) or just a storage space under the roof usually accessed by a ladder (British usage). A <b>loft</b> apartment refers to large adaptable open space, often converted for residential use (a converted <b>loft)</b> from some other use, often light industrial. Adding to the confusion, some converted <b>lofts</b> include upper open <b>loft</b> areas. Within certain upper <b>loft</b> areas exist even further <b>lofts,</b> which may contain <b>loft</b> areas of their own, and so forth.|$|R

5|$|He {{registered}} his {{century in}} 115 minutes, clouting another five balls over the boundary {{in the morning}} session. One of Miller's sixes travelled over 170m {{in the air to}} Block Q next to the pavilion. He then aimed a <b>lofted</b> shot over long on from the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly went over the press box and clipped the top of the roof. Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Macartney joined North Sydney Cricket Club in {{the first}} {{division}} of Sydney Grade Cricket and then moved to the Gordon club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed during the 1905–06 season. He played regularly for Gordon until 1933–34 when he was 47, amassing 7648 runs {{at an average of}} 54.62. He was known for his dominant status at the Chatswood Oval. In one match, he <b>lofted</b> a ball out of the ground, over a railway line and onto an adjacent lawn bowling green, forcing the players to take evasive action.|$|E
5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but <b>lofted</b> Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Loft</b> Law Amendment (also {{referred}} to as Expanded <b>Loft</b> Law) is a New York law that created a new window period for recognition of <b>loft</b> tenants that previously did not qualify under the original 1982 <b>Loft</b> Law.|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} which involved only short distance experimental releases (800 m or less and within view of the home <b>loft),</b> it was demonstrated that dorsomedial forebrain ablated pigeons generally failed to reassociate with their home <b>loft</b> if the postablation experimental release took place soon postablation or if during the time between ablation and experimental release they were kept away from their home <b>loft.</b> In contrast, if dorsomedial forebrain ablated pigeons were allowed to recover at their home <b>loft</b> prior to experimental release, they succeeded in associating with their home <b>loft</b> {{in a manner similar}} to controls. However, only postablation exposure to a pigeon's own <b>loft</b> was sufficient to permit continued home <b>loft</b> association. Pigeons from one <b>loft</b> failed to associate with a foreign postablation recovery <b>loft</b> when released within sight of it. The results show that dorsomedial forebrain ablations result in pigeons which no longer succeed in associating with their home loft; recovery from failed home <b>loft</b> association behavior is possible with postablation exposure to the home <b>loft,</b> and a pigeon's previous association with a <b>loft</b> was a precondition if postablation association was to be affected. The results suggest that dorsomedial forebrain ablated pigeons retain something like a 'home <b>loft</b> trace' which they can use to mediate retrieval and reformation of the recognition properties needed for proper home <b>loft</b> association...|$|R
5000|$|The typical <b>loft</b> for woods {{ranges from}} 7.5 to 31 degrees. Driver <b>lofts</b> {{generally}} center around 10.5° but the desired <b>loft</b> is very {{dependent upon the}} player's swing speed (low swing speeds need higher lofts); men's <b>lofts</b> vary between 8 and 11 degrees while women's drivers are between 10 and 13 degrees, and seniors' <b>lofts</b> trend toward the upper range by gender. The average 3-wood has a 13-16 degree <b>loft</b> (typically 15°) and the average 5-wood has an 18-21 degree <b>loft.</b> Higher <b>lofts</b> than that overlap with irons in distance, but many players prefer high-number woods to low-number irons wherever {{they can be used}} as the wood is easier to hit than a [...] "long iron". The <b>loft</b> of any given club number varies between manufacturers, model lines, and the target player.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played {{into the hands of the}} Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he <b>lofted</b> from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.|$|E
5|$|Edrich then {{relieved}} Coxon, who had bowled {{his first}} seven overs in Test cricket {{for the loss}} of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to the leg side, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the leg trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a <b>lofted</b> leg glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.|$|E
5|$|In the 22ndminute, a <b>lofted</b> through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and {{went out for a}} corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling to the ground in the inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E

25|$|In 1935, <b>Loft</b> sued Guth for {{breaching}} {{his duty}} {{of loyalty to}} the company by failing to sell the syrup formula to <b>Loft,</b> and instead appropriating it for himself. <b>Loft</b> argued that while its president, Guth used <b>Loft's</b> assets, credit, finances, facilities and employees {{to build up the}} other company. Guth argued that the opportunity came to him personally and that it was out of <b>Loft's</b> business sector. <b>Loft</b> sued for the 237,500 shares that Guth owned (91% of Pepsi-Cola's total shares). He remained president of Pepsi during the process. In 1939, the Delaware supreme court rendered the verdict in favor of <b>Loft.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Loft</b> block wells are ten inch {{gaps between}} pairs of {{face-to-face}} steel channels {{flush with the}} grid deck that occur beneath each <b>loft</b> block beam. The <b>loft</b> blocks of a hemp, or grid-mount counterweight, rigging system can mount to the <b>loft</b> block well channels. The <b>loft</b> block wells may also act as clear openings through which the lift lines of under-hung counterweight, or automated, systems may pass.|$|R
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Harvey scored {{seven and}} struggled {{in contrast to}} the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head. His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval. The home team's captain Stuart Surridge <b>lofted</b> a drive down the ground, and Harvey ran 25m from wide long-on and leapt in the air to catch the ball, which would have cleared the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match.|$|E
5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his <b>lofted</b> shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller {{just as he}} was looking to get his shot away. On 15 minutes, they came even closer to breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass had sent him through.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was <b>lofted</b> and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was <b>lofted</b> and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E

50|$|Historically, <b>loft</b> {{residents}} {{consisted of}} artists and other artisans taking advantage of cheap rents, large spaces and load-bearing floors. <b>Loft</b> residences were illegal and <b>loft</b> dwellers resided under commercial leases, forgoing basic residential rights such as hot water and sanitation.

50|$|A <b>loft</b> {{conversion}} or {{an attic}} conversion {{is the process}} of transforming an empty attic space or <b>loft</b> into a functional room, typically used as a bedroom, office space, a gym, or storage space. <b>Loft</b> conversions {{are one of the most}} popular forms of home improvement in the United Kingdom as a result of their numerous perceived benefits.

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes {{was unable to}} {{complete}} the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley <b>lofted</b> Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs—including 20 maidens—as England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease for one minute as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had the {{majority}} of the possession up to this point, with Dortmund content to counter-attack. The tactic worked as Dortmund took lead in the 61st minute. Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on the left hand side of the pitch, Emmerich played a <b>lofted</b> pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down the left hand side of the pitch and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on the left hand side of the pitch signalled to the referee that the ball had gone out of play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal to stand. There were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed. With the scores still level at 1–1, the match went into extra-time.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} by commentators {{to be the}} benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, The Jubilee Book of Cricket, Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the off side, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as off theory, of bowling the ball just outside the off stump. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was {{a key factor in}} limiting his range of leg side shots. He favoured <b>lofted</b> shots which were often compared to golf strokes.|$|E
50|$|During the 2013-14 season, <b>Loft</b> {{had been}} a regular fixture in the first-team, scoring nine goals in 43 league and cup appearances, until April 2014, when an alleged {{training}} ground altercation between <b>Loft</b> and teammate Daniel Jones left <b>Loft</b> out of action {{for the remainder of}} the season. Manager Micky Adams stressed that <b>Loft</b> was the innocent party in the confrontation that left <b>Loft</b> with a broken cheekbone and Jones was sacked following a club investigation.|$|R
50|$|A {{bungalow}} with <b>loft</b> has a second-storey <b>loft.</b> The <b>loft</b> may {{be extra}} space over the garage. It is often {{space to the}} side of a great room with a vaulted ceiling area.

5|$|Several {{communities}} in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, {{as many as}} 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands of cows were killed, and that {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees were toppled. Not one church or school was left standing in the county, and damage there was estimated at $250,000. Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed by the collapse of their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were <b>lofted</b> nearly a half mile downwind. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as St. Augustine. In Fernandina Beach, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings. Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached , the effects were generally insignificant.|$|E
5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand <b>lofted</b> a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He <b>lofted</b> Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
