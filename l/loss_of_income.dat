5|$|High-priced oil {{allowed the}} USSR {{to support the}} {{struggling}} economies of the Soviet bloc during the 1974–1981 petrodollar surge, and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> during the 1980s oil glut contributed to the bloc's collapse in 1989. During the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, OPEC member Venezuela played a similar role supporting Cuba and other regional allies, before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1969 the Irish {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Nelson Pillar Act, terminating the Pillar Trust and vesting {{ownership of the}} site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> In the debate, Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington argued that the Pillar had been capable of repair {{and should have been}} re-assembled and rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1999, Moscoso {{oversaw the}} {{handover}} of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Her government then faced {{the challenge of}} cleaning up environmental problems in the Canal Zone, where the US Army had long tested bombs, biological agents, and chemical weapons. Remaining issues included lead contamination, unexploded munitions, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. Though Moscoso fired all of Pérez Balladares' appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate (and future president) Ricardo Martinelli as its head, the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration. At the same time, Panama's economy began to struggle due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> from American canal personnel.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} conclusion can be drawn. When we try {{to maximize}} the welfare effects of production we have to maximize real income formation. Maximizing productivity leads to a suboptimum, i.e., to <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> {{from the}} Diocese of Africa were {{equivalent}} to the costs of nearly 40,000 infantry or over 20,000 cavalry. The imperial regime had to increase taxes. Despite admitting that the peasantry could pay no more, and that a sufficient army could not be raised, the imperial regime protected the interests of landowners displaced from Africa and allowed wealthy individuals to avoid taxes.|$|R

5|$|Sylvia Lim was an NCMP from 2006 till Parliament was {{dissolved}} in 2011 {{for the general}} election held that year, at which she was elected {{as one of the}} MPs for Aljunied GRC. While she was an NCMP, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill 2009 which would permit an organ donor to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> Lim spoke of her worry that the bill might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|This spell {{in the top}} {{division}} ended {{after two}} seasons and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> due to relegation led to the club going into financial administration. There was the minor consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, this time via the UEFA Fair Play ranking, and Ipswich survived two ties before losing {{in the second round}} proper to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the season, culminating in a 0–3 defeat at struggling Grimsby Town, meant that Burley was sacked in October 2002 after nearly eight years as manager.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{upstream}} toll bridges at Windsor and Maidenhead, {{the crossing}} at Datchet was toll-free for both River and road and {{quickly became a}} popular crossing. Seeking compensation for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> on their bridges, the corporations of Windsor and Maidenhead made claims to the Treasury. In 1708 Windsor was granted an ex-gratia payment of £55 (equivalent to £ today) plus £25 and £20 to two tenants (equivalent to £ and £ respectively). Maidenhead's complaint, not made until 1714, was noted but no compensation paid.|$|E

50|$|Figure {{above is}} a {{somewhat}} exaggerated depiction {{because the whole}} production function is shown. In practice, decisions are made in a limited range of the production functions, but the principle is still the same; the maximum real income is aimed for. An important conclusion can be drawn. When we try to maximize the welfare effects of production we have to maximize real income formation. Maximizing productivity leads to a suboptimum, i.e. to <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The MR {{management}} were {{horrified at}} the potential <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> and restarted {{negotiations with the}} GCR, and a 1906 agreement meant that GCR traffic was shared between {{the old and new}} routes. Management of the shared route north of Harrow alternated every five years between the MR and GCR. (A proposed link between Marylebone and the sub-surface section of the Metropolitan Railway, which would have allowed GCR trains to run across London via the MR-controlled Thames Tunnel and on to the south coast, was abandoned.) The sharing arrangement meant through trains running from Chesham to Marylebone, as well as the MR terminus at Baker Street, and that the branch was worked by GCR trains as well as the ageing MR rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E
5|$|Kayibanda {{presided over}} a Hutu {{republic}} for the next decade, ruling in a top down manner similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. In 1973, Hutu army officer Juvénal Habyarimana toppled Kayibanda in a coup. Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana, but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence. A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to foreign aid receipts. The family of first lady Agathe Habyarimana, known as the akazu, were the principal winners in this fight. The family had a more respected lineage {{than that of the}} president, having ruled one of the independent states near Gisenyi in the nineteenth century. Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west. The akazu exploited this to their advantage, with Habyarimana increasingly unable to rule without them. The economic crisis forced Habyarimana to heavily reduce the national budget; to quell civil unrest, he declared a commitment to multi-party politics, but did not take any action to bring this about. Student protests followed, and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.|$|E
50|$|The LSWR {{had been}} slower than {{competing}} lines to plan electrification, {{and it was}} the LB&SCR among the railways south of London that electrified some of its suburban lines, with the first opening on 1 December 1909. Street tramways and competing, electric railways, coupled with demographic factors, led to <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> year on year which were becoming serious, such that London area fares were reduced from 1 January 1914 to try to stem the loss.|$|R

5|$|Matteo Sereni and Finidi George arrived {{before the}} 2001–02 season {{to boost the}} squad for its foray into Europe. The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1–0 {{at home in the}} third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4–1 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight {{fixtures}} appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed {{on the final day of}} the season with a 5–0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting in the sale of a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, BINA Istra (the {{operator}} of the motorway) collected €38million in revenues while its expenditure reached €230million. In {{the first half}} of 2011, however, BINA Istra reported 65.8millionkuna (€8.9million) of income in {{the first half of}} 2011, without VAT. This income represented a 30.8percent increase compared to the same period in the previous year. (The figure includes income from the entire Istrian Y system, i.e., both the A8 and A9 motorways.) Most of this increase is attributed to the introduction of a closed toll system along the routes, replacing an open toll system in which a toll was charged only at the Mirna Bridge (along the A9 motorway) and the Učka Tunnel. In 1999, the Croatian government negotiated amendments to the BINA Istra concession contract. These amendments allow the government to determine tolls along the A8 and A9 motorways, and the government decided to eliminate tolls on traffic flowing along the two-lane sections of the routes; to compensate for this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> the government subsidizes BINA Istra– for instance, in 2012 it is expected to receive a 165millionkuna (million) subsidy. By the end of 2010, the subsidy paid to BINA Istra reached a total of 1.3billionkuna (million); at the time, it was estimated that a further sum of 1.9billionkuna (million) may be paid in annual subsidies between 2011 and 2027, when the concession contract expires. BINA Istra estimates the total investment value of the construction it has carried out or planned on the A8 and A9 routes at one billion euros.|$|E

40|$|A {{multilevel}} optimization {{approach is}} presented {{for determining the}} optimum management of the Texas brown shrimp fishery. Independent fisher groups harvest this open access resource in a hierarchical order without cooperation among themselves or with the management authority. The special structure {{of the problem is}} exploited to derive the fishers' optimum responses to any arbitrary specification of the policy variables (season and area closures). Empirical results indicate that significant <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> and harvest value would occur if the fishery were unmanaged. The results also indicate that optimum closure policies vary significantly depending on the policy objective specification. Copyright 1996, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

25|$|Argentina enjoyed {{four years}} of rapid {{recovery}} from {{the economic and social}} crisis of 2001-02, {{which was one of the}} most severe <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> and downturns in living standards on record. Effective macroeconomic management, focused on the generation of primary fiscal surpluses, has helped to sustain this strong performance. Consequently, average real GDP increased by nearly 9% per year between 2003 and 2006, surpassing the maximum GDP reached in 1998. Poverty and unemployment have fallen substantially from their peaks during the economic crisis. Poverty has declined to about 31% from a high of over 57% in 2002, while unemployment fell to near 11% from 21% in 2003.|$|R
50|$|The {{statistics}} cover actual outlays. This means that, for example, <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> are {{not seen}} in the statistics {{with the exception of}} specific transfers (or subsidies) that are designed to compensate any economic losses. Neither do the statistics cover all activities that might have a beneficial environmental impact. There is a distinction between the purpose of the activity and the effect of the activity. For example, new production equipment that is installed solely for the purpose of increasing productivity and reducing costs may use energy and materials more efficiently, and as a side effect reduce environmental discharges. The expenditure for this new equipment would not be included in EPE.|$|R
