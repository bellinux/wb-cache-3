5|$|Æthelbert retired {{some time}} before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this {{occurred}} is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, {{but it could be}} 777 too. Eanbald's position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. During his retirement, he had constructed a new church dedicated to Alma Sophia. He <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> consecrate the new church, ten days before his death on 8 November.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see the theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|Men {{were also}} {{motivated}} by positive means. New medals were instituted: the Military Cross {{was created in}} December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for enlisted men in March 1916 (although to the regret of some men, it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one grade) was instituted in 1917. By 1918, medals for bravery were often awarded within a week {{to ensure that the}} man <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> receive it.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin had no {{legitimate}} descendants, {{though it}} is probable he had illegitimate issue. Four of his five sisters <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as 'Helen') received Potemkin's special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, {{one of whom was}} twelve or thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships successively with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.|$|E

50|$|Thucydides {{states that}} people ceased fearing the law since {{they felt they}} were already living under a death sentence. Likewise, people started {{spending}} money indiscriminately. Many felt they would not <b>live</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the fruits of wise investment, {{while some of the}} poor unexpectedly became wealthy by inheriting the property of their relatives. It is also recorded that people refused to behave honorably because most did not expect <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> enjoy a good reputation for it.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if he had <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} from the {{beginning}} of the bridge's life, it was toll-free for Lumberland residents. Eventually the town leased the bridge out to private individuals, who collected tolls indiscriminately. During times when bridge could not be leased, the town retained control. The tollhouse was later removed and sold. It is now a home. Originally, the settlement of Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side was named Flagstone, but changed to its current name upon construction. Both Pond Eddys expanded rapidly. A new railroad station was created in Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side. The riverfront location on the New York side had two stores, a Methodist church, a telegraph office, eighteen homes and a new hotel with a restaurant. The hotel had new owners around the time of the bridge and eventually became a large stop for travelers. The Pond Eddy Bridge served the town of Lumberland well in the late 19th century, but the area's prosperity did not last. The canal went out of business in 1898, after years of competition from railroads. The Erie station on the Pennsylvania had no roads to go anywhere, and the community began to decline. Decker died at 77 years old in 1900, having <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> experience the rise and fall of Pond Eddy.|$|E

The poison was traced back to her, and Penington <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> know the crime would be brought home against the perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|In Polwhele’s History of Cornwall, it is {{stated that}} a man {{resident}} in the nearby Grenville manor of Stratton <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see its site a cornfield before the building existed, and after the building was destroyed a cornfield again. The house was sold for building materials in 1739, and much of its fabric survives, having {{been used in the}} contemporary construction of West Country buildings.|$|E
25|$|Manuel II's reign {{saw another}} {{temporary}} respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, {{he succeeded in}} retaking some territory and held {{it to the end}} of his reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see his son undo much of his achievements.|$|E

Thomas also suffered from poor health, and spent much of his life as an invalid, reliant upon his mother for financial assistance. Despite his ill health, he <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> succeed his uncle as 4th Baron Grantley of Markenfield.|$|E
