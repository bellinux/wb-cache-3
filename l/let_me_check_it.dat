6000|$|But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>check</b> my proneness {{to dilate}} upon this {{favorite}} theme; I may recur to it hereafter. Suffice it to say, the intimacy thus formed, continued {{for a considerable}} time; and in company with the worthy Diedrich, I visited many of the places celebrated by his pen. The currents of our lives at length diverged. He remained at home to complete his mighty work, while a vagrant fancy led me to wander about the world. Many, many years elapsed, before I returned to the parent soil. In the interim, the venerable historian of the New Netherlands had been gathered to his fathers, but his name had risen to renown. His native city, that city in which he so much delighted, had decreed all manner of costly honors to his memory. I found his effigy imprinted upon new-year cakes, and devoured with eager relish by holiday urchins; a great oyster-house bore the name of [...] "Knickerbocker Hall;" [...] and I narrowly escaped the pleasure of being {{run over by a}} Knickerbocker omnibus! ...|$|R

60|$|I {{raised my}} head to get the direction, and then, with a violent twist of my body, I started toward him; but being bound fast I could not guide myself, and I rolled off the ledge. The bank there was pretty steep, and, unable to stop, I kept on like a barrel going down-bill. The thought of rolling into the spring filled me with horror. Suddenly I bumped hard into {{something}} that <b>checked</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> was a log of firewood, and in one end stuck the big knife which Herky-Jerky used to cut meat.|$|R
60|$|I was on {{the point}} of distributing bad marks (the schoolmaster's stand-by) broadcast, when a curious sound <b>checked</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> {{followed}} directly upon the opening of the front door. I heard White's footsteps crossing the hall, then the click of the latch, and then--a sound that I could not define. The closed door of the classroom deadened it, but for all that it was audible. It resembled the thud of a falling body, but I knew it could not be that, for in peaceful England butlers opening front doors did not fall with thuds.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} Greaser {{running toward the}} cave put me into a frenzy. Dropping the knife, I darted to where my rifle leaned across my saddle. But I saw the Mexican would beat <b>me</b> to <b>it.</b> <b>Checking</b> my speed, I grabbed up a round stone and let fly. That was where my ball-playing stood me in good stead, for the stone hit Greaser on the shoulder, {{knocking}} him flat. But he got up, and lunged for the rifle just as I reached him.|$|R
