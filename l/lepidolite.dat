5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and <b>lepidolite,</b> {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. <b>Lepidolite</b> contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the receptaculite Tetragonis sulcata d'Eichwald, 1860 in Upper Ordovician erratics from the {{northern}} Netherlands. D'Eichwald's original description is reviewed, giving a wider conception of the morphological diversity of receptaculites. Tetragonis sulcata is placed in the family Tetra-gonaceae Rietschel, 1969 (nomen correctum), together with <b>Lepidolites</b> dickhauti Ulrich, 1879. The aim {{of this study was to}} reconstruct the living receptaculite organism by documenting homologies between Tetragonis sulcata and receptaculites described in the literature. Through analysis of a diverse set of morphological features which thus were obtained, an attempt could be made to determine the pattern of receptaculite morphogenesis. This study therefore concentrates on the func tional morphology, growth, and calcification of meroms which are extensively reviewed, particularly with respect to receptaculite growth.

40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of "protolithionites" 1 M and 3 T were refined in the C 2 /m and P 3 (1) 12 space groups with R equal to 3. 8 and 3. 0 % and R(w) 5. 4 and 3. 2 %, respectively. Refinement of the 1 M structure in subgroup symmetry (C 2) {{did not result}} in a significant improvement of fit and was not accepted. The 1 M mica has a mesooctahedral cation ordering (two octahedra identical), similar to that of muscovite but with less pronounced differences in size between M 1 and M 2; Li and Fe 2 + prefer M 1 to M 2, Al does the opposite. Like all 3 T structures refined to date, the "prototithionite" 3 T has a heterooctahedral ordering rather similar to that found in "protolithionite" 3 T of Pavlishin et al. (1981) and zinnwaldite 1 M of Guggenheim & Bailey (1977), The two large (though not identical) octahedra M 3, M 1 contain all Li and most Fe, the small (M 2) octahedron is occupied with Al. This type of ordering is apparently suitable for a relatively wide range of compositions of Li-Fe micas; the <b>lepidolites</b> are not included, and neither are iron-rich compositions. "Protolithionite" 1 M has no pronounced octahedral ordering and all octahedra are nearly the same in size...|$|R

The geometry of merom distribution as a result of polar growth of receptaculites has been studied. A description is given of a merom arrangement not yet considered before, the Tetragonis type, which is compared with the normal, Receptaculites, type. Controversial issues, such as the position of soft parts in receptaculites as well as their life orientation, are discussed with regard to their palaeobiological significance. This approach produced some arguments against an apex-down orientation, as proposed by Campbell et al. (1974). Based on these data, the systematic position of receptaculites is analysed. Consequently, it is inferred that they should be regarded as calcareous algae.

5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is <b>lepidolite.</b> A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral <b>lepidolite.</b> The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red line for rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and <b>lepidolite.</b> In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperiments {{have been}} {{performed}} both on a peraluminous leucogranitic (DK 89) and a F-, Li-, P-rich pegmatitic (B 2) melt to constrain the stability of micas in evolved crustal silicic magmas and refine mica-melt partition coefficients for F, Li, and Be. The experiments were conducted in parallel in two fO 2 ranges, “oxidizing” (NNO + 1 to + 3) and “reducing” (NNO – 1. 6 to – 1. 4). One two-stage reducing-oxidizing experiment was conducted in a vessel fitted with a H 2 -permeable Shaw-type membrane. The approach toward equilibrium was tested by imposing long experimental durations and combining mica crystallization experiments with mica dissolution experiments using mica seeds. Experimental micas and melts were analyzed for major elements by electron microprobe and for light elements by nuclear microprobe. At 3 kbar, 620 °C, and under oxidizing conditions, B 2 crystallized only muscovite, the biotite seeds reacting {{to form a new}} mica intermediate between phengite and Li-rich phengite. Under reducing conditions, biotite (siderophyllite composition) appeared as the stable mica. The two-stage experiment yielded a composite mica assemblage with siderophyllite cores mantled by muscovite rims. At 3. 5 – 3. 8 kbar, 720 °C, and under oxidizing conditions, DK 89 crystallized only aluminous biotite and muscovite seeds reacted to form biotite-bearing assemblages; muscovite appeared together with biotite at 700 °C. Under reducing conditions, Al-rich biotite is also the stable mica at 720 °C. Partition coefficients show that F and Li are preferentially incorporated in biotite rather than in muscovite, the opposite as for Be. Biotite fractionation buffers the F and increases the Li and Be contents of the residual melt. Muscovite increases the Li content of the melt and has little influence on F and Be concentrations. Our experiments reproduce mica assemblages and compositions typical of Variscan pegmatites and leucogranites, yet very Li-rich micas (e. g., <b>lepidolites)</b> were not obtained. The results stress the differential influence of fO 2 on mica stability in moderately and highly fractionated crustal melts. Mica crystallization in leucogranites {{does not appear to be}} strongly dependent on fO 2. In contrast, a very strong influence of fO 2 on stable mica assemblages is demonstrated for the pegmatitic melt. The reducing experiments emphasize the existence of a stability field for biotite in melts poor in Fe, Mg, and Ti. If fO 2 is reducing, biotite must crystallize in moderately to highly evolved peraluminous crustal melts. In contrast, the crystallization of muscovite as the sole mica in evolved crustal melts constitutes an indicator of oxidizing fO 2. Such an oxidizing evolution that deviates from classical buffered T-logfO 2 trajectories is the consequence of a mechanism of magma “self-oxidation” that is proposed to result from dissociation of H 2 O in the melt...|$|R
25|$|After M.H. Klaproth had {{discovered}} the presence of potassium in leucite and <b>lepidolite,</b> it occurred to L. N. Vauquelin that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. Knowing that alum cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient in the salt, and in 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. Soon after, J.A. Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum and alum manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as Vauquelin.|$|E
500|$|Rubidium was {{discovered}} in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral <b>lepidolite</b> through spectroscopy.

500|$|Rubidium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in <b>lepidolite.</b> Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150kg of a <b>lepidolite</b> containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb2PtCl6) could be obtained by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51grams of rubidium chloride for further studies. Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with [...] of mineral water, which yielded 7.3grams of caesium chloride and 9.2grams of rubidium chloride. Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just {{one year after the}} invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{its large}} ionic radius, {{rubidium}} {{is one of}} the [...] "incompatible elements." [...] During magma crystallization, rubidium is concentrated together with its heavier analogue caesium in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of rubidium and caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because rubidium substitutes for potassium in the crystallization of magma, the enrichment is far less effective than that of caesium. Zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as pollucite or the lithium minerals <b>lepidolite</b> are also a source for rubidium as a by-product.|$|E
