Therefore, rain runoff water pollution in most urbanized and industrialized city of central India, i.e., Raipur during rainy season (May–September 2012) is analyzed statistically using cluster and principal component analysis to assess sources. The cluster analysis grouped runoff water samples into two clusters based on the similarity of runoff water quality characteristics of the total variance. The factor analysis differentiated the diffused sources of runoff water contaminants. The enrichment factors and runoff fluxes of the contaminants are discussed.|$|R

Latest researches deal with removing <b>pollutants</b> from <b>land</b> using bioextraction, based on biosynthetic processes in plants, including toxic metals (phytoremedation). Bioextraction processes where metal cations are transported from land in plant, especially cations of heavy metals, are dependent on balances that are establishing in aqueous solutions, depending on pH and present coexisting components. Present investigations of bioextraction treatment included monitoring of efficiency in removing heavy metals with addition of various organic components. This paper deals with investigation of Cd(II), Pb(II) and Fe(III) interactions in aqueous solutions with addition of crown ethers, cationic and anionic tenzides. Specially there is considered impact of tenzides, as surface active components, present in waste waters. Mechanism of complexation and balance state restoration are investigated depending on solution pH and metal cationic and organic additive concentration.

The author discusses how the principles of the Breaking the Logjam project might be applied in crafting solutions to the problems posed by the temporal dimension of hazardous waste management and concludes with the suggestion of an additional principle of institutional learning and the conservation of options: in any long-term effort one must expect that over time we will come to understand a problem better and so develop better ideas for addressing it.

The problem of heavy metal pollution is currently increasing in many lakes of Kashmir, India viz. Dal, Nigeen, Anchar etc. The present study was thus designed to assess the heavy metal contamination of the Anchar Lake. The lake being located in the north-west of Srinagar city had become a recipient of urban run-off and surrogate end point for pollutants of domestic and commercial effluents. Due to fast growing settlements around the lake, it {{is now one of the}} most polluted lakes of the Kashmir valley. Run-off from agricultural <b>land,</b> <b>pollutants</b> from septic systems, sewers and other human-related activities increase the flux of both inorganic nutrients and organic substances into the Anchar lake. The direct discharge and accidental release of harmful chemical compounds from the SKIMS Institute into the Anchar lake has totally deteriorated the lake quality (ESRO 2007). Pollution of this lake is of grave concern that it is a dwelling place for many birds and is a source of fodder for animals. Therefore, the main objective of the present work was to assess the heavy metal concentration in water, sediment and in Lemna minor, a free floating aquatic plant.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to survey and risk {{evaluate}} 9 out of 23 disused landfills in Vilhelmina municipality, Västerbotten, Sweden. The study is based on MIFO methodology which is developed by the Swedish Environmental protection agency, EPA. The MIFO methodology is divided into two phases and this study deals with phase one. The intended use for MIFO is to evaluate the risk of these nine disused landfills and assess polluted soil and water areas. The results of the study are described for each landfill with respect to degree of pollution, the toxicity of the pollutants, conditions for distribution from soil to groundwater, soil to surface water, and surface water to sediments. The conclusions of the risk classification indicate that one landfill ended up in a class 2 and the other landfills ended up in class 3. Two of nine landfills are in need of action while the others need a control program to continuously monitor the status of the landfill. Metals were analyzed from soils of three landfills, and although these landfills were leaching, no levels exceeded the guideline value for <b>land.</b> <b>Pollutants</b> have been analyzed in surface water and groundwater of two of the landfills, but high detection limit and small sample sizes prevented accurate comparisons with available guidelines.

40|$|SUMMARY: For an {{unconfined}} coastal aquifer, {{an improved}} {{understanding of the}} effects of tidal fluctuations on contaminant movement allows better strategies to be implemented to con-trol or mitigate the effects of contaminants on coastal wetlands, coastal aquifers, and the adjacent marine environment. These effects are investigated using a two-dimensional groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical model. Density differences have not been included because of the marked increase in complexity and computational cost entailed. The results are useful nevertheless, since they are relevant to saline groundwater carrying contaminants to the sea. In addition, when freshwater discharge is large the seawater wedge formed due to the higher seawater density will be short and the velocity patterns, and hence the contaminant discharge at the shore, will still be dominated by outflow {{at the top of the}} aquifer as in the present analyses. It is shown that tidal fluctuations have a significant effect on the spatial distribution of contami-nant in the aquifer near the shore line. The concentration profile along the sloping face between sea and aquifer is influenced significantly by tidal fluctuations. A practical implication of this phenomenon, in the context of environmental management, is a better understanding of the ef-fects of <b>land</b> based <b>pollutants</b> on the near shore marine biology. ...|$|R

Seven lithofacies, eight grain-size types and six clusters reveal comparable geographic distributions that are a direct response to geomorphic setting and depositional processes, {{both of which have}} been modified by man. Although positioned in an arid setting and affected by anthropogenic factors (<b>land</b> reclamation, <b>pollutants),</b> regional subfacies distribution patterns in Idku lagoon are largely a function of the spatial configuration of freshwater-dominated to brackish to higher salinity-dominated (near inlet) zones typical of lagoons receiving significant freshwater input. Within Idku, a northern depositional province near the inlet and along the coastal sand barrier is defined by associations of terrigenous and coarse-grained sediment types. A southern province, bounded by lagoon margins and marshes, is characterized by finer-grained sediment types, with a high biogenic content, recording lower energy levels. The petrological-statistical approach is used to identify and interpret lagoon subfacies in older (to > 6000 years B. P.) core sections in ldku region and in former Abu Qir lagoon. Additionally, cluster analysis serves to determine specific lagoon subfacies from hand samples alone, whether from surface grabs or cores; this is based on a comparison of lithofacies and clusters determined for surficial and short core samples in the ldku region. To test the method, a separate cluster analysis, also using surficial and short core samples, was used to define Manzala lagoon subfacies in the northeastern Nile delta.

Associated with climate change, the development of large urban and industrial areas {{has been found to}} be responsible for water quality degradation and recent flooding of watercourses. In parallel, increased pressure on land and costs associated with developments tend to place pressure on the space allocated to amenity in cities. This is despite the fact that amenity has been found to act positively on residents in terms of their wellbeing by raising living standards. Within this context, urban drainage has a key role to play by providing water quality, water quantity and amenity benefits according to the SuDS triangle philosophy. However, it is felt that urban drainage could potentially offer more than its current benefits by implementing SuDS in series; a treatment train. Indeed, despite environmental regulator guidance (CIRIA, 2007) a significant proportion of sites in Scotland are developed with a single “end-of-pipe” pond. Within this context, the research undertaken aimed to develop a framework which may be used by an environmental regulator to implement treatment trains and maximise potential water quality, water quantity and amenity benefits while preventing excessive constraints for other stakeholders involved in SuDS implementation. In this regard, the fears and expectations of stakeholders are investigated using structured interviews and questionnaires. This step allowed underlining drivers and barriers to SuDS implementation to be identified and a set of quantitative benchmarks to be developed including cost of construction and maintenance, <b>land</b> take, <b>pollutant</b> removal, attenuation volume and the willingness to pay for amenity benefits. To determine how the benchmarks interrelated, two case studies were investigated in Scotland: The Dalmarnock Road Area in Glasgow and the Houston Industrial Estate in Livingston. Based on water quality modelling using MUSIC and hydraulic modelling using Infoworks CS, it has been shown that the benefits, in terms of water treatment and attenuation, should be seen in the context of increased land take and/or costs for the area considered for virtually all the SUDS techniques. iii Based on the conclusions of the investigations, a general framework was formulated to optimise SuDS treatment trains for large developments. The framework, based on iterative water quality and hydraulic modelling aims to identify the relationship between drivers and barriers to SuDS implementation. The final decision regarding the extent to which the treatment train can be implemented can then be taken knowing its implications for all the stakeholders...|$|R
