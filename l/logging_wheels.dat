50|$|Michigan <b>logging</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{also known}} as big wheels, high wheels, <b>logging</b> <b>wheels,</b> logger wheels, lumbering wheels, bummer carts, {{katydids}} or nibs, are a type of skidder. It extended the season in which the logging industry could extract timber from the North Woods of Michigan, by removing the need for icy ground to travel over. The <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> were a specially designed large set of wooden wagon wheels that could carry logs that were up to 100 feet in length, several at a time.|$|E

40|$|Selecting {{the best}} {{harvesting}} {{system based on}} the physical characteristics of the logging area and economical parameters is an important decision for forest engineers. To consider different environmental, economical and social criteria this study uses an AHP decision making method to choose the best skidding system for a mountainous mixed hardwood forest. The possible available skidding alternatives are mule <b>logging,</b> <b>wheeled</b> cable skidder and tractor in the case study area. The AHP {{results showed that the}} best alternative is mule logging if all criteria have the same weight. But if the economical parameters are more important for the forest managers, then the tractor logging is the best choice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Combine {{harvester}} is {{the most}} widely used modern forest machinery; tracked and <b>wheeled</b> <b>logging</b> machine is the common stumper. But each type of logging machine has its shortcomings and therefore it is need to develop a combination of tracked and <b>wheeled</b> <b>logging</b> machine. This logging mechanism takes the form of tracked feet while preserving the flexibility of <b>wheeled</b> <b>logging</b> machine, and also it has the obstacle-crossing ability of tracked harvester. The most important indicator of the performance of this new logging machine is its trafficability in soft and uneven road. This thesis uses multi-body dynamic simulation analysis software RecurDyn to build up the 3 D model of such four feet tracked logging machine, and analyzes its dynamical process when meeting ditch. Eventually the logging mechanism performance is got. The conclusions provide foundation for design of combined harvester with four tracked feet...|$|R

50|$|In 1875, {{he began}} making special pairs of {{extra-large}} wagon wheels that were 10 ft in diameter called <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> or big wheels. They were double {{the size of}} ordinary wooden wagon wheels and were for hauling logs from forests that had wet terrain {{in the summer and}} heavy snows in the winter.

Overpack solicited {{the support of the}} Redding Iron Works Company to aid in supplying his product to the western United States. He needed their aid to help overcome shipping issues, which {{they were a}}ble to do with their proximity to the West Coast timber industry. They became then another builder of Overpack's Michigan <b>logging</b> <b>wheels.</b> He then began manufacturing on a large scale and ultimately made thousands of <b>logging</b> <b>wheels.</b> He sold them worldwide and shipped via railroad to other states and Canada. The U.S. Army Forestry Department even took several to France during World War I. They were discontinued by 1930.|$|E

50|$|Wood {{was born}} on September 22, 1934 on a family farm near Stuart, Virginia as one of six {{children}} (five sons and one daughter), and began building vehicles when he built a wagon with <b>logs</b> for <b>wheels,</b> which is intended to roll downhill. When he was 13, Wood placed a washing machine engine on a go-kart frame, and used various pulleys and chains from salvaged vehicles at his father's shop to propel the vehicle, which was able to reach {{a top speed of}} 25 mph. The go-kart is currently on display in Stuart's Wood Brothers Museum. In high school, Wood learned to build an engine from watching his father, Walter, disassemble the engine from the team's car, and successfully rebuilt it.|$|R

When the Tasmanian Government Railways taken over the Marrawah tramway in 1929, the engine passed into their ownership. [...] "Big Ben" [...] was apparently light on the front wheels and as a result, the front was often prone to rise above the wheels when running front first. On the 6 September 1938 when running with a load of <b>logs</b> the <b>wheels</b> risen up again but when they came down they didn't find the rails resulting in a derailment which caused the driver to die from injuries the next day. After this incident, a load of old rails where tied {{to the front of the}} engine to weigh it down.|$|R

5000|$|Silas C. Overpack (1841-1927) was a blacksmith, wheelwright, and businessman. He owned a shop (around 1868) in {{downtown}} Manistee, Michigan, at 87 Pine Street, called S.C.

5000|$|An early 20th-century lumber camp in Victory Township was {{donated to}} house the museum. The two 100-year-old {{buildings}} were moved from their original location to White Pine Village.

Michigan <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> {{that were used to}} drag logs out of the woods are displayed on the grounds.|$|E
50|$|Overpack's <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> could haul logs {{without the}} need for icy ground. They did not sink into mud in the wet terrain of the {{northern}} woods where ordinary wagon wheels would get mired in the spring thaw. The wheels also enabled a team of horses to pull several logs at a time. The logs were held by a chain that suspended the logs' weight from the wheel axle, creating a stabilizing, low center of gravity.|$|E

5000|$|The Newburgh Raid was a {{successful}} raid by Confederate partisans on Newburgh, Indiana, on July 18, 1862, making it the first town in a northern state to be captured during the American Civil War. Confederate colonel Adam Rankin Johnson led the raid by using a force of only about 35 men he had recruited from nearby Henderson, Kentucky. They confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired by tricking Newburgh's defenders into thinking the town was surrounded by cannons. In reality, the so-called cannons were an assemblage of a stove pipe, a charred <b>log,</b> and wagon <b>wheels,</b> forever giving the Confederate commander the nickname of Adam [...] "Stovepipe" [...] Johnson.|$|R
500|$|By {{the time}} of the Ohio Whig Convention in Columbus on February 22, the theme and enthusiasm had taken full hold. Tens of {{thousands}} of delegates and spectators filled the streets as a mile-long parade featured <b>log</b> cabins on <b>wheels,</b> with the builders drinking hard cider on the roof, and giant wooden canoes with the image of Old Tippecanoe, though General Harrison was not in attendance. Many of those who came to Columbus dressed as pioneers, in buckskins with coonskin cap. Barrels of hard cider were provided on every corner. Serious business was accomplished; the national ticket was endorsed and Congressman Corwin nominated for governor. Thirty thousand people attended; [...] "no political rally like this had ever taken place in America." ...|$|R
50|$|From then on Overpack's big wheels {{were part}} of Michigan logging history. Many {{northern}} states used them, and Michigan alone had at least 65 different lumber companies that had them. Michigan's rough and wet forest terrain made logging strictly a winter industry in the nineteenth century. The loggers used frozen ground to skid the logs from the woods to the railheads of rails or to river banks for further transporting. In the spring they would slide the logs from the banking grounds into the rivers for the log drive to the sawmills. Overpack made logging possible in all four seasons when he began manufacturing Michigan <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> at his Manistee wagon business.|$|E
5000|$|Before the era {{of modern}} diesel or {{gasoline}} powered equipment, the existing machinery was steam powered. Animal or steam-powered skidders {{could be used to}} haul harvested logs to nearby rail roads for shipment to sawmills. Horse driven <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> were a means used for moving logs out of the woods. Another way for transporting logs to sawmills was to float them down a body of water or a specially-constructed log flume. Log rolling, the art of staying on top of a floating log while [...] "rolling" [...] the log by walking, was another skill much in demand among lumberjacks. Spiked boots known as [...] "caulks" [...] or [...] "corks" [...] were used for log rolling and often worn by lumberjacks as their regular footwear.|$|E
5000|$|By 1937, F. L. Chambers and E. G. Boehnke {{arranged}} a property {{trade with the}} federal government—land for a new post office site, {{in exchange for the}} old post office building to house the county's history museum. Pioneer relics were stored {{in the basement of the}} old post office, but other federal agencies needed offices during the war years, so the space was never used as a museum. In 1951, the first Lane County History Museum, described as [...] "a small warehouse museum", 40 x 60 ft, was built at the Lane County Fairgrounds to house the growing collection of pioneer relics. The site was already the location of the oldest building in Lane County, the Lane County Clerk's Building. By 1954, to display big <b>logging</b> <b>wheels,</b> the museum added a shed, 25 x 80 ft and a covered passage 20 x 140 ft for other vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{a number}} of {{historical}} sources, Newburgh was a prominent stop on the Underground Railroad between the mouth of the Little Pigeon River and Lake Michigan. On July 18, 1862, Newburgh was the first town north of the Mason-Dixon line to be captured by the Confederate forces during the American Civil War in what would {{come to be known as}} the Newburgh Raid. Colonel Adam [...] "Stovepipe" [...] Johnson, with a partisan band, crossed the Ohio River and confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired. The Confederates would have been unable to shell the city (as promised) had Newburgh put up a fight. The Confederates' [...] "cannons" [...] were an assemblage of a stove pipe, a charred <b>log,</b> and wagon <b>wheels.</b> The raid convinced the federal government that it was necessary to supply Indiana with a permanent force of regular Union Army soldiers to counter future raids. Many of the structures used in this raid are still standing, including The Exchange Hotel.|$|R
60|$|Devine drove a birch <b>log</b> {{behind the}} <b>wheels</b> {{and then ran}} to the leaders' heads and cracked his whip, while Harding called to the pole-team. For a few moments the {{battering}} hoofs churned up the sloppy trail and the wagon groaned and shook, the horses floundering and slipping without moving it. Then with a harsh creak the high wheels began to turn and they slowly struggled up the hill. Harness rattled, chain and clevis rang, the steam from the toiling animals rose in a thin cloud, and white smears streaked their coats as they strained at the collar. The men were red in face and panting hard, but as they fought the grade they broke into breathless shouts. Harding was sparing of the whip; {{but this was not}} a time to be weakly merciful, when the load might overpower his teams and, running back, drag them over the edge. Nor dare he stop again and subject the animals to the cruel effort of restarting. They must get up somehow before their strength gave out.|$|R
50|$|Caldwell {{came with}} his parents to Litchfield {{township}} in Hillsdale county in 1856 from upper New York state {{by way of the}} Erie Canal. He worked on his father's farm in the summers and attended school during the winters. While his older brothers and his father were Civil War veterans, he was too young to enlist during this time period of 1861 - 1865. When he was eighteen years old {{in the early part of}} 1868 he went to the woods of Tuscola County of the thumb area of Michigan for about two years in his first employment. This was the beginning of his timber career where he learned the industry. In November 1869 Caldwell then went to Missaukee county in northern Michigan. He was gainfully employed there for years as a land agent for George A. Mitchell and the Mitchell Brothers Company for timber development in Michigan and New Mexico. He was one of their key timber-men representatives. He worked with lumberjacks that used <b>logging</b> <b>wheels</b> for hauling timber out of the woods.|$|E
50|$|The {{throwing}} {{is done in}} {{two separate}} rooms, {{depending on the type}} of pot that is being made.Kyaukmyaung pots are thrown on a human operated wheel submerged in the ground. Throwing these very large pots often requires two or three men. One man keeps the wheel in motion by spinning it with his hands, and the other two work on throwing. This is a very laborious process because of the sheer size of these pots. A single pot is thrown with about 40 pounds of clay. Pots are thrown in two pieces and later combined. Clay is distributed to the wheel in a stretched out <b>logs</b> when the <b>wheel</b> is in motion. This varies from the traditionally western style of throwing, where the entirety of the clay being used for the section is placed on the wheel and centered afterward. This centering process is designed so that the height of these pots is dramatically increased. It also helps to reduce air bubbles from interfering with the throwing process. The bottom section of the pot is thrown first.|$|R
5000|$|The 1999 book Hidden in Plain View, by Raymond Dobard, Jr., an art historian, and Jacqueline Tobin, {{a college}} {{instructor}} in Colorado, explores how quilts {{were used to}} communicate information about the Underground Railroad. The idea for the book came from Ozella McDaniel Williams who told Tobin that her family had passed down a story for generations about how patterns like wagon <b>wheels,</b> <b>log</b> cabins, and wrenches were used in quilts to navigate the Underground Railroad. Williams stated that the quilts had ten squares, each with a message about how to successfully escape. It started with a monkey wrench, that meant to gather up necessary supplies and tools, and ended with a star, which meant to head north. The book claims {{that there was a}} quilt code that conveyed messages in counted knots and quilt block shapes, colors and names. In a 2007 Time magazine article, Tobin stated: [...] "It's frustrating to be attacked and not allowed to celebrate this amazing oral story of one family's experience. Whether or not it's completely valid, I have no idea, but it makes sense with the amount of research we did." [...] Dobard said, [...] "I would say there has {{been a great deal of}} misunderstanding about the code. In the book Jackie and I set out to say it was a set of directives. It was a beginning, not an end-all, to stir people to think and share those stories." [...] He called the book [...] "informed conjecture, as opposed to a well-documented book with a [...] "wealth of evidence".|$|R
