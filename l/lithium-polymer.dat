5000|$|The Hubsan X4 is {{a series}} of very small {{lightweight}} remotely-controlled quadcopters (sometimes considered unmanned aerial vehicles or [...] "drones") which utilize four propellers (hence the [...] "X4" [...] designation) powered by a single <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery. Since the marketing of the first model, several upgrades and improvements have taken place, each with a subsequent model number and designation.|$|E
5000|$|The Desire 610 {{comes with}} a 4.7-inch display with screen {{resolution}} of 540 x 960 pixels (234 PPI) or FWVGA 480x854 resolution in USA for the AT&T variant.

[...] It has a 2040mAh non-removable <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery.|$|E
5000|$|Other terms {{used in the}} {{literature}} for this system include hybrid polymer electrolyte (HPE), where [...] "hybrid" [...] denotes {{the combination of the}} polymer matrix, the liquid solvent and the salt. It was a system like this that Bellcore used to develop an early <b>lithium-polymer</b> cell in 1996, which was called [...] "plastic" [...] lithium-ion cell (PLiON), and subsequently commercialised in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The Bluefin-21 is a torpedo-shaped multirole AUV {{capable of}} {{conducting}} oceanic military, scientific and {{search and rescue}} operations. Utilising a modular design powered by interchangeable <b>lithium-polymer</b> batteries, it can operate on the sea floor for up to sixteen hours at a time. In 2014, the Bluefin-21 was deployed to conduct undersea sensor sweeps during the international effort to locate the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.|$|E
50|$|It {{provides}} 20 GB hard-disk {{space and}} can play MP3, WMA, and WMA-DRM. However, audio quality {{was reported to}} be mediocre. It can record from the internal FM radio or from line-in, and has a built-in FM modulator. Playback time using the internal <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery is up to 10 hours, but may be decreased by transmitter use, playback volume and audio files with high bit rates.|$|E
50|$|The silicon nanowire-based {{battery cell}} also {{provides}} opportunity for dimensional flexible energy source, which would also {{leads to the}} development of wearable technological device. Scientist from Rice University showed this possibility by depositing porous copper nanoshells around the silicon nanowire within a polymer matrix. This <b>lithium-polymer</b> silicon nanowire battery (LIOPSIL) has a sufficient operational full cell voltage of 3.4V and is mechanically flexible and scalable.|$|E
50|$|The jYUice is a {{power bank}} from YU Televentures, and has a {{capacity}} of 5000mAh or 10000mAh. The power bank consists of an anodized aluminum shell which houses a <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery. The 5000mAh model has a single 5V/2.1A USB port while the 10000mAh model has a 5V/1A USB port and a 5V/2.4A USB port. It comes with a multi-colored LED light to indicate how much charge the jYUice has.|$|E
50|$|The H107 was {{the first}} model. All {{subsequent}} models are based on this basic design. Like all Hubsan X4s, the H107 operated with four propellers and a <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery. It was very inexpensive compared to the available set of quadcopters, making it appealing to first-time hobbyists and therefore very popular. However, it had no built-in LED lights, no camera, was easily damaged when crashing, and could easily blow away in light winds.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{the first}} {{pioneering}} company in this field, the Electric Aircraft Corporation, began offering engine kits to convert ultralight weight shift trikes to electric power. The 18 hp motor weighs 26 lb and an efficiency of 90% is claimed by designer Randall Fishman. The battery {{consists of a}} <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery pack of 5.6kWh which provides 1.5 hours of flying in the trike application. The company claimed a flight recharge cost of 60 cents in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|The battery was {{custom-designed}} to {{fill the}} available space in the smaller enclosure. It uses a new 39.7 watt-hour <b>lithium-polymer</b> terraced battery cell which is said to provide [...] "all day" [...] battery life. It is said to last up to 9 hours for Internet browsing or 10 hours of iTunes movie playback. The battery was improved in the 2016 refresh, with Apple claiming to provide 10 hours for Internet browsing, and 11 hours for iTunes movie playback.|$|E
50|$|A popular early {{mobile phone}} battery was the nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) type, {{due to its}} {{relatively}} small size and low weight. Lithium ion batteries are also used, as they are lighter {{and do not have}} the voltage depression due to long-term over-charging that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers use <b>lithium-polymer</b> batteries as opposed to the older lithium-ion, the main advantages being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2009 Peghiny {{demonstrated}} {{a new version}} of his Spyder single seat model at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. Designated the e-Spyder, it differs from earlier models in that it is electric-powered. The aircraft replaces the standard Spyder's normally-fitted two-stroke engine with a Yuneec Power Drive 20 [...] electric motor and two 28 lb <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery packs which provide a 40-minute endurance. The aircraft is intended to be developed into a commercially available kit and forecast to be available for under US$25,000.|$|E
5000|$|The YP-F1 is a necklace-like style flash {{digital audio}} player with an LCD screen. It {{was made in}} three storage capacities: the 256 MB F1V, the 512 MB F1X, and the 1 GB F1Z. It connects to a {{computer}} with a USB cable to charge the 10-hour (claimed) <b>lithium-polymer</b> battery and transfer files. It supports the MP3, WMA (and WMA DRM), WAV, ASF, and Ogg formats. It can receive and record FM broadcasts, and supports voice recording. The size is 1.14" [...] x 2.5" [...] x 0.6".|$|E
5000|$|Electravia, {{organized}} as an association called APAME, first flew its [...] "Electra" [...] electric-powered open-cockpit airplane on Sunday, 23 December 2007 at Aspres sur Buech airfield, Hautes Alpes, France. Test pilot Christian Vandamme flew the strut-equipped aircraft for 48 minutes, covering 50 km. The BL1E [...] "Electra" [...] {{is powered by}} an 18-kW (24 hp) disk-brushed electric engine driven by a 47 kg (104 lb) KOKAM <b>Lithium-Polymer</b> battery power pack. The BL1E [...] "Electra is the first registered aircraft in the world powered by an electric motor with batteries.|$|E
