5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E

5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and {{a variation on the}} Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E

Despite recent reinforcements, only around 90,000 Soviet soldiers manned this line–far too few to stem the German advance. Given the <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> available, Zhukov decided to concentrate his forces at four critical points: the 16th Army under Lieutenant General Rokossovsky guarded Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk was defended by 5th Army under Major General Govorov, the 43rd Army of Major General Golubev defended Maloyaroslavets, and the 49th Army under Lieutenant General Zakharkin protected Kaluga. The entire Soviet Western Front—nearly destroyed after its encirclement near Vyazma—was being recreated almost from scratch.|$|E

5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on <b>limited</b> <b>resources.</b> A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Given the <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> of many {{developing}} nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{illustrates that}} agriculture {{continues to be}} the leader in the nation for accidents. The attitudes and behaviors of farmers and farm workers towards farm equipment and its safe use are major concerns. Farm safety education and research are strongly needed to prevent or reduce farm injuries.

The survey method with a mailed questionnaire was used to collect the data. The sample for this study consisted of 297 <b>limited</b> <b>resource</b> farmers in North Carolina. Selected conclusions drawn from the findings were: 1. The risks for <b>limited</b> <b>resource</b> farmers and their workers, associated with the use of tractors, machinery, and farm chemicals are very high. 2. Farmers between the ages of 36 - 50 have higher expected injuries compared to other age groups. 3.

The research suggested that hazards exposed by using tractors without rollover protection structures (ROPS) could result in higher injuries among <b>limited</b> <b>resource</b> farmers and workers. Selected recommendations: 1. Federal and state governments should give incentives to farmers to encourage them to retrofit ROPS on their old tractors. 2. Mandatory training should be required for small scale or <b>limited</b> <b>resource</b> farmers on operation of farm equipment operation and personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization. 3.
