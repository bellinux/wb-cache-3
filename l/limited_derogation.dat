40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the ways in}} which countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) can maximise the patent-related advantages that are available to developing countries and regions by flexibilities offered by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the European Community (EC). Article 31 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) provided only <b>limited</b> <b>derogation</b> to the exclusive rights that a patent holder may have under Article 28 of TRIPs. The entry into force of the agreement in developing countries entailed that important (cheaper) generic medicine manufacturers such as Brazil, China, India and South Africa {{would not be able to}} use TRIPs to supply needed medicines. This problem became known as the ‘Doha Paragraph 6 Problem’ as it was included in the 2001 Doha Declaration under the section of TRIPs and public health. The Declaration called for a solution to the problem by the end of 2002. Although this deadline was not met, an interim solution to the problem was worked out by the TRIPs Council of the WTO. This interim solution provided generous options for countries in need. The decision was integrated into the TRIPs Agreement as a permanent amendment in December 2005. In the EC, Regulation 816 / 2006 was adopted to apply the system which had been crafted at the WTO. So far only one country (Rwanda) has used the system to purchase affordable HIV/AIDS medicines from Canada. SADC is a region that has high levels of prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS. The WTO and EC flexibilities have not been used by SADC countries. One of the advantages of the flexibilities is that benefits are specifically guaranteed to regional trade arrangements like SADC’s. Why has there been use an under-utilisation of the flexibilities? This paper argues that elements such as lack of awareness on the SADC side, the complicated nature of the procedures in the use of the flexibilities, and the actions of international charities explain the limited use of the system in SADC. It advocates for a more proactive involvement of SADC and its member states in the negotiations on the various ways in which access to medical products (especially second line HIV/AIDS medicines) can be eased for SADC’s citizens...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the complex issue of risk classification {{in the field}} of insurance. Prior to accepting risks, insurance companies must first be able to evaluate those risks. Accordingly, they seek to collect the most information possible from, amongst other sources, the insured, so as to gage relative risk and evaluate whether to insure or not, to what degree and at what rate. In due course, the insurer will use this information on conjunction with statistical and actuarial calculations to draw hypotheses on the degree, probability and cost of risk. In selecting relevant risks for analysis, insurers will utilise set variables based on the area of insurance in which they operate. However, said variables are highly susceptible to being discriminatory. Notably, one thinks of sex and age which are contentiously considered by practitioners and scholars whether or not they operate {{in the field of}} insurance. This dissertation will examine exhaustively the normative framework in place in order to determine to what degree, if indeed at all, insurers can legitimately and legally utilize certain classifications such as age and sex in order to select, categorise and fix the price for the various risks offered to them. The question shall arise, to what degree less or all-together non-discriminatory criteria should be favoured over criteria, sometimes considered, prohibited. In order to answer all these questions to better address the issue, we must first examine certain essential notions of insurance. Thus, in the first section, we will describe the relevant logistic practices in insurance industries. We shall focus on the decision process at various levels where potential discriminatory practices may arise. We will see that certain schools of thought on insurance classification are at odds, some times diametrically. We will, incidentally, favour the 'fair discrimination' doctrine over its traditional theoretical rival: 'anti-discrimination'. Our research shows that potentially discriminatory classification occurs at several stages of the ex ante and ex post contractual relationship, stages we will examine one at a time. In the second portion we will cover the general juridical regime of the right to non-discrimination in contracts at the international, national and provincial levels. Special attention will be paid to specific rules which allow some <b>limited</b> <b>derogation</b> to the constitutional rights against discrimination. We shall highlight that the legislative authority granted by the Quebec Charter does have limitations. What's more, certain guidelines recently established by the Supreme Court of Canada regarding application, must take precedence over various classification criteria pertaining to insurance which find their root in article 20. 1 of the Quebec Charter. Ultimately, we will concentrate on what is just, which is to say the legitimacy of discrimination in a field that takes it for granted while seldomely questioning its foundations. We will come to apply a new measure for insurance discrimination. We will test this new measure in two specific fields: life insurance and automobile insurance. Overall, this thesis will allow us to determine how discriminatory classification can, at times, be legally employed (mostly in pre-selection and segmentation) in the above mentioned fields. We will conclude by proposing a new operating model which seeks to limit classification procedures that circumvent rights to privacy and non-discrimination...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} {{the negative effects of}} shift work on safety and health, many countries have enacted regulations on shift work. The European Union, in its directive 2003/88/EC, has established a 48-hour limit on working time (including overtime) per week; a minimum rest period of 11 consecutive hours per 24-hour period; and a minimum uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours of mandated rest per week (which is in addition to the 11 hours of daily rest). The EU directive also limits night work involving [...] "special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain" [...] to an average of eight hours in any 24-hour period. The EU directive allows for <b>limited</b> <b>derogations</b> from the regulation, and special provisions allow longer working hours for transportation and offshore workers, fishing vessel workers, and doctors in training (see also medical resident work hours).|$|R

In order to comply with the EU Drinking Water Directive, the Italian government had to provide treatment facilities to reduce the contamination below allowable <b>limits.</b> Despite a <b>derogation,</b> the government did not do this.

40|$|The Italian noise {{legislation}} {{is based on}} the principle of protection of the population exposed to several type of noise sources. The noise exposure, beyond the direct effects on the auditive apparatus, could cause sleep disturbance, speech intelligibility, psycho physiological effects, that generate important state of annoyance. The real goal of the noise {{legislation is}} to reduce annoyance. Such legislation, however, is not sufficient for particular type of noise sources, like those generated by infrastructure works. In these cases the law gives authorisation notwithstanding the provisions in force, exceeding the limit values, but without creating damage conditions. The local authorities should then manage these derogations by characterizing the parameters {{that could be used to}} take under control the noise, and then to avoid several state of annoyance. The purpose of this study is to take into account the parameters that have been identified and to set up guidelines aimed to establish <b>limit</b> values for <b>derogation</b> for the infrastructure works. The first step will be to distinguish between the different noise produced by different type of infrastructure works. The limit values will then be different for building or street yard and for great infrastructure works such as tunnel or high-speed way construction. The main differences are the plants and the machinery used for the works, but in particular the duration of the work. The limits will then be more rigid for the long time infrastructure works, which are often active also in the night, because of a longer population exposure. These guidelines will be finally discussed with the local authorities in order to manage the noise produced by the temporary infrastructure works and to avoid the worsening of the quality of life...|$|R
