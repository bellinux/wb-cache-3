The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of 40,000 Aruban florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses.

On January 10, 1976, Tydings announced his candidacy to retake the seat, which he argued was taken unfairly in 1970 due to an undisclosed $180,000 gift to the Beall campaign.|$|E

The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, {{which had a}} growing rate at the time because the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased the interest rates for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as {{they were about to}} be auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused of committing crimes during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike other lawyers the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E

25|$|On January 22, Silver {{was arrested}} on federal {{corruption}} charges. The federal inquiry, which followed the state's abruptly disbanded Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption, focused on large payments that Silver received for years from a <b>law</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> specialized in seeking reductions of New York City real-estate taxes. Investigators led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara charged that Silver did not properly disclose the payments from the firm, Goldberg & Iryami, on his annual financial disclosure filings with the state. The firm's major client was the state’s single-largest political donor, while the founding partner Jay Goldberg was Silver's former Assembly counsel, and partner Dara Iryami agreed to testify under immunity.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s the Celtic board {{consisted}} of Chairman Jack McGinn and directors Kevin Kelly, Chris White, Tom Grant and Jimmy Farrell. Neither McGinn nor Farrell were members of the traditional family dynasties at Celtic: Farrell was a partner in the Shaughnessy <b>law</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> had long standing connections with Celtic, and was invited to become a director at the club in 1964; McGinn was responsible for the setting up of the club newspaper The Celtic View in the 1960s and later became the club's commercial manager. He was given a seat on the board and became Chairman in 1986. In May 1990 former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Michael Kelly, and property developer Brian Dempsey were invited to join the Celtic board. Dempsey did not last long however, a dispute about a proposed relocation from Parkhead to Robroyston resulted in him being voted off the board five months later.|$|E

25|$|Doolittle {{has denied}} any wrongdoing. In {{connection}} with the matter, he hired David Barger, a criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor from Ken Starr's office, and Wiley Rein LLP, a <b>law</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> specializes in campaign finance and government ethics. Doolittle has estimated that he received about $50,000 in contributions for his campaigns from clients of Abramoff, mostly Indian tribes. His congressional campaigns from 1999-2004 received $14,000 in personal donations from Abramoff over the period 1999–2004 to Doolittle's congressional campaigns. After Doolittle's Chief of Staff Kevin A. Ring left to work for Abramoff, Ring helped arrange for Abramoff to hire a consulting firm owned by Doolittle's wife. Doolittle used Abramoff's luxury sports box for a political fundraiser and failed to report this {{as part of his}} campaign finances. Doolittle was investigated by a federal probe into his relationship with Abramoff. On April 13, 2007, Doolittle's former aide, Kevin Ring, resigned from his lobby firm. On the same day, the FBI raided Doolittle's Virginia home. On September 4, 2007, the House announced that Doolittle's Chief of Staff Ron Rogers and Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Blankenburg were subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.|$|E
25|$|The case of R. v. Sussex Justices, {{ex parte}} McCarthy (1923) {{provides}} {{an illustration of}} the differences. In that case, the person who acted as clerk to certain magistrates {{was a member of}} a <b>law</b> <b>firm</b> <b>that</b> represented a party with an interest in the outcome of a matter being decided by the magistrates. When the magistrates withdrew to consider the matter, the clerk went with them in case they needed advice on any legal issues. However, the magistrates reached a decision without consulting the clerk. Thus, on the facts of the case, there was no possibility of actual bias whatsoever. Yet the decision in question was set aside because justice had to be seen to be done. Judicial Commissioner Menon highlighted that the underlying principle protected the appearance of justice being done, and reasoned that it would not be relevant under such a principle to consider whether justice was actually done. Nor did he think that Gough could be reconciled with ex parte McCarthy, despite the attempt in Gough attempt to confine the latter case to its own facts. In his view, the two tests were therefore different in substance, in addition to the different perspective that each test adopted. Furthermore, those differences were sometimes material in deciding a case; for example, the choice of the real likelihood test was a deciding factor of the result in Gough.|$|E
