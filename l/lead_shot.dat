5|$|Hunting with <b>lead</b> <b>shot,</b> {{along with}} the use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of <b>lead</b> <b>shot</b> ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where <b>lead</b> <b>shot</b> has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use <b>lead</b> <b>shot,</b> waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. <b>Lead</b> <b>shot</b> has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.|$|E
5|$|The apex nest predators of the American {{black duck}} include American crows, gulls and raccoons, {{especially}} in tree nests. Great horned owls {{are also a}} major predator of adults. Bullfrogs and snapping turtles eat many ducklings. Ducklings often catch diseases caused by protozoan blood parasites transmitted by bites of insects such as blackflies. They are also vulnerable to <b>lead</b> <b>shot</b> poisoning, known as plumbism, due to their bottom-foraging food habits.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing <b>lead</b> <b>shot),</b> DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{critically}} endangered California condor {{has also}} been affected by lead poisoning. As scavengers, condors eat carcasses of game that have been shot but not retrieved, and with them the fragments from lead bullets; this increases their lead levels. Among condors around the Grand Canyon, lead poisoning due to eating <b>lead</b> <b>shot</b> is the most frequently diagnosed cause of death. In an effort to protect this species, in areas designated as the California condor's range the use of projectiles containing lead has been banned to hunt deer, feral pigs, elk, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, ground squirrels, and other non-game wildlife. Also, conservation programs exist which routinely capture condors, check their blood lead levels, and treat cases of poisoning.|$|E
25|$|In the Soviet era {{there was}} a legend about the {{uniqueness}} of the design of the monument, that its axle load distribution was executed by <b>lead</b> <b>shot.</b> But when the monument was subjected to restoration in the 1980s, no trace of any <b>lead</b> <b>shot</b> was found inside it.|$|E

40|$|A Solid State Neutral Particle Analyzer (SSNPA) array {{has been}} {{installed}} on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). The array consists of four chords viewing through a common vacuum flange. The tangency radii of the viewing chords are 60, 90, 100, and 120 cm. They view across the three co-injection neutral beam lines (deuterium, 80 keV (typ.) with tangency radii 48. 7, 59. 2, and 69. 4 cm) on NSTX and detect co-going energetic ions. A silicon photodiode used was calibrated by using a mono-energetic deuteron beam source. Deuterons with energy above 40 keV can be detected with the present setup. The degradation of the performance was also investigated. <b>Lead</b> <b>shots</b> and epoxy are used for neutron shielding to reduce handling any hazardous heavy metal.
