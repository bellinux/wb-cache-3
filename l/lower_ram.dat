50|$|To fit {{potentially}} {{much more}} memory than the 384 kB of free address space would allow, a bank switching scheme was devised, where only selected {{parts of the}} additional memory would be accessible at the same time.

50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints.

The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the <b>lower</b> <b>rams</b> so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be bled off allowing the upper rams to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper rams.

40|$|Area array {{technology}} {{is one of}} the main themes for IC packaging in the past decade. Ball grid array (BGA), chip scale package (CSP) and flip chip (FC) packages utilize solder ball (bumps) for interconnection overwhelmingly. Nowadays, the solder ball shear test has been widely used as a standard qualification test to evaluate the solder ball attachment strength for BGA, CSP and FC packages. In this thesis, experimental observations of failure mechanisms in the solder ball shear test were performed on PBGA packages with 30 -mil eutectic Pb-Sn solder balls at a fixed test condition. Three typical failure modes were identified. During the ball shear test, the solder ball undergoes substantial rigid-body rotation. For Mode I failure (the dominant mode), no crack is observed when the shear force starts to descend. For Mode II failure (the less dominant mode), a crack is initiated at the root of the solder ball at an early stage of the ball shear test. Finite element simulation on the ball shear test shows that Failure Modes I is closely related to the high regions of von Mises stress contours inside the solder. The experimental investigation on effects of shear test conditions on solder ball shear strength for PBGA, CSP and FC packages were performed. A higher shear speed and <b>lower</b> <b>ram</b> height result in a higher solder ball shear strength. The shear strength of Sn-Ag-Cu solder balls is more sensitive to the shear speed than that of eutectic Pb-Sn solder balls. Finite element models were then constructed to simulate the effect of the shear test conditions on the solder ball shear strength for PBGA with 30 -mil eutectic Pb-Sn solder balls. With a scale factor (effective thickness), it is feasible to study a 3 -D problem with a 2 -D finite element model. The results from 2 -D modeling are in agreement with the experimental data. For BGA, CSP and FC, the ideal solder ball shear test conditions are recommended to be the cases with a ram height of 10 to 20 % of the ball height and a shear speed in the range of 50 to 200 μm/s. The solder ball shear strength of UltraCSP 80 remains stable till 4 time reflow. After that, the strength decreases significantly. For UItraCSPs with and without Au, with high temperature storage (HTS) at 150 °C the shear strengths decrease monotonically. With HTS, the electrical resistances of UltraCSPs with and without Au increase monotonically. After 1000 hours, the resistance of UltraCSPs without Au levels off, while the resistance of UltraCSPs with Au continues to increase. In the as-received state, the IMC forming at the interface of the solder and Al/Ni(V) / Cu UBM is in the Cu 6 Sn 5 phase. After the reflow process of Au addition and with high temperature storage, two layers of (Cu,Au,Ni) 6 Sn 5 IMC with different Au and Ni amounts in them form finally. With the increase in HTS time, the IMC phase at the interface grows. After 1000 hours at 15 O°C, the IMC growth rate in CSPs without Au slows down significantly, while the IMC phase in CSPs with Au continues to grow. For CSPs without Au, even after 2000 hours at 15 O°C, solder balls still fail in the solder. For CSPs with 0. 3 wt% Au, brittle failure happens after 1000 hours at 15 O°C, while brittle failure occurs after only 200 hours for CSPs with 0. 5 wt% Au. The changes of the solder ball shear strength and the electrical resistance are related to the microstructural evolution. High temperature storage at 175 °C was conducted on flip chip test dies with Sn-Ag-Cu solder bumps. After storage for only 24 hours at 175 °C, both the solder bump shear strength and electrical resistance drop significantly. But from 100 to 2000 hours, the bump shear strength levels off, while the electrical resistance rises gradually at first and soon levels off as well. In the as-received state, all solder bumps fail in the bulk solder during the shear test. While after 20 hours at 175 °C, brittle failure occurs. With high temperature storage, IMC at the interface transforms from Cu 6 Sn 5 in the as-received state to a complex (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 phase...|$|E

40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to <b>lower</b> the <b>ram</b> head. When the first spark jumps the gap, downward travel of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{calibration}} of a validated risk-adjustment model in very high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) cases and assess whether sites' case mix affects their performance ratings. BackgroundThere are concerns that treating PCI patients with particularly high-risk features such as cardiogenic shock or prior cardiac arrest may adversely impact hospital performance ratings. However, there is little investigation on the validity of these concerns. MethodsWe examined 624, 286 PCI procedures from 1, 168 sites that participated in the CathPCI Registry in 2010. Procedural risk was estimated using the recently published Version 4 National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) PCI risk-adjusted mortality (RAM) model. We calculated observed/expected mortality using several risk classification methods, and simulated hospital performance after combining their highest risk cases over 2 years into a single year. ResultsIn 2010, crude in-hospital PCI mortality was 1. 4 %. The NCDR model was generally well calibrated among high risk, however there was slight overprediction of risk in extreme cases. Hospitals treating the highest overall expected risk PCI patients or those treating the top 20 % of high-risk cases had <b>lower</b> (better) <b>RAM</b> ratings than centers treating lower-risk cases (1. 25 % vs. 1. 51 %). The observed/expected ratio for top-risk quintile versus low-risk quintile was 0. 91 (0. 87 to 0. 96) versus 1. 10 (1. 03 to 1. 17). Combining all the high-risk patients over a 2 -year period into a single year also did not negatively impact the site's RAM ratings.

50|$|Forms of {{read-only}} memory were employed as non-volatile storage for programs in most early stored-program computers, such as ENIAC after 1948. (Until {{then it was}} not a stored-program computer as every program had to be manually wired into the machine, which could take days to weeks.) Read-only memory was simpler to implement since it needed only a mechanism to read stored values, and not to change them in-place, and thus could be implemented with very crude electromechanical devices (see historical examples below). With the advent of integrated circuits in the 1960s, both ROM and its mutable counterpart static RAM were implemented as arrays of transistors in silicon chips; however, a ROM memory cell could be implemented using fewer transistors than an SRAM memory cell, since the latter needs a latch (comprising 5-20 transistors) to retain its contents, while a ROM cell might consist of the absence (logical 0) or presence (logical 1) of one transistor connecting a bit line to a word line. Consequently, ROM could be implemented at a <b>lower</b> cost-per-bit than <b>RAM</b> for many years.|$|R

Only dam lines with 2 or more cows having performance records in the database were used. Bayesian estimates were obtained fitting eight different univariate and multivariate models defined depending on the inclusion or not of the permanent maternal environment (c) and the l effects. Univariate models that included both the c and the l effects had the best fit with data (assessed by computing the logarithm of the conditional predictive ordinate; logCPO) for BrW and ADG while for WW this was the case for the model that only included the c effect. For multivariate models, the best fit with data was obtained for the model that only included the c effect (logCPO= − 245, 899) while the second “better” model was that which only include the l effect value(logCPO=− 241, 108). In general, whatever the estimation model used, estimates of heritability for the direct (h 2) and maternal (m 2) genetic effects and the genetic correlation between them (ram) obtained in the current study for BrW were slightly higher (ram more negative) than the most recent estimates reported in the breed. However, this is not true for WW and ADG when multivariate estimation models include the l effect.

After familiarization, nine trained athletes performed six 30 -s Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) cycle bouts followed by a time-to-exhaustion (Texh) cycle on six separate randomized and counterbalanced occasions. The three time-of-day nonfasting (control, CON) exercise sessions were performed before the Ramadan month, and the three corresponding time-of-day Ramadan fasting (RAM) exercise sessions were performed during the Ramadan month. Note that the 21 : 00 h session during Ramadan month was conducted in the nonfasted state after the breaking of the day’s fast. Total work (TW) completed during the six WAnT bouts was significantly <b>lower</b> during <b>RAM</b> compared to CON for the 08 : 00 and 18 : 00 h (p less than. 017; effect size [d] =. 55 [small] and. 39 [small], respectively) sessions, but not for the 21 : 00 h (p =. 03, d =. 18 [trivial]) session. The Texh cycle duration was significantly shorter during RAM than CON in the 18 : 00 (p less than. 017, d =. 93 [moderate]) session, but not in the 08 : 00 (p =. 03, d =. 57 [small]) and 21 : 00 h (p =. 96, d =. 02 [trivial]) sessions.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to devise co-design rules for data centric embedded applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{alternating}} machine {{having a}} separate input tape with k two-way, read-only heads, {{and a certain}} number of internal configurations, AM(k), is considered as a parallel computing model. For the complexity measure TIME · SPACE · PARALLELISM (TSP), the optimal lower bounds Ω(n 2) and Ω(n 3 / 2) respectively are proved for the recognition of specific languages on AM(1) and AM(k) respectively. For the complexity measure REVERSALS · SPACE · PARALLELISM (RSP), the lower bound Ω(n 1 / 2) is established for the recognition of a specific language on AM(k). This result implies a polynomial lower bound on PARALLEL TIME · HARDWARE of parallel <b>RAM's.</b> <b>Lower</b> bounds on the complexity measures TIME · SPACE and REVERSALS · SPACE of nondeterministic machines are direct consequences of the result introduced above. All lower bounds obtained are substantially improved in the case that SPACE⩾ nɛ for 0 <ɛ< 1. Several strongest lower bounds for two-way and one-way alternating (deterministic, nondeterministic) multihead finite automata are obtained as direct consequences of these results. The hierarchies for the complexity measures TSP, RSP, TS and RS can be immediately achieved too...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{design for a}} {{high-performance}} low-cost solid-state disk (SSD). Ignoring garbage-collection costs, our SSD performs only 1 + ε physical accesses to NAND flash pages for every request of a page-size block by the host, for some small ε. This is true for all access patterns, including random writes, which are usually slow on low-cost SSDs. Garbage collection in all SSDs is determined primarily by how full the SSD is, and its cost is similar in most SSDs. The unique feature in our design is that it achieves high performance even with when the SSD contains {{only a small amount}} of RAM. In most SSD designs, this would imply low performance; in ours, it does not. A small <b>RAM</b> <b>lowers</b> the cost of an SSD with a given flash array. Our design achieves high performance with a small RAM using two innovative ideas. One is the use of a clever mapping data structure. The second is a host-assisted hinting mechanism that uses RAM on the host to compensate for the small amount of RAM within the SSD. This mechanism is implemented as an enhanced SCSI driver (kernel module). Our prototyping methodology is also a significant contribution. We simulate the SSD in software, using files to represent the flash array, but the resulting prototype is a working SCSI device that file systems can be mounted on.

40|$|Early life {{nutrition}} is {{implicated in}} the risk of metabolic diseases (e. g. type 2 diabetes) in adulthood. Low birth-weight was associated with defects in the skeletal muscle insulin-signalling pathway of young adult men (1), and insulin resistance was associated with changes in myofibre composition (2). In sheep, maternal undernutrition reduced fetal skeletal muscle myofibre density and composition (3). Recently we reported that lower body condition score (BCS) led to increased fasting glycaemia, mild glucose intolerance and impaired initial insulin secretory response in adult offspring (4). We hypothesised that this would worsen with age, and that altered skeletal muscle structure and insulin signalling pathways are involved. Ewes were established, by dietary manipulation, at a BCS of 2 (lower (L) n = 10) or > 3 (higher (H) n = 14) before and during pregnancy (4). In male offspring at 4. 04 ± 0. 02 years plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured during a glucose tolerance test (0. 5 g/kg body weight i. v.) and rams were killed by an overdose of barbiturate (i. v. 145 mg/kg). We analysed a) insulin-signalling proteins by Western blotting in abdominal fat and vastus muscle (m.); b) glucose uptake in isolated strips of vastus and soleus m. (5); c) myofibre density and cross-sectional area (CSA) by immunostaining with anti-fast skeletal myosin (3). Data are mean±SE and were analysed by Student’s t test. Glucose tolerance was similar between groups. Basal glucose uptake was similar in L and H group soleus and vastus m. isolated strips. However insulin-stimulated uptake tended to be reduced in the soleus m. only of L rams (H 1. 01 ± 0. 06; L 0. 84 ± 0. 07 pmol. min. mg, p< 0. 1). In vastus, but not soleus, m. total myofibre density (H 343 ± 15; L 294 ± 14 fibres/mm 2, p< 0. 05) and fast myofibre density (H 226 ± 10; L 194 ± 10 fibres/mm 2, p< 0. 05) was <b>lower</b> in L <b>rams.</b> Slow myofibre density tended to be <b>lower</b> in L <b>rams</b> (H 117 ± 7; L 100 ± 6 fibres/mm 2, p< 0. 1). Myofibre CSA was unaltered. Protein levels of (i) Akt 1 were lower in the vastus m. (L= 83 ± 7 % of H, p< 0. 05), and tended to be lower in abdominal fat (L= 71 ± 7 % of H, p< 0. 1), of L rams; (ii) GLUT- 4 were increased (L= 157 ± 6 % of H, p< 0. 001), and (iii) IGF-IR tended to be reduced (L= 78 ± 12 % of H, p< 0. 1), in the vastus m. of L rams. Reduced signalling through Akt 1 may therefore mediate the decreased vastus m. myofibre density in L rams resulting in reduced glucose tolerance of the young adult offspring (4). However in mature adulthood, glucose tolerance and glucose uptake into vastus m. was not altered by maternal BCS, and thus the impact of reduced myofibre density may be offset in part by increased GLUT- 4. Such adaptations may lead to complications in metabolic control in an overabundant postnatal nutrient environment...|$|R
