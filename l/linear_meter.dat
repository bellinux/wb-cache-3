40|$|Argentina has {{experienced}} {{changes in its}} agricultural production, moving from traditional practices which greatly disturbed soils towards systems that reduce soilworking. Direct seeding {{is a good example}} of the latter. Seeding machines have improved significantly in recent years, incorporating new technical and functional features. Two seeding systems are used in soybean cultivation: the traditional method which relies on planters equipped and drills (which plant in rows). The second option allows the use of a single seeding machine for wheat-soybean rotation and is the object of growing market interest. The aim of this study was to compare two direct seeding machines representative of these systems. The following variables were recorded: a) the «treatment » received by the seed (as determined by seed viability), b) the relationship between plants grown and seeds planted per row, c) the uniformity of plant distribution per <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> of furrow, and d) yield per <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> of furrow plus yield as kg ha- 1 at harvest.

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of paclobutrazol, combined with branch tip pruning, on the flowering induction and quality of 'Ubá' mango tree fruits. Treatments were distributed in a 5 x 2 + 1 factorial arrangement, consisting of five paclobutrazol doses (0 g, 0. 50 g, 1. 00 g, 1. 50 g and 2. 0 g per <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> of canopy), with and without branch tip pruning, in a randomized blocks design, with four replicates. The flowering percentage, number of panicles per branch, total flowers per panicle, male/hermaphrodite flowers ratio, number of fruits per branch and fruit quality were evaluated. Plants treated with tip pruning showed a higher flowering percentage. There was an increase in the flowering percentage in response to the paclobutrazol dose, reaching a maximum level at the dose of 1. 62 g per <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> of canopy. Plants submitted to branch tip pruning had a higher number of panicles per branch. There was an increase in the male/hermaphrodite flowers ratio with increasing paclobutrazol doses. Branch tip pruning increased the number of fruits per branch. There were no differences in fruit quality in response to the paclobutrazol application. It was concluded that the paclobutrazol application at the dose of 1. 62 g per <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> of canopy, combined with branch tip pruning, increases the flowering of the 'Ubá' mango tree and does not change the fruit quality...|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} commercial sugar cane fields cropped with the variety SP 70 - 1143, {{with the objective of}} evaluating a single row microplot design to determine plant recovery of 15 N fertilizer nitrogen. One of them used 15 N-aqua ammonia and 15 N-urea applied to two <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> microplots of a ratoon crop (four replicates). The second used one <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> microplots (three replicates) which received 15 N-aqua ammonia only. The fertilizers were applied on 15 cm deep furrows, located 25 cm {{from both sides of the}} cane row. One <b>linear</b> <b>meter</b> of ratoon cane, inside and outside of the microplot, and on the same and adjacent rows were harvested twelve months after fertilization. The results indicate the feasibility of using single row segments of ratoon cane with 15 N-fertilizer. The main advantage of this microplot design, when compared to the classical 3 contiguous row segments, is that only one third of the labeled fertilizer is needed. In a single row, in order to separate the nitrogen taken up by plants from the fertilizer applied to the row (Nr dff r), from that applied to adjacent rows (Nr dff r+ 1, and Nr dff r- 1), the following should be considered: (a) a border segment of 0. 5 to 1. 0 m inside the plot, so that Ndff results from plants harvested in the center of the microplot represent the actual value of fertilizer nitrogen taken up from that applied to the same row, and (b) harvest of plants from adjacent rows at equivalent positions to those sampled inside the microplot, to quantify the 15 N-fertilizer uptake by outside plants (Nr+ 1 dff r and Nr- 1 dff r), which is assumed to be the same as non labeled fertilizer applied to adjacent rows (Nr dff r+l and Nr dff r- 1) taken up by inside plants. The Ndff total values should be calculated by the equation: Ndff total = Nr dff r + Nr+ 1 dff r + Nr- 1 dff r...|$|E

The British Honduras Company emerged as the predominant landowner of the Crown colony. The firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a London merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company. The firm expanded, often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land. In 1875, the firm became the Belize Estate and Produce Company, a London-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony.
