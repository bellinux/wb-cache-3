5|$|Linezolid is a {{completely}} synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid {{have been reported in}} the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs <b>low-temperature</b> conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis.

5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a <b>low-temperature</b> separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and <b>low-temperature</b> objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
5|$|Tungsten {{exists in}} two major {{crystalline}} forms: α and β. The former has a {{body-centered cubic structure}} and is the more stable form. The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the β form exhibits a columnar habit. The α phase has {{one third of the}} electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the β phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1–4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in <b>low-temperature</b> superconducting circuits.|$|E

However, when heated above 400 °C this structure converts irreversibly to the more complicated 7×7 reconstruction. In addition, a disordered 1×1 structure is regained at temperatures above 850 °C, which can be converted back to the 7×7 reconstruction by slow cooling.|$|R

For granular CoAg films prepared by Co implantation into thermally evaporated Ag films, giant magnetoresistance effects were observed as expected. However. the MR results exhibit an anomalous temperature variation of the coercive field which shows a maximum at around 240 K and decreases with decreasing temperature from 240 to 20 K. For granular thin layers formed by Fe implantation into Si, a large positive MR effect (larger than 700 % for one sample at 30 K) at <b>low-temperatures</b> was observed. For thin layers formed by Ti implantation into Si at appropriate implant conditions, an even more unexpected positive MR effect was observed. The MR effect virtually vanishes at <b>low-temperatures</b> but exhibits positive MR values {{in the order of}} a few percent at temperatures higher than about 240 K. The magnetic field dependence and temperature variation of these MR properties, and their relation with the processing conditions were studied and discussed in conjunction with results of Rutherford backscattering spectromotry (RBS) and other characterization techniques.
