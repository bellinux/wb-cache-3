50|$|In 1884, Cullen {{joined the}} company of J & F Adam as a writer to the signet, a {{specialist}} form of solicitor. He switched to the other branch of the legal profession, and was admitted as an advocate in 1891. He built his reputation specialising in the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>conveyancing,</b> land and inheritance, and took silk in 1905.|$|E
50|$|He {{studied at}} Paisley grammar {{school and at}} the University of Glasgow. In 1835 he was {{admitted}} {{a member of the}} Society of Writers to the Signet, and in 1856 was appointed professor of conveyancing in the University of Edinburgh. In this chair he distinguished himself by the thoroughness and clearness of his expositions of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>conveyancing,</b> and by the mastery which he showed over some of the more difficult departments, ignorance of which had been a fruitful source of litigation. In 1860 he is living at 11 Royal Circus in Edinburgh's Second New Town, close to Stockbridge.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} situations where a claim is extinguished by operation <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> If two persons are jointly but not severally liable {{for a simple}} contract debt, a judgment at common law obtained against {{only one of the}} debtors works as an extinguishment of the claim on the other debtor as a matter <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> A <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> mortgaged land by the mortgagor to the mortgagee extinguishes the mortgage. However taking a promissory note for the amount due on the mortgage does not deprive the mortgage holder of a right to a lien, but merely suspends its enforcement until the note is payable.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} until now no major and {{comprehensive}} study of the phenomenon of legal symbolism in ancient Mesopotamian law. The available studies have been unsystematic and lack clear and defined methodology {{in the study of}} legal symbolism. ^ The present study is a preliminary step toward a {{comprehensive study of}} legal symbolism in Mesopotamian law. It offers a model of analysis of symbolic acts which includes definitions and criteria for isolating and identifying symbolic acts on three levels: Morphology (the form of the symbolic act), Semantics (the legal meaning of the symbolic act), and Etymology (the symbolic meaning of the symbolic act). This model of analysis has been applied to a large sample of Mesopotamian symbolic acts from four legal categories: <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Person, <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Obligation, <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conveyance,</b> and <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Procedure. ^ Following this model of analysis it has been possible to identify symbolic acts as such and to delineate them from other written modes of expression such as technical expressions, legal figures of speech, and remarks alluding to technical acts. ^ The sample of symbolic acts analyzed in this study exhibits some general patterns pertaining to the phenomenon of legal symbolism in general, such as the type of relation between the symbol and symbolized, the source of the constitutive legal power of symbolic acts, the relative importance of symbolic acts and written documents, and the symbolic conceptualization of legal relationship by the Mesopotamians. These general patterns have been presented in a summary fashion in the final chapter of the study together with some suggestions for future research. ...|$|R
