40|$|Abstract: IPOs on the EuroNMs {{have shown}} very high underpricing. The {{majority}} of these IPOs possess specific characteristics such as <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements,</b> venture-capital financing, ownership by the underwriter and over-allotment options. We study how these characteristics influence the underpricing of firms listed on the two largest EuroNM stock exchanges, the Neuer Markt of Germany and the Nouveau Marché of France. We find that the high underpricing in these two markets - contrary to the evidence on the US - is not driven by insiders' selling behaviour. However, the large underpricing {{is caused by the}} high degree of riskiness of the issuing firms and by the partial adjustment phenomenon of offer prices to compensate institutional investors for the truthful revelation of their demand for the shares. In contrast, venture-capital involvement does not affect underpricing. For France, <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements</b> act as substitutes to underpricing, but not so for Germany. We also explore the reasons for the large difference in underpricing between the German and the French IPOs: German firms are more underpriced because they are more risky, have larger price revisions, have less stringent VC lock-up contracts and mostly go public during the hot issue period of 1999 - 2000 when the general level of underpricing in all IPO markets is substantially higher.

40|$|A <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreement</b> {{ensures that}} major {{shareholders}} retain significant economic {{interest in the}} companies following the IPOs. Rationally, these insiders will not adhere to the <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreement</b> unless the benefits of doing so can more than offset the costs. Therefore, in an environment characterized by high information asymmetry, a <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreement</b> can serve as an effective mechanism to signal the risk or quality of firms. This article examines whether the lock-up ratio and lock-up period affect the initial returns, using a sample of 384 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia between 2000 and 2012. The results of the cross-sectional multiple regression show that the lock-up period is significantly positive in explaining IPO initial returns, but the lock-up ratio is not. The findings provide new insights for testing the signaling content of lock-up provisions, particularly in a setting characterized by high information asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} stock price impact of expirations of lock-up {{provisions}} that prevent insiders from selling their shares after the Initial Public Offering (IPO). We examine 172 lock-up expirations of 142 IPOs floated on Germany’s Neuer Markt. We detect significant negative abnormal returns and a 25 % increase in trading volume surrounding lock-up expiration. The negative abnormal returns are larger for firms with high volatility; superior performance after the IPO, low free float, and venture capital financed firms. The negative price reaction is significantly stronger for the expiration of voluntary <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements</b> than for mandatory prohibitions of disposal...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{examined}} 174 <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements</b> in 142 unique firms. A lock-up {{refers to the}} prespecified time, usually 180 days, following an IPO, where pre-IPO shareholders enter into {{an agreement with the}} underwriter not to sell, or contract to sell any of their shares. We find the Oslo Stock Exchange to be efficient, as there are no significant price reactions around the lock-up expiry, and therefore we find support for the efficient market hypothesis. We also found a permanent increase in trading volume of 85 percent. Further, we found some support for the commitment hypothesis as a potential explanation for the existence of lock-ups. On the other hand, we found no support for the signaling and additional underwriter compensation hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to assess the {{determinants}} of PE and VC investors ’ decision to continue holding shares in the post-IPO period. We distinguish between compulsory ownership which arise {{as a result of}} the lockup commitments and voluntary holdings which occur when there is no lockup or ownership in the post-lockup expiry dates. We find support that voluntary ownership is driven by signalling and commitment hypotheses. PE/VC investors ’ compulsory holdings are driven only by the signalling hypothesis in the US, while in the UK, the compulsory ownership is consistent the commitment hypotheses. We find significant differences across US and UK PE/VC firms in terms of their investment, divestment dynamics, ownership retention three years post-flotation, and the terms of <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements.</b> We also report statistically significant relationships between PE/VC fund’s ownership and fund’s characteristics such as age, location and bank affiliation...|$|E

After Rhythm went public, shares skyrocketed and Enron found itself with $300 million worth of Rhythm stock in May 1999.

Owing to Enron's mark-to-market policy, Skilling's worries about Rhythm's volatility led to LJM1 carrying forth a convoluted transaction.|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we examine the}} {{determinants}} of the long-run stock price performance of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on Europe's new stock markets. We report that the average company that went public on these markets {{has been a very}} poor long-term investment. We find that the stock price performance during a three-year window is inversely related to first-day returns. We also find that the long-term underperformance of IPO firms begins after the <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreement</b> has expired and insiders start trading in the firm's shares. These findings are consistent with the divergence of opinion hypothesis of Miller (1977). Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Ja, der Ablauf der Lock-up-Frist ist ein kursrelevantes Ereignis. Wir untersuchen Kursreaktionen auf das Ende der Lock-up-Frist bei 142 Unternehmen des Neuen Marktes. Da der Ablauf der Sperrfrist bereits zum Zeitpunkt des Börsengangs bekannt ist, erwarten wir bei einem (semi-) informationseffizienten Kapitalmarkt durchschnittlich keine Kursreaktion. Im Rahmen einer Ereignisstudie zeigen wir aber, dass sich am Ende der Sperrfrist signifikant {{negative}} Überrenditen ergeben. Durch eine differenzierte Analyse stellen wir fest, dass firmenspezifische Faktoren (Volatilität, Performance, Free Float) die Kursreaktionen am Ende der Lock-up-Periode beeinflussen. Die Befunde unserer Untersuchung belegen die Notwendigkeit klarer Regeln für mehr Transparenz nach dem Börsengang. Bedeutsam sind die vorliegenden Ergebnisse vor allem vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen Diskussion um eine Erweiterung der insiderrechtlichen Meldepflichen im Rahmen des 4. Finanzmarktförderungsgesetzes.

We examine 172 <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements</b> of 142 IPOs floated on Germany’s New Market.

However, using an event-study methodology we detect statistically significant negative abnormal returns and a twenty-five percent increase in trading volume surrounding lock-up expiration. The negative abnormal returns are larger for firms with high volatility, superior performance after the IPO, and low free float. The results of our study raise important regulatory issues with respect to disclosure rules of firms going public. We argue that insiders should be legally required to disclose their sell transactions in order to protect new and less informed shareholders.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine initial and long-run returns of Japanese IPOs in {{particular}} venture capital (VC) -backed and non-VC-backed. The main research focus is on the performance of VC-backed companies. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a comprehensive long-run performance analysis. As such, it provides evidence using two performance methods: cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and buy-and-hold return (BHARs). This paper uses updated data from 1998 through 2001 and presents a deeper understanding for the long-run returns of Japanese IPOs. Findings – The findings show that there is no statistically significant difference in the initial returns of VC-backed and non-VC-backed companies. The evidence is inconsistent with the VC certification hypothesis that venture capitalists certify the true value of the firm and therefore reduce underpricing. Further, Japanese IPOs underperform in the long-run. The fads hypothesis is applicable to explain the poor long-run performance. The results suggest that although VC-backed companies have high initial returns, they perform significantly worse over a three-year time horizon than non-VC-backed companies. Research limitations/implications – An examination of the <b>lock-up</b> <b>agreements</b> is necessary to understand negative returns. The results of this paper provide a good starting point for such a study. Practical implications – This paper highlights the stock returns of VC-backed and non-VC-backed companies. It is hoped that investors and academics will benefit from the outcome of the current paper. Originality/value – To date, there is no comprehensive study on the Japanese IPO market applying both CAR and BHAR long-run measurements. This paper applies both measurements. Further, this is the first study of the long-run performance of Japanese firms going public in Mothers and in Hercules stock markets.
