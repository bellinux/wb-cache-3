5000|$|Many {{organizations}} give {{tests to}} potential employees {{during the interview}} process to determine their job knowledge, overall intelligence, or honesty, and use these to predict how the employee will perform if hired. Research has touched on how maximum performance can be predicted by these tests. For example, one tool is the integrity test, which is a test that attempts to assess whether potential employees will engage in deviant behavior on the job. [...] Examples of such behavior can range from gossiping about a co-worker to stealing money from the organization. Researchers have <b>linked</b> <b>integrity</b> testing to maximum performance because they hypothesize that integrity levels will determine differences in how individuals perform their job, differences which can affect maximum performance in particular. [...] Results obtained by Ones & Viswesvaran supported the use of integrity testing in predicting maximum performance, but also mentioned that job knowledge tests predicted maximum performance as well. [...] Interestingly, integrity tests {{are related to the}} personality factor of conscientiousness, which, as mentioned previously, has not been shown to be related to maximum performance.|$|R

5000|$|The power {{reduction}} is accomplished {{in a few}} ways. In 100 Mbit/s, 1 gigabit and 10 Gbit/s speed data links, energy is used to keep the physical layer transmitters on all the time. If they could be put into [...] "sleep" [...] mode when no data is being sent, that energy could be saved. When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer PHY. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain <b>link</b> signaling <b>integrity.</b> When there is data to transmit, a normal IDLE signal is sent for a predetermined period of time. The data link {{is considered to be}} always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the transmit path is in sleep mode.|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} and usability {{of data on}} the Semantic Web {{is ultimately}} reliant {{on the ability of}} clients to retrieve Resource Description Framework (RDF) data from the Web. When RDF data is unavailable clients reliant on that data may either fail to function entirely or behave incorrectly. As a result {{there is a need to}} investigate and develop techniques that aim to ensure that some data is still retrievable, even in the event that the primary source of the data is unavailable. Since this problem is essentially the classic <b>link</b> <b>integrity</b> problem from hypermedia and the Web we look at the range of techniques that have been suggested by past research and attempt to adapt these to the Semantic Web. Having studied past research we identified two potentially promising strategies for solving the problem: 1) Replication and Preservation; and 2) Recovery. Using techniques developed to implement these strategies for hypermedia and the Web as a starting point we designed our own implementations which adapted these appropriately for the Semantic Web. We describe the design, implementation and evaluation of our adaptations before going on to discuss the implications of the usage of such techniques. In this research we show that such approaches can be used to successfully apply <b>link</b> <b>integrity</b> to the Semantic Web for a variety of datasets on the Semantic Web but that further research is needed before such solutions can be widely deployed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} All About That (AAT) {{an experimental}} prototype system for preserving linked data integrity on the Semantic Web. <b>Link</b> <b>integrity</b> {{is an open}} problem on the traditional web that is largely ignored by many since the power of search engines have made locating missing pages or alternate sources of information trivial. On the linked data web search technology is insufficiently mature to perform the same function {{with the level of}} effectiveness possible on the hypermedia web. As {{the very nature of the}} Semantic Web is interlinked data it is more important than ever that <b>link</b> <b>integrity</b> be preserved if we are to reliably reason across data and build useful applications. To this end a replication and versioning approach based on ideas from the work of Veiga & Ferreira [1, 2] is adopted and applied to the Semantic Web to create an experimental prototype. The prototype permits a user to monitor any number of URIs that they are interested in with the software able to produce versions of how the RDF at that URI appeared on a particular date and detail how the RDF has changed over time. 1.

40|$|National audienceThis chapter {{focuses on}} {{referential}} <b>link</b> <b>integrity</b> problems.

The main objective of this chapter is to provide a generic relationship validation mechanism to remedy this shortcoming.
