On his first, he advanced to within {{three feet of}} Bradbury before being forced back by intense machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire. His second try was similarly turned back and {{as the rest of}} his patrol provided covering fire, Monti advanced a third time but was struck by an RPG. Some news reports indicated that the explosion blew off both of his legs, but this is not supported by family accounts or military records. Monti attempted to crawl back towards cover. He is reported by comrades to have made his peace with God and asked Sgt. Cunningham to tell his parents he <b>loved</b> <b>them.</b> Monti died moments later. At about the same time, the artillery and air support for which he had called began hitting the enemy position, killing 22 of the attackers and dispersing the rest.|$|E

Eliot for Faber and Faber, and the same firm remained the British publisher of all the books he published thereafter. In 1930 he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys' schools: two years at the Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh, Scotland, then three years at the Downs School in the Malvern Hills, {{where he was a}} much-loved teacher. At the Downs, in June 1933, he experienced what he later described as a [...] "Vision of Agape", while sitting with three fellow-teachers at the school, when he suddenly found that he <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> for themselves, that their existence had infinite value for him; this experience, he said, later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940.|$|E

500|$|While Auerbach was {{not known}} for his {{tactical}} bandwidth, famously restricting his teams to just seven plays, he was well known for his psychological warfare, often provoking opposing players and officials with unabashed trash talk. For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history. Age did nothing to diminish his fire; in 1983, after star Larry Bird was ejected from a preseason game against Philadelphia at the Garden along with the Sixers' role player Marc Iavaroni, Auerbach stormed onto the court and after taking the officials to task, screamed nose-to-nose with the 6'10" [...] 260-pound Moses Malone. Concerning his own team, Auerbach was softer. Earl Lloyd, the first black player {{to play in the}} NBA, said: [...] "Red Auerbach convinced his players that he <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> [...] so all they wanted to do was please him." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} Mr. Hooper episode, [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] was studied {{extensively}} for comprehension and attention. After it was filmed, it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers. The results found several unintended negative effects. As The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "it bombed". Despite Gordon's reassuring the Muppets Elmo, Big Bird, and Telly, children {{believed that their}} parents' arguments would lead to their divorce. They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice's parents <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> despite the divorce, were unclear where the characters' parents lived (especially their father, who had never appeared on the show before). Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again. According to Singer, [...] "The kids came away with negative messages... The kids misunderstood arguments. They said arguments did mean divorce. Some thought Snuffy's parents were moving away even though we said just the opposite. A number said the parents {{would no longer be}} in love with them".|$|E
500|$|Simon Leng {{identifies}} a thematic {{link between}} it and other songs in the Harrison canon, notably [...] "See Yourself", from Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976). Leng rates [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] "one of his most successful" [...] compositions, through its acknowledgment that human relationships are [...] "the {{other side of the}} coin" [...] from the spiritual search represented in [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Lord". Ian Inglis writes that [...] "Its rolling melody and warm vocals give it the texture of a love song, which, of course, it is: a love song to the Beatles." [...] In his book subtitled The Essential Songs of the Beatles' Solo Careers, Andrew Grant Jackson concludes of [...] "Run of the Mill": [...] "Such personal musings would be irrelevant to anyone but the biggest Beatle fans if Harrison hadn't so artfully written the words to be open-ended and applicable to anyone … A touching work of maturity by a little brother who saw more clearly than the others, realizing that he <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> but {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

500|$|OK Computer has {{appeared}} frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Alternative Press, Spin, Pitchfork, Time, Metro Weekly and Slant placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, {{the album was}} ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Retrospective reviews from BBC Music, The A.V. Club and Slant have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying [...] "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> for trying too hard {{at a time when}} nobody else was even bothering." [...] According to Acclaimed Music, a site which uses statistics to numerically represent reception among critics, OK Computer is the 10th most celebrated album of all time. It is also considered the best album of all time by Rateyourmusic.com. In 2015, the United States National Recording Preservation Board selected the album for preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, which designates it as a sound recording that has had significant cultural, historical, or aesthetic impact in American life.|$|E
500|$|Albert {{continued}} to devote {{himself to the}} education of his family and the management of the royal household. His children's governess, Lady Lyttelton, thought him unusually kind and patient, and described him joining in family games with enthusiasm. He felt keenly the departure of his eldest daughter for Prussia when she married her fiancé at the beginning of 1858, and was disappointed that his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, did not respond well to the intense educational programme that Albert had designed for him. At the age of seven, the Prince of Wales was expected to take six hours of instruction, including an hour of German and an hour of French every day. When the Prince of Wales failed at his lessons, Albert caned him. Corporal punishment was common at the time, and was not thought unduly harsh. Albert's biographer Roger Fulford wrote that the relationships between the family members were [...] "friendly, affectionate and normal... there is no evidence either in the Royal Archives or in the printed authorities to justify the belief that the relations between the Prince and his eldest son were other than deeply affectionate." [...] Philip Magnus wrote in his biography of Albert's eldest son that Albert [...] "tried to treat his children as equals; {{and they were able to}} penetrate his stiffness and reserve because they realised instinctively not only that he <b>loved</b> <b>them</b> but that he enjoyed and needed their company." ...|$|E
