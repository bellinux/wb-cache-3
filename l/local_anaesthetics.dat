40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{social and economic}} pressure to improve the welfare of animals in our care. In the present study plasma cortisol concentrations were measured to assess the pain-induced distress caused by ring castration plus tailing in lambs and dehorning in calves {{and the extent to}} which the distress caused by these procedures can be reduced by using different alleviation strategies. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> injected into the neck of the scrotum just before ring application significantly reduced the cortisol response to ring castration plus tailing in lambs, but <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> injected into the testes just after ring application only marginally reduced this response. A castration clamp was applied across the full width of the scrotum of lambs for 6 or 10 seconds after ring castration plus tailing to disable the innervation from the scrotal area. The application of the castration clamp for 6 seconds after placement of the ring did not reduce the cortisol response to ring castration plus tailing, whereas application for 10 seconds slightly, but significantly, reduced the peak cortisol concentration. Healing of the castration wound was not complicated by the application of the castration clamp after ring castration plus tailing. Therefore injecting <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> into the neck of the scrotum just before ring castration plus tailing significantly alleviates the pain-induced distress associated with ring castration plus tailing, but applying the castration clamp in combination with ring castration plus tailing has little benefit. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> given prior to dehorning virtually abolishes the cortisol response to dehorning for the duration of action of the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic,</b> but once the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wears off cortisol concentrations increase resulting in a delayed cortisol response equivalent to the overall cortisol response to dehorning when <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> is not used. This delayed cortisol response is thought to be stimulated by inflammation-related pain. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketoprofen and phenylbutazone and an endogenous cortisol surge stimulated by iniecting ACTH were used to assess whether this delayed cortisol response is associated with inflammation-related pain. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> (5 hour duration of action) plus ketoprofen given prior to scoop dehorning marginally reduced the delayed cortisol response observed once the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wore off, but giving <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> and phenylbutazone prior to dehorning had no significant effect on this delayed cortisol response. The antinociceptive action and a greater anti-inflammatory potency of ketoprofen compared to phenylbutazone may explain why ketoprofen was more effective than phenylbutazone in reducing this delayed cortisol response. ACTH plus <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> given prior to dehorning only marginally reduced the delayed cortisol response observed once the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wore off, suggesting that the delayed cortisol response seen when the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wears off is not due primarily to inflammation-related pain Giving <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> prior to dehorning and cauterising the amputation wounds prevented the delayed cortisol response after the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> wore off and significantly reduced the overall cortisol response to dehorning. Thus, in the present study long acting <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> (5 hour duration of action) in combination with NSAIDs had minimal alleviating effects on the pain-induced distress caused by dehorning compared to <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> alone, but <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> and cautery provided effective pain-relief...|$|R
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E

2500|$|Definitions of pain vary, {{but most}} involve {{the ability of}} the nervous system to detect and reflexively react to harmful stimuli by {{avoiding}} it, and the ability to subjectively experience suffering. Suffering cannot be directly measured in other animals. Responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself. To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain, argument by analogy is sometimes used. [...] Another approach is to construct a list of criteria and assess whether the animal fulfills these. Crustaceans fulfill several criteria proposed as indicating that non-human animals may experience pain. [...] These fulfilled criteria include a suitable nervous system and sensory receptors, opioid receptors and reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and <b>local</b> <b>anaesthetics,</b> physiological changes to noxious stimuli, displaying protective motor reactions, exhibiting avoidance learning and making trade-offs between noxious stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements. In vertebrates, endogenous opioids are neurochemicals that moderate pain by interacting with opioid receptors. Opioid peptides and opioid receptors occur naturally in crustaceans, and although it was concluded in 2005 [...] "at present no certain conclusion can be drawn", more recent considerations suggest their presence along with related physiological and behavioural responses as indicating that crustaceans may experience pain. [...] Opioids may moderate pain in crustaceans in a similar way to that in vertebrates. If crustaceans feel pain, there are ethical and animal welfare implications including the consequences of exposure to pollutants, and practices involving commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, food preparation and for crustaceans used in scientific research.|$|E
