Robinson was invited to donate memorabilia to the NASCAR Hall of Fame but did not send anything because of her commitment to audition for The Amazing Race 16. She was involved with the planning and decorating for Kelley Earnhardt Miller's marriage in 2011. In March 2014, Robinson was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, which she was told had also spread to her lymph nodes. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy which caused 18 lymph nodes and a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast to be removed. Robinson was cared for by her mother-in-law for seven months. Her friends ran her businesses on her behalf, and Earnhardt Miller along with Dale Earnhardt Jr., ran fundraising events to help Robinson pay her medical bills. She later entered remission, and completed her final radiation treatment in September 2015.|$|E
25|$|On June 29, 2007, the program's {{longtime}} {{film critic}} Joel Siegel died {{of complications from}} colon cancer at age 63. The July 9 edition of GMA was dedicated to Siegel, with former hosts Hartman, Hill, Lunden, Newman, Christian, Perkins and Gibson all appearing to share their memories. One month later, on July 31, 2007, Robin Roberts announced {{that she had been}} diagnosed with breast cancer after discovering a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast during a self-examination while preparing the Siegel tribute episode. Roberts remained as anchor while undergoing chemotherapy and completed radiation treatments on March 28, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Jane Emily Goward {{was born}} in Wakefield in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten {{children}} of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast and had a lumpectomy, she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a radiographer. By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric radiographer. Three years after having a lumpectomy the cancer returned {{and she had a}} second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2000, Jane Tomlinson was told that the cancer had spread to her bones and lungs, and was given about 12 months to live.|$|E

A couple of months before they started filming, everyone got together to discuss the storyline and map out the journey it would take. Viewers saw the character discovering a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast, going against doctors' advice about terminating her pregnancy and subsequently going through with treatment for the cancer.

Ruth was thirty-four {{at the time of her}} diagnosis, which was unusually young to contract such a cancer. Breast cancer nurse Vickki Harmer acted as a consultant to the scriptwriters during the storyline and BBC Radio 4 invited listeners to ring a helpline for further advice after Ruth received her diagnosis.

40|$|Extra-medullary leukemic {{infiltration}} {{of the breast}} by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is very rare. We report two cases of ALL presenting as breast masses and diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Our first patient, a post-partum 30 -year-old female, developed bilateral breast <b>lumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> last trimester of pregnancy and complained of easy fatigability. Our second patient, a 14 -year-old girl, presented with a right-breast lump of 1 -week duration. She had received treatment for ALL 1 year back and had been in complete remission for the last 1 year. FNA of the breast nodules done in both the cases revealed diffuse infiltration by lymphoblasts. Subsequent hematological investigations confirmed bone marrow involvement by ALL {{in the first case}} and extra-medullary relapse in the second case. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an easy and cost effective method for the early diagnosis of metastatic leukemic infiltration, avoiding unnecessary excisional biopsies in such cases...|$|R
500|$|Speaking to The Observers Sue Arnold, Finch {{believed}} The Archers {{had done}} [...] "a great service for women's health" [...] by tackling {{the subject of}} breast cancer. Finch later revealed that she had received letters from listeners about the storyline and one woman wrote to thank her because she had found a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast after listening to the show. Finch also named the storyline {{as one of her}} Archers highlights. Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough said The Archers treated the subject of breast cancer [...] "as sensibly as one can reasonably expect." [...] Morgan continues saying that Breakthrough liked how the show had highlighted the effect that a cancer diagnosis can have on a partner. In contrast, the radio series Feedback reported that the storyline had initially attracted a negative response from listeners, who felt the subject should have been handled with more optimism.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} Sunset Boulevard at the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1995, Paige {{discovered}} a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast, prompting her to consult her doctor, who at first reassured her {{there was nothing to}} be concerned about. She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When I did the show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning. Words like, 'as if we never said goodbye' became more real". [...] Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She spoke for the first time of her encounter with breast cancer in a 2004 interview, and has since described the period as [...] "the most awful thing that's happened to me in my life".|$|E

40|$|A 44 -year-old-woman {{presented}} with a painless <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> the right breast for 10 months. She had no nipple discharge and no familial history of breast carcinoma.

Physical examination revealed a 3. 5 cm, mobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. There was no evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient was admitted for excisional biopsy of the breast mass. IMAGING FINDINGS Mammography showed scattered fibroglandular breasts with a 3. 5 cm partially circumscribed, dense mass in the right upper outer quadrant (Fig 1). The mass contained no calcification. The axillary lymph nodes appeared normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the mass showed a complex mass with cystic and solid components (Fig 2). The mass also showed some posterior acoustic enhancement. Colour Doppler US demonstrated vascular flow within the solid component of the mass (Fig 3). Figure 2 Transverse US image of the mass shows a complex mass with cystic and nodular solid (M) components. Posterior acoustic enhancement (arrows) is also seen...|$|R

A <b>lump</b> was found <b>in</b> <b>her</b> right breast, measuring 1. 7 [*]cm in diameter. Surgical excision followed, and pathology revealed a highly atypical spindle cell tumor. Immunohistochemistry along the histological features, excluded the possibility of carcinoma, malignant phyllodes tumor, or another type of pure sarcoma. There was no history of previous irradiation in the region. MFH is among the rarest types of sarcoma of the breast, {{and most of the}} times behaves aggressively.

40|$|We {{encountered}} a 62 -year-old {{woman with a}} progressively worsening sore throat and a sharp <b>lump</b> located <b>in</b> <b>her</b> left upper neck, which appeared several hours before admission. After questioning, she underwent rigid esophagoscopy at a local hospital for suspected fish bone impaction but this gave a negative result. Unusual signs caused us to arrange a computed tomography scan, which showed that a foreign body had penetrated the left sternocleidomastoid muscle to the subcutaneous layer, with extensive emphysema in the neck. We extracted the foreign body with a 1 -cm horizontal incision of the neck under general anesthesia. The patient returned to a normal diet and was discharged on day 5 of hospitalization without further morbidity. This is another rare case of a migrating foreign body presenting as a neck lump. On reviewing the literature, most cases involving subcutaneously migrating fish bones show development of a neck lump several weeks to months after ingestion, with relatively stable conditions. However, our case showed a neck lump 1 day after ingestion with acute toxic symptoms...|$|R
