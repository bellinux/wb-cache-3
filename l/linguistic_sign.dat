2500|$|Indeed, {{the origin}} of language, {{understood}} as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and {{the origin of}} complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist Robin I. Dunbar has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged {{as a means of}} using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example grooming. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the structural theory of Ferdinand de Saussure which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of semiotics. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a <b>linguistic</b> <b>sign,</b> consisting for example of the sound [...] and the meaning [...] "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of [...] "wearing a crown" [...] and the cultural meaning of [...] "being king". In this way {{it can be argued that}} culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions. Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} {{different}} opinions on the arbitrariness of <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs.</b> This paper will review these different understandings of the arbitrariness and <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> and some arguments of some famous linguists over the arbitrariness of <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs.</b> Although now we can not gain a final solution to these arguments, {{we can see that}} these arguments themselves are developing, improving and that they improve the theory of arbitrariness of <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> as a whole. Holding a developing and philosophical attitude to the arbitrariness of <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs,</b> we can say that while the connection of sound to concept may have been arbitrary, the relationships between <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> after they are made within a language system are not arbitrary.

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> is based on social convention, <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|R

5000|$|Yet <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> in {{contexts}} of use accomplish other functions than pure reference and predication — though {{they often do}} so simultaneously, as though the signs were functioning in multiple analytically distinct semiotic modalities at once. In the philosophical literature, the most widely discussed examples are those identified by J.L. Austin as the performative functions of speech, for instance when a speaker says to an addressee [...] "I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow", and in so saying, in addition to simply making a proposition about a state of affairs, actually enters into a socially constituted type of agreement with the addressee, a wager. Thus, concludes Silverstein, [...] "the problem set for us {{when we consider the}} actual broader uses of language is to describe the total meaning of constituent <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs,</b> only part of which is semantic." [...] This broader study of <b>linguistic</b> <b>signs</b> relative to their general communicative functions is pragmatics, and these broader aspects of the meaning of utterances is pragmatic meaning. (From this point of view, semantic meaning is a special subcategory of pragmatic meaning, that aspect of meaning which contributes to the communicative function of pure reference and predication.).|$|R

Prague school linguist Jan Mukařovský writes that Saussure's [...] "discovery of the internal structure of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>sign</b> differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes", and that in this development [...] "new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature". Ruqaiya Hasan argues that [...] "the impact of Saussure’s theory of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>sign</b> has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure".|$|E
