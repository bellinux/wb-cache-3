We assume that it finds its origins in the Babylonian era and it could survive until now to many obstacles that were mostly related to religion –like the concept of usury-during the Greek, Roman, and Arab civilizations.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the index-based livestock insurance program in Mongolia {{designed in the}} context of a World Bank <b>lending</b> <b>operation</b> with Government of Mongolia and implemented on a pilot basis in 2005. This program involves a combination of self-insurance by herders, market-based insurance, and social insurance. Herders retain small losses, larger losses are transferred to the private insurance industry, and extreme or catastrophic losses are transferred to the government using a public safety net program. A syndicate pooling arrangement protects participating insurance companies against excessive insured losses, with excess of loss reinsurance provided by the government. The fiscal exposure of Government of Mongolia toward the most extreme losses is protected with a contingent credit facility. The insurance program relies on a mortality rate index by species in each local region. The index provides strong incentives to individual herders to continue to manage their herds so as to minimize the impacts of major livestock mortality events; individual herders receive an insurance payout based on the local mortality, irrespective of their individual losses. This project offered the first opportunity to design and implement an agriculture insurance program using a country-wide agricultural risk management approach. During the first sales season, 7 percent of the herders in the three pilot regions purchased the insurance product.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the key banks' specific variables of regression models in determination of bank profitability in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). For the purposes of econometric modeling, quarterly indicators of the banking sector based on country's aggregate data over the period 2000 q 1 to 2014 q 2, including one macroeconomic indicator (GDP growth rate) were employed. The key findings of this research showed that there was a positive and statistically significant relationship between (ROAA), the three of explanatory variables (LATA, TLTD and CRR) and a negative and statistically significant relationship with CEF and CAR. The results of our study have shown that higher bank's profitability measured by ROAA was possible if the banks increase the employment of capital, effectively manage operating costs, increase the share of deposits in financing loans, and improve non <b>lending</b> <b>operation.</b> More specifically, ROAE was significantly influenced by only two variables: cost efficiency and management of credit risk.

40|$|T {{his country}} {{study is a}} {{background}} paper prepared for the comparative analysis of organization and performance of cotton sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa, a study {{carried out by the}} World Bank, with the objective of analyzing the links between sector structure and observed performance outcomes and thus draw lessons from reform experience that can provide useful guidance to policy-makers, other local stakeholders, and interested donors agencies. It describes and reviews the cotton sector situation in Uganda. During the 1960 s, Uganda was Sub-Saharan Africa’s largest cotton producer. However, political instability and poor policy choices of the 1970 s led the sector to its demise. Attempts to revive the sector with lending operations during the 1980 s failed, but policy reforms combined with a <b>lending</b> <b>operation</b> and the high cotton prices of the 1990 s revitalized the sector. However, {{there is a sense that}} the sector lags behind its full potential. Various reports have identified low quality of cotton, lack of domestic textile industry, and low use of purchased inputs due to lack of rural credit as the key constraints. This paper argues that the fundamental problem of Uganda’s cotton sector is its low profitability, which reflects the displacement of cotton by food crops. Furthermore, its earlier process reflects, in part, the forced labor conditions under which cotton was grown. The paper concludes that promotion of biotechnology and training of cotton growers are two areas that should receive priority. Yet, the production targets announced by the government and many other entities are unlikely to be met any time soon...|$|E

40|$|ROCKEDBY THE MOUNTING {{shock waves}} of the {{explosion}} of the material and service expectations of the library user, the practitioners of interlibrary loan in the traditional manner are digging in behind their policies. As a consequence, one of the most important, implied obligations of the library-providing the most effective access to information-is slighted, as the borrower will not and cannot borrow and the lenders will not lend. Interlibrary loan is a technique by which one library lends material indirectly to an individual through another library. In essence, therefore, it is merely a means through which a library may broaden its lending service to include those materials which are made available by other libraries. The technique of interlibrary loan, of necessity, entails a <b>lending</b> <b>operation,</b> but regardless of where the actual work is performed-circulation, acquisitions, etc. -the principle involved is one of reference: that is, to provide the library user as completely as is possible with the material he needs. As a library activity, interlibrary loan should not be viewed as constant and unchanging but rather as a manifestation of a principle existing along the continuum of library development. To write a documented history of interlibrary loan would be extremely difficult; while it might add a certain historical prestige to trace its development back to a traffic in clay tablets or incunabula, and to indicate variations in the purposes and techniques of the transactions, the principle was the same then as it is today. The purposes for which one library will make available its material to another library, the scope of what materials are made available, and the techniques by which materials are made available are reflections of the society itself, when viewed against the totality of the social environment.

For that reason banking sector is also grow up very rapidly. The Banking Industry in Bangladesh is more than 100 years old. The first commercial Bank was ANZ Grind lays Bank, which opened in 1905. Today necessity of Bank as a financial institution is undeniable. Conventional Banks operates their businesses on interest basis. But interest is not allowed in our religion Islam.

Banking sector of Bangladesh {{is one of the}} major sectors, which contributes significantly to the national economy. The sector comprises a number of banks in various categories. Considering ownership the sector can be classified in to four major categories - such as Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs), Specialized Banks (SPBs), Private Commercial Banks (PCBs), and Trans-National Banks (TNBs). BASIC Bank Limited is one of oldest commercial bank operating in Bangladesh. It has over the years created one of the largest networks among all the other banks in Bangladesh. Although a trendsetter in offering a various ranges of products in the market, the products offer by BASIC Bank are quickly imitated by competitors. The profitability of a bank always depends on the efficient management of fund and exploring the genuine avenues in which its resources are invested to produce the maximum income. In this report I tried to analyzethe Credit Risk Management of BASIC Bank Ltd. Credit is one of the most important section for a bank. If the credit operation system is easier to the customer then it is acceptable to the client. Now it is a time when the banking section is too much competitive. If the operation policy is not good then it cannot exist for a long time in the market. I go through the following description. What are the strategies are followed by BASIC Bank Ltd and what are their priorities? What are the values considered as their guided factors, such as-placing the interest of clients and customers first, teamwork to the smallest unit to the enterprise as a whole. BASIC Bank enrich their credit system by offering several product offers, such as- General loan scheme, lease finance, consumer credit scheme, small and medium enterprise, advance against salary, all the offers are too much attractive because of having an attractive interest rate for all the scheme. The credit Policy framework is very organized at BASIC Bank Ltd. Credit risk management policy is also very important for the bank because of having different types of risk in credit. Credit risk management needs to be a robust process that enables a Bank to proactively manage its loan portfolio in order to minimize losses and earns an acceptable level of return for stakeholders. Given the fast changing dynamic global economy and the increasing pressure of globalization, liberalization, consolidation and disintermediation, it is essential that BASIC Bank has a robust credit risk management policy and procedures that are sensitive and responsive to these changes. BASIC Bank will always comply with the prevailing banking regulation regarding Single Customer Exposure Limit set by Bangladesh Bank from time to time. The BASIC Bank Ltd. ensures that the loan or credit they lend is given to the right person. For this, BASIC follows a strict rules and regulation. <b>Lending</b> <b>operation</b> starts from selection of borrower from field level and ends with disbursing sanctioned amount after proper credit analysis and documentation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} commercial banks’ practice {{pertaining to}} the integration of environmental issues into their lending activities. There is evidence {{that over the last}} few decades some banks have considered the environmental impact of borrower activities as part of credit risk assessment and management. A number of academic surveys have identified a positive correlation between the environmental and financial performance of companies. These developments influence the level of bank support for responsible environmental management. For most commercial banks loans are a large percentage of assets. Hence appropriate management of loans is a priority for bank management, shareholders and other interested people. Traditionally, banks use financial instruments to measure the efficiency of their lending decisions and to ensure that payments are made on time. However, each <b>lending</b> <b>operation</b> may involve environmental risks. Adverse environmental outcomes may result in a reduction in the borrowers’ repayment capacity, a decline {{in the value of the}} collateral, a direct bank liability for environmental damage caused by its borrowing clients and potential risks to the bank’s reputation. For each of these risks the bank can determine the likelihood, extent, cost and impact should the damage actually occur. Bank lending occurs in a wider economic and social context of strategic importance for banks. Society’s quest for sustainable development involves the creation of new financing markets, such as markets for sustainable energy, water purification equipment, products for the financing of companies’ climate policies and groundbreaking technology. Banks can fulfil the role of a traditional financial intermediary or can step into this growing market to develop specific new products such as environmental loans. This market is rich in challenges and opportunities. Hence, it is crucial that banks have appropriate indicators to help them and stakeholders monitor performance. Against this background, this study investigates the practice of incorporating environmental issues into banks’ lending decisions, utilizing Westpac as a case study. Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were adopted. A mixed method of data collection was used, consisting of an analysis of annual reports, semi-structured interview and a survey questionnaire. The Westpac study is used to develop and test an environmental sustainability framework to analyse the incorporation of environmental issues into lending decisions by financial institutions. The results from the research provide some evidence that Westpac incorporates environmental issues into lending decisions and is aware of environmental risks and opportunities. At the operational level, the bank assesses environmental risks before approving loans and finances projects with high environmental benefits. With regard to motivational drivers, the findings indicate that the bank’s incorporation of environmental issues into lending decisions is motivated by multiple reasons: managerial, financial and environmental. However, the environmental information reported was not consistently and sufficiently communicated to stakeholders. Further, the results from the research reveal that bank management should effectively consider environmental issues when making lending decisions and that they should take specific actions to have such issues effectively implemented. Although banks are motivated by a variety of factors, financial issues were considered the most important factor when banks are making lending decisions. This study also reveals that respondents did not know about bank effectiveness in addressing environmental issues when making lending decisions. Moreover, people who are likely to be better informed or knowledgeable about environmental issues were also found to have a low level of knowledge in this regard. Furthermore, the majority of respondents tend not to be satisfied with the interaction between banks and both the public and the New Zealand government. The literature to date suggests there is increasing stakeholder pressure on businesses to act with environmental responsibility, but this result suggests challenges still remain. A comparison of Westpac and HSBC stakeholder reports revealed that HSBC provided more appropriate environmental information than Westpac regarding their lending activities. The comparison reveals that there is a shift in how banks view the consideration of environmental performance as material to users of the annual reports. However, there is a gap in the information provided probably due to the voluntary nature of sustainability disclosures in annual reports. Thus, there is a need for improvement relating to the content and quality of environmental reporting. This research proposes an environmental sustainability framework, with specific focus on the lending process as a guideline for bank management, policy makers and other interested people. It facilitates effective measurement of environmental performance in two major areas: management and operations, and motivations. The framework includes indicators and processes to improve bank financial and environmental performance. The key findings of this study are instructive. Consideration of environmental issues when making lending decisions is important to banks, borrowers, the environment and stakeholders in general. Environmental risks, opportunities and the positive relationship between the environmental performance and financial performance give motivation to integrate environmental issues into lending activities. This study identified that Westpac and commercial banks more generally have an opportunity to provide further and consistent evidence concerning their managerial and operational performance and drivers when making lending decisions. Such actions would provide stakeholders with more accurate views on the bank’s environmental performance. It would also facilitate the bank’s ability to respond sufficiently and transparently to the international agreements and initiatives the bank is signatory to and/or a member of...|$|E
