5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1990 as 102.2 Jazz FM in London, {{and a second}} Jazz FM branded station was {{launched}} four years later in Manchester. The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004, {{and was the first}} in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand. The London station followed suit a year later. The network's parent company, GMG Radioa subsidiary of the Guardian Media Groupacquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid-2000s, and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name. After the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio, and the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and broadcasts, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single, quasi-national station in October 2010; local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows, but carried networked programming at other times. As part of their <b>licence</b> <b>agreement,</b> the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name, and the UK's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications (Ofcom) stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week, but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, Westland {{investigated}} licensed {{manufacture of}} the Sikorsky S-56 {{for the civil}} market with turboshaft power. The company sought Ministry of Supply support for the proposal, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. In June 1958, Westland obtained an extension to their <b>licence</b> <b>agreement</b> with Sikorsky to cover the five bladed main-rotor, gearbox, tail-rotor, transmission and control systems of the S-56. Faced with continuing government indifference, Westland decided to press ahead with a private-venture design for a heavy-lift transport, built around the S-56 systems but powered by a pair of Napier Eland turboshafts. At the time, Westland was heavily committed to development of the Wessex and the Westminster project had to be run on a shoestring.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, CAC {{obtained}} a <b>licence</b> <b>agreement</b> {{to build the}} F-86F Sabre. In a major departure from the North American blueprint, {{it was decided that}} the CA-27 would be powered by a licence-built version of the Rolls-Royce Avon R.A.7, rather than the General Electric J47. In theory, the Avon was capable of more than double the maximum thrust and double the thrust-to-weight ratio of the US engine. This necessitated a re-design of the fuselage, as the Avon was shorter, wider and lighter than the J47. Because of the engine change the type is sometimes referred to as the Avon Sabre. To accommodate the Avon, over 60 percent of the fuselage was altered and there was a 25 percent increase {{in the size of the}} air intake. Another major revision was in replacing the F-86F's six machine guns with two 30mm ADEN cannon, while other changes were also made to the cockpit and to provide an increased fuel capacity.|$|E

Unsure of the type of plane he should take, but considering a Blériot, Mawson mentioned his plans to Scott's wife Kathleen Scott, an aircraft enthusiast. She recommended he take a monoplane, and conveyed his interest to Lieutenant Hugh Evelyn Watkins of the Essex Regiment.

500|$|Westland Helicopters, {{which had}} a long-standing <b>licence</b> <b>agreement</b> with Sikorsky Aircraft {{to allow it to}} build Sikorsky's helicopters, {{extended}} the agreement to cover the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King soon after the Sea King's first flight in 1959. Westland proceeded to independently develop the Sea King, integrating a significant proportion of components from British suppliers; key changes include the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Gnome turboshaft engines and the implementation of an automatic flight control system. On this matter, authors Jim Thorn and Gerald Frawley stated that: [...] "Despite appearances, Westland's Sea King [...] very different aircraft from Sikorsky's". Many {{of the differences between the}} Westland-built Sea King and the original helicopter were as a result of differing operational doctrine. While the U.S. Navy Sea Kings were intended to be under tactical control of the carrier from which they operated, the Royal Navy intended its helicopters to be much more autonomous, capable of operating alone, or coordinating with other aircraft or surface vessels. This resulted in a different crew arrangement, with operations being controlled by an observer rather than the pilot, as well as fitting a search radar.|$|E
500|$|The College of Arms had {{informed}} Wimbledon F.C. in August 2002 that its {{continued use of}} the Wimbledon double-headed eagle device for its logo was illegal, so the club adopted a new badge before the 2003–04 season.

40|$|We use {{survey data}} for 247 European {{universities}} and 40 public research organizations {{to investigate the}} effects of institutional policies on four outcomes of transfer performance (R&D agreements with companies, patent applications, <b>licence</b> <b>agreements,</b> and start-ups established).

The results suggest that the type of incentive as well as the degree of transparency of transfer policies should be chosen to complement the main transfer channels and strategy of the institutio...|$|R
