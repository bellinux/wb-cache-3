50|$|In mathematics, log-polar {{coordinates}} (or <b>logarithmic</b> <b>polar</b> coordinates) is a {{coordinate system}} in two dimensions, where a point is identified by two numbers, {{one for the}} logarithm of the distance to a certain point, and one for an angle. Log-polar coordinates are closely connected to polar coordinates, which are usually used to describe domains in the plane {{with some sort of}} rotational symmetry. In areas like harmonic and complex analysis, the log-polar coordinates are more canonical than polar coordinates.|$|E

They {{have the ability}} to explore areas unavailable to manned assets and to perform duties that are risky to humans. In particular, UUVs {{have the ability to}} perform bearings-only tracking in shallow areas near shorelines. This article compares a <b>Logarithmic</b> <b>Polar</b> Coordinates EKF (LPC-EKF) and <b>Logarithmic</b> <b>Polar</b> UKF (LPC-UKF) for the estimation problem.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{rotation}} and scale invariant texture segmentation is proposed, {{which can be}} also employed for object recognition based on pattern analysis in noisy images. The segmentation scheme {{is based on a}} supervised rotation and scale invariant texture recognition using multichannel <b>polar</b> <b>logarithmic</b> Gabor filters for feature extraction. The <b>polar</b> <b>logarithmic</b> arrangement works like a Fourier-Mellin descriptor providing orientation and scale invariance. The classification of the features is carried out by symmetric phase-only matched filtering. The classification accuracy is about 90 % at arbitrary rotation angle and for scale factors between 0. 25 and 4. 0. Rotation angle and scale factor can be determined with high precision by the classification scheme. Prior to the segmentation a normalization scheme as preprocessing step is used to reduce illumination gradients, which is also able to treat illumination edges like shades...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{rotation}} and scale invariant texture recognition is proposed, {{which can also}} be employed for multi-object analysis and object recognition based on pattern analysis in noisy images. The recognition method uses data base textures, which are compared with a texture to be recognized and relies on extraction and classification of features. The features are extracted using multichannel <b>polar</b> <b>logarithmic</b> Gabor filtering of the data base textures and the texture to be recognized with the same definite filter bank. The <b>polar</b> <b>logarithmic</b> orientation of the Gabor filters guarantees rotation and scale invariance. The classification of the features is carried out by symmetric phase-only matched filtering. The performance of the method has been tested on Brodatz textures, hone textures, and textile textures with perfect recognition results. Rotation angle and scale factor can be determined with arbitrary precision by the classification scheme...|$|R
40|$|The shock {{strengths}} {{for which}} either Edney type I or type II shock interference patterns can occur when two oblique shocks of opposite families intersect were determined graphically at Mach 10 by using <b>logarithmic</b> shock <b>polar</b> diagrams. The theoretical region of overlap {{for the two}} types of interaction was investigated by observing in the Schlieren system of the Langley 15 -inch hypersonic flow apparatus the intersection of oblique shocks generated by two sharp 10 degree wedges as the wedge angles of attack and their relative positions were altered. A range of shock strengths for which either of the two interference patterns can exist was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Implementations of the Bayes {{filtering}} for vision based aircraft tracking suffer fundamental {{difficulties in}} the Cartesian coordinate. This {{is because of the}} uncertainty of the noise model in the flight dynamic equation when the aircraft state is described in these coordinates. Recently, the <b>Logarithmic</b> <b>Polar</b> Coordinate (LPC) framework has been successfully applied in the bearings-only tracking context, with the ability of estimating the variance to range ratio (Brehard and Le Cadre [2004]). In this paper, we design an aircraft tracking method using LPC. This method can adapt with changes of the noise model in the flight dynamic equation. Hence, it is more robust than methods for vision based aircraft tracking using the Cartesian Coordinates...|$|E
40|$|A {{polar diagram}} where the {{amplitude}} {{of the transfer}} function is on a logarithmic scale, is presented. This gives a one-size-fits-all diagram with no need for zooming in and out, and no need for additional reasoning about infinite-radius encirclements when there are poles on the imaginary axis - {{as opposed to what}} is usually neccessary with the standard polar (Nyquist-) diagram. All properties needed for stability considerations are upheld, such as encirclements, gain and phase margins. The path for s in the loop transfer function is carefully chosen with regard to possible poles on the imaginary axis. Small excursions into the right half plane in the form of arcs of different-sized logarithmic spirals result in corresponding large but finite arcs that do not overlap in the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>polar</b> plots...|$|E
40|$|We here {{address the}} {{classical}} bearings-only tracking problem (BOT) {{for a single}} object, which belongs to the general class of nonlinear filtering problems. Recently, algorithms based on sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filtering) have been proposed. As far as performance analysis is concerned, the Posterior Cramér-Rao Bound (PCRB) provides a lower bound on the mean square error. Classically, the PCRB is given by the inverse Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The latter is computed using Tichavsk´y’s recursive formula via Monte Carlo methods.

40|$|Spirals are {{surprisingly}} common in science, nature, physics, astronomy, flora and fauna, and the arts. In Cartesian coordinates they are typically transcendental functions, {{which makes the}} evaluation on Cartesian grids an inefficient process. We propose a construction scheme for piecewise circular approximations. The algorithm is convergent and consists of generating center coordinates and radii for quarter circles given an arbitrary monotone polynomial, exponential, or <b>logarithmic</b> function in <b>polar</b> coordinates. Evaluating quarter circles as well as generating the parameters can be done incrementally with few integer operations, thus, the algorithm is fast and stable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of <b>polar</b> <b>logarithmic</b> {{quantization}} (PLQ) for multi-input systems, and the corresponding design issues for the underlying networked control system (NCS). It is shown that the PLQ induces sector bounded nonlinear uncertainties in multiplicative and relative forms for vector-valued analog signals, {{similar to those in}} the scalar case. For the two-input NCS, optimal quantization is obtained through minimization of the quantization error that is quantified explicitly. The results are extended to more than two-input NCSs with an upper bound derived for the quantization error. Feedback stabilization and control of the NCS are also investigated under the PLQ at the plant input under state feedback. The coarsest quantization density (CQD) is studied and obtained. Results in this paper are illustrated by a numerical example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} {{classical}} bearings-only tracking problem (BOT) {{for a single}} object, which belongs to the general class of nonlinear filtering problems. Recently, algorithms based on sequential Monte-Carlo methods (particle filtering) have been proposed. As far as performance analysis is concerned, the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) provides a lower bound on the mean square error. Classically, under a technical assumption named “asymptotic unbiasedness assumption, ” the PCRB is given by the inverse Fisher information matrix (FIM). The latter is computed using Tichavsk´y’s recursive formula via Monte-Carlo methods. Two major problems are studied here. First, we show that the asymptotic unbiasedness assumption can be replaced by an assumption which is more meaningful. Second, an exact algorithm to compute the PCRB is derived via Tichavsk´y’s recursive formula without using Monte-Carlo methods. This result {{is based on a}} new coordinate system named <b>logarithmic</b> <b>polar</b> coordinate (LPC) system. Simulation results illustrate that PCRB can now be computed accurately and quickly, making it suitable for sensor management applications...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study how the logarithmic-polar mapping affects the spatiotemporal volume and the {{computation}} of the optical flow. We propose two new methods for the estimation of the optical flow and its spatial derivatives in the log-polar plane. We study analytically and experimentally the effects of the polar deformation and we qualitatively explain the decimation due to subsampling on the computation of optical flow. 1 Introduction This paper is concerned with the computation of optical flow in image sequences obtained with the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>polar</b> transformation. The log-polar transformation is a model for space-variant resolution in the periphery of the image. Spacevariant sensing arises as a necessity in systems which must be able to process simultaneously a central region of interest (fovea) in detail for recognition tasks and a wide-angle peripheral view for detecting events and new candidates for gaze change. Uniform resolution in the peripheral part would resu [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Vision {{systems with}} {{spatially}} homogeneous resolution {{are not able}} to provide a real time response in a dynamically changing environment. A reactive behavior necessitates selective sensing in space. Such a selection can be accomplished by the combination of a space-variant resolution scheme and a sensor with controllable degrees of freedom. The field of view is split into a homogeneous high resolution area - the fovea - and the periphery with decreasing resolution. Both in neurobiology and in robot vision, models of the resolution decrease towards the image boundaries have been established. The most convincing model is the theory of <b>logarithmic</b> <b>polar</b> mapping. In this paper we propose two new methods for the estimation of the optical flow and its spatial derivatives in the log-polar plane.
