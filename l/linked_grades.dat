School accountability systems link rewards and consequences {{to a set of}} measurable outcomes, typically student scores on standardized tests. While these systems aim to improve school quality and academic achievement, a substantial literature on accountability has focused on how schools may act in ways that improve accountability measures but do not actually raise achievement (e. g., exempting low performing students from testing) or raise achievement for a subset of students (i. e., those given more weight in the accountability system) at their classmates’ expense. 1 In short, {{there is a great deal}} of evidence on the pitfalls of school accountability, but far less evidence that these systems can lead to increases in student achievement...|$|E

40|$|Unauthorised {{student nurse}} {{absenteeism}} {{in higher education}} troubles many university lecturers. Anecdotally, absenteeism is occasionally raised as an issue by attending students who resent others "getting away" with non-attendance and some policy documents appear to suggest that attendance should be mandated. This paper argues against enforced attendance in higher education and challenges those who would mandate attendance to explain and justify their position. Drawing {{on a range of}} nursing and non-nursing material we here discuss some of the literature on attendance, absenteeism, effort or time spent in study and grade attainment. Informed by this admittedly partial review we maintain that the evidence <b>linking</b> <b>grade</b> attainment with attendance and study effort is less conclusive than intuition might initially suggest. We note that enforcing attendance apparently runs counter to important pedagogic (humanistic and androgogic) principles. We propose that responses to absenteeism cannot be separated from questions of ‘harm’ and we suggest that lecturers should refrain from associating nonattendance with unprofessional behaviour and poor professionalization...|$|R
40|$|Borders are {{important}} as they demarcate developing tissue into distinct functional units. A key challenge is {{the discovery of}} mechanisms that can convert morphogen gradients into tissue borders. While mechanisms that produce ultrasensitive cellular responses provide a solution, how extracellular morphogens drive such mechanisms remains poorly understood. Here, we show how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathways interact to generate ultrasensitivity and borders in the dorsal telencephalon. BMP and FGF signaling manipulations in explants produced border defects suggestive of cross inhibition within single cells, which was confirmed in dissociated cultures. Using mathematical modeling, we designed experiments that ruled out alternative cross inhibition mechanisms and identified a cross-inhibitory positive feedback (CIPF) mechanism, or "toggle switch", which acts upstream of transcriptional targets in dorsal telencephalic cells. CIPF explained several cellular phenomena important for border formation such as threshold tuning, ultrasensitivity, and hysteresis. CIPF explicitly <b>links</b> <b>graded</b> morphogen signaling in the telencephalon to switch-like cellular responses and {{has the ability to}} form multiple borders and scale pattern to size. These benefits may apply to other developmental systems...|$|R

40|$|In [Duke Math. J. 101 (1999) 359 - 426], Mikhail Khovanov {{constructed}} a homology theory for oriented <b>links,</b> whose <b>graded</b> Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial. He also explained how every link cobordism between two links induces a homomorphism between their homology groups, and he conjectured the invariance (up to sign) of this homomorphism under ambient isotopy {{of the link}} cobordism. In this paper we prove this conjecture, after having made a necessary improvement on its statement. We also introduce polynomial Lefschetz numbers of cobordisms from a link to itself such that the Lefschetz polynomial of the trivial cobordism is the Jones polynomial.
