40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the application of}} ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the examination of lacrimal canalicular diseases, and to investigate UBM image characteristics of lacrimal canaliculi in disease states. METHODS: Sixty cases (63 eyes, 69 canaliculi) of lacrimal canalicular diseases were enrolled that included 32 patients (32 eyes, 32 canaliculi) with chronic lacrimal canaliculitis, 18 patients (18 eyes, 18 canaliculi) with previous lacrimal canalicular laceration, 9 patients (12 eyes, 18 canaliculi) with congenital absence of lacrimal puncta and canaliculi, and 1 case (1 eye, 1 canaliculus) of canalicular mass. The patients were examined using UBM, and disease-specific features of the UBM images were noted. RESULTS: UBM imaging of lacrimal canaliculi in chronic canaliculitis patients showed obvious ectasia of the lacrimal canalicular lumen. Dot-like moderate echoic signals were detected on some ectatic lumina of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>canaliculus.</b> Some lumen-like structures of the lower <b>lacrimal</b> <b>canaliculus</b> were observed in 2 (2 eyes, 2 canaliculi) of the 9 patients (12 eyes, 18 canaliculi) with congenital absence of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>canaliculus.</b> Of the 18 patients (18 eyes, 18 canaliculi) with previous lacrimal canalicular laceration, the lacerated end on the nasal side of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>canaliculus</b> was detected only in 14 patients (14 eyes, 14 canaliculi).

Excellent anatomical knowledge {{is required for}} this endoscopic surgical approach. This study was performed {{in order to better}} evaluate the anatomical features of the lacrimal apparatus from cadavers in the Isfahan forensic center as a sample of the Iranian population.   Materials and Methods: DCR was performed using a standard method on 26 cadaver eyes from the forensic center of Isfahan. The lacrimal sac was exposed completely, then the anatomical features of the <b>lacrimal</b> sac and <b>canaliculus</b> were measured using a specified ruler.   Results: A total of 26 male cadaveric eyes were used, of which four (16. 7 %) were probably non-Caucasian. Two (8 %) of the eyes needed septoplasty, one (4 %) needed uncinectomy, and none needed turbinoplasty. Four (16 %) lacrimal sacs were anterior to axilla, one (4 %) was posterior and 20 (80 %) were {{at the level of the}} axilla of the middle turbinate. The distance  from the nasal sill to the anterior edge of the lacrimal sac (from its mid-height) was 39. 04 (± 4. 92) mm. The distance from the nasal sill to the posterior edge of the lacrimal sac (from its mid-height) was 45. 50 (± 4. 47) mm. The width and length of the lacrimal sac was 7. 54 (± 1. 44) mm and 13. 16 (± 5. 37) mm, respectively. The distance from the anterior edge of the lacrimal sac to the posterior edge of the uncinate process was 14. 06 (± 3. 00) mm, while the distance from the anterior nasal spine to the anterior edge of the lacrimal sac (from its mid-height) was 37. 20 (± 5. 37) mm. The height of the fundus was 3. 26 (± 1. 09) mm. The distance from the superior punctum to the fundus was 12. 70 (± 1. 45) mm, and the distance from the inferior punctum to the fundus was 11. 10 (± 2. 02) mm.   Conclusion:  Given the differences between the various studies conducted in order to evaluate the position of the lacrimal sac, studies such as this can help to better identify the position of lacrimal sac during surgery based on ethnic differences.

METHOD: In the period August 1995 -August 1999 16 patients were seen with a monocanalicular trauma. No {{attempt was made to}} reconstruct the canaliculus; only the superficial layers were closed (skin and M. orbicularis oculi). At follow-up the patients were asked about epiphora (score of Munk) and the test of Anel and the fluorescein dye disappearance test were carried out. RESULTS: At follow-up a mean of 13. 7 months (range: 3 - 33) after the trauma the injured canaliculus was totally blocked in all patients.

All cases responded to appropriate surgical management. <b>Lacrimal</b> <b>canaliculus</b> obstruction is a known com- the illness vesicles were present on the eyelids, and plication of virus infection. ' Although several the eyes were 'red and irritable ' with crusting on the different viral diseases have been implicated in this lashes and considerable tearing. The general ocular way, chickenpox has been mentioned only sparingly examination was nonnal, but an obstruction was in the medical literature as havingsuch a complication. Three cases were recently observed and provided the opportunity to examine this more closely. The results are reported here.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the necessity of}} modification to the traditional pigtail probe and evaluate its efficiency and therapeutic effect in searching the nasal cut ends and anastomosing the lacerated <b>lacrimal</b> <b>canaliculus.</b> MethodsEighty-seven patients (including 87 eyes) suffering from canalicular laceration were randomized into two groups: 41 patients treated with traditional pigtail probes (Group A) and 46 with modified pigtail probes (Group B). During {{the reconstruction of the}} lacerated canaliculi, the traditional pigtail probe and the modified pigtail probe were used respectively to seek for the nasal cut ends of lacerated lacrimal canaliculi. Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICCTM) silicone tube with diameter of 0. 95 mm was intubated as a stent for 4 - 6 months. The surgical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed after stent removal. ResultsIn Group B, the primary success rate of searching the nasal cut ends of lacerated lacrimal canaliculi was 93. 48 % (43 / 46) and the final success rate was 97. 83 % (45 / 46). No false passage formed in Group B. Statistical significance was found between Group A and Group B as the primary success rates of searching the nasal cut ends (χ 2 = 10. 522, P 0. 05). The mean time of searching the nasal cut ends of lacerated lacrimal canaliculi in Group B was (5. 02 ± 2. 73) minutes and the mean time of operation was (33. 90 ± 4. 84) minutes, and both weresignificantly shorter than those of Group A (t 1 = 9. 779, t 2 = 10. 700, P 0. 05).

A vertical portion of the canaliculus was about 1 mm (1. 11 ± 0. 16 mm) deep, and the horizontal portion was about 2 ~ 3 mm (2. 08 ± 2. 74 mm) long 2 mm below the mucocutaneous junction, which is where an incision may be made when performing epicanthoplasty. 2) Motor innervation to the lower orbiculis oculi muscle: the pretarsal and preseptal OOMs were innervated by five to seven terminal twigs of the zygomatic branches {{of the facial nerve}} that approached the muscle at a right angle. The mean horizontal distance between the lateral canthus and the zygomatic branch was 2. 31 ± 0. 29 cm (range: 1. 7 ~ 2. 7 cm) and the vertical distance was 1. 20 ± 0. 20 cm (range: 0. 8 ~ 1. 5 cm). 3) Sensory innervation of the lower eyelid skin: the majority of the terminal branches (93. 8 %) of the ION were distributed to the medial to the lateral canthus. Most (99. 4 %) of the terminal branches of the ZFN were distributed to lateral to the lateral canthus. 4) Retractor of the lower eyelid; capsulopalpebral fascia (CPF) : the orbital septum blended with the CPF most closely at 3. 7 ~ 5. 4 mm beneath the lower tarsal border and differently at 3. 7 ± 0. 7 mm on the medial limbus line, 4. 3 ± 0. 8 mm on the midpupillary line and 5. 4 ± 1. 0 mm on the lateral limbus line. 5) Arcuate expansion (AE) : The AE was a fibrous band expanding from the inferolateral orbital rim to the medial canthal ligament. A sector (fan-shaped) of the AE originated in the angle of 5 to 80 degrees at the circumference of the inferolateral orbital rim circle, falling within the range of...|$|E

A sector (fan-shaped) of the AE originated in the angle of 5 to 80 degrees at the circumference of the inferolateral orbital rim circle, falling within the range of 3 to 5. 5 o'clock, and then it tapered and attached to the inferior border of the medial canthal ligament. 6) Suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) in the lower eyelid: the SOOF was located in the inferolateral side of the orbit within a range between medial + 15 and lateral - 89 degrees to a vertical midpupillary line. Histologically, the SOOF was situated deep to the Orbicularis oculi muscle and superficial to the orbital septum and periosteum. The SOOF consisted more of fibrofatty tissue rather than being the pure fatty nature like orbital fat. I hope surgeons can achieve desirable outcomes with the knowledge reviewed in this article...|$|E
