5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, <b>labyrinthitis,</b> strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Labyrinthitis</b> - An {{inner ear}} {{infection}} or inflammation causing both dizziness (vertigo) and hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Although BPPV {{can occur}} at any age, {{it is most}} often seen in people {{over the age of}} 60. Besides aging, there are no major risk factors known for {{developing}} BPPV, although previous episodes of trauma to the head, or inner ear infections known as <b>labyrinthitis,</b> may predispose individuals to future development of BPPV.|$|E
25|$|<b>Labyrinthitis</b> {{presents}} {{with severe}} vertigo with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and {{is believed to}} be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear though several theories have been put forward and the cause remains uncertain. Individuals with vestibular neuritis do not typically have auditory symptoms but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus. Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected.|$|E
25|$|BPPV {{can result}} from a head injury or simply occur {{among those who are}} older. A {{specific}} cause is often not found. The underlying mechanism involves a small calcified otolith moving around loose in the inner ear. It is a type of balance disorder along with <b>labyrinthitis</b> and Ménière's disease. Diagnosis is typically made when the Dix–Hallpike test results in nystagmus (a specific movement pattern of the eyes) and other possible causes have been ruled out. In typical cases medical imaging is not needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and <b>labyrinthitis.</b> Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo is a problem {{in a part of the}} vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} {{is more likely}} in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In <b>labyrinthitis</b> the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E
25|$|Frank R. Freemon (1976) {{thinks that}} the above reasons given by modern biographers of Muhammad in {{rejection}} of epilepsy come from the widespread misconceptions about {{the various types of}} epilepsy. In his differential diagnosis, Freemon rejects schizophrenic hallucinations, drug-induced mental changes such as might occur after eating plants containing hallucinogenic materials, transient ischemic attacks, hypoglycemia, <b>labyrinthitis,</b> Ménière's disease, or other inner ear maladies. At the end, Freemon argues that if one were forced to make a diagnosis psychomotor seizures of temporal lobe epilepsy would be the most tenable one, although our lack of scientific as well as historical knowledge makes unequivocal decision impossible. Freemon cites evidences supporting and opposing this diagnosis. In the end, Freemon points out that a medical diagnosis should not ignore Muhammad’s moral message because it is just as likely, perhaps more likely, for God communicate with a person in an abnormal state of mind.|$|E

2500|$|Vertigo that {{is caused}} by {{problems}} with the inner ear or vestibular system, which is composed of the semicircular canals, the vestibule (utricle and saccule), and the vestibular nerve is called [...] "peripheral", [...] "otologic" [...] or [...] "vestibular" [...] vertigo. The most common cause is {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo. Other causes include Ménière's disease (12%), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, <b>labyrinthitis,</b> and visual vertigo. [...] Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures). [...] Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo.|$|E

50|$|Vestibular {{rehabilitation}} {{therapy is}} a highly effective way to substantially reduce or eliminate residual dizziness from <b>labyrinthitis.</b> VRT works by causing the brain to use already existing neural mechanisms for adaptation, neuroplasticity, and compensation.|$|E
50|$|The main {{symptom of}} <b>labyrinthitis</b> is severe vertigo. Rapid and {{undesired}} eye motion (nystagmus) often {{results from the}} improper indication of rotational motion. Nausea, anxiety, and a general ill feeling are common due to the distorted balance signals that the brain receives from the inner ear.|$|E
50|$|Biological causes - obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, post {{traumatic stress}} disorder, hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, Wilson's disease, mitral valve prolapse, pheochromocytoma, and inner ear disturbances (<b>labyrinthitis).</b> Dysregulation of the norepinephrine {{system in the}} locus ceruleus, {{an area of the}} brain stem, has been linked to panic attacks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Labyrinthitis,</b> {{also known}} as {{vestibular}} neuritis, is inflammation of the inner ear. It results in vertigo and also possible hearing loss or ringing in the ears.

Vestibular neuronitis may also be associated with eye nystagmus.|$|E

50|$|Diseases of the {{vestibular}} {{system can}} take different forms, and usually induce vertigo and instability {{or loss of}} balance, often accompanied by nausea. The most common vestibular diseases in humans are vestibular neuritis, a related condition called <b>labyrinthitis,</b> Ménière's disease, and BPPV. In addition, {{the function of the}} vestibular system can be affected by tumors on the vestibulocochlear nerve, an infarct in the brain stem or in cortical regions related to the processing of vestibular signals, and cerebellar atrophy.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause is}} often not clear. It {{may be due to}} a virus, but it can also arise from {{bacterial}} infection, head injury, extreme stress, an allergy, or as a reaction to medication. 30% of affected people had a common cold prior to developing the disease. Either bacterial or viral <b>labyrinthitis</b> can cause permanent hearing loss in rare cases. This appears to result from an imbalance of neuronal input between the left and right inner ears.|$|E
50|$|Many {{inner ear}} {{disorders}} can cause dizziness, {{which leads to}} dysfunctional righting reflex action. Common inner ear disorders can cause vertigo in patients, which can be acute or chronic symptoms. <b>Labyrinthitis,</b> or inflammation of the inner ear, can cause imbalances that must be overcome through therapeutic exercises. Labyrinthectomy, or removal of inner ear organs, is an operation conducted for patients with severe inner ear disorders whose vertigo is debilitating. Imbalances result from the procedure, but therapy can help overcome the symptoms.|$|E
