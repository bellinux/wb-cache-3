5|$|Jain texts mention five transgressions (Atichara) of the vow: {{the desire}} to be reborn as a human, {{the desire to}} be reborn as a divinity, the desire to {{continue}} living, the desire to die quickly, and the desire to live a sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enjoyment of pleasures in the future.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E
5|$|Ramram hoped his {{son would}} {{follow in his}} profession, but Ramprasad showed no {{interest}} in practical pursuits. As he grew up, his spiritual inclinations caused {{a great deal of}} anxiety to his parents. Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad more responsible, his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known devotee of Kali {{and the author of the}} Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) and worship of Kali.|$|E

5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E
5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

The programmers commented that the traditional nature of the track was suited for playing on contemporary American radio.|$|E
500|$|Across {{the various}} theologies and philosophies, the common theme {{presents}} Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with {{human life and}} love {{as a reflection of}} the divine. The longing and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other characters, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna's lila is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, [...] "love is presented not simply as a means to salvation, it is the highest life". Human love is God's love.|$|E
500|$|Another song on {{the album}} that deals {{with the need to}} escape the {{confines}} of society is David Crosby's [...] "Dolphin's Smile". The song was an early example of Crosby's penchant for using nautical imagery in his songs, a thematic trait he would utilize in future compositions, including [...] "Wooden Ships" [...] and [...] "The Lee Shore". The theme of unfettered idyllic bliss is further explored in the Hillman-penned [...] "Natural Harmony". Like [...] "Goin' Back", [...] "Natural Harmony" [...] conveys a sense of <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> innocence of youth, albeit filtered through the awareness-raising properties of psychedelic drugs. It has been suggested by some commentators that the song exhibits the strong influence of Crosby's writing style, with its laid-back, jazzy feel and dreamy, high tenor vocal part.|$|E

500|$|In {{the closing}} chorale, [...] "" [...] (Amen, amen! Come, you fair crown of joy), Bach sets the Abgesang {{only of the}} final stanza of Nicolai's hymn. The musicologist Julian Mincham offers the thought: [...] "Conceivably the most convincing {{explanation}} lies, as it so often does, within the text– ... do not delay, I await You longingly. The hymn tune itself, through its very abbreviation implies {{a sense of urgency}} and the feeling of being unable to defer any longer." [...] In Bach's setting, the violin adds a jubilant fifth part to the four vocal parts. The violin has to [...] "climb three octaves to convey the extent of the soul's <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> joys of a future life and the prospect of Jesus returning at the end of time".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the songs in the film, Ariel has new songs by Alan Menken and lyrics by Glenn Slater. [...] "The World Above" [...] is Ariel's introductory song, where she expresses her admiration and curiosity with the human world, [...] "Beyond My Wildest Dreams" [...] is performed after Ariel has become human and given up her voice, and is used to express her thoughts about the human world and Eric, and [...] "If Only (quartet)" [...] is a quartet between Ariel, Eric, King Triton and Sebastian where all four express longing and sadness for their current situation: Ariel saddened that she only has one day left to get Eric to kiss her, Eric's confusion of falling for Ariel despite <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mysterious girl who saved his life, King Triton's regret at driving Ariel away, and Sebastian for his inability to help Ariel achieve her dreams.|$|E
500|$|It is set as a chorale fantasia. The soprano {{sings the}} [...] in long notes, on the melody of [...] "Von Gott will ich nicht lassen". Similar {{to the final}} chorale [...] of the Christmas Oratorio, the chorale tune in a church mode appears in the triumphant context of a {{different}} major key. The text expresses <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day of being united with Jesus in Heaven. The musicologist Julian Mincham interprets the mode of the tune as [...] "the human state of waiting and hoping", while the concerto represents the fulfillment. Mincham compares the writing to the opening chorale fantasias of the second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, finding the composition for the lower voices [...] "endlessly inventive, frequently related to the textual images" [...] pointing out [...] "the passionate and clinging representation of kissing the Saviour beneath the caressing flutes, in the penultimate phrase".|$|E
