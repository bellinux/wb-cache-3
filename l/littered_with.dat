40|$|Acacia {{is popular}} crop for Forestry Plantation. But Acacia litter needs {{a long period}} for decomposing. Deposit of acacia litter may fire the acacia area easily and also disturb the {{nutrient}} cycles. Rice straw is agriculture waste that is in big amount. The {{aim of the research}} is evaluation of some decomposers effect on the decomposition rate, microbial dynamic and compost characteristic of some organic matter. The researchwas arranged in Randomized Completely Design with two factors and two replications. The first factor was the organic matter and the second factor was the decomposer. They were rice straw or acacia litter without decomposer (A 0 /B 0), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> worm (A 1 /B 1), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> EM- 4 (A 2 /B 2), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> rumen (A 3 /B 3), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> chicken manure (A 4 /B 4), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> worm + rumen (A 5 /B 5), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> worm + chicken manure (A 6 /B 6), rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> EM 4 + chicken manure (A 7 /B 7), and rice straw or acacia <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> worm + EM 4 + chicken manure (A 8 /B 8).

40|$|ABSTRACT In broiler production, {{the litter}} is reused for consecutives flocks, {{and it is}} treated during down time between flocks to reduce its {{microbial}} load. Although covering the <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> a plastic canvas is a common litter treatment in the field, there is little scientific information available on its efficacy. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of covering broiler <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> a plastic canvas for eight days on litter microbiological, physical, and chemical parameters, and on the intestinal microbiota and immunity of broilers. In the first trial, reused litter from a previous flock was distributed into three treatments, with six replicates each: L 1 (negative control, litter free from Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Eimeria maxima (EM) and not covered), L 2 (positive control, <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> SE and EM, and not covered), and L 3 (<b>litter</b> <b>with</b> SE and EM, and covered with plastic canvas for eight days). Litter total bacteria, Enterobacteria, Lactobacillus, SE, and EM counts, and litter pH, temperature, moisture, and ammonia emission were determined on days 1 and 8. In the second trial, broilers were housed on those litters according to the treatments described above, and their intestinal microbiota, gut CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes and macrophages, and liver and intestinal pro-inflammatory interleukin (IFN-γ, IL- 1 β e IL- 18) levels were evaluated on days 14 and 28. A significant reduction of litter bacterial populations was observed in the <b>litter</b> covered <b>with</b> plastic canvas. A significantly higher mRNA IFN-γ gene expression (12. 5 -fold) was observed in the jejunum and liver of broilers reared on the <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> Enterobacteria counts. No EM reduction was observed in the covered litter. Covering reused broiler <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> plastic canvas reduces initial litter bacterial load as a result of the interaction between physical and chemical parameters...|$|R
40|$|It was {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} poultry litter treatment on moisture content, pH, density and volatilized ammonia for five consecutive flocks of broiler chicken breeding. It was used 640 birds per flock as a complete randomized design with eight treatments and four replicates. The treatments were the following: 1 non-treated litter; 2 litter submitted to in-house composting; 3 <b>litter</b> treated <b>with</b> aluminum sulfate; 4 litter submitted to gypsum; 5 <b>litter</b> treated <b>with</b> quicklime; 6 <b>litter</b> treated <b>with</b> dolomitic limestone; 7 <b>litter</b> treated <b>with</b> zeolite and 8 <b>litter</b> treated <b>with</b> charcoal. Chopped elephant-grass hay was used as poultry litter in all flocks. Fermentation in the shed increased moisture content of the litters {{in the second and}} first flocks on 21 and 42 days of breeding, respectively. There was no difference on density among treatments. Aluminum sulfate reduced pH of the litters in all flocks at 21 days of breding. On 42 days of breeding, pH of the litters was reduced in the <b>litters</b> <b>with</b> aluminum sulfate and gypsum in the first, second and forth flocks. On 21 days, aluminum sulfate reduced the volatilized ammonia in the first, third and forth flocks, and on 42 days, there was a reduction of volatilized ammonia in the <b>litters</b> <b>with</b> aluminum sulfate in the forth flock. Aluminum sulfate can improve quality of poultry litter of chopped elephant-grass hay by reducing pH and ammonia volatilization...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{was carried out}} at the DER/FCAV, São Paulo State University - Brazil, {{with the purpose of}} analyzing {{the quantity and quality of}} biogas produced by six types of substrates. The substrates used in the anaerobic digestion were characterized as: 1 - Litter of broiler (LB); 2 - Grinded broiler litter (GBL); 3 - Broiler <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> wood shavings (BLWS); 4 - Grinded broiler <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> wood shavings (GBLWS); 5 - Broiler <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> peanut hulls (BLPH); 6 - Grinded broiler <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> peanut hull (GBLPH). It was concluded from the collected data that: the (GBL) substrate showed a superior biogas accumulated production in relation to the other substrates, while the BLWS presented an inferior accumulated production; the grinded substrates showed higher quantities of accumulated biogas in relation to the non-grinded substrates, except for GBLPH, with 20. 9 m³ inferior than BLPH; the period of maximum biogas production started from 45 to 60 days, declining after 120 days; at 57 days after filling up the digesters the biogas produced had levels of CH 4 superior than 53 %, and from 99 days all of them produced biogas with levels of CH 4 superior than 70 %; LB and GBL presented higher concentrations of CH 4 in the biogas...|$|R

40|$|In a first experiment, {{performances}} and carcass quality of fattening pigs kept either on a <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> sawdust, on straw or on slatted floor were compared. Three batches of 17 pigs were kept on each floor type. Pens <b>with</b> <b>litter</b> were not cleaned {{until the end}} of the third fattening period. On average 100 kg of sawdust or 49 kg of straw were used per pig. The growth rate of pigs on litters was higher (P < 0, 01) than that of pigs on slatted floor : 739 g/d on sawdust, 745 g/d on straw and 686 g/d on slatted floor. Carcass quality at slaughter was not different according to the floor type. The peak shear force of the M. Longissimus dorsi was higher for pigs kept on straw than for the 2 other groups. In a second experiment, 97 weaners, 4 weeks old, were divided in 3 groups on 3 floor types : a deep <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> sawdust, a deep <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> sawdust mixed with straw and a slatted floor. Between 4 and 10 weeks of age, the growth rates of pigs were different (P < 0, 05) according to the 2 litters : 438 g/d on the deep <b>litter</b> <b>with</b> straw and sawdust, 397 g/d on sawdust and higher (P < 0, 001) than that on slatted floor (273 g/d).

They knocked out Stjarnan from Iceland and Qarabağ from Azerbaijan in the early qualifying rounds, but lost 4–3 on aggregate to Swedish side Malmö FF in the final play-off round. This meant for the second successive season, Celtic dropped into the Europa League. Celtic's Europa League campaign was poor and <b>littered</b> <b>with</b> individual errors which contributed to dropped points in every match. Celtic failed to qualify after finishing bottom of their group, and was the first time Celtic went through a group stage of a European competition without recording a single victory.|$|E
5|$|Despite the misgivings of the expedition's commanders, {{the fleet}} left Brest as {{scheduled}} on 15 December 1796, one day {{ahead of a}} message from the Directory calling off the entire operation. De Galles knew that the British would be watching Brest harbour: their frigates were a constant presence as part of the Inshore Squadron of the blockade. In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz was a dangerous narrow channel <b>littered</b> <b>with</b> rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also obscure the size, strength and direction of the French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E

However, amid the confusion the exact dispositions of the companies remained unclear {{for the remainder of}} the night. Australian losses were 12 killed and 64 wounded, the same number as those suffered during their entire advance into North Korea. A number of officers of the battalion were later critical of the decision to withdraw while still engaged, believing that it had been both dangerous and unnecessary, while the lack of detailed planning, reconnaissance and orders were also seen as a factor in the disorganisation that ensued. While A Company had immediately withdrawn as ordered and had suffered a number of casualties in doing so, both B and D Companies, which were commanded by experienced veterans of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, had delayed doing so until more favourable circumstances prevailed and fared better as a consequence. Yet the following morning a patrol from D Company cleared the abandoned A and B Company positions unopposed. The area was found <b>littered</b> <b>with</b> Chinese dead and equipment. Among the casualties were both Chinese and North Koreans, and it became clear that the Australians had been attacked by a mixed force, estimated at around 1,500 men.

In a tense final against {{defending}} champion Mark Selby, neither player {{was able to}} obtain a sizeable lead, with frames <b>littered</b> <b>with</b> both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3–1, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4–4, and took the first frame of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 frames to lead 7–5. O'Sullivan responded by taking three frames in succession himself, to lead 8–7. The following two frames were shared, and at 9–8, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating Mark Selby 10–8 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this he became only the second player, after Stephen Hendry, to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan proclaimed his victory, composed with a cue that he had obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker. During an exhibition in Ireland in January 2009, O'Sullivan and Jimmy White made maximum breaks in consecutive frames. In {{the first round of}} the 2009 World Championship O'Sullivan compiled three centuries in his 10–5 win against Stuart Bingham.

5|$|Records {{indicate}} that the alignment of PA371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in1791 through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties. In1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March29,1804. Construction through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties commenced in1806, with completion of the roadway coming in1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto the cut in Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original CochectonDamascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821), {{the area around the}} bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA371 eventually became <b>littered</b> <b>with</b> a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in1853. Although the roadway itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation that was supposed to maintain the roadway remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, the roadway remained the only physical route in the area until at least the1890s.|$|E
