50|$|Roll-on and {{roll-off}} skips {{are similar}} to open skips, but instead of being lifted onto a skip <b>loader</b> <b>wagon</b> by chains, they are rolled on to a wagon with a hook. They are more common as industrial containers and are not suitable for domestic uses.|$|E
50|$|A {{hay rake}} is an {{agricultural}} rake {{used to collect}} cut hay or straw into windrows for later collection (e.g. by a baler or a <b>loader</b> <b>wagon).</b> It is also designed to fluff up the hay and turn it over so that it may dry. It is also used in the evening to protect the hay from morning dew. The next day a tedder is used to spread it again, so that the hay dries more quickly.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to evaluate two forage wagons - Pöttinger Jumbo 6600 and KRONE Titan 6 / 48 GL and to show their efficiency in the harvesting fodder and straw {{in the company of}} primary agricultural production. It evaluates the problem in terms of actual and theoretical chop length. It determines the basic efficiency and indicators of exploitation of <b>loader</b> <b>wagons</b> during harvest. It discusses the analysis of investment and operating costs. The solution methodology was based on his own observations and measurement, information obtained from owners, specialized literature and agricultural standards...|$|R
50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Löffler, what {{is now known as}} Fella-Werke GmbH began as a harrow production company. It did not take long before Fella started acquiring other companies, however. In 1923, Fella acquired a <b>loader</b> <b>wagon</b> company and in 1924 they added the production of ploughs to their line. In 1931, Fella took over Epple & Buxmann in Augsburg. This was a crucial step in their harvesting technology. In that acquisition, Fella began their first production of mowers, tedders and rakes mainly for grain production.|$|E
50|$|Meshram {{was born}} in a poor dalit family in Akola. He spent his teens and early {{adulthood}} working as a railway <b>wagon</b> <b>loader,</b> a construction worker, and an oil mill worker. While struggling to make a living, he continued his education. After graduation from college, he joined Western Railways as a clerk, but later secured the position of a Marathi lecturer at Maharshi Dayanand College in Parel area of Mumbai.|$|R
40|$|The bale {{collecting}} problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations in grain and other crops. Its solution defines {{the sequence of}} collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation-aid systems or auto-steering for agricultural vehicles and machines, is able to provide accurate data to make a reliable {{bale collecting}} planning. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approach to address the BCP pursuing resource optimization such as minimizing non-productive time, fuel consumption, or distance travelled. The algorithmic route generation provides {{the basis for a}} navigation tool dedicated to <b>loaders</b> and bale <b>wagons.</b> The approach is experimentally tested on a set of instances similar to those found in real situations. In particular, comparative results show an average improving of a 16 % from those obtained by previous heuristics...|$|R
