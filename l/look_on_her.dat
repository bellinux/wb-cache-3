500|$|Nancy is {{frequently}} portrayed pursuing a suspect, examining a clue, or observing action. She is often also shown in peril: being chased, falling off a boat, or hanging by a rope from rafters. These covers are [...] "characterized by frenetic energy on Nancy's part; whether she is falling, limbs flailing, an alarmed <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, or whether she is running, hair flying, body bent, face breathless. Nancy {{does not have}} any control over the events that are happening in these covers. She is shown to be a victim, being hunted and attacked by unseen foes." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlotte and {{her family}} were well {{travelled}} and sojourned to cultural and historical landmarks on the continent. While details on Fermor and her sisters' education are minimal, mention of them in contemporary diaries implies they were well-educated. She and Lady Pomfret were well-read and interested in theology; Charlotte's friends included the educated Elizabeth Carter. Charlotte was fluent enough in Italian for Horace Walpole to remark in 1740, she [...] "speaks the purest Tuscan, like any Florentine" [...] and [...] "the Florentines <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> as the brightest foreigner that has honoured their [...]" [...] According to Walpole, Lord Granville, who had been briefly married to Charlotte's sister Sophia, was [...] "extremely fond" [...] of Charlotte; after Sophia's death in 1745, Granville gave his deceased wife's jewels to Charlotte, [...] "to the great discontent of his own daughters".|$|E

500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would I have given {{my life for}} his". Princess Mary wrote to Queen Victoria of the Princess of Wales, [...] "the despairing <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face was the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen." [...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, {{it is too late}} now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Cher {{collaborated with}} several musicians {{including}} Stargate, Chicane and previous collaborator Mark Taylor. She {{said she felt}} lucky for having {{a chance to have}} [...] "great songs and great producers" [...] for the album. Cher said her favorite song slated for the album was a cover version of [...] "When the Money's Gone", written by Bruce Roberts, stating it was [...] "so perfect" [...] for her. [...] "It's about this person who's , 'If I lose all my money, will you still love me if we have to eat fast food out of a beat up car?'. It's so dance. It's so gay. It's so good", she said. The album cover, photographed by Michael Lavine, was revealed through Cher official website on October 8, 2001. It depicts Cher wearing a [...] "flowing" [...] blond wig in contrast to her all-black, medieval-like outfit. The Dallas Morning News commented that [...] "even with a pensive <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> exquisitely snipped and tucked face, she commands attention".|$|E
500|$|Moore {{considered}} disinheriting his daughter, {{writing that}} [...] "Russell's conduct towards me {{continues to be}} cold and heartless ... and I must <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> as not deserving to inherit from me". Sophia Peacock, a sister of his wife, was closely involved in Russell's up-bringing and Moore developed romantic feelings for her; in 1858, he changed his will to give her his property instead of Russell, but Sophia rejected his marriage proposal and he disinherited her the following year. Despite Moore's [...] "vehement objections", his daughter married George Edward Corrance in 1860. After a year she eloped with Colonel Edward William de Lancy Lowe; they married in 1866, after Corrance divorced her on grounds of adultery. Her father [...] "had always reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct" [...] and, three months before his death, he made a new will and bequeathed all of his property to Peacock. After Moore's death, Russell Lowe and her paternal uncle, Rev. Edward Moore opened a court case to contest the will. In March 1868, the courts found that the will was legal. Sophia Peacock inherited nearly all of Moore's estate.|$|E

500|$|She also sang [...] "Listen" [...] {{during the}} finals on December 21, 2011. A writer of Fox News Channel {{commented that the}} judges [...] "didn't want to stop {{listening}} to Melanie Amaro" [...] while she was singing a [...] "soaring rendition" [...] of the ballad. Simon Cowell said, [...] "I brought this show to America because I believe {{some of the greatest}} singers in the world are from this country, and you just proved that. I think you, based on that performance tonight, to me, should be the winner of 'The X Factor,' because you're going to represent this country all over the world." [...] L.A. Reid also commented, [...] "That wasn't a $5 million performance. That was a $50 million performance." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine felt that her performance was [...] "as powerfully and passionately [...] as she did the first time". Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised Amaro's rendition, writing that it contained a [...] "determined <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, lots of generous spreading of the arms, and plenty of big notes". Amaro eventually emerged as the winner of The X Factor, performing this song for the final time.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of her senior year, Quinn has {{completely}} reinvented herself and refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions, although when New Directions performs [...] "You Can't Stop The Beat" [...] in the auditorium Quinn can be seen watching them with a conflicted <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. Shelby lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. After seeing {{a picture of a}} happy Beth and Puck, Quinn resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club, but Quinn reveals to Puck she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody. After Puck tells Shelby of Quinn's true intentions, Shelby informs Quinn that she does not want her in Beth's life. Quinn later reveals a desire to have a second baby with Puck. Puck refuses, and tries to comfort her; he offers to share an important secret if she promises not to tell anyone, which ultimately results in Quinn planning to get Shelby fired for sleeping with a student, Puck. Quinn decides not to reveal Shelby's secret for Beth's sake.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 2008, Fator {{appeared}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show along with American Idol Judge Simon Cowell. To the amazement of Oprah, Cowell referred to Fator {{as one of}} the [...] "two most talented people on the planet." [...] Fator performed with three of his dummies; country singer Walter T. Airedale performed a Garth Brooks song and Winston the impersonating Turtle sang a Bee Gees song. Julius performed a Marvin Gaye song; Julius was a favorite when he {{appeared on}} The Oprah Winfrey Show. [...] "As soon as I brought out Julius, she had this <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, wondering what I was about to do," [...] Fator said. [...] "Once I started into Marvin Gaye, she fell out of her chair." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Alive" [...] {{has been}} {{revealed}} by Vedder {{to be part}} autobiographical and part fiction. When Vedder was a teenager, his mother revealed {{to him that the}} man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was dead. The first and last verses detail those actual events, but the second verse is storytelling on Vedder's part. The lyrics of the second verse read, [...] "Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room/She said I'm ready...for you/I can't remember anything to this very day/'Cept the look, the look.../Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...," [...] and Vedder revealed that [...] "she" [...] was the mother, and [...] "the look" [...] referred to was not the <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, but [...] "the look is between her legs. Where do you go with that? That's where you came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|A detective {{from the}} Sheriff's Juvenile Aid Bureau, among others, {{was summoned to}} {{interview}} Brawley, but she remained unresponsive. The family requested a black officer, which the police department was able to provide. Brawley, described as having an [...] "extremely spacey" [...] <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, communicated with this officer with nods of the head, shrugs of the shoulder, and written notes. The interview lasted 20 minutes, during which she uttered only one word: [...] "neon". Through gestures and writing, however, she indicated she had been raped repeatedly in a wooded area by three white men, {{at least one of}} whom, she claimed, was a police officer. A sexual assault kit was administered, and police began building a case. Brawley provided no names or descriptions of her assailants. She later told others that there had been no rape, only other kinds of sexual abuse. Forensic tests found no evidence that a sexual assault of any kind had occurred. There was no evidence of exposure to elements, which would have been expected in a victim held for several days in the woods {{at a time when the}} temperature dropped below freezing at night.|$|E
2500|$|Her last {{release of}} the year was Yash Chopra's thriller Darr, {{alongside}} Shah Rukh Khan and Sunny Deol. The film {{went on to become a}} blockbuster upon its release and was one of the highest grossing films of the year, making it Chawla's fourth consecutive box office hit of the year. Darr was also a major critical success, winning several awards including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Her performance as Kiran, a girl caught between one man's love and other man's obsession was widely appreciated and to date remains one of her most memorable performances. A critic wrote [...] "In Darr she gets to display all her talent, be it the frightened <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face on seeing Rahul, be it the twinkle in the eyes during the song Tu hai meri Kiran or the comic chemistry with Anupam Kher, it is one of her best performances." [...] Rediff stated [...] "Sensuous, seductive, gorgeous, cute, vulnerable -Juhi looked every bit of a dream girl her Kiran needed to be." [...] Chawla's curly hair and off shoulder dress became the trademark in the 90s with her blockbuster Darr. All these successes made her the most successful actress of the year.|$|E

2500|$|Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} {{concluded that}} [...] "the secretly devastating video" [...] for [...] "Someone like You" [...] will remind Adele's ex-lover {{what he has}} done by leaving her. A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video. Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an [...] "uncomplicated, moving film" [...] and wrote, [...] "the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its grey skies, singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more." [...] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was [...] "simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, [...] "speak for itself" [...] about the sadness in the video. Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, [...] "the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. The <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on March 30, 2010, in Beverly Hills, California, and was {{directed}} by Ray Kay, director of Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] video. On the topic of choosing the lead girl, Kingston told MTV News, [...] "I picked the main girl, basically, because Justin is 16 and I'm 20 years old, so {{it had to be}} a girl that fit the both of us, because in the video and song, she's trying to play the both of us. So there had to be a contrast. She fit it perfectly." [...] Additionally, Kingston explained the plot of the video to Rap-Up, commenting, [...] "The video is basically about this girl trying to play both of us and at the end... we end up both at the same place at one time, and she's left with a stupid <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face." [...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside. But, wait â€” there she is flirting with Bieber while Kingston is hanging out, wondering where she went. The fickle girl eventually leaves Bieber to chill with Kingston, and then â€” boom â€” there she is with Bieber again. And, well, you get it. Of course, the 'eenie-meenie-miny-moe lover' eventually gets caught. While she's chatting up Kingston, along comes Bieber, and her game is blown. The dudes are cool with it. Well, they're not cool with her playing them, but they seem to remain friends despite both going for the same girl." ...|$|E

David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined {{to find out what}} went on in Camelot, saying {{that the only way to}} help her is to find out what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks whatâ€™s going on inside Emmaâ€™s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes the <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face â€“ regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he canâ€™t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him.
