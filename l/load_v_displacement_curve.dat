The decks may also be used for other purposes than bridge decks. Load-carrying capacities of these decks are very high and friction alone carries load between individual members. Friction is achieved by using prestressed steel rods through the decks that give normal compressive forces between members, see Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Left: bridge deck in laboratory test situation. Right: FE modelThe <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>curve</b> for a transversally loaded deck is normally nonlinear even for low load values but especially for high loads due to partial slip between members. FE simulations and laboratory tests for behaviour have been made earlier, see [1], [2], [3]. Two different approaches for FE-simulations have been used, one with an elastic-plastic material model without discrete member modeling and another with discrete member modeling and contact surfaces between members. In the presentation a summary of earlier results are shown and also some recent results due to additional features in the FE models. The additions are possibilities too simulate gaps between members for the elastic-plastic model and results from butt-end modeling with the contact model.

Preliminary evaluation referred to the tensile response of Glare shows that an overestimation of the ultimate loads is obtained even when the plasticity of the light alloy layers is included.

Consistent evolution laws for the involved internal variables are derived based on the augmented Lagrangian method. The (time) discrete formulation and the corresponding variational structure are investigated, with the Euler–Lagrangian equations defining the closest-point projection approximation of the proposed model. The numerical aspects, such as the stress updating algorithm and the algorithmic consistent tangent moduli, are also discussed in details. It is found that in the developed numerical algorithm the active loading surfaces are determined in such a posterior manner that potential numerical problems due to the iteratively updating procedure in classical algorithms can be avoided. The proposed model {{is applied to the}} modeling of tensile cracking in concrete. The behavior of a single crack is characterized by an elliptical cracking surface and a hyperbolic softening function, with the orientations of potential cracks determined by Mohr’s postulate.

Under ballistic impact, the kinetic energy of the projectile is absorbed by the fabrics deforming largely in the out-of- plane direction, which retards the motion of the projectile. Interfacial friction between yarns is {{known as one of the}} factors that affect the energy absorption by the fabric. ^ To investigate the frictional behavior between yarns in a quantitative and qualitative manner, yarn pull-out experiments have been performed by many researchers. However, available experimental studies were limited to quasi-static, which may not represent the frictional behavior under dynamic loading. Considering that applications for woven fabric materials are under the condition of dynamic loading in many cases, the importance of yarn pull-out experiments at higher rates are evidently great to obtain more realistic results. ^ In this study, we experimentally investigated the mechanical response during the pull out of a single yarn from a single layer of Kevlar ® and Twaron® fabric under out-of plane loading at high rates. In order to perform the dynamic experiments, a system of pendulum impact was designed to pull out the single yarn. The pull-out load was measured directly at the yarn and the movement of the fabric was measured to portrait pull-out <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>curves.</b> Quasi-static experiments were performed as well to delineate the effects of loading rate.

Finite element analyses (FEA) of the small punch tests have been performed for the 304 H stainless steel in this study. 304 H stainless steel was isothermally aged at 650, 700 and 750 o C for durations up to 200 hours. Small punch tests were performed to assess the mechanical properties of the heat treated materials. Using the input of the true stress-strain curves of material constitutive behaviour, the theoretical <b>load</b> <b>vs</b> punch <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> calculated from the FEA models were found in good agreement with the experimental results. The fracture thickness of the small punch tested specimens and the equivalent fracture strain were also be determined for the test materials...|$|R
40|$|Double-torsion {{tests were}} carried out to {{ascertain}} whether a thin test specimen would affect {{the results of this}} test. The tests involved two test specimen sizes, one with a thickness five-fold greater than the particle size of the material and the other with a three-fold greater thickness. The width of both test specimens was ten times that of their thickness and their length was double their width. The material utilized was an alumina-based refractory castable without cement. It is important to ascertain the influence of the thickness of double-torsion test specimens when materials with a coarse microstructure are involved. Otherwise, test specimens would have to be very large, rendering the experimental procedure difficult, {{as in the case of}} the size of sintering furnaces and the size of accessories for the test. This study shows that test specimens with lower thicknesses are representative when one analyzes the calibration curve of the compliance, the length of the crack at which the break occurred (critical crack length), and the shapes of the R-curve and of the <b>load</b> (P) <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>curves.</b> However, the analysis of the mean values of R (R), obtained by the arithmetic average of the R values in the section of stable crack propagation and the total fracture energy (&# 947;wof), showed that these values are dependent on the size of the test specimens, indicating that this subject deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} thesis analyze mechanical {{phenomena in}} fibrous composites with fiber bundle sub-structure (woven composite sheet molding compounds (SMC) etc.). This sub-structure defines an intermediate meso-scale between {{the scale of}} individual fibers and macro-scale of the composite. The thesis consists of six papers dedicated to different mechanical aspects. Paper 1 contains an analysis of two analytical models for elastic properties of woven fabric composites. Predictions of these models are compared with results obtained using the method of reiterated homogenization and with experimental data for plain weave glass fiber- and carbon fiber polyester composites. Three different scales are identified in the analysis. It is shown that fiber bundle scale predictions are the most critical and the uncertainty there causes large differences in predictions. In Paper 2 the morphology of the ceramics C/PyC/SiC woven composite is studied and micro-damage mechanisms are revealed. Micromechanical fracture mechanics based models are proposed to describe the possible damage mechanisms. The significance of observed microdamage mechanisms for stiffness reduction is studied. The PyC core damage is suggested as the energy dissipation process. In contrast to most micromechanical models for stiffness prediction of woven composites, that assumes independence of the $Q$-matrix {{on the number of}} fabric layers in the composite, Paper 3 shows that it may not be true in some cases of woven composites. This paper contains experimental and theoretical investigations of plain weave carbon fiber/polyester composites with one single and eight layers of fabrics. The theoretical part of the paper consists of several micromechanical models which explain the main mechanisms. The last three papers: Paper 4 - Paper 6 are dedicated to the cohesive zone phenomenon which {{plays an important role in}} fracture of short fiber composites with fiber bundle structure. Paper 4 describes the finite element modeling (FEM) results of center-hole notched tensile specimens with different bridging-laws governing crack growth. Crack lengths, crack profiles and stress distributions are predicted. The results are compared with experimentally determined crack shapes from an earlier investigations. Only with softening bridging-laws, the experimental results can be matched. In Paper 5, fracture of SMC materials two double edge notched tensile (DENT) specimens with considerable difference in fracture characteristics is studied. Linear- and non-linear FEM were used to extract the true crack opening from measured displacements over the cracked region. The bridging laws of the two SMCs were estimated and the main physical mechanisms governing the fracture were recognized. Experimentally obtained <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> in compact tension tests (CT) of two different SMC materials are analyzed in Paper 6. Three different CT specimen geometries are considered. Progressive fracture is attained in all tests. By implementing bridging laws from Paper 5 and volumetric stiffness degradation of bulk SMC in an FEM model, the experimental results for two larger geometries were reproduced with high accuracy. Premature material degradation on the compressive side of the CT specimen precrack, was analyzed. The successful use of bridging laws strongly suggests that they are indiced intrinsic properties, governing the fracture behavior of SMC materials. Godkänd; 2002; 20061113 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work considers how {{to properly}} characterize fracture properties of short fiber composites (SFC). Associated with fracture of SFC {{is the creation}} of a comparably widespread fracture process zone. This zone develops since a number of inelastic failure mechanisms (e. g. debonding, microcracking, fiber failure and fiber pull-out) take place in the vicinity of an advancing crack. In the present approach, a bridging law (or cohesive zone law) approach is adopted in order to characterize the fracture toughness of the material. Conventional fracture toughness measures, such as KIC were in most cases found not to be applicable. This was because fundamental small-scale yielding geometry requirements could not be fulfilled in experiments. The bridging law approach captures previously mentioned mechanisms in terms of a closure stress (bridging stress). This stress acts between two fictitious crack planes. The relation between crack opening displacement and bridging stress is governed by the bridging law. Parts of the presented work consider determination of bridging laws from experiments (Paper I and Paper III). Different experimental configurations, double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens loaded with pure moments and double edge notched tension (DENT) specimens, were used in the two studies. A main conclusion from Paper I is that the large differences in fracture characteristics between two sheet molding compound (SMC) composites could be explained on the basis of bridging laws and their influence on fracture energy. Similar observations were made in Paper III. In Paper III, it also was evident that the intrinsic non-linearity of bulk SMC material has to be considered separately in the data reduction of experimental results, in order to capture the bridging law. Bilinear approximations of decreasing bridging laws were obtained as a result from the study. A closer investigation on the mechanical behavior of SMC with varied composition was performed in Paper II. Various mechanical tests, including tension, compression, in situ studies, DCB and stiffness degradation measurements through quasi-static cyclic loading-unloading experiments, were employed. The purpose was to characterize and understand observed differences between conventional and toughened SMC with low density additives. The applicability of the proposed bridging law approach is confirmed by the work presented in Paper IV and Paper V. In these papers, the previously measured (Paper I and Paper III) bridging relations are used as a constitutive property in predictions of structural behavior of specimens with varied geometry. Paper IV considers that bridging law parameters can be used to predict and explain the change in notch-sensitivity observed on SMC DENT-specimens with varied geometry. A comparably simple analytical route (neglecting non-linear bulk behavior and shape of bridging law) is employed with satisfactory results. In Paper V, the use of the finite element method (FEM) in conjunction with measured bilinear bridging laws, allows reconstruction of experimentally measured compact tension (CT) specimen <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>curves</b> with good accuracy. Three different CT specimen geometries are considered. Modeling and experimental results from Paper V also shows that compression failure often is of equal importance as tensile, in real structures and loading conditions.
