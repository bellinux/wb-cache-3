25|$|The plane {{perpendicular}} to the axis of angular momentum and passing {{through the center of}} mass is sometimes called the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane,</b> because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system, free from outside influences, are considered.

25|$|In 1799, Pierre-Simon Laplace first {{realized}} that a fixed plane was associated with rotation — his <b>invariable</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A herpolhode is {{the curve}} traced {{out by the}} {{endpoint}} of the angular velocity vector ω of a rigid rotor, a rotating rigid body. The endpoint of the angular velocity moves in a plane in absolute space, called the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane,</b> that is orthogonal to the angular momentum vector L.

5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane,</b> and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|R
5000|$|The International Astronomical Union (IAU) {{defines the}} {{geographic}} north pole {{of a planet}} or any of its satellites in the Solar System as the planetary pole {{that is in the}} same celestial hemisphere relative to the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> of the Solar System as Earth's North pole. This definition means that an object's direction of rotation may be negative (retrograde rotation) — in other words, it rotates clockwise when viewed from above its north pole, rather than the [...] "normal" [...] counterclockwise direction exhibited by Earth's north pole. Venus rotates in the opposite direction to the other planets, and Uranus has been knocked on its side and rotates almost perpendicular {{to the rest of the}} Solar System. The ecliptic remains within 3° of the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> over five million years, but is now inclined about 23.44° to Earth's celestial equator used for the coordinates of poles. This large inclination means that the declination of a pole relative to Earth's celestial equator could be negative even though a planet's north pole (such as Uranus) is north of the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hence, {{the normal}} vector to the kinetic-energy {{ellipsoid}} at [...] {{is proportional to}} , which is also true of the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane.</b> Since their normal vectors point in the same direction, these two surfaces will intersect tangentially.|$|R
5000|$|The Laplace or Laplacean plane, as {{discussed}} here, {{relates to the}} orbit of a planetary satellite.

The <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta, and is [...] "invariable" [...] over the entire system, while the Laplace plane may be different for different orbiting objects within a system.

5000|$|The {{trajectory}} of the angular velocity around the angular momentum in the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> is a circle {{in the case of}} a symmetric top, but in the general case wiggles inside an annulus, while still being concave towards the angular momentum.|$|R
5000|$|This {{plane is}} {{sometimes}} called the [...] "Laplacian" [...] or [...] "Laplace plane" [...] or the [...] "invariable plane of Laplace", though {{it should not be}} confused with the Laplace plane, which is the plane about which orbital planes precess. [...] Both derive from the work of (and are at least sometimes named for) the French astronomer Pierre Simon Laplace. [...] The two are equivalent only in the case where all perturbers and resonances are far from the precessing body. The <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta, and is [...] "invariable" [...] over the entire system, while the Laplace plane may be different for different orbiting objects within a system. Laplace called the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> the plane of maximum areas, where the area is the product of the radius and its differential time change dR/dt, that is, its velocity, multiplied by the mass.|$|R
50|$|The Northern Hemisphere is {{the half}} of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as {{being in the same}} {{celestial}} hemisphere relative to the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> of the solar system as Earth's North pole.|$|R
5000|$|Taken together, {{these results}} show that, in an {{absolute}} reference frame, the instantaneous angular velocity vector [...] {{is the point}} of intersection between a fixed <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> and a kinetic-energy ellipsoid that is tangent to it and rolls around on it without slipping.

40|$|We {{present a}} robust method for {{measuring}} the effective plane of the Kuiper belt. The derived plane has an inclination {{with respect to the}} ecliptic of 1 º. 86 and an ascending node of 81 º. 6, with a 1 σ error in pole position of the plane of 0 º. 37. The plane of the Kuiper belt is inconsistent with the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane,</b> the plane of Jupiter, and the plane of Neptune at the greater than 3 σ level. Using linear secular perturbation theory, we show that the plane of the Kuiper belt is expected to oscillate about the position of the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> with a period of 1. 9 million years and an amplitude of 1 º. 2. The present predicted position of the plane of the Kuiper belt has an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 1 º. 74 and an ascending node of 86 º. 7, within 0 º. 20 of our measured position...|$|R
5000|$|These two {{constraints}} {{operate in}} different reference frames; the ellipsoidal constraint holds in the (rotating) principal axis frame, whereas the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> constant operates in absolute space.

5000|$|In 2009 the {{responsible}} IAU Working Group decided {{to define the}} poles of dwarf planets, minor planets, their satellites, and comets according to the right-hand rule. To avoid confusion with the [...] "north" [...] and [...] "south" [...] definitions relative to the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane,</b> the poles are called [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "negative." [...] The positive pole is the pole toward which the thumb points when the fingers of the right hand are curled in its direction of rotation. The negative pole is the pole toward which the thumb points when the fingers of the left hand are curled in it direction of rotation. This change was needed because the poles of some asteroids and comets precess rapidly enough for their north and south poles to swap within a few decades using the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> definition.|$|R
25|$|There are two {{standard}} {{methods of}} specifying tilt. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines {{the north pole}} of a planet as that which lies on Earth's {{north side of the}} <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> of the Solar System; under this system, Venus is tilted 3° and spins retrograde, opposite that of most of the other planets.|$|R
25|$|However, when {{measured}} {{independently of}} Earth's orbit, but {{relative to the}} <b>invariable</b> <b>plane</b> (the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System, approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter), precession has {{a period of about}} 100,000 years.

40|$|By numerically {{integrating}} {{the orbits of}} the giant planets and of test particles {{over a period of}} four billion years, we follow the evolution of the location of the midplane of the Kuiper belt. The Classical Kuiper belt conforms to a warped sheet that precesses with a 1. 9 Myr period. The present-day location of the Kuiper belt plane can be computed using linear secular perturbation theory: the local normal to the plane is given by the theory’s forced inclination vector, which is specific to every semi-major axis. The Kuiper belt plane does not coincide with the <b>invariable</b> <b>plane,</b> but deviates from it by up to a few degrees in stable zones. For example, at a semimajor axis of 38 AU, the local Kuiper belt plane has an inclination of 1. 9 degrees and a longitude of ascending node of 149. 9 degrees when referred to the mean ecliptic and equinox of J 2000. At a semimajor axis of 43 AU, the local plane has an inclination of 1. 9 degrees and a nodal longitude of 78. 3 degrees.
