40|$|In data grids {{scientific}} and business applications produce huge {{volume of data}} which needs to be transferred among the distributed and heterogeneous nodes of data grids. Data replication provides a solution for managing data files efficiently in large grids. The data replication helps in enhancing the data availability which reduces the overall access time of the file. In this paper an algorithm, namely, EDRA using agents for data grid, has been proposed and implemented. EDRA consists of dynamic replication of hierarchical structure taken into account for the selection of best replica. Decision for selecting the best replica is based on scheduling parameters. The scheduling parameters are bandwidth, <b>load</b> <b>gauge,</b> and computing capacity of the node. The scheduling in data grid helps in reducing the data access time. The distribution of the load on the nodes of data grid is done evenly by considering scheduling parameters. EDRA is implemented using data grid simulator, namely, OptorSim. European Data Grid CMS test bed topology is used in this experiment. The simulation results are obtained by comparing BHR, LRU, No Replication, and EDRA. The result shows the efficiency of EDRA algorithm in terms of mean job execution time, network usage, and storage usage of node...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] TCP Westwood (TCPW) {{has been}} shown to provide {{significant}} performance improvement over high-speed heterogeneous networks. The key idea of TCPW is to use Eligible Rate Estimation (ERE) methods to set the congestion window (cwnd) and slow start threshold (ssthresh) after a packet loss. ERE is defined as the transmission rate a sender ought to use to achieve high utilization and remain friendly to other TCP variants. This paper presents TCP Westwood with Agile Probing (TCPW-A), a sender-side only enhancement of TCPW. TCPW-A perform well when faced with highly dynamic bandwidth, large propagation time/bandwidth, and random loss in the current and future heterogeneous Internet. TCPW-A achieves its goal by incorporating the following two mechanisms: 1) When a connection initially begins or re-starts after a Timeout, instead of exponentially expanding cwnd to an arbitrary preset ssthresh and then going into linear increase, TCPW-A uses Agile Probing, a mechanism that repeatedly resets ssthresh based on ERE and forces cwnd into an exponential climb each time. The result is fast convergence to a more appropriate ssthresh value. 2) In Congestion Avoidance, TCPW-A invokes Agile Probing upon indication of unused extra bandwidth via a scheme we call <b>Load</b> <b>Gauge</b> (LG). Experimental results, both in Ns- 2, and in measurements using FreeBSD implementation, show that TCPW-A can significantly improve link utilization over a wide range of bandwidth, propagation delay and dynamic network loading.

40|$|Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) technologies that are being used for the production of end-use components due to the technologies ability for short production runs and as a method for producing geometrically complex parts. As it is a polymeric process, FDM in general is more flexible and can easily accommodate without significant expense, changes to a products design during the product development cycle (known as rapid prototyping) prior to fabricating end-use functional parts (known as rapid manufacturing (RM)). However, the quality and functional performance of FDM parts is dependent on a number of process parameters including layer thickness, build orientation, etc. Taking all of this into account, these parameters have to be optimised in order to obtain the ideal part, for fit and function testing as well as an end-use product. This paper seeks to depict the optimisation of the FDM process for optimum performance of ABS plastic parts in terms of tensile and shear effects, where the parameter of build orientation is observed. This research uses load bearing exhibition board mounting clips as the case study product. Series of experiments were conducted to attain the maximum load value of clips fabricated via FDM manufactured in different orientations. The orientations are in the y-axis with constraints in x and z-axis with the direction from y = 0 º to y = 180 º in increments of 10 º. The experimental setup for the physical study used a Kern Ch 15 K 20 <b>load</b> <b>gauge</b> to measure the load on the clips for each orientation. From the results, it is found that the build orientation significantly affects the strength performance of FDM parts. This contributes to further research into the development of RM design rules, specifically in design analysis and optimisation for validation of AM as a viable route for producing functional parts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Townsville’s former General Hospital site is {{undergoing}} a major redevelopment that includes the construction of twelve elevated, level residential allotments with commanding views across Cleveland Bay towards Magnetic Island. To achieve the above development objectives, a large quantity of fill is required and most importantly {{will need to be}} retained to construct the allotments. Numerous methods of retainment were investigated and the reinforced earth option was discovered to be the most feasible. A recycled concrete fill material, crushed to 100 mm minus, was proposed {{to be used in the}} reinforced earth structure. This material was a result of the demolition of numerous buildings from within the site. External advice suggested that the 100 mm minus material would not integrate sufficiently with the reinforcement (Tensar Geogrid) and would need to be crushed further to a 75 mm minus material. This would help to provide enough resistance to achieve the correct pullout characteristics of the reinforcement. The objective is to create a testing apparatus that makes it possible to test the interaction of the Tensar Geogrid reinforcement with the various gradings of crushed recycled concrete material. These tests can then be analysed to confirm interaction calculations and the design of the reinforced earth structure. A plywood box is constructed to allow the compaction of various grades of crushed concrete within. A similar grade of Tensar grid is used for each test and located centrally within the material. The reinforcement material extrudes from the box allowing a force to be applied. A <b>load</b> <b>gauge</b> records the pullout force applied to pull the Tensar grid from the apparatus. The results from the individual tests undertaken are analysed against calculations made for the various types of material. The results are then compared against each other to indicate the ability of interaction and performance under load. Preliminary analysis indicates that failure strength is similar for all tests undertaken, however the rate of failure gives a good indication of the interaction characteristics of the materials...|$|E

30|$|California Bearing Ratio (CBR) {{tests were}} carried out on soil samples soaked for 24  h. Preliminary CBR values {{indicated}} the need to introduce additives to the soil to increase strength. Trial mixes were made with different percentages of cement from 1 to 7  % by weight mixed with the soil samples. These CBR tests {{were carried out}} {{in accordance with the}} AASHTO T  193 - 10 (2010) Standards. The Modified AASHTO test, which is the standard adopted for road and highway works locally, was adopted for the study. In preparing the samples for testing, dry ordinary Portland cement was manually but thoroughly mixed with dry soil samples, a measured amount of water that will bring the soil to the Optimum Moisture Content for each of the soil under study the optimum moisture, is added to the soil, while manual mixing of the resulting mixture is carried out. The Ordinary Portland cement additives employed yield a strength of 32.5  N/mm 2 at 28  days in standard application. To evaluate the effectiveness of a cement-stabilized soil, testing according to the ASTM D 559 (1996), Standard is often used to determine strength and durability of samples subject to wet-dry cycles. However, such tests are user subjective and for that reason were not adopted in this study. Instead, unconfined compressive strength tests were adopted. These tests were carried out on samples treated with various percentages of the cement ranging from 2 to 7  % and containing the optimum moisture content of each soil. The samples were water cured for 28  days at room temperature and soaked for 4  h before unconfined compressive strength testing. The unconfined compressive strength tests are carried out on samples extruded from modified AASHTO compaction mold. The sample specimens from the mold have 14.5  cm diameter and a height of 12.5  cm. Testing was carried out with a motorized loading machine which has a strain rate of 1.27  mm/min, and is equipped with digital deformation and load gauges which were read manually. Readings were taken until the <b>load</b> <b>gauge</b> reading starts to decrease at which point the test ends. Calculations were made that enable a plot of stress versus strain. The peak value {{at the turn of the}} resulting curve is the unconfined compressive strength. The maximum Young’s modulus values were estimated using the values of stress at the peak of the plotted curve and zero as the ordinate and the associated strain. The minimum values were estimated from the slope of straight line at the early linear part of the curve. The maximum value of stress used in this computation is taken as the minimum unconfined strength for the sample.|$|E
