5|$|Following {{the death}} of Al-Asad, Price's team hold off against Ultranationalist forces who arrive to avenge him. Later, a joint task force, {{composed}} of the SAS, Force Recon, and the Loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son, Victor, to learn Zakhaev's whereabouts. After ambushing him in an enemy convoy at a vehicle checkpoint, Victor flees the scene but is soon cornered {{on the roof of}} an apartment building. Refusing to surrender, he commits suicide. Enraged, Zakhaev retaliates by taking control of a nuclear <b>launch</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Speer ordered Peenemünde {{officers}} and engineers (including Colonel Gerhard Stegmair, Dr Ernst Steinhoff and Lieutenant-Colonel Georg Thom) {{to tour the}} Artois region in northwest France and locate a suitable site for an A-4 <b>launch</b> <b>facility.</b> The site chosen was just {{to the west of}} the small town of Watten, in the Forest of Éperlecques, near Saint-Omer in the Pas-de-Calais department. It was given the cover name of Kraftwerk Nord West (Northwest Power Plant).|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Dr. Schenker {{reveals that}} the {{antidote}} for the chemical reagent is located in H.A.R.M.'s space station. Cate travels to a small island located in the Caribbean, where she infiltrates a secret <b>launch</b> <b>facility.</b> Cate discovers that a rocket {{will be sent to}} the space station that afternoon to collect some antidote. Disguised as a H.A.R.M. space agent, Cate boards the rocket and travels to H.A.R.M.'s space station. While she is searching for the antidote, the space station is struck by a meteor shower, causing it to implode. Cate obtains a large antidote sample and uses an escape pod to return to Earth safely.|$|E

5|$|The SAS team tracks down Al-Asad in Azerbaijan, and {{discover}} {{that he was}} working with Imran Zakhaev, the leader of the Ultranationalist party. The mission then flashes back to 1996, where Captain Price, who was a Lieutenant at the time, is sent alongside his commanding officer, Captain MacMillan, on a failed assassination attempt on Imran Zakhaev. After killing Al-Asad, the SAS team, with support from U.S. Force Recon and Russian loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son and learn his whereabouts. They ambush him, but he commits suicide. In response, Zakhaev seizes control of a nuclear <b>launch</b> <b>facility.</b> A joint operation is launched to take back the site, but Zakhaev launches intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. eastern seaboard. The joint teams are able to breach the facility and remotely destroy the missiles before fleeing the area.|$|E

25|$|After the shuttle's breakup, {{there were}} some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved, but no {{evidence}} of that has ever surfaced.

25|$|While Canada was {{the third}} country to build a {{satellite}} which was launched into space, it was launched aboard an American rocket from an American spaceport. The same goes for Australia, who launched first satellite involved a donated U.S. Redstone rocket and American support staff {{as well as a}} joint <b>launch</b> <b>facility</b> with the United Kingdom. The first Italian satellite San Marco 1 launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. Scout rocket from Wallops Island (Virginia, United States) with an Italian launch team trained by NASA. By similar occasions, almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets.|$|E
500|$|The Blockhaus d'Éperlecques ( [...] , also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Watten bunker" [...] or simply [...] "Watten") is a Second World War bunker, now part of a museum, near Saint-Omer in the northern Pas-de-Calais département of France, and only some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) north-northwest from the more developed La Coupole V-2 <b>launch</b> <b>facility,</b> in the same general area. The bunker, built by Nazi Germany under the codename Kraftwerk Nord West (Powerplant Northwest) between March 1943 and July 1944, was originally intended to be a launching facility for the V-2 (A-4) ballistic missile. It was designed to accommodate over 100 missiles at a time and to launch up to 36 daily.|$|E

500|$|The Germans' {{main focus}} of {{attention}} switched instead to Schotterwerk Nordwest, the former quarry at nearby Wizernes, where work had been ongoing to build a bombproof V-2 storage facility. This project was expanded to turn the quarry into a fixed <b>launch</b> <b>facility.</b> Plans were put into effect to build a huge concrete dome– now {{open to the public}} as the museum of La Coupole– under which missiles would be fuelled and armed in a network of tunnels before being transported outside for launching. The Allies carried out further heavy bombing against both the Watten and Wizernes sites with little initial effect on the buildings themselves, although the rail and road network around them was systematically destroyed. On 3 July 1944, Oberkommando West gave permission to stop construction at both sites, which had been so disrupted by bombing that work could no longer proceed. Three days later an Allied raid succeeded in wrecking the interior of the Watten bunker with a Tallboy bomb that brought down part of the roof. Finally, on 18 July 1944, Hitler decreed that plans for launching missiles from bunkers need no longer be pursued. Dornberger's staff subsequently decided to continue minor construction at Watten [...] "for deception purposes". The site itself was now useless, as the Germans recognised when they wryly codenamed it Concrete Lump, and the liquid oxygen generators and machinery were transferred to the Mittelwerk V-2 factory in central Germany, well away from Allied bombers.|$|E
