40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} the Chinese laws, judicial interpretations, scholarly views and government policies relating to contractual formality for <b>land</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> in their historical and modern settings. The thesis also employs a comparative methodology to critically evaluate the Statute of Frauds literature in some selected Common Law jurisdictions {{such as the}} United States, Australia and England. This investigation includes English legal history, {{the development of the}} Statute of Frauds legislation, associated scholarly views and judicial interpretations. These positions and arguments are compared and contrasted with their counterpart in mainland China and other Civil Law jurisdictions such as Germany and Taiwan, including Chinese legal history, the principle of freedom of contract and the Chinese version of Healing Theory. The most important original contribution is the examination and integration of the functions of formality (particularly writing) in both Sino-Civilian (mainland China, Germany and Taiwan) and Anglo-American literature which forms the theoretical framework of the thesis. Formality is also examined against the theory of freedom of contract in mainland China. Additionally, the thesis compares and contrasts the contractual consequences where the statutory writing obligation is not observed, as well as the legal techniques to address oral <b>land</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> across the selected Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions. Arising out of this, the thesis proposes a legal reform measure for mainland China and argues for a clear requirement of writing for real property <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> in modern mainland China. The reform recommendation also includes contractual consequence for lack of writing and the legal techniques to address the informal and <b>sale</b> <b>contracts.</b> This reform has legal, political, economic and social significance. The reform increases legal certainty and clarity in <b>land</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts,</b> {{one of the most important}} dealings in Chinese society, and could be integrated into China’s unified Civil Code in the making. The reform also addresses some of the essential issues outlined by the Central Committee of Communist Party of China. Furthermore, the reform underpins the issues relating to the real property industry which constitutes a significant portion of the Chinese national economy...|$|R

40|$|The Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 (Qld) {{ushered in}} a new regime for the {{creation}} of residential <b>land</b> <b>sales</b> <b>contracts</b> in Queensland.

While the Act utilises elements of familiar consumer protection methodology, their application in this previously little-regulated market has implications for how legal practitioners understand and apply the law of contract and its underpinning philosophy of freedom of contract and autonomy.

40|$|An {{installment}} {{land contract}} {{is a fairly}} simple conveyancing device, somewhat analogous to a conditional <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> for personal property and is {{the most commonly used}} substitute for the purchase money mortgage or deed of trust. The vendor agrees to convey the described premises upon payment by the purchaser of a specified purchase price and upon performance of any other obligations outlined in the contract. The down payment is generally minimal, with the balance of the purchase price to be paid in installments at regular intervals over an extended period. Like a mortgage, installments are applied to principal and interest and the debt may extend over relatively short periods or for periods exceeding twenty years. Commonly, the vendor retains legal title until the final payment is made, at which time the deed is delivered to the purchaser, sometimes under an escrow arrangement made simultaneously with the installment <b>contract.</b> Some <b>land</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> call for a deed to the purchaser after a certain percentage of the purchase price has been paid, at which time the purchaser delivers to the vendor a purchase money mortgage or deed of trust to secure payment of the balance.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} Anglo-American mining companies and Afro Ecuadorian communities in the northern region of Esmeraldas province, Ecuador during the late nineteenth century. Specifically in these interactions, the thesis analyzes the territorial conflicts that emerged between the mining companies and communities based on their opposing conceptualizations of land and their different definitions of land use and ownership. In analyzing the conflicts, the thesis aims to provide a decolonial interpretation, meaning it gives value to both Afro Ecuadorian and Anglo-American legal frameworks, philosophies in order to depict the tensions and conflicts {{between the two groups}} in a more equitable fashion. Based on primary research at government archives in Ecuador and private document collections in the United States, the thesis recreates a historical narrative in which a mining company’s corporate documents and letters to shareholders are juxtaposed with interviews of community members and oral histories passed down from generation to generation in the community. The thesis also incorporates government maps, public notary entries, <b>land</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> and diplomatic correspondence from several major government archives in Ecuador: The Archive of the Ecuadorian Central Bank in Esmeraldas, The National Archive of Ecuador in Quito, The Archival Library at the National Assembly of Ecuador in Quito and the Library of the Ministry of Foreign Relations in Quito. In addition to the government archives, community interviews and recordings of community members’ oral traditions were obtained from the Afro-Andean Document Collection at the Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar in Quito.

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{research}} has highlighted the surge and development of rural <b>land</b> <b>sales</b> and tenancy <b>contracts</b> in West Africa. However, the commoditization of <b>land,</b> especially through <b>sales,</b> {{does not appear to}} be obvious, as land transactions appear to be a major source of tenure insecurity and land conflicts. This issue is linked with the broader issue of identification and recognition of both the land rights that are being transferred and people holding them. This article deals with tensions and conflicts in land transactions in Côte d'Ivoire and discusses how these transactions might be secured in a context where most transactions occur outside the legal framework. The 1998 Law aims to organise a rapid transition towards private property rights through a nationwide certification and titling program. Due to the socio-political situation, it was only in 2010 that the first certificates were issued and even independently of current political turmoil, there are grounds for doubting the effective implementation of the law. The objective of this article is to consider the issue of securing land transactions in the pre-certification/titling context, drawing from the author's intensive field research on land transactions in Côte d'Ivoire. A first section describes the main types of rural land transactions in Côte d'Ivoire. The second section outlines the sources of tensions and conflicts arising from these transactions. The third section assesses the practices that have emerged spontaneously in rural areas to secure transactions.
