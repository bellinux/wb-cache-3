Especially if workflow steps require the invocation of resource-intensive applications or a large number of applications needs to be carried out concurrently, process owners may have to allocate extensive computational resources, leading to high fixed costs. Instead, process owners could make use of Cloud-based computational resources, dynamically <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> <b>releasing</b> resources on demand, which could lead to lower costs. In the work at hand, we propose a resource-efficient workflow scheduling algorithm for business processes and Cloud-based computational resources. Through the integration into the Vienna Platform for Elastic Processes and an evaluation, we show the practical applicability and the benefits of our contributions. Specifically, we find that our approach reduces the resource demand if compared with an ad hoc approach...|$|R

It emerged in to the market with a huge potential to fulfill this dream and many attractive promises that are inviting to many con summers around the world. As such, it offers many advantage, in terms of reduced cost, relief from managing complex IT infrastructure, flexibility, and scalability. However, cloud computing is a risky paradigm.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, McLaughlin set up Karen Records, {{the first of}} three record labels named after his daughters, the others being Carla and Moira.

In some cases, it is believed that McLaughlin's production credit was an outcome of his management responsibilities for the artists concerned. Many of his recordings were made in Chicago and in Detroit, in some cases using musicians contracted to Motown, <b>and</b> several were <b>leased</b> to, <b>and</b> <b>released</b> by, the Atlantic and Atco labels.

50|$|The {{solution}} was to merge the latter-day wadset and gage for years into a single transaction embodied in two instruments: (1) the absolute conveyance (the charter) in fee or for years to the lender; (2) an indenture or bond (the defeasance) reciting the loan and providing {{that if it was}} repaid the land would reinvest in the borrower, but if not the lender would retain title. If repaid on time, the lender would reinvest title using a reconveyance deed. This was the mortgage by conveyance (aka mortgage in fee) or, when written, the mortgage by charter and reconveyance and took the form of a feoffment, bargain and sale, or <b>lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>release.</b> Since the lender did not necessarily enter into possession, had rights of action, and covenanted a right of reversion on the borrower, the mortgage was a proper collateral security. Thus, a mortgage was on its face an absolute conveyance of a fee simple estate, but was in fact conditional, and would be of no effect if certain conditions were met.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> was:"developed {{as another}} {{strategy}} to avoid public transfer of seisin, {{in response to}} the limitations imposed by the Statute of Enrolments. Since uses (future leases in land) had been limited by the Statute of Uses (and remain subject to disincentives in many jurisdictions), another instrument had to be found. That instrument was the lease for a year (lease for possession) followed on the following day by a release of the property, thus avoiding livery of seisin. The instrument thus consists of two parts: (i) a lease for one year on one day; (ii) a release on the following day. In the lease for a year, the consideration was nominal (usually 5s.) and the term of the lease one year. The release was executed the day after the lease, releasing the property to the 'lessee' in perpetuity; the full purchase price (consideration) is recited in the release; the release recites mentions the lease of the previous day; the release is executed 'according to the statute for converting uses into possession' (the Statute of Uses)." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> was:"a {{species of}} conveyance, invented by Serjeant Moore, {{soon after the}} {{enactment}} of the statute of uses. It is thus contrived; a lease, in fact being a bargain and sale upon some pecuniary consideration for one year, is made by a tenant of the whole freehold no fetter on alienation to the lessee who is in fact the bargainee (buyer). This, without any enrollment, makes the bargainor stand seised {{to the use of the}} bargainee, and vests in the bargainee the use of the term for one year, and then the statute immediately annexes the possession. Being thus in possession, he is capable of receiving a release of the freehold and reversion, made to this tenant (bargainee) in possession; and, accordingly, the next day a release is granted to him." [...] This cites the New York common law treatise that [...] "lease and release was the usual mode of conveyance in England (until) 1841 ... and in New York until 1788...."

This technological trend has enabled the realization of a new computing model called cloud computing, in which resources are provided as general utilities that can be <b>leased</b> <b>and</b> <b>released</b> by users through the Internet in an on-demand fashion. The organizations are gaining more experience in the cloud and they start to shift more core business functions onto cloud platforms. Because of this fact, we are seeing that cloud adoption is significantly more complex than we imagined initially, particularly in terms of data management, system integration and the management of multiple cloud providers. Cloud computing is of growing interest to companies around the globe, but many are finding greater costs and greater obstacles to the adoption of cloud computing than they anticipated. In this case, is cloud computing still able to deliver all the promises?In this paper we will analyze from a company's point of view the factors that need to be considered by an enterprise when making the decision of using cloud computing. Some of the companies are moving towards cloud computing just because it is the latest trend in information technology. On the other hand, other companies cannot even take into consideration the idea of having their sensitive data outside their premises. Both of these cases represent companies that are just not very well informed. We are not sustaining that cloud computing is a perfect solution for everybody, but adopting it or not should be result of a very well informed analysis. We will analyze the positive and negative aspects of each of the following factors: integration with existing IT infrastructure and existing software, costs, return on investment, performances, security. Also, we will correlate all these factors with the company size and business area in order to identify if or what type of cloud computing solution is suitable for their needs...|$|R

50|$|From 1290 to {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, there is no statute of the first {{importance}} dealing with real estate. The reign of Henry VIII, like that of Edward I, is signalized by three acts, the effects of which continue to this day. The one which has had the most lasting influence in law is the Statute of Uses, intended to provide against secrecy of sales of land. As a necessary sequel, the Statute of Enrollments required all bargains and sales of land be duly enrolled. Bargain and sale {{was a form of}} equitable transfer which had for some purposes superseded the common law feoffment. It applied only to estates of inheritance and not to terms of years. The unforeseen effect of the act of 1535, Enrolment of Bargains of Lands, etc. was to establish as the ordinary form of conveyance until 1841 the conveyance by <b>lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>release.</b> Uses having become legal estate by the Statute of Uses, and therefore no longer devisable, the Statute of Wills (explained by the Wills Act of 1542) was passed to remedy this inconvenience.

The colonies were royal grants. An entire province, or {{any part of}} it, could be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of like a private estate.

Cloud computing allows resources to be provided as general utilities, which users can <b>lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> in an on-demand fashion through the Internet. In this thesis an HTTP based mobile messaging solution is designed, implemented and described and deployed in the Amazon Cloud, with the main goal of determining to what extent the availability of mobile {{messaging service}}s improves when deployed in the Amazon Cloud. Three testing environments are proposed for deploying mobile messaging services, i. e. using a proprietary server, Auto Scaling service and the Elastic Load Balancing service provided by Amazon. The architectures for all three scenarios are described and illustrated, and a description is provided of their implementation. Based on performance tests executed in all three scenarios the improvement in availability is determined. Also stress tests are executed in all scenarios with the purpose to compare the performance, i. e. the average response time required to process a subscriber’s request for service, of each scenario with each other. A comparison of the test results provides insight into the availability of the tested messaging service, and the relationship that exists between each scenario’s performance.

Academic research in this area has argued that in a monopolistic environment, leasing dominates selling. Hence, <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> selling should not co-exist and the firm should concentrate its efforts solely on leasing. We show that the relative profitability of <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> selling hinges on the rates at which <b>leased</b> <b>and</b> sold units depreciate. In particular, we find that leasing does not dominate selling in all cases; if sold units depreciate at a significantly higher rate than leased units, a monopolistic firm is better off by only selling its product. In addition, we find that if leaded and sold products depreciate at different rates, then the optimal strategy for the firm involves a combination of both <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> selling.
