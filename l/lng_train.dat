25|$|The most {{important}} infrastructure needed for LNG production and transportation is an LNG plant consisting {{of one or}} more LNG trains, each of which is an independent unit for gas liquefaction. The largest <b>LNG</b> <b>train</b> now in operation is in Qatar. These facilities recently reached a safety milestone, completing 12 years of operations on its offshore facilities without a Lost Time Incident. Until recently it was the Train4 of Atlantic LNG in Trinidad and Tobago with a production capacity of 5.2 million metric ton per annum (mmtpa), followed by the SEGAS LNG plant in Egypt with a capacity of 5mmtpa. In July 2014, Atlantic LNG celebrated its 3000th cargo of LNG at the company’s liquefaction facility in Trinidad. The QatargasII plant has a production capacity of 7.8mmtpa for each of its two trains. LNG sourced from Qatargas II will be supplied to Kuwait, following the signing of an agreement in May 2014 between Qatar Liquefied Gas Company and Kuwait Petroleum Corp. LNG is loaded onto ships and delivered to a regasification terminal, where the LNG is allowed to expand and reconvert into gas. Regasification terminals are usually connected to a storage and pipeline distribution network to distribute natural gas to local distribution companies (LDCs) or independent power plants (IPPs).|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 115 - 148 The {{international}} liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) trade is expanding rapidly. Projects are being proposed worldwide to meet the industry forecasted growth rate of 12 percent {{by the end of}} the decade. <b>LNG</b> <b>train</b> designs in the coming years appear to fall within three classes, having nominal capacities of approximately 3. 5, 5. 0, and 8. 0 million tons per annum (MTPA). These designs may coexist in the coming years, as individual projects choose designs that closely match their gas supplies, sales, and other logistical and economic constraints. The most critical component of an LNG liquefaction facility is the refrigeration compressors and their drivers. These represent a significant expense and strongly influence overall plant performance and production efficiency. The refrigeration compressors themselves are complex and challenging to design due to high Mach numbers, large volume flows, low inlet temperatures, and complex sidestream mixing. Drivers for these plants include gas turbines that range in size from 30 MW units to large Frame 9 E gas turbines. Aeroderivative engines have also been recently introduced. This paper comprehensively covers the design, application, and implementation considerations pertaining to both LNG plant drivers and compressors. The paper does not focus on any particular LNG process but just addresses turbomachinery design and application aspects that are common to all processes. Topics cover key technical design issues and complexities involved in the turbomachinery selection, aeromechanical design, testing, and implementation. The paper attempts to highlight the practical design compromises that have to be made to obtain a robust solution from a mechanical and aerodynamic standpoint...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Gorgon Joint Venture† {{made the}} Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Gorgon Project in September 2009. One element of that {{approval}} was {{the decision to}} proceed with the Carbon Dioxide Injection Project on Barrow Island, whereby CO 2 separated from the reservoir gas from the Gorgon and Jansz-Io fields will be injected into a deep sandstone interval beneath Barrow Island. Since FID, the focus has been on delivering the project – this involves preparations for drilling and completing the four different well types, engineering design and procurement of the CO 2 pipeline and procurement and manufacture of the CO 2 compression system within the LNG plant. In addition to this engineering activity, the subsurface team has continued with improving their knowledge of the injection interval and overlying geology. The focus of this work has been two-fold: 1. Deliver work to support the execution decisions, e. g. finalising well locations, well construction design, well completion design, reservoir data gathering plans, etc. In addition work has also been done to prepare for operations, focusing on understanding the behaviour of super- critical CO 2 in the full system from the compressor to the reservoir as a basis for developing operations procedures and documents. 2. Prepare for long term reservoir and project management; this includes developing a reservoir management plan with emphasis on surveillance data, continuing to develop the monitoring plans for understanding distribution of CO 2 in the injection interval and continuing to evaluate and update understanding of subsurface uncertainties. We currently anticipate commissioning of the carbon dioxide injection system contemporaneous with the start-up of the second Gorgon <b>LNG</b> <b>train</b> in 2015. Between now and then the Carbon Dioxide Injection Project will drill and complete 17 wells, install a seven kilometre buried pipeline and associated facilities and construct, install and commission the CO 2 compression system. * The Gorgon Joint Venture comprises the Australian subsidiaries of Chevron (47. 3 percent), Exxon Mobil (25 percent), Shell (25 percent), Osaka Gas (1. 25 percent), Tokyo Gas (1 percent) and Chubu Electric Power (0. 417 percent).
