40|$|An {{overview}} of the application of Si(Li) detectors to cosmic-ray identification is presented. A vacancy-related defect in FZ silicon that can limit the <b>lithium</b> <b>compensation</b> process in Si(Li) detector fabrication is discussed and a gettering process to remove this defect is outlined. Computer simulation of the gettering process is shown to yield native point defect diffusivity and concentration values approaching those recently proposed by Gösele, Plöβl and Tan...|$|E
40|$|The initial lithium loss {{during the}} {{formation}} stage {{is a critical}} issue that significantly reduces the specific capacity and energy density of current rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). An effective strategy {{to solve this problem}} is using electrode prelithiation additives that can work as a secondary lithium source and compensate the initial lithium loss. Herein we show that nanocomposites of lithium fluoride and metal (e. g., LiF/Co and LiF/Fe) can be efficient cathode prelithiation materials. The thorough mixing of ultrafine lithium fluoride and metal particles (∼ 5 nm) allows lithium to be easily extracted from the nanocomposites via an inverse conversion reaction. The LiF/Co nanocomposite exhibits an open circuit voltage (OCV, 1. 5 V) with good compatibility with that of existing cathode materials and delivers a high first-cycle “donor” lithium-ion capacity (516 mA h g&# 8211; 1). When used as an additive to a LiFePO 4 cathode, the LiF/Co nanocomposite provides high <b>lithium</b> <b>compensation</b> efficiency. Importantly, the as-formed LiF/metal nanocomposites possess high stability and good compatibility with the regular solvent, binder, and existing battery processing conditions, in contrast with the anode prelithiation materials that usually suffer from issues of high chemical reactivity and instability. The facile synthesis route, high stability in ambient and battery processing conditions, and high “donor” lithium-ion capacity make the LiF/metal nanocomposites ideal cathode prelithiation materials for LIBs. clos...|$|E
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} detector X-ray spectrometer type 454 provides {{a resolution of}} 220 eV FWHM for the Fe Kα X-ray line at count rates up to 10 4 pulses per second, and is suitable for the energy range 4 to 60 keV. The preamplifier uses the pulsed optical feedback technique and a remounted input field effect transistor which operates at 130 K. The detectors are fabricated from commercially available hyper-pure n-type silicon and do not suffer from the carrier trapping effects exhibited by some lithium drift compensated silicon detectors at temperatures approaching 77 K. The high initial cost of this material is offset by savings in manufacturing time and {{in the cost of}} the sophisticated equipment required for <b>lithium</b> drift <b>compensation</b> of p-type silicon. Drifting times of possibly weeks coupled with uncertainty about the qualities of the final product make the more costly hyper-pure n-type silicon an attractive proposition for small laboratories. The doping density is stable and is not affected appreciably by the high temperature (300 ºC) processing required to diffuse lithium into one surface and so produce a highly doped low sheet resistivity n contact. Guarding the n+ contact ensures a signal contact leakage current of less than 0. 01 pA when the 5 - 8 mm thick detector is fully depleted...|$|R
