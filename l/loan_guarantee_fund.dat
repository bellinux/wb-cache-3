40|$|In this period, {{an often}} debated topic {{is related to}} credit risk, as more as it {{manifested}} lately and caused the trigger of the current crisis. Credit risk is not directly {{the subject of this}} work, but especially the ways of hedging credit risk. Therefore I examined in this paper the current trends in <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>loans,</b> respectively the institutional guarantees. Even if, in the other EU countries, <b>loans</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>funds</b> work from many years in the case of Romania the activity of these funds is at the beginning. Therefore, the experience from other European countries, should lead to some measures that have to be taken in Romania in order to encourage the <b>loans</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>funds</b> activity and to increase the confidence of the banks in the guarantees provided by this. This action may, on the one hand, facilitate the access of more companies to the credits provided by banks, {{and on the other hand}} a way to encourage lending, which can lead to an economic development and can contribute to the overcome of the actual economic crisis. <b>loans</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>funds,</b> credit risk, SME’s, economic crisis...|$|R

40|$|The paper uses a {{case study}} of a <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>fund</b> of $ 800, 000 {{provided}} by the Ford Foundation to the Grameen Bank in 1981 as a framework for offering reflections on current debates within US philanthropy on accountability, support for innovation, risk taking and impact. Ford's <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>fund</b> leveraged commercial bank lending to Grameen Bank. The subsequent high rates of loan repayment by loan recipients convinced commercial bankers of the viability of Muhammad Yunus' model of lending to poor entrepreneurs unable to provide traditional loan collateral. The paper develops the concept of "accountability regimes," and argues that foundations engaged in international poverty reduction are better able, institutionally, to bear risk in support of innovation than multilateral and bilateral aid organizations such as the World Bank and USAID. That said, recent interviews of a small sample of executives whose foundations fund poverty work abroad suggest ambivalent attitudes toward funding innovative and risky projects. This is attributed, in part, to high expectations on the part of foundation boards and top executives that foundation-funded programs show positive, early and measurable impact. The great diversity of the US philanthropic community, and the commitment of many foundations to important charitable activities that are not necessarily inviting of innovation, further explains a more modest investment by US philanthropy in the kind of innovative work that they are uniquely sanctioned to support. Encouraging foundations to be more open to supporting innovative initiatives, the paper next offers three operational principles, drawn mainly from the Grameen case study, which foundations might observe in their poverty reduction initiatives. These are: the strongest ideas are likely to come from individuals and organizations outside of foundations working close to the problems; long-term impact assessments should focus on achievement of administrative and policy reforms in institutions that matter in the lives of poor people and; active and early engagement with governments, the private sector and publicly-funded donors will increase the chances that new ideas, once successfully tested, will bring about systemic change.

The Johansen cointegration test was employed in this study and the result indicated that there was no cointegrating relationship between cocoa production in Nigeria and Agricultural credit <b>guarantee</b> scheme <b>fund</b> over the period under study. This could be attributed to the guaranteeing of few number as well as limited value of credit to the farmers by agricultural credit <b>guarantee</b> scheme <b>fund</b> and the high incidence of loan diversion by the cocoa farmers who had access to the <b>loans</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by agricultural credit <b>guarantee</b> scheme <b>fund.</b> It is recommended that the number as well as the value of credit guaranteed to cocoa farmers should be significantly increased so as to enable the farmers expand their production and thereby, reposition the cocoa to assume a critical role as a major non-oil foreign exchange earner in the Agricultural transformation plan of Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|The study {{established}} {{the relationship between}} amount of <b>loan</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by the Agricultural Credit <b>Guarantee</b> Scheme <b>Fund</b> (ACGSF) and some key macroeconomic variables in Nigeria.

The short-run and long-run elasticities of amount of <b>loan</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by ACGSF with respect to some key macro-economic fundamentals were determined using the techniques of co-integration and error correction models. The empirical results revealed {{that in the long}} run, the coefficients of interest rate charged by commercial banks and value of oil revenue has a significant negative and positive relationship respectively with the amount of <b>loan</b> <b>guaranteed</b> by the ACGSF in the country.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the recent credit slowdown among Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries from three analytical angles. First, it finds that, {{similar to other}} regions and to its past history, a credit boom preceded the current slowdown, and that a protracted period of sluggish growth is likely going forward. Second, it uncovers a key role played by bank funding (deposit growth and external borrowing slowed considerably) but whose effect was frequently dampened by expansionary monetary policy. Third, bank-level fundamentals - capitalization and loan quality - helped to explain differences in credit growth across banks and countries.

In reality though, corporate <b>loan</b> <b>guarantees</b> have negative as well as positive effects. The negative effects of <b>loan</b> <b>guarantees</b> arise from the agency problem between the controlling minority shareholders and outside investors.

40|$|Small {{businesses}} are considered important engines for job growth {{and economic development}} by policy makers worldwide. One {{of the most commonly}} cited constraints of small businesses is a lack of access to capital. To address this constraint, small business <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> programs have been established in over 100 countries. There are a variety of types of <b>guarantee</b> <b>funds,</b> with the most significant differences being which borrowers are eligible for guarantees, and how borrowers are approved for guarantees. There is currently no clear delineation between types of programs and the economic conditions they operate in, though some trends are becoming apparent. However, these trends may not be leading to the best economic outcomes possible. By better matching the structure of the <b>guarantee</b> <b>fund</b> to the economic conditions it operates in, the program’s success in meeting economic development goals may be greatly improved. Many programs in developing countries may not be taking advantage of bank expertise and may be limiting the scope of their effectiveness. At the same time, programs in developed countries may be wasting resources by scattering their efforts too thinly and subsidizing less competitive firms to the detriment of local economic development...|$|R
