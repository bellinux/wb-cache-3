25|$|Achondroplasia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a <b>lethal</b> <b>allele).</b> A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.|$|E
50|$|Alleles {{that need}} only {{be present in}} one copy in an {{organism}} to be fatal {{are referred to as}} dominant lethal alleles. These alleles are not commonly found in populations because they usually result in the death of an organism before it can transmit its <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> on to its offspring.

50|$|Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency (GBED) is {{a genetic}} disease where {{the horse is}} lacking an enzyme {{necessary}} for storing glycogen, the horse's heart muscle and skeletal muscles cannot function, leading to rapid death.

50|$|A pair of {{identical}} alleles {{that are both}} present in an organism that ultimately results in death of that organism {{are referred to as}} recessive lethal alleles. Though recessive lethals may encode for dominant or recessive traits, they are only fatal in the homozygous condition. Heterozygotes will sometimes display a form of disease phenotype, {{as in the case of}} achondroplasia. One mutant <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> is tolerated, but having two results in death. In the case of homozygous achondroplasia, death almost invariably occurs before birth or in the perinatal period. Not all heterozygotes for recessive lethal alleles will show a mutant phenotype, as is the case for cystic fibrosis carriers. If two cystic fibrosis carriers have children, they have a 25 percent chance of producing offspring having two copies of the <b>lethal</b> <b>allele,</b> eventually resulting in the death of the child.|$|E

Homozygous offspring for the mutant allele cannot survive birth and are therefore not seen in these crosses.|$|E

40|$|A {{dominant}} mutation {{due to the}} insertion of a P-element at 93 E on the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster enhances position-effect variegation. The corresponding gene was cloned by transposon tagging and the sequence of the transcript revealed that it corresponds to the gene encoding the transcriptional activator and cell cycle regulator dE 2 F. The transposon-tagged allele is homozygous viable, and the insertion of the transposon in an intron correlates with a strong reduction {{in the amount of}} transcript. A homozygous <b>lethal</b> null <b>allele</b> was found to behave as a strong enhancer when heterozygous. Overexpression of the gene in transgenic flies has the opposite effect of suppressing variegation.

Mating {{tests of}} males bearing {{different}} combinations of alleles near locus T show fertility differences from near sterile to near normal fertility depending on the specific alleles combined.

For small values of alpha (= 3 N mu), where N is the size of the female population, and mu is the mutation rate from wild-type to <b>lethal</b> <b>allele,</b> the standard deviation (SD) of the proportion of new mutants is large. However, if alpha more than 50, the potential effect of genetic drift is probably less important than the many other sources of error and bias...|$|E

The identities of the residues at the positions of these mutations are highly conserved in the BTB domain family of proteins, and when the corresponding mutations were engineered into the BTB domain-containing GAGA protein, the activity of GAGA as a transcription activator in a transient transfection assay was severely reduced.

40|$|AbstractThe lsp gene {{encoding}} prolipoprotein signal peptidase (signal peptidase II) of Staphylococcus aureus was cloned by screening a {{genomic library}} for plasmid clones capable of complementing a conditionally <b>lethal</b> lsp <b>allele</b> of Escherichia coli, E. coli cells carrying {{one of five}} overlapping clones exhibited increased resistance to globomycin. The nucleotide sequence of the S. aureus lsp gene was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the signal peptidase II of S. aureus suggests that this enzyme has a hydropathy profile {{very similar to those}} of E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme from these four distinct bacterial species reveals three highly conserved domains in proteins which have a low degree of overall sequence homology.

40|$|Different point {{mutations}} in the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (Nop 1 p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) can inhibit different steps in ribosome synthesis. A screen for mutations that are synthetically lethal (sl) with the nop 1 - 5 allele, which inhibits pre-rRNA processing, identified NOP 56. An independent sl mutation screen with nop 1 - 3, which inhibits pre-rRNA methylation, identified a mutation in NOP 58. Strikingly, Nop 56 p and Nop 58 p are highly homologous (45 % identity). Both proteins {{were found to}} be essential and localized to the nucleolus. A temperature-sensitive <b>lethal</b> mutant <b>allele,</b> nop 56 - 2, inhibited many steps in pre-rRNA processing, particularly on the pathway of 25 S/ 5. 8 S rRNA synthesis, and led to defects in 60 S subunit assembly. Epitope-tagged constructs show that both Nop 56 p and Nop 58 p are associated with Noplp in complexes, Nop 56 p and Nop 1 p exhibiting a stoichiometric association. These physical interactions presumably underlie the observed sl phenotypes. Well-conserved homologs are present in a range of organisms, including humans (52 % identity between human hNop 56 p and yeast Nop 56 p), suggesting that these complexes have been conserved in evolution...|$|R
40|$|A {{spreadsheet}} {{model was}} constructed {{to describe the}} change in allelic frequency over time for a lethal recessive mutation in an animal population. The model allowed relative fitness to differ between genotypes, between sexes, and over time. Whereas a <b>lethal</b> recessive <b>allele</b> is naturally eliminated very slowly from a population, a small selective disadvantage of the heterozygote results in a large increase {{in the rate of}} elimination. With selective advantage of the heterozygote through linkage with a production trait or pleiotropy, the allele is never naturally eliminated but tends toward a stable equilibrium frequency. The model was used to investigate various alternative control programs based on the detection of heterozygotes by genotyping and their exclusion from breeding. The programs (genotyping males only, genotyping males and 50 % of females, and genotyping all breeding animals) were modeled for various initial heterozygote frequencies, and the results were described {{in terms of the number}} of generations, number of tests, and number of culls required to reduce the heterozygote frequency to a predefined level.

40|$|We {{describe}} a Drosophila mutation, Double or nothing (Dub), that causes meiotic nondisjunction in a conditional, dominant manner. Previously isolated mutations in Drosophila specifically affect meiosis either in females or males, {{with the exception}} of the mei-S 332 and ord genes which are required for proper sister-chromatid cohesion. Dub is unusual in that it causes aberrant chromosome segregation almost exclusively in meiosis I in both sexes. In Dub mutant females both nonexchange and exchange chromosomes undergo nondisjunction, but the effect of Dub on nonexchange chromosomes is more pronounced. Dub reduces recombination levels slightly. Multiple nondisjoined chromosomes frequently cosegregate to the same pole. Dub results in nondisjunction of all chromosomes in meiosis I of males, although the levels are lower than in females. When homozygous, Dub is a conditional <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> and exhibits phenotypes consistent with cell death...|$|E

We replaced the wild-type copies of PRI 1 and PRI 2 with two pri 1 and two pri 2 conditional alleles. When shifted to the restrictive temperature, these strains showed altered DNA synthesis and reduced ability to synthesize high molecular weight DNA products, thus providing in vivo evidence for the essential role of DNA primase in eukaryotic DNA replication.

The role of the essential mediator component Srb 7 p has been difficult to investigate, since no conditional <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> has been available to date. While the expression of Srb 7 p under the control of a repressible promoter is not sufficient to reduce the level of Srb 7 p beneath the threshold for survival, {{we have been able to}} isolate a clone termed ts 16 which confers a temperature sensitive phenotype. ts 16 contains an insertion mutation that requires translational frameshifting for correct expression of Srb 7 p, leading to extremely low protein levels. Strains bearing the ts 16 construct show mild defects in the transcription of constitutive genes like TDH 1 but severely affect activated transcription, e. g. of the GAL 1 gene. In contrast, CUP 1, which is also independent of other holoenzyme components, is not affected by ts 16...|$|E

Neither alter expression of era indicating that suppression is post-translational. Plasmid clones of ptsN prevent suppression by either disruption mutation indicating that this gene is important for lethality caused by era(ts). rpoN and six neighboring genes were sequenced and compared with sequences in the database. Two of these genes encode proteins homologous to Enzyme IIA(Fru) and HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. We designate these proteins IIA(Ntr) (ptsN) and NPr (npr). Purified IIA(Ntr) and NPr exchange phosphate appropriately with Enzyme I, HPr, and Enzyme IIA proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system. Several sugars and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates inhibited growth of the ptsN disruption mutant on medium containing an amino acid or nucleoside base as a combined source of nitrogen, carbon, and energy. This growth inhibition was relieved by supplying the ptsN gene or ammonium salts but was not aleviated by altering levels of exogenously supplied cAMP. These results support our previous proposal of a novel mechanism linking carbon and nitrogen assimilation and relates IIA(Ntr) to the unknown process regulated by the essential GTPase Era...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila snf gene encodes {{a protein}} with {{functional}} homology to the mammalian U 1 A and U 2 B" snRNP proteins. Studies, {{based on the}} analysis of three viable alleles, have suggested a role for snf in establishing the female-specific splicing pattern of the sex determination switch gene, Sex-lethal. Here, we show that the non-sex-specific <b>lethal</b> null <b>allele</b> is required for female sex determination, arguing against the formal possibility that the viable alleles disrupt a function unrelated to snf's wild-type function. Moreover, we find snf is required for normal cell growth and/or survival, as expected for a protein involved in a cell-vital process such as RNA splicing. We also show that of the three viable alleles only one, snf(JA 2), is a partial loss-of-function mutation. The other two viable alleles, snf(1621) and snf(e 8 H), encode antimorphic proteins. We find the antimorphic proteins are mislocalized and correlate their mislocalization with their molecular lesions and mutant phenotypes. Finally, we provide genetic evidence that the antimorphic alleles interfere with the autoregulatory splicing function of the Sex-lethal protein. Based on these studies we suggest a model in which the snRNP protein, Snf, functions with Sex-lethal to block recognition of the regulated male-specific exon...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{dissection}} {{of learning}} and memory in Drosophila has been limited by the existence of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) -induced mutations in {{only a small number}} of X-linked genes. To remedy this shortcoming, we have begun a P element mutagenesis to screen for autosomal mutations that disrupt associative learning and/or memory. The generation of ``P-tagged'' mutant alleles will expedite molecular cloning of these new genes. Here, we describe a behavior-genetic characterization of latheo(P 1), a recessive, hypomorphic mutation of an essential gene. latheo(P 1) flies perform poorly in olfactory avoidance conditioning experiments. This performance deficit could not be attributed to abnormal olfactory acuity or shock reactivity-two task-relevant ``peripheral'' behaviors which are used during classical conditioning. Thus, the latheo(P 1) mutation appears to affect learning/memory specifically. Consistent with chromosomal in situ localization of the P element insertion, deficiencies of the 49 F region of the second chromosome failed to complement the behavioral effect of the latheo(P 1) mutation. Further complementation analyses between latheo(P 1) and lethal alleles, produced by excision of the latheo(P 1) insert or by EMS or γ-rays, in the 49 F region mapped the latheo mutation to one vital complementation group. Flies heterozygous for latheo(P 1) and one of two EMS lethal alleles or one <b>lethal</b> excision <b>allele</b> also show the behavioral deficits, thereby demonstrating that the behavioral and lethal phenotypes co-map to the same locus...|$|R

40|$|Using genomic data, lethal recessives may be {{discovered}} from haplotypes {{that are common}} in the population but never occur in the homozygote state in live animals. This approach only requires genotype data from phenotypically normal (i. e. live) individuals and not from the affected embryos that die. A total of 7, 937 Nordic Holstein animals were genotyped with BovineSNP 50 BeadChip and haplotypes including 25 consecutive markers were constructed and tested for absence of homozygotes states. We have identified 17 homozygote deficient haplotypes which could be loosely clustered into eight genomic regions harboring possible recessive lethal alleles. Effects of the identified haplotypes were estimated on two fertility traits: non-return rates and calving interval. Out of the eight identified genomic regions, six regions were confirmed as having an effect on fertility. The information {{can be used to}} avoid carrier-by-carrier mattings in practical animal breeding.

40|$|A temperature-sensitive <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> of {{suppressor}} of forked, l(1) su(f) ts 67 g (ts 67), {{has been}} discovered and characterized as follows: Flies which are hemizygous for ts 67 live at 18 ° and 25 ° but die at 30 ° primarily as larvae. The temperature-sensitive period for ts 67 homozygotes or hemizygotes begins in second instar and ends at pupation. ts 67 is lethal at 30 ° when heterozygous with suppressor of forked (su(f)), a deficiency for suppressor of forked (su(f) -), and a non-conditional <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> of suppressor of forked (3 DES). It is viable at 30 ° when heterozygous with the wild-type allele of suppressor of forked. At 25 ° but not at 18 ° forked bristles are suppressed in flies of the following genotypes: fsts 67 /Y, fsts 67 /fsts 67, fsts 67 /fssu(f), futs 67 /fs 3 DES, futs 67 /fssu(f) -, futs 67 /fssu(f). There is some suppression of forked bristles at 25 ° in the heterozygote, fsts 67 /fs+su(f). The forked bristle phenotype is not suppressed at either temperature in flies of the genotypes futs 67 /Y, futs 67 /futs 67 / (fs and fu indicating suppressible and unsuppressible alleles of forked). The temperature-sensitive period for suppression of forked bristles begins at pupation and extends through the period of bristle synthesis. The deficiency phenotype (bristles reduced in size or absent, wing wrinkled or blistered, eyes rough) typical of flies of the genotype fssu(f) /fssu(f) - at 18 ° and 25 °, is exhibited by flies of the genotypes fsts 67 /fssu(f) - at 25 ° and futs 67 /fssu(f) at 29 °. An allele of lozenge (lz 1) which can be suppressed by su(f) is suppressed at 25 ° but not at 18 ° in lz 1 ts 67 /Y males. ts 67 homozygous females are fertile at 25 ° but sterile at 30 °. The hypothesis is discussed that the su(f) locus codes for a ribosomal protein and that suppression and enhancement are affected by mutations at the locus by mutant ribosome-induced misreading.

40|$|At {{the final}} step of {{melanocyte}} differentiation in mouse hair follicles, the cells produce melanin. The type of melanin they produce is, however, determined by the tissue environment of hair follicles. In wild-type mice, melanocytes located in hair bulbs synthesize eumelanin {{at the beginning of}} hair growth. They subsequently produce pheomelanin and finally produce eumelanin again. Therefore, the hair is characterized by a subterminal band of yellow, with the rest of it displaying black. This characteristic is called the agouti pattern and is known to be determined by the wild-type allele, A at the a (agouti) locus, which is considered to function in the follicular cells. Expression of the agouti pattern is altered by genetic substitutions at the a locus and the e (extension) locus. Animals heterozygous for the Ay (<b>lethal</b> yellow) <b>allele</b> exhibit yellow coat color; those homozygous for the e (recessive yellow) also produce yellow hair exclusively. By using an organ culture method, we demonstrated that α-MSH and cholera toxin, as well as forskolin, induced eumelanin synthesis in expiants from lethal yellow mice (Ay/a). On the other hand, these reagents did not induce eumelanogenesis in the hair follicles of recessive yellow (e/e) mice. Therefore, we assume that the product of the a locus, which probably functions in follicle cells, interacts with α-MSH at the α-MSH receptor and that the e locus controls the functionality of adenylate cyclase in the membrane of mouse melanocytes.

40|$|Genetic {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the product of the yeast SUP 45 gene encodes a component of the translational-termination machinery. In higher eukaryotes, genes similar to SUP 45 encode eukaryote release factor 1 (eRF 1), which has a stop-codon-dependent peptidyl-release activity. Using a conditional <b>lethal</b> mutant <b>allele</b> of SUP 45 (sup 45 - 2) and a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that the product of the SUP 45 gene (Sup 45 p or eRF 1) is a factor required for translation termination in yeast. A homologous in vitro assay based on suppressor-tRNA-mediated readthrough of stop codons is used to show that a translating lysate from a sup 45 - 2 mutant strain exhibits a termination defect when heated for short periods to greater than the non-permissive temperature (37 degrees C). This defect can be complemented with a purified preparation of Sup 45 p (eRF 1) expressed in Eschericha coli, The termination defect in this strain appears to be due to an inability of the Sup 45 p protein to bind the ribosome, resulting in vivo in a reduced ability of Sup 45 p to release nascent polypeptides from the ribosome at the non-permissive temperature. Cell-free translation lysates from the sup 45 - 2 strain do not show a defect in sense-codon translation at the non-permissive temperature.

40|$|The RNA 1 {{gene product}} is {{believed}} to be involved in RNA metabolism due to the phenotype of a single conditionally <b>lethal,</b> temperature-sensitive <b>allele,</b> rna 1 - 1. We cloned the RNA 1 gene and determined that it produces a 1, 400 -nucleotide polyadenylated transcript. On a multicopy plasmid, the mutant rna 1 - 1 allele partially complements the rna 1 - 1 temperature-sensitive growth defect. This suggests that the temperature-sensitive nature of the rna 1 - 1 allele results from the synthesis of a product with lowered activity or stability at elevated temperatures or from a decrease in synthesis of the rna 1 - 1 product at the restrictive temperature. A chromosomal disruption of RNA 1 behaves as a recessive lethal mutation. Haploids bearing the disruption were isolated by sporulating a diploid heterozygous for the disrupted allele and the rna 1 - 1 allele and possessing an episomal copy of the RNA 1 gene. Analysis of the rescued haploids bearing the chromosomal disruption indicated that the recessive lethal phenotype of the RNA 1 disruption is not merely due to a block in spore germination. Unexpectedly, diploids heterozygous for the disruption and the rna 1 - 1 alleles become aneuploid for chromosome XIII at a frequency of 2 to 5 %. It appears that the disrupted RNA 1 allele on a multicopy plasmid also promotes aneuploidy for chromosome XIII. Promotion of aneuploidy seems to be a phenotype of this particular allele of RNA 1...|$|R

One of these subunits, p 8 /TTDA, interacts with p 52 and XPD and is important in maintaining TFIIH stability. Drosophila mutants in the p 52 (Dmp 52) subunit exhibit phenotypic defects similar to those observed in TTD patients with defects in p 8 /TTDA and XPD, including reduced levels of TFIIH. Here, we demonstrate that several Dmp 52 phenotypes, including lethality, developmental defects, and sterility, can be suppressed by p 8 /TTDA overexpression. TFIIH levels were also recovered in rescued flies. In addition, p 8 /TTDA overexpression suppressed a <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> of the Drosophila XPB homolog. Furthermore, transgenic flies overexpressing p 8 /TTDA were more resistant to UV irradiation than were wild-type flies, apparently because of enhanced efficiency of cyclobutane-pyrimidine-dimers and 6 - 4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts repair.

Bbp 1 p was detected at the central plaque periphery of the SPB and bbp 1 - 1 cells were found to be defective in SPB duplication. bbp 1 - 1 cells extend their satellite into a duplication plaque like wild-type cells; however, this duplication plaque then fails to insert properly into the nuclear envelope and does not assemble a functional inner plaque. This function in SPB duplication is probably fulfilled by a stable complex of Bbp 1 p and Mps 2 p, a nuclear envelope protein that is also essential for duplication plaque insertion. In addition, we found that Bbp 1 p interacts with Spc 29 p and the half-bridge component Kar 1 p.

A conditionally <b>lethal</b> <b>allele</b> was constructed by placing NOP 1 expression {{under the control of}} a GAL promoter. Growth on glucose medium results in the depletion of NOP 1 over several generations, during which cell growth is progressively impaired. Pulse labelling of proteins shows that NOP 1 depleted strains are greatly impaired in the production of cytoplasmic ribosomes, and they have a reduced level of rRNA. Northern hybridization and pulse-chase labelling of pre-rRNA show a progressive impairment of all pre-rRNA processing steps. The pathway leading to 18 S rRNA is particularly affected. Methylation of pre-rRNA is concomitantly impaired and unmethylated pre-rRNA accumulates and is not processed over long periods. NOP 1 depletion does not prevent the accumulation of seven snoRNAs tested including U 3; the levels of two species, U 14 and snR 190, decline.

40|$|The non-essential VTS 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is highly}} conserved in eukaryotes and encodes a sequence- and structure-specific RNA-binding protein. The Vts 1 protein has {{been implicated in}} post-transcriptional {{regulation}} of {{a specific set of}} mRNAs that contains its-binding site at their 3 ′-untranslated region. In this study, we identified VTS 1 as a multi-copy suppressor of dna 2 -K 1080 E, a <b>lethal</b> mutant <b>allele</b> of DNA 2 that lacks DNA helicase activity. The suppression was allele-specific, since overexpression of Vts 1 did not suppress the temperature-dependent growth defects of dna 2 Δ 405 N devoid of the N-terminal 405 -amino-acid residues. Purified recombinant Vts 1 stimulated the endonuclease activity of wild-type Dna 2, but not the endonuclease activity of Dna 2 Δ 405 N, indicating that the activation requires the N-terminal domain of Dna 2. Stimulation of Dna 2 endonuclease activity by Vts 1 appeared to be the direct cause of suppression, since the multi-copy expression of Dna 2 -K 1080 E suppressed the lethality observed with its single-copy expression. We found that vts 1 Δ dna 2 Δ 405 N and vts 1 Δdna 2 - 7 double mutant cells displayed synergistic growth defects, in support of a functional interaction between two genes. Our results provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence that Vts 1 is involved in lagging strand synthesis by modulating the Dna 2 endonuclease activity that plays an essential role in Okazaki fragment processing...|$|R
40|$|Thermus thermophilus is an {{extremely}} thermophilic bacterium that is widely used as a model thermophile, in large part due to its amenability to genetic manipulation. Here we describe a system for the introduction of genomic point mutations or deletions using a counterselectable marker consisting of a conditionally <b>lethal</b> mutant <b>allele</b> of pheS encoding the phenylalanyl-tRNA syn-thetase-subunit. Mutant PheS with an A 294 G amino acid substitution renders cells sensitive to the phenylalanine analog p-chlorophenylalanine. Insertion of the mutant pheS allele via a linked kanamycin resistance gene into a chromosomal locus pro-vides a gene replacement intermediate that can be removed by homologous recombination using p-chlorophenylalanine as a counterselective agent. This selection is suitable for the sequential introduction of multiple mutations to produce a final strain unmarked by an antibiotic resistance gene. We demonstrated the utility of this method by constructing strains bearing either a point mutation in or a precise deletion of the rrsB gene encoding 16 S rRNA. We also used this selection to identify spontaneous, large-scale deletions in the pTT 27 megaplasmid, apparently mediated by either of the T. thermophilus insertion elements ISTth 7 and ISTth 8. One such deletion removed 121 kb, including 118 genes, or over half of pTT 27, including multiple sugar hydrolase genes, and facilitated {{the development of a}} plasmid-encoded reporter system based on -galactosidase. The ability to introduce mutations ranging from single base substitutions to large-scale deletions provides a potentially powerful tool for engineering the genome of T. thermophilus and possibly other thermophiles as well...|$|R
40|$|Deleterious {{recessive}} alleles {{that are}} masked in outbred populations are predicted {{to be expressed}} in small, inbred populations, reducing both individual fitness and population viability. However, there are few definitive examples of phenotypic expression of lethal recessive alleles under inbreeding conditions in wild populations. Studies that demonstrate the action of such alleles, and infer their distribution and dynamics, are required to understand their potential impact on population viability and inform management responses. The Scottish population of red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), which currently totals &# 60; 60 breeding pairs and is of major conservation concern, has recently been affected by lethal blindness in nestlings. We used family data {{to show that the}} pattern of occurrence of blindness within and across affected families that produced blind nestlings was exactly 0 · 25, matching that expected given a single-locus autosomal <b>lethal</b> recessive <b>allele.</b> Furthermore, the observed distribution of blind nestlings within affected families did not differ from that expected given Mendelian inheritance of such an allele. Relatedness estimates showed that individuals from affected families were not more closely related to each other than they were to individuals from unaffected families that did not produce blind nestlings. Blind individuals tended to be less heterozygous than non-blind individuals, as expected if blindness was caused by the expression of a recessive allele under inbreeding. However, {{there was no difference in}} the variance in heterozygosity estimates, suggesting that some blind individuals were relatively outbred. These results suggest carriers of the blindness allele may be widely distributed across contemporary families rather than restricted to a single family lineage, implying that the allele has persisted across multiple generations. Blindness occurred at low frequency (affecting 1 · 6...|$|R
