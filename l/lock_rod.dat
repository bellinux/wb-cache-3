An external locking collar would be pinned to an internal <b>locking</b> <b>rod</b> that would be springloaded to slide the collar longitudinally over the gate to lock the gate in the closed position. The gate would be unlocked by sliding the collar axially against the spring load. To reduce the probability of inadvertent unlocking, the rod-and-collar mechanism would include two locking buttons. Optionally, the rod-and-collar mechanism could be replaced with an external locking mechanism based on a longer collar...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of polyamide 12 intramedullary rods in osteotomized humerus in cockerels (White Plymouth Rock) and analyze, by radiography and histopathology, bone consolidation and the formation of bone callus. Ten cockerels were subjected to transverse osteotomy of the right humeral diaphysis followed by the insertion of polyamide 12 <b>locked</b> <b>rods,</b> with two nails in each bone fragment. Radiographies obtained at the immediate pre and post-operative period, and every 7 days for 3 months revealed no perioperatory complications. Radiography revealed a radiopaque bone callus between the 4 th and 5 th week post-surgery. Histopathology detected an amphophylic material (polyamide 12 rod) in the intramedullary region and the proliferation of highly vascularized connective tissue between the rod and the cortical bone. This connective tissue was highly cellular with differentiation into osteoblasts. The collagen fibers varied from loose to dense and a differentiated bone matrix, containing osteocytes in gaps and the development of bone marrow, was also observed; indicating the formation of a bone callus without signs of implant rejection. The polyamide 12 intramedullary rod was effective in the stabilization of the fractures used in this experimental model, with no rejection reaction for at least 90 days...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{describe}} the technique and report the results and complications of percutaneous femoral rotational osteotomy, secured with a trochanteric-entry, <b>locked</b> intramedullary <b>rod,</b> in adolescents with femoral anteversion. Our series comprised an IRB approved, retrospective, consecutive series of 85 osteotomies (57 patients), followed to implant removal. The average age at surgery was 13.3  years (range 8.8 – 18.3) with a female-to-male ratio of 2.8 : 1. The minimum follow-up was 2  years. Eighty-three osteotomies healed primarily. Two patients, subsequently found to have vitamin D deficiency, broke screws and developed nonunions; both healed after repeat reaming and rod exchange and vitamin supplementation. Preoperative symptoms, including in-toeing gait, tripping and anterior knee pain or patellar instability, were resolved consistently. We did not observe significant growth disturbance or osteonecrosis. We noted a 12.5  % incidence of broken interlocking screws; this {{did not affect the}} correction or outcome except for the two patients mentioned above. This prompted a switch from a standard screw (core diameter =  3  mm) to a threaded bolt (core diameter =  3.7  mm). These results have led this technique to replace the use of plates or blade plates for rotational osteotomies.|$|R
40|$|Traumatic rupture of the {{quadriceps}} tendon {{by itself}} is not an uncommon clinical condition. However, its association with concurrent ipsilateral closed distal tibia oblique fracture is exceedingly rare with only one previously reported case in English literature. The dual diagnosis of this atypical combination of injury may be masked by pain and immobilization of the more obvious fracture and may be missed, unless the treating physician maintains a high index of suspicion. Suprapatellar knee pain {{with or without a}} palpable gap in the quadriceps tendon and inability to straight leg raise in the setting of a distal tibia fracture should raise concern, but if initial treatment employs a long-leg splint the knee symptoms may be muted. In this report, we describe this unusual combination of injury in a 67 -year-old male patient who sustained a trivial twisting injury to the leg. The aim of this report is to raise awareness and emphasize the importance of thorough and repeated clinical examinations in the presence of distracting injuries. Despite the complexity of the problem, standard techniques for quadriceps tendon repair using transpatellar bone tunnels following <b>locked</b> intramedullary <b>rodding</b> of the tibia fracture may lead to optimal outcomes...|$|R

30|$|Three of 59 (5.1 %) had {{an oblique}} Kirschner wire placed across the {{osteotomy}} for additional rotational stability.

In each of the cases, the wire was used for perceived rotational instability at the time of surgery after the <b>locking</b> of the <b>rod</b> and was used in cases where the rod did not provide compression at the osteotomy site. In one case, the bone was felt to be osteopenic proximally in the tibia, and the proximal locking construct through the rod was considered inadequate to hold the rotation, so a supplemental semitubular plate was placed at the osteotomy site. Later, patients in the series were fixed with a nail that permitted axial compression of the osteotomy.|$|R

The connection between the displacements of stock and free end of the beam is examined. The relationships between the sizes of rods, which ensure the correct work of sensor, are obtained on this base...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN. Development {{and testing}} of a new spinal implant-locking {{mechanism}} based on the special properties of nickel-titanium alloy. OBJECTIVE. To develop a new self-tightening locking mechanism to reduce fretting corrosion at implant junctions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. All current implant locking involves tightening of a nut against the rod and screw head to form a coupling. Particulate debris is generated, and the coupling becomes loose because of wear between the <b>rod</b> and <b>locking</b> mechanism (fretting). To avoid this fretting, a new locking mechanism with an automatic retightening effect based on the superelastic and shape-memory properties of nickel-titanium alloy has been developed. METHOD. The new coupling made of nickel-titanium alloy will tightly <b>lock</b> the <b>rod</b> when temperature increases to 50 °C (shape-memory effect). If fretting occurs, the coupling will further tighten itself around the rod (superelastic effect). This new coupling is mechanically tested against 4 current implant couplings. RESULTS. In axial compression, conventional couplings failed between 570 and 740 N, while the new coupling reached 800 N without loosening. In axial rotation, conventional devices failed between 1. 8 and 5. 3 Nm, while the new coupling reached 6. 5 Nm without failure. During testing, the retightening effect could {{be seen on the}} force versus displacement plot. CONCLUSIONS. To our knowledge, the self-tightening coupling is a new concept not previously described and is attributable to the superior superelastic effect of the new coupling. This implant coupling {{has the potential to be}} used as a very low profile system and also in nonfusion technologies in which demands on the coupling would not higher without the protection of spinal fusion. © 2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} the use of {{antegrade}} intramedullary rods in adolescent fractures (or osteotomies), the main concerns relate to the risk of iatrogenic osteonecrosis or disturbance of femoral neck growth [9]. Some authors have advocated against the use of antegrade rods in adolescents [10]. However, reported cases of osseous necrosis have been rare and subclinical, sometimes noted at the time of rod removal. Review of the literature implicates piriformis fossa entry techniques that were performed for introduction of straight rods [11, 12]. In an extensive meta-analysis of 1277 publications regarding <b>locked</b> antegrade <b>rods</b> in skeletally immature patients [13, 14], MacNeil et al. [15] extracted 19 relevant articles and concluded that the risk of necrosis was 2  % with piriformis entry, 1.4  % {{at the tip of the}} trochanter and 0  % utilizing a lateral trochanteric-entry site. This was the impetus for the development of the lateral trochanteric-entry point rods for trauma [1]. Stevens et al. [16] reported the use of the Philips intramedullary rod (Philips/Biomet) for 40 elective rotational osteotomies, with no observed growth disturbance in the femoral head or neck. The findings are consistent with recent trauma literature; in a series of 241 adolescent patients with 246 femoral fractures, Crosby et al. [17] reported only 2.2  % of clinically relevant growth disturbance and no femoral head osteonecrosis. We identified no clinically significant incidents of growth disturbance using the Pedi-Nail (Orthopediatrics, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) which is a lateral trochanteric-entry point device. We defined the threshold of “significant” as > 5  mm change in the center of femoral head—tip of trochanter distance and > 10  mm in relative femoral length as compared to the opposite side. Based upon our measurements of the center of femoral head to trochanteric tip distance, we concluded that the risk of causing proximal femoral growth disturbance in children and adolescent patients has been mitigated effectively by current implant designs that avoid the piriformis fossa perforation.|$|R
40|$|This senior {{design project}} is {{sponsored}} by Newport News Shipbuilding. The objective of this project is to design a pipe hanger system that could be installed during initial fabrication while still allowing adjustment when the pipe path deviates from the initial drawings. The design must be cheap and utilize already existing parts. One key constraint is to hold a load of 250 pounds and withstand a velocity between 100 - 120 inches per second. The original design created utilizes a C-channel track attached to the ceiling and a spring locking mechanism to provide flexibility. This final design eliminated the spring device with a nut and <b>rod</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism and a threaded rod between the C-channel track and the marine style pipe hanger. This design was tested against the constraints given by NNS, using the program ANSYs workbench. The design {{was found to be}} able to withstand 100 - 120 inches per second velocity without faltering. The design was found to be able to withstand up to 6014 psi. Once the computer testing was complete, the total cost was calculated. This was estimated originally at a range of $ 50 - $ 60. The end price was calculated at $ 90, this was without the track. For the constraint of a cheap product to be achieved, the design will need to be altered to use either cheaper materials, cheaper tools, or cheaper components. [URL]...|$|R
