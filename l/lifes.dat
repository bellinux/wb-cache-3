5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still <b>lifes,</b> working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas. His still <b>lifes</b> of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh painted {{several groups}} of still <b>lifes</b> in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he {{completed}} numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and {{showed no sign}} of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still <b>lifes,</b> which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still <b>lifes</b> from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E

This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of relationship between two variables: the contribution of MIS in 15 specific <b>life</b> domains and the contribution of MIS to overall quality of <b>life</b> (QoL). We examined bottom-up spillover theory with original and our additional <b>life</b> domains. Eleven <b>life</b> domains derived from previous research include: leisure <b>life,</b> family <b>life,</b> friend <b>life,</b> cultural <b>life,</b> work <b>life,</b> community <b>life,</b> consumer <b>life,</b> financial <b>life,</b> health <b>life,</b> safety <b>life,</b> and self-life.

5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still <b>lifes</b> and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still <b>lifes</b> and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{permanent}} exhibition of paintings by Lodewijk Bruckman (1903–1995). Bruckman lived in Bellingwolde {{in a hotel}} opposite to the museum from 1987 to 1989. He donated 21 paintings to the Bellingwedde municipality in 1988. These paintings, which are now exhibited in the museum, are mostly still <b>lifes</b> in a style which is described as realistic, surrealistic, or magic realistic.|$|E

5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still <b>lifes</b> to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, {{until his death}} in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still <b>lifes,</b> beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still <b>lifes,</b> which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Hunter made a {{visit to}} Paris, funded by his {{earnings}} as an illustrator. He {{was inspired by the}} numerous artistic experiences there, and became fully resolved to take up oil painting. When he returned to San Francisco in 1905, he began preparing for his first solo exhibition, which was to be held the following year. However, Hunter's early work was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards, settling in Glasgow. Initially he continued to make his living there primarily as an illustrator. His oil painting began with still <b>lifes</b> on black backgrounds, influenced by the Dutch style.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, Haefliger's extramarital affair, {{which had}} lasted {{for over a}} decade, came to an end. Bellette and Haefliger left Australia {{intending}} to divorce quietly, but were reconciled. After a year in Paris they settled in Majorca, living first in Deià before buying {{a house in the}} hamlet of C'an Baxu. Bellette painted landscapes and still <b>lifes</b> that reflected a Spanish influence, and showed periodically in Australia through the 1960s. The year she moved to Majorca {{turned out to be the}} last year in which she exhibited work outside Australia. The couple visited in 1970 and 1975, and Bellette returned once more in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still <b>lifes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still <b>lifes</b> in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E

5|$|Ethel Sands (6 July 1873 – 19 March 1962) was an American-born {{artist and}} hostess {{who lived in}} England from her early childhood. She studied art in Paris for several years under Eugène Carrière, {{and it was there}} that she met Anna Hope Hudson (Nan), her life partner. Her works were {{influenced}} by the artist Edouard Vuillard and Walter Sickert, and were generally of still <b>lifes</b> and interior scenes, many of which are of Château d'Auppegard that she shared with Hudson in France. Sands was a Fitzroy Street Group and London Group member. Her works are in the collections of museums, the National Portrait Gallery, London and public collections. During both world wars, she nursed soldiers; she established a hospital in France in World War I. In 1916 she was made a citizen of England.|$|E
5|$|Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, {{painted in}} 1821, {{featured}} numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All {{but one of}} the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although {{he was one of the}} most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still <b>lifes.</b> He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.|$|E

5|$|Hunter {{began to}} achieve limited success after {{a trip to}} the Etaples art colony in {{northern}} France in 1914. Here, inspired by French art and the local landscape, he began to develop the style and ability that would later identify him as a colourist. However, the onset of the First World War forced him to return to Scotland, where his work became noticed by Alexander Reid of Reid & Lefevre. In 1915, Hunter held his first one-man exhibition with Reid in Glasgow. Hunter's work at this stage of his career focused primarily on still <b>lifes,</b> inspired by Chardin, Kalf and Manet. During the 1920s, Hunter began to be associated with a group of three other artists: John Duncan Fergusson, F. C. B. Cadell, and Samuel Peploe. The four of them became known as the Scottish Colourists, although the term was not used until 1948, by which time only Fergusson was still alive.|$|E
5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of <b>Lifes</b> July 1964 issue.|$|E
