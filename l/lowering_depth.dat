40|$|The {{technique}} of definition of refrigerating capacity of self-acting cooling plants applied {{in areas with}} a severe climate as devices <b>lowering</b> <b>depth</b> of soils freezing is described. These devices are applied in the struggle with ice, critical shrinkage of the artificial structures and other phenomena connected with ground thawing.

30|$|The {{second part}} of imaging {{experiment}} was a real-time single-hole reflection imaging experiment. Since the time window of the system was short, only 60  ns, and the vertical <b>lowering</b> <b>depth</b> was also spliced, namely, the 7 – 35  m length was divided into two measurements, so a complete image was composed of six parts. In order to ensure the repeatability of the experiment and to eliminate the false signals caused by external interference and system’s own noise waves, two tests were carried out when the system ran {{from top to bottom}} from 7 to 35  m. Moreover, the feature points of each test result were compared to ensure the validity of the experiment.|$|E
