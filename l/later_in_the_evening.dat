Linda later demands Babe return the money to the Cokers to avoid police interference, but Babe neglects the task so Mick warns her. She tries to earn the money by gambling and blackmailing Abi, but she mocks Babe's desperation.

They later have a heart-to-heart where Babe explains that the money was placed into a bank account for Linda's infant son, Ollie Carter (Charlie) and says how she is cruel because it makes her feel better. Linda subsequently allows Babe to move back into the Vic.|$|E

Sarita and Taylor Wilde had their third match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion, with Sarita once again coming out victorious. Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact! as a face, when she answered the challenge of TNA Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non-title match, Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact! when, despite losing to her and Love in the first round match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, Sarita claimed that Sky was a loser, and {{would never be able to}} beat her. On the December 23 episode of Impact!, Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but was forced to miss the match, after being attacked backstage by Sarita. The following week, Sarita defeated Sky in a Strap match.

5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} {{more than anyone}} that Lesnar could not win, trying {{to talk him out}} of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn into a fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

The jury failed to agree, so a second trial was held. At the re-trial Taylor was found not guilty.|$|R
