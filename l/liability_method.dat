40|$|Purpose: The Ministry of Finance {{issued the}} new China {{accounting}} standards on February 15, 2006 (CAS 2006), which require the listed companies {{to use the}} balance sheet <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> for the income tax accounting. Thus, it give {{us an opportunity to}} investigate the earnings management of listed companies from the perspective of income tax. Under the balance sheet <b>liability</b> <b>method,</b> because conforming earnings management strategies and nonconforming earnings management strategies have different income tax cost and the current income payable will also vary, the listed companies need to choose conforming earnings management and nonconforming earnings management. Our research just try to investigate the relationship between the listed companies’ income tax planning and earnings management on the background of this new system. Design/methodology/approach: Our research approach combines theoretical analysis and empirical analysis. This paper first make a deep theoretical analysis on the listed companies’ choice between pretax earnings management activities that have current income tax consequences (book-tax ‘conforming earnings management’) and earnings management activities that do not have current income tax consequences (book-tax ‘nonconforming earnings management’),and then we exemplify our theory. Next, we come up with two hypotheses based on the theoretical analysis, build up a restatement model and conduct the empirical examination. The empirical analysis employs the method of descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Findings: When engaging in earnings management, listed companies will trade off conforming and nonconforming earnings management from the perspective of income tax cost. We find that managers’ motivations and purposes will influence the choice. On the one hand, when companies are facing the punishment of the suspension or termination of the listing for three consecutive losses, they will have a great incentive to manage earnings in order to turn losses into gains. In this case, companies can’t wait to manage earnings to increase incomes and won’t consider income tax cost too much. And if they employ nonconforming earnings management bringing greater book-tax differences, it may increase the probability of being detected and earnings management behavior may also be found. Thus, in this motivation, listed companies will employ more conforming earnings management. On the other hand, when companies engage in fraudulent activities, they will avoid the use of earnings management strategies which bringing greater book-tax difference to avoid penalty cost associating with fraud being found, since greater book-tax difference will possibly attract regulatory agencies’ and auditors’ attention therefore lead to the fraud being found. In this motivation, listed companies will employ more conforming earnings management. In summary, the main conclusion is when the company has motivations to turn losses into gains and has the motivation to avoid penalty cost associated with fraud being found, the company prefers to employ more conforming earnings management strategies. Research limitations/implications: The limitation in our research is as follows. First, we mainly focus on the conforming and nonconforming earnings management when the listed companies restate their financial statements. However after the issue of CAS 2006, many listed companies still not disclose income tax account, which restrict our sample. Second, without the acquisition of private companies’ data, our empirical results may have some errors. We will solve these problems in our future study. Practical / social implications: Based on the sample of restatement companies, our research explores the listed companies’ choice of conforming and nonconforming earnings management under different motivations, which provides our study with new perspective and theoretical evidence. Meanwhile, because this paper focuses on restate firms’ earnings management, the results are helpful for regulators to strengthen the administration of listed companies’ restatement, as well as decrease the damage of restatement on our capital market. Finally, our results indicate that when the company has motivations to turn losses into gains and has motivations to avoid penalty cost associated with fraud being found, the company prefers to employ more conforming earnings management strategies. It will help us to deeply understand the impact of the accounting processes of income tax under the balance sheet <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> on the listed companies, therefore provide companies’ income tax planning with essential empirical and theoretical evidences. Originality/value: So far, earnings management researches in academia mostly focus on the cost, motivations, means and results of earnings management, there are few studies discuss the choice of earnings management strategies and how different purposes and motivations affect the choice from the perspective of income tax. The issue of CAS 2006 offers an opportunity for this research. This paper use restatement as sample to investigate the choice of conforming earnings management and nonconforming earnings management under different motivations and purposes for the first time. And not only study the effect that earnings management have on income tax, but also study the effect of different earnings management motivations on the choice of earnings management strategies. </p...|$|E

However, subthreshold psychotic symptoms characterized by attenuated delusions and hallucinations also occur in healthy individuals from the general population. A body of evidence suggests that this phenomenon represents a continuum of schizophrenia, with severe and attenuated symptoms sharing a common genetic etiology. Hallucinations are one subthreshold psychotic symptom in which a clear continuum has been observed. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess if subthreshold hallucinatory experiences and schizophrenia share genetic <b>liability.</b> <b>Method</b> 3, 028 participants were administered the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale (LSHS), which measures a predisposition to hallucinations, through Genes for Good, an online study of health and behavior. A genome-wide association study was conducted for subthreshold hallucinatory experiences. A polygenic risk score was then used to predict subthreshold hallucinatory experiences and assess the existence of a genetic correlation between the two. Results No reliable associations with hallucinatory experiences were found that reached genome-wide significance. None of the 124 previously established significantly associated schizophrenia risk variants were found to be significant after correcting for multiple testing. A polygenic risk score based on genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia was unable to successfully predict hallucinatory experiences with scores from the LSHS. Conclusions No substantial evidence was found to support the association between genetic liability for subclinical hallucinatory experiences and schizophrenia. The effect between subthreshold hallucinatory experiences and schizophrenia was too small to detect in our sample using a polygenic risk score...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo tem o objetivo de discorrer sobre a responsabilidade civil do administrador de sociedade anônima, destacar os posicionamentos doutrinário e jurisprudencial sobre o tema em espécie, bem como demonstrar a modalidade de responsabilidade civil a ser aplicada para a hipótese de o administrador de S/A que desrespeita o preceito estabelecido no art. 158, II, da Lei 6. 404 / 76. A justificativa para este estudo existe porque o mencionado dispositivo legal não evidencia qual o sistema de responsabilidade civil se aplica à espécie. Prova disto é que se trata de tema bastante tormentoso na doutrina e que, apenas recentemente, passou a ser encarado pelos Tribunais. Em relação às hipóteses suscitadas neste trabalho, nota-se que uma parte da {{literatura}} especializada entende que a hipótese legal específica do tema estudado cuida de responsabilidade civil objetiva. Outra parcela, em posição oposta à primeira, assegura que a responsabilidade do administrador, em tais casos, é subjetiva com inversão do ônus da prova. Há, ainda, uma terceira corrente, antagônica às anteriores, que sustenta a aplicação da responsabilidade civil subjetiva clássica ao administrador que agir com violação da lei ou do estatuto. Daí porque se faz necessário um estudo aprofundado da matéria, a fim de definir, com precisão, qual a modalidade de responsabilidade civil aplicada à hipótese proposta neste trabalho. O resultado da pesquisa, após a utilização de metodologia científica dedutiva, aponta que a responsabilidade civil subjetiva clássica é a modalidade de responsabilidade civil a ser aplicada ao administrador da companhia para o caso de ofensa ao artigo 158, II, da Lei 6. 404 / 76 This study aims {{to discuss}} the liability of the corporation administrator, highlight the doctrinal and jurisprudential positions on the issue, as well as demonstrate the <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> to be applied in case that the Anonymous Society administrator disrespects the rule laid down in Article 158, II, of Law 6. 404 / 76. The rationale for this study exists because of the aforementioned legal provision does not show which liability system applies to the case. Proof {{of this is that}} the subject is quite a stormy theme in doctrine and that only recently has begun to be viewed by the courts. Regarding the hypotheses raised in this paper, it is noted that part of the literature considers that the specific legal hypothesis of the study theme takes care of objective liability. Another portion arranged opposite to the first, says the administrator liability in such cases is subjective by reversing the burden of proof. There is also a third current, antagonistic to the above, which supports the application of classical subjective liability to the administrator that acts in breach of any law or statute. That is why a thorough study of the matter is necessary in order to define, with precision, what the is legal nature applied to the hypothesis proposed in this paper. The search result after the use of deductive scientific methodology indicates that classical subjective liability is the <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> to apply to the administrator of the company in case of offense to Article 158, II, of Law 6. 404 / 7...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{estimate}} the heritability of liability to epistaxis in the southern African Thoroughbred population. Data of all horses that suffered epistaxis while racing in southern Africa and Mauritius from 1986 to 2002 and involving 1252 bleeders were analysed. Pedigree data covering the period 1960 - 1986 was used as required to calculate the incidence of bleeding amongst ancestors of the post- 1986 era. Only pedigrees of horses that raced were {{included in this study}} as {{it was not possible to}} predict whether non-runners would have bled had they raced. Consequently all non-runners and also those that raced overseas in countries where bleeding occurrence was not recorded, were excluded. The heritability of <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> as described by Falconer (1989) was used to estimate the relative importance of heredity and environment. For the period investigated, the population incidence for epistaxis in southern African horses was 2. 1 %. The estimation of heritability of liability showed that 1 st-degree relatives had a figure of 55. 4 %. Second-degree relatives had a heritability of 41. 3 % and 3 rd-degree relatives came in at 30. 4 %. The heritability of liability shown in this study could be regarded as being at the lower end of the range but could be appreciably higher. The data depict horses that bled almost exclusively on race days, as only a small percentage (~ 5 %) was reported as having bled during exercise. Accordingly, the full extent of epistaxis amongst racing Thoroughbreds in southern Africa is difficult to gauge. It is clear that epistaxis in the racing Thoroughbred has a strong genetic basis. It is suggested that horses showing frank bleeding from the nostrils after racing or exercise be suspended, and not used for breeding purposes. This should result in relatively fast progress being made towards eradicating this costly scourge of the modern Thoroughbred racehorse...|$|E

40|$|The pension actuary {{has always}} been on unsure ground in {{attempting}} to identify by source experience gains (and losses) in a pension plan. His approach as usually been more intuitive than scientific. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe an actuarially acceptable and mathematically definitive method for allocating ains by source. T HE pension actuary's interest in gains analysis has been heightened by the new requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Not only must the experience gain or loss of a pension plan be reported (unless an aggregate cost method is used), but the enrolled actuary must certify that in his opinion the valuation assumptions "(i) are in the aggregate r asonably related to the experience of the plan and to reasonable expectations; and (ii) represent his best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. '' 1 It is now more important than ever for him to evaluate and understand the effect on the plan experience of the actuarial assumptions, and, by implication, the effect of each assumption. This paper will describe a general approach to gains determination that is not only mathematically correct but practical as well. The approach is essentially automatic and can be used for any pension plan, regardless of complexity or funding method. The approach also allows the pension actuary to determine the experience changes in a pension plan by source with such accuracy that any deviation between the sum of the individual-ly determined changes and the total change invariably can be traced to faulty valuation technique. The paper is organized in four parts. The first part deals with plans funded on an individual cost method, such as entry age normal or unit credit.

40|$|Claims {{resulting}} from delays and acceleration on construction projects are inevitable. To prepare a delay/acceleration claim, a forensic schedule analysis {{needs to be}} performed. In this analysis, the impacts of different delays/accelerations are assessed and the responsibility of each party is calculated. The analysis usually involves CPM schedule calculations using a number of methods adopted by the industry. Although some of these methods are more accurate than others, they usually produce different results depending on the available data and the user’s point of view. There {{is a need for}} an integrated framework that enhances the documentation of progress data, and that performs forensic schedule analysis and damage quantification in a more timely, accurate, and cost effective manner. There is also a need to integrate the forensic schedule analysis function with the more routinely performed scheduling and monitoring functions. From this perspective, the present research introduces an integrated framework for progress data documentation, forensic schedule analysis, and damage quantification. The main objectives of this research are to: i) Identify delays/accelerations and document their related information as they emerge; ii) Determine the impact of delays/accelerations on the project duration and determine responsibilities; iii) Quantify damages for contractors and owners; and iv) Integrate and automate the process of schedule analysis and damage quantification to help minimize time, cost and errors. The methodology adopted for this research includes a review of the literature, the design and implementation of a delay/acceleration and cost database, a schedule analysis module, a direct cost module, an impact cost module, an overhead cost module, and a liquidated cost module. The event identity concept (EIC) and the equal <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> (ELM) were introduced to document delays and apportion concurrency entitlements, respectively. An Isolated Daily Window Analysis Technique (IDWAT) was also introduced and used as part of the framework. The framework assists {{in the creation of the}} as-built, as-planned, and of any adjusted schedule at any day of a project’s life. It also facilitates forensic schedule analysis using essentially any analysis technique. MS Project, Access, and VBA were used to implement the framework; MS project was used as both a scheduling tool and as an interface for the user, while Access was used to create the database. Using MS Project as an interface made the forensic schedule analysis function totally integrated with the more routinely performed scheduling and monitoring functions. The VBA was used to implement the schedule analysis and cost calculation modules as well as to integrate the different components of the framework. The framework was tested using manually calculated cases and by comparing its results with those of previous studies. The results of the framework were reasonable and always resulted in a total delay equal to the sum of the parties’ shares of the delay. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} entitled "Deferred Tax and its Conceptual Complexities" addresses two immensely {{complex and}} intricate issues of deferred taxes and business combinations. Its aim {{is not only}} to analyse the development of accounting standards both individually and in mutual dependence, but also, with the help of scholarly works and practical reflections, to draw conclusions on the current state of accounting for deferred tax and on the process of international convergence. In order to achieve this goal, the following approaches were used: close reading of accounting standards as well as professional papers, analysis of the past development from both historical and regional perspective, and deduction of the author's personal conclusions using illustrative charts and a practical example. The dissertation is composed of three interlocking parts looking at deferred tax on its own, the deferred tax in business combinations and deferred tax in a broader context. It is evident, that deferred tax lies {{at the core of the}} whole study; however, it does not mean that the ultimate purpose was to dwell on its tiniest details. On the contrary, details, such as the distinction between enacted and substantively enacted tax rates and laws, are pointed out only to shed additional light on the general situation [...] especially as the short-term convergence project on deferred taxes is coming to its end [...] and on the role of rules versus principles in the current accounting standards, especially on the role of the true and fair view principle. In the first part, the fundamental building blocks (such as the methods of accounting for deferred taxes and the various differences) are introduced from the viewpoint of standards applicable in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Czech Republic, and of International Financial Reporting Standards. All the standards are first discussed in chronological order with only the defining issues being analysed; afterwards, the standards are grouped according to the relevant standard setters and discussed in greater detail. The overall picture summarises the main points of the first three chapters. The second part provides the reader first with a general overview of deferred taxes in business combinations, and then focuses on deferred tax assets and the temporary difference arising from the initial recognition of goodwill. The conceptual inconsistencies and the gradually increasing complexity are portrayed using illustrative charts and the results of a simplified practical example based on the data taken from the standards themselves. The conclusion of this part is quite simple: something needs to be done. The question is what. The third part tries to provide the answer. The tentative conclusion is that the path followed by UK standards might currently be the most principle-based, and therefore it could be worth looking at; moreover, it can show that the effort devoted to the reconciliation of US and international standards might be worthless unless it also reconsiders the logic of using the balance sheet <b>liability</b> <b>method</b> with comprehensive allocation but without discounting. The competition among individual standard setters has proved to be of a great importance as it demonstrates that the acceptable alternatives are working not only in the minds of academics, but also in the real world. Finally, the issues of individual responsibility and professional judgement are raised, the pros and cons weighed, and the direction for further research indicated...|$|E

However, findings are extremely limited with respect to physicians' specific explanatory behaviours and what might be regarded as a breach of the physicians' duty to explain in an actual medical setting. This study sought to identify physicians' explanatory behaviours that {{may be related to the}} physicians' legal <b>liability.</b> <b>Methods</b> We analysed legal decisions of medical malpractice cases between 1990 and 2009 in which the pivotal issue was the physician's duty to explain (366 cases). To identify factors related to the breach of the physician's duty to explain, an analysis was undertaken based on acknowledged breaches with regard to the physician's duty to explain to the patient according to court decisions. Additionally, to identify predictors of physicians' behaviours in breach of the duty to explain, logistic regression analysis was performed. Results When the physician's explanation was given before treatment or surgery (p = 0. 006), when it was relevant or specific (p = 0. 000), and when the patient's consent was obtained (p = 0. 002), the explanation was less likely to be deemed inadequate or a breach of the physician's duty to explain. Patient factors related to physicians' legally problematic explanations were patient age and gender. One physician factor was related to legally problematic physician explanations, namely the number of physicians involved in the patient's treatment. Conclusion These findings may be useful in improving physician-patient communication in the medical setting. </p...|$|R

A comprehensive appreciation of its effects on haematology vs other anti-malarials is needed in view of potential safety <b>liabilities.</b> <b>Methods</b> Individual-patient data analysis conducted on a database from seven randomized controlled trials conducted in sub-Saharan African comparing AS&AQ to reference treatments in uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients of all ages. Haematologic values (white cells total and neutrophil counts, haemoglobin/haematocrit, platelets) were analysed as both continuous and categorical variables for their occurrence, (severity grade 1 - 4) and changes during follow-up. Risks and trends were calculated using multivariate logistic random effect models. Results 4, 502 patients (72 % < 5 years old), from 13 sites in nine countries with 28 -day follow-up were treated with AS&AQ (45 %) or a comparator (other forms of ACT accounted for 27 %, other combination 12 %, mono-therapies 16 %). Pre-treatment leucopaenia (3 %) and neutropaenia (6 %) were infrequent; anaemia was common (39 %). The treatment-emergent adverse events incidence (TEAE = condition not present or less severe pre-treatment) was 11 % for neutropaenia, 6 % for thrombocytopaenia with AS&AQ and not different from treatment groups; anaemia was higher with AS&AQ (20 %) {{or other forms of}} ACT (22 %) than in non-artemisinin groups (4 %, p = 0. 001). Multivariate analysis showed that the risk of anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, and leucopaenia decreased with follow-up time, while neutropaenia increased; the risk of anaemia and thrombocytopaenia increased with higher baseline parasitaemia and parasitological reappearance. White cells total count was not a good surrogate for neutropaenia. No systematic significant difference between treatments was detected. Older patients were at lower risks. Conclusion The effects of AS&AQ on haematologic parameters were not different from those of other anti-malarial treatments used in sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis provides the basis for a broader evaluation of haematology following anti-malarial treatment. Continuing monitoring of haematologic safety on larger databases is required...|$|R

It is proved that the Roman law by means of cases managed to develop the basic conceptual apparatus of the institute of private legal liability as well as principles of determining guilt as a fundamental criterion for such liability. It is proved that the subsequent development of civilisltic science and civil legislation in Russia testifies to the borrowing of the Roman law general principles regarding civil liability and guilt as its condition. It is shown that in the Soviet period the civillegal concept of guilt evolved under the negative attitude to many provisions of the science of private law developed in the prerevolutionary period. Analysis of Chapter 25 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and 	first and foremost of Article 401 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation indicates that both the current state of the civil guilt doctrine and the legal definition of this category are based on the conceptual apparatus developed during many centuries.

How large has the safety net become? Walter and Weinberg (2002) measured and examined the size of the safety net as it stood in 1999. We estimate the size of the safety net as of the end of 2009, after the creation of a number of government programs meant to back financial <b>liabilities.</b> We use <b>methods</b> similar to those employed by Walter and Weinberg and find that the safety net has expanded significantly.

40|$|Prudence in {{accounting}} is a corner-stone concept which has shaped accounting theory, {{as well as}} ordinary financial reporting. Thus, on the quantitative side of the study, we developed a proxy for accounting conservatism, namely the degree of uncertainty associated with the settling of a company's obligations. To this purpose, we hand-collected accounting data for 388 business groups from 17 European countries. For these companies we computed the provisions-to-liabilities ratio (PLR) and performed several group tests, according to the following original classification of national accounting cultures. The results indicate that companies incorporated in countries that are classified as ‘conservative' do assign a significantly higher degree of uncertainty to their total amount of <b>liabilities.</b> mixed research <b>methods,</b> accounting conservatism, European companies, national accounting culture, international harmonization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} one of the biggest {{problems}} in non-life insurance and that is forecasting outstanding claims <b>liabilities.</b> Chain ladder <b>method</b> is probably the most often used method for estimating outstanding liabilities. Firstly, we show classic chain ladder method and its deterministic and stochastic form. Secondly, we introduce relatively new method, double chain ladder method which comes from chain ladder method, but in addition it considers number of reported claims, that allow us to count RBNS reserve more precisely and also to count IBNR and RBNS reserves separately. In the end we apply both methods on the real data. We compute point estimate of the reserve by chain ladder method and by double chain ladder method and compare the results.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{effective}} method for simultaneously estimating the parameters and assigning process affiliation in case of incomplete field data from self-exciting point processes on a network. This problem comes from the demand for law enforcement agencies to identify gang affiliation {{in the case of}} unsolved crimes in an area of highly complex gang rivalry activity. We present a new framework we name the Estimate & Score Algorithm for possible application to field data. By testing the method on simulated datasets we can understand its performance features and <b>liabilities.</b> The <b>method</b> is an iterative procedure in which process parameters are estimated alternately with the calculation of network affiliation probabilities. We identify several useful ‘score functions’ for calculating the network affiliations. We also compare the use of unknown events in the parameter estimation. One upshot of our analysis is that the inclusion of unknown events may increase the accuracy of the parameter estimation. Several score functions are considered and the Forward Backward score function shows the most promise with comparable results to that of the Stomakhin-Short-Bertozzi method of [24] in the parameter regime tested. The score function calculation is a direct method that does not rely on solving a variational problem, and thus is more computationally efficient than [24].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{liability}} concerns {{centered around}} maternity care have widespread public health implications, as restrictions in physician scope of practice may threaten quality of {{and access to}} care in the current climate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine national trends in prenatal care settings based on medical <b>liability</b> climate. <b>Methods</b> Analysis of prenatal visits in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1997 to 2004 (N = 21, 454). To assess changes in rates of prenatal visits over time, we used the linear trend test. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was developed to determine characteristics associated with visits made to hospital outpatient departments. Results In regions of the country with high medical liability (N = 11, 673), the relative number, or proportion, of all prenatal visits occurring in hospital outpatient departments increased from 11. 8 % in 1997 – 1998 to 19. 4 % in 2003 – 2004 (p Conclusion There has been a shift in prenatal care from obstetrician's offices to safety net settings in regions of the country with high medical liability. These findings provide strong indirect evidence that the medical liability crisis is affecting patterns of obstetric practice and ultimately patient access to care. </p...|$|R
40|$|On 1 January 2014 the new Civil Code, {{the most}} {{important}} piece of legislation, has come into effect. It {{is a part of}} large recodification of the Czech civil law. This thesis, "The impact of the new Civil Code on liability insurance", points out the most significant changes and the implications which effects, among others, the insurance sector. The first part of the thesis addresses mostly the theoretical concept of liability, the elemental preconditions of <b>liability</b> and <b>methods</b> of compensation for material and immaterial damage, including comparison of claim rights under former legal norm and the current legal norm. It also mentions the ambiguity in law in case of compensation for work-related injuries and occupational diseases. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to describing the process of implementation of the new Civil Code to operation of insurance companies from both legal and financial point of view. This includes evaluation {{of the impact of the}} changes on settlement of compensation claims for immaterial damage from the first available data. The third part is focused on the characteristics of liability insurance and its construction. It includes basic breakdown by legal bindings and a description of types of liability insurances. The conclusion contains overall assessment of liability insurance on the Czech insurance market...|$|R
