5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E

25|$|The Huainanzi has two {{versions}} of the earlier Zhuangzi zither string resonance analogy. Both Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 omit the reference to Lu Ju and his disciple who attracted yang to <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and yin to make ice, and each account adds a different interpretation. The shorter version refers to the Dao's mysterious ineffability.|$|E

25|$|Karaite Judaism or Karaism is a Jewish {{denomination}} {{that began}} in eighth century Baghdad to form a separate sect that rejected of the Oral Torah and Talmud, and placed sole reliance on the Tanakh as scripture. Thus, for example, Karaite understood Exodus 35:3 ("Do not <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day") as forbidding {{the use of any}} kind of fire on the Sabbath, including fires lit {{before the start of the}} Sabbath, which are permitted by the Oral Law. Karaites also do not adhere to widespread customs such as the donning of tefillin and the prohibition against eating milk and meat together on the grounds that such practices are grounded in the Oral Law.|$|E
500|$|It {{became a}} sports media sensation, {{especially}} {{given that the}} New York Mets had won the division in 2006 with relative ease. The claim was widely reported, often without {{the second part of}} the quote ("only on paper"). USA Today columnist Hal Bodley opined, [...] "The Phillies have needed someone to <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> especially in April. Rollins' bold, if not arrogant, prediction might just do that." [...] During the first half of the season, it appeared Rollins had spoken prematurely, as the Mets jumped out to an early divisional lead. On June 28, Rollins had a four-hit game against the Cincinnati Reds, including a game-tying triple. The triple was Rollins' 10th, which gave him his fifth career [...] "quadruple–double".|$|E

There, he marries Sitti Aminah, a young woman who, though only 20 years of age, has been married and divorced three times. Their marriage does not last long, and the man leaves Aminah {{three days before the}} Eid al-Fitr holiday. However, his expensive set of black clothing, which he must wear during the Eid ceremonies, is accidentally left at Aminah's home. Pretending to be sick, the man goes to Aminah and asks her to cover him with clothing and <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> to keep him warm. When she starts a fire in the kitchen, the man escapes with his black clothes. The story was first published in 1936, in issues 100 and 101, volume 14, of Pandji Poestaka.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox {{and some}} Conservative {{authorities}} rule that turning electric devices {{on or off}} is prohibited as a melakhah; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s). One view is that tiny sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute <b>lighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> (category 37). If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may be considered as <b>a</b> type of <b>fire</b> that falls under both <b>lighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11). Turning lights off would be extinguishing <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> (category 36).|$|R
500|$|The {{invasion}} angle {{began on}} the May 9 episode of Raw, when Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff made a statement regarding the pay-per-view, saying that he'd [...] "squash ECW like a bug." [...] The next week on Raw, Tajiri agreed to an Extreme Rules match with Chris Benoit. In {{the middle of the}} match, however, Bischoff came out to stop it, and announced anything related to ECW was banned from Raw. He also vowed to [...] "destroy" [...] ECW {{with the help of the}} Raw superstars chosen to compete at the pay-per-view. Bischoff planned an ECW funeral for the next week's Raw but WWE Chairman Vince McMahon interrupted and spoke of his support for the ECW reunion and his financial interest in bringing back the promotion. Paul Heyman then came out and reminded McMahon that, while Heyman did not own ECW, he still had control of it. Heyman also said that he welcomed Bischoff's invasion, claiming, [...] "You may <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> that you can’t put out." [...] and proceeded to light the funeral wreath ablaze. In a rematch from the last week's RAW, Benoit defeated Tajiri in an Extreme Rules match after locking in the Crippler Crossface. The next week, Bischoff set up a Tables match between Edge and Benoit. During the match, Benoit attempted a diving headbutt with Edge on a table, but failed after Lita moved Edge off it. At that point, Bischoff sent several Raw superstars to the ring to assault Benoit, with Gene Snitsky booting Benoit in the face and Edge powerbombing Benoit through the table for the victory.|$|E

2500|$|In early September 2004, a film {{deal with}} Universal was {{publicly}} confirmed. Universal acquired {{the rights to}} Firefly shortly before the confirmation.

2500|$|After {{the loss}} to Valuev, Holyfield took a [...] period of inactivity. He {{reportedly}} agreed to fight South African boxer Francois Botha on January 16, 2010; {{it was agreed that}} the venue for the fight would be the Nelson Mandela Memorial Stadium in Kampala, Uganda. A few weeks before the fight, it was revealed that the bout would be postponed to February 20, 2010. The match was put in jeopardy due to economic disagreements but was later confirmed to be on April 10, 2010, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. When asked about his upcoming bout, the four-time world heavyweight champion said: [...] "I've been hearing for a while that I can't do it. All it does is <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> under me to prove people wrong." [...] He also added: [...] "I can still fight. I don't want to leave until I've become the undisputed heavyweight champion one more time. That's been my goal the entire time." [...] The American boxer scored an eighth-round knockout of Botha to win the vacant World Boxing Federation (WBF) Heavyweight title.|$|E

2500|$|After La Salle and Tonti left, {{the pilot}} {{and the rest of}} the crew were to follow with the supply vessel. On January 8, 1679, {{the pilot and}} crew decided to spend the night ashore where they could <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and sleep in some warmth. It was a calm night and they {{believed}} the vessel was securely moored. When a strong wind suddenly arose, they could not make it back to the ship. The vessel dragged its anchor for about nine miles to the east before grounding and breaking up near present-day Thirty Mile Point. [...] When La Salle heard of the loss (through a messenger or one of the natives), he left Niagara and joined in the salvage effort. They recovered the anchors, chain, and most of the materials critical for Le Griffon, but most of the supplies and provisions were lost. They dragged the materials to the mouth of the Niagara, rested and warmed up a few days in an Indian village, then carried the materials single file through the snow to their settlement above the falls. They arrived there on January 20, and were welcomed by La Motte and Hennepin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Veach was {{the subject}} of a motivational tactic by new player-manager Cobb. Cobb {{believed}} that Veach, who came to bat with a smile and engaged in friendly conversation with umpires and opposing pitchers, was too easygoing. Tigers historian Fred Lieb described Veach as a [...] "happy-go-lucky guy, not too brilliant above the ears", who [...] "was as friendly as a Newfoundland pup with opponents as well as teammates". (Fred Lieb, [...] "The Detroit Tigers") Hoping to <b>light</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in Veach, Cobb persuaded Harry Heilmann, who followed Veach in the batting order, to taunt Veach from the on-deck circle. [...] "I want you to make him mad. Real mad[...] [...] [...] hile you're waiting, call him a yellow belly, a quitter and a dog. … Take that smile off his face". The tactic may have worked, as Veach had career-highs in RBIs (126) and home runs (16), and his batting average jumped from [...]308 to [...]338. Cobb had promised to tell Veach about the scheme when the season was over, but never did. When Heilmann tried to explain, Veach reportedly snarled, [...] "Don't come sucking around me with that phony line". Veach never forgave Heilmann.
