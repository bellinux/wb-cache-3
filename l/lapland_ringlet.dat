50|$|The <b>Lapland</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia embla) is {{a member}} of the Satyrinae {{subfamily}} of the Nymphalidae family. It is restricted to sunny patches in very damp spruce and pine forests and forested unmanaged peatlands (and sometimes moors). The larva feeds on various grasses and related plants (such as Carex) and winters twice. A dry period in the habitat will result in the decline of the species.|$|E
50|$|This {{butterfly}} can {{be distinguished}} from the rather similar <b>Lapland</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia embla) and the Arctic ringlet (Erebia disa) {{by the fact that}} it has white blotches on the under surfaces of the hindwing and those butterflies do not. It can also be distinguished from the Arctic ringlet {{by the fact that it}} always has eyespots on its hindwings while the upperside of the Arctic ringlet's wings are plain brown. Another very similar species is the dewy ringlet, but that has a more rusty red forewing and the red strip along the underside of the wings is not continuous.|$|E
50|$|The upperside of {{the wings}} are dark brown {{with a fine}} black and white hashed line along the hind margins. The forewing has a red or orange strip fairly near the edge on which are four black blotches with white-centred eyespots. The hindwing is plain brown. The {{underside}} of the forewing {{is similar to the}} upperside while the underside of the hindwing is greyish brown with a broad dark brown lateral band and a hashed black and white margin. The wingspan is 40 to 50 mm. Species with which this butterfly could be confused include the <b>Lapland</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia embla) and the Arran brown (Erebia ligea), but these both have white markings on the undersides of their hindwings.|$|E
50|$|The Arctic {{woodland}} ringlet is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of between 33 and 42 mm. Females {{tend to be}} a little larger than males. The upperside of both the forewings and hindwings are dark brown with black eyespots with red margins in a row near the edge. In the male the eyespots are small and do not usually have a white centre except possibly the front one. In the female they may be no bigger but many of them have white centres and they may be more numerous forming a continuous line. The underside of the wings is similar to the upperside. This butterfly can be distinguished from the rather similar <b>Lapland</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia embla) and the Arran brown (Erebia ligea) {{by the fact that it}} has no white blotches on the under surfaces of the wings. It can be distinguished from the Arctic ringlet (Erebia disa) by the fact that it always has eyespots on its hindwings.|$|E
