5|$|The video {{starts off}} with Timberlake flirting with Johansson on the burlesque-style club. She rejects with a tease {{at first but}} {{eventually}} leaves with {{him to go back}} to his place. In between cuts, they are shown in bed caressing each other. Johansson jumps into a pool outside the house, and floats below the surface as if she is drowning. Timberlake runs out and pulls her up; she <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> Timberlake and kisses him.|$|E

Later Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs Meredith that Lou underwent surgery and was discharged. He's asked to see her to apologize, but Meredith refuses. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) helps her prepare for a visit with her children. On arriving they are terrified when they see their mother in that condition and leave. Meredith has a panic attack, and Penny steps up to help, removing the wires holding her jaw shut. Jackson reprimands Penny for jeopardising the healing process.|$|E
5|$|Robin {{becomes a}} roommate to Katherine, {{who is still}} feeling {{depressed}} after her recent stint in a mental hospital. Robin encourages Katherine {{to go out to}} a bar, and the two have a great time. When two men hit on Robin and show no interest in Katherine, Robin shows them up by kissing Katherine on the lips. Katherine initially <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> the funny moment, but later learns Robin really is a lesbian. Katherine insists she is not interested in women when Robin suggests she explores the possibility, but later it appears that Katherine may be intrigued by the idea.|$|E

40|$|The List of Derisible Situations (LDS; Proyer, Hempelmann and Ruch, List of Derisible Situations (LDS), University of Zurich, 2008) {{consists}} of 102 different occasions for being <b>laughed</b> <b>at.</b> They were retrieved in a corpus study and compiled into the LDS. Based on this list, {{information on the}} frequency and the intensity with which people recall being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> during a given time-span (12 months in this study) can be collected. An empirical study (N = 114) examined {{the relations between the}} LDS and the fear of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (gelotophobia), the joy of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (gelotophilia), and the joy of <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others (katagelasticism; Ruch and Proyer this issue). More than 92 % of the participants recalled having been <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> at least once over the past 12 months. Highest scores were found for experiencing an embarrassing situation, chauvinism of others or being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> for doing something awkward or clumsy. Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism were related about equally to the recalled frequency of events of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (with the lowest relation to katagelasticism). Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism yielded a distinct and plausible pattern of correlations to the frequency of events of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at.</b> Gelotophobes recalled the situations of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> with a higher intensity than others. Thus, the fear of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> exists to a large degree independently from actual experiences of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> but is related to a higher intensity with which these events are experience...|$|R
5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E
5|$|Draupadi is {{the heroine}} of Mahabharata. She is common {{wife of the}} five Pandava {{brothers}} and queen of Hastinapur, in their reign. Born from a fire-sacrifice of king of Panchala - Drupada, Draupadi was prophesied {{to lead to the}} end of Drona and Kauravas. Though the middle Pandava Arjuna - disguised as a brahmin - wins her in her swayamvara, Draupadi is compelled to marry all the five brothers on command of her mother-in-law Kunti. Pandavas agree to the plan that Draupadi will always be the chief consort of all brothers and always the empress. She will be in personal union with one brother every year and may bear him a child. Anyone of the other 4, who interrupts them during a private time within that one year, must go on a 11-month prilgrimage. She insults Kaurava general Karna in the swayamvara and <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> Duryodhana - the leader of Kauravas - when he falls in her Pandava palace at Indraprastha. She mothers five sons from each of the Pandavas, regaining her virginity after every year. The Kauravas take their revenge when the eldest Pandava Yudhishthira loses her to Kauravas in a game of dice. Kaurava Dushasana tries to disrobe her in the royal court, however divine intervention saves her dignity by making her wrapped cloth infinite in length. Draupadi pledges to keep her hair untied till they were drenched by Dushasana's blood and mocks her husbands and all present in the court. Pandavas and Draupadi finally accept 13-year exile for losing the game. While in exile in the forest, her second husband Bhima rescued her from various demons and Jayadratha, who abducted her. She also instructed Krishna's queen Satyabhama on the duties of a wife. In the 13th year of exile, Draupadi and her husbands spent life incognito in Virata's court. She served as the maid of the queen and is harassed by the queen's brother Kichaka, who she desires to be killed by Bhima. After life in exile, a war breaks between the Kauravas and Pandavas, in which the Kauravas are slain and her insult avenged, but Draupadi also loses her father, brothers and sons. Yudhishthira became the emperor of Hastinapur with Draupadi as the chief consort. At the end of their lives, Draupadi and her husbands set off to the Himalayas to walk to heaven; but Draupadi falls in the middle as she loved Arjuna more than her other husbands. She is venerated as a village goddess and described at times an avatar of the fierce goddess Kali or the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi.|$|E

50|$|Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism {{describe}} {{three different}} stances towards laughter and <b>laughing</b> <b>at.</b> Empirical studies with the PhoPhiKat-45 show that, of course, {{people can not}} {{at the same time}} fear and like being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (i.e., be gelotophobes and gelotophiles at the same time). However, there is at least a subgroup of gelotophobes that enjoys <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others, despite knowing how harmful this can be. Finally, gelotophilia and katagelasticism are positively related; i.e., those who enjoy being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> might also enjoy <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others.|$|R

5000|$|Katagelasticism is a {{psychological}} {{condition in which}} a person excessively enjoys <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others (coined by Christian F. Hempelmann and Sean Harrigan from [...] (katagelastēs), Ancient Greek for “mocker”). Katagelasticists actively seek and establish situations in which they can <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> others (at the expense of these people). There is a broad variety of things that katagelasticists would do—starting from harmless pranks or word plays to truly embarrassing and even harmful, mean-spirited jokes. They would be of the opinion that <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others is part of the daily life and if others do not like being <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> they should just fight back. For the katagelasticists it is fun <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others and there is almost nothing that might hinder them from doing so. For them, some people even might provoke getting <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (and surely deserve being <b>laughed</b> <b>at).</b> This condition often makes it difficult for sufferers to gain and maintain acquaintances and romantic partners.|$|R

25|$|In later Greek {{literature}} {{the doctrine}} is mentioned in {{a fragment of}} Menander and satirized by Lucian. In Roman literature it is found as early as Ennius, who, in a lost passage of his Annals, told how he had seen Homer in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. Persius in his satires (vi. 9) <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> this, it is referred to also by Lucretius and Horace.|$|E

25|$|Benny's comic persona {{changed over}} the course of his career. At some point he {{developed}} a miserly persona. This stage character was everything that Jack Benny was not: cheap, petty, vain and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> the expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era where few male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an everyman character.|$|E

Later, Bradley frees Ickis {{and the rest of}} the monsters when Ickis gains his sympathy, undermining Simon and protecting the secret that monsters are real. In a later episode, Bradley is worried about being picked on while camping in the woods until he agrees to help Ickis with a scare. After this he becomes very popular with his peers.|$|E

Tender speaks Adam's name aloud, but when Adam asks if they are brothers, he desperately denies it. After the bus incident, Fertility takes Tender to a department store that she presciently knows will catch on fire, but that she knows will not harm them. Fertility explains that she has the same talent as her brother for dreaming the future.|$|E

Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a glass bead. When they do find it, the little princess gives it to her as a token for her help. Sylphy <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> Kilala for being naïve and unsuitable to be a real princess. Princess Aurora finds Kilala on the balcony and tells her to keep on believing in herself and her love for Rei. Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the glass bead turns into a rose quartz and joins with the Tiara.|$|E

The next generation titles, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, featured plots based heavily on present day geopolitics, such as the instability of post-USSR states, or tensions at the DMZ between North and South Korea. However, in contrast, the games often displayed a quirky sense of humor, featuring numerous appearances by Elvis including outside a castle where he cannot be killed or even harmed, he just <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> you and even Santa Claus, as well as wisecracks from the player character in the earlier games (in Urban Strike, the player's character, on being told the villain is an evil genius, comments: 'Great, another evil genius. Why can't I ever fight an evil idiot?') Although ostensibly serious in nature, the games were often quite tongue-in-cheek in their execution.|$|E
