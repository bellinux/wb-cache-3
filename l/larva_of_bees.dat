The characteristic molecular structure of this silk is α-helical proteins assembled into tetrameric coiled coils. Gene sequences from seven species are available, and each species possesses a copy of each of four related silk genes that encode proteins predicted to form coiled coils. The proteins are ordered at multiple length scales within the labial gland of the final larval instar before spinning. The insects control the morphology of the silk during spinning to produce either fibers or sheets. The silk proteins are small and non repetitive and have been produced artificially at high levels by fermentation in E. coli. The artificial silk proteins can be fabricated into materials with structural and mechanical properties similar to those of native silks...|$|R

6000|$|There are a {{considerable}} number of Diptera, or two-winged flies, that closely resemble wasps and bees, and no doubt derive much benefit from the wholesome dread which those insects excite. The Midas dives, and other species of large Brazilian flies, have dark wings and metallic blue elongate bodies, resembling the large stinging Sphegidæ of the same country; and a very large fly of the genus Asilus has black-banded wings and the abdomen tipped with rich orange, so as exactly to resemble the fine bee Euglossa dimidiata, and both are found in the same parts of South America. We have also in our own country species of Bombylius which are almost exactly like bees. In these cases the end gained by the mimicry is no doubt freedom from attack, but it has sometimes an altogether different purpose.

Considerando que as abelhas são insetos benéficos por atuarem como agentes polinizadores das plantas, este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar o efeito tóxico da ricinina para as operárias e larvas de Apis mellifera (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hymenoptera, Apidae) e Scaptotrigona postica (Latreille, 1907) (Hymenoptera, Meliponini). Para isso, foram realizados testes de ingestão em operárias confinadas recebendo ricinina incorporada à dieta e testes de aplicação tópica com a substância solubilizada em metanol e aplicada no pronoto das abelhas com auxílio de uma microseringa. Para as larvas foram realizados testes de ingestão e calculada sua taxa de mortalidade. Os resultados mostram atividade tóxica significativa (p < 0. 0001) da ricinina nas abelhas adultas das duas espécies para a concentração 0, 1 % nos testes de ingestão e 0, 2 % nos testes de aplicação tópica.

40|$|I {{reject the}} Darwinian {{assumption}} that larvae and their adults {{evolved from a}} single common ancestor.

Grubs and maggots, including the <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> beetles, <b>bees,</b> and flies, evolved from caterpillars by loss of legs. Caterpillar larval organs are dismantled and reconstructed in the pupal phase. Such indirect developmental patterns (metamorphoses) did not originate solely by accumulation of random mutations followed by natural selection; rather they are fully consistent with my concept of evolution by hybridogenesis. Members of the phylum Onychophora (velvet worms) are proposed as the evolutionary source of caterpillars and their grub or maggot descendants. I present a molecular biological research proposal to test my thesis. By my hypothesis 2 recognizable sets of genes are detectable in the genomes of all insects with caterpillar grub- or maggot-like larvae: (i) onychophoran genes that code for proteins determining larval morphology/physiology and (ii) sequentially expressed insect genes that code for adult proteins. The genomes of insects and other animals that, by contrast, entirely lack larvae comprise recognizable sets of genes from single animal common ancestors...|$|R

DNA {{methylation}} {{has been shown to}} play an important role in this differentiation. In this study, we examine the contributions of diet and cell size to caste differentiation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured the activity and gene expression of one key enzyme involved in methylation, Dnmt 3; the rates of methylation in the gene dynactin p 62; as well as morphological characteristics <b>of</b> adult <b>bees</b> developed either from larvae fed with worker jelly or royal jelly; and larvae raised in either queen or worker cells. We show that both diet type and cell size contributed to the queen-worker differentiation, and that the two factors affected different methylation sites inside the same gene dynactin p 62. Conclusions/Significance: We confirm previous findings that Dnmt 3 plays a critical role in honey bee caste differentiation. Further, we show for the first time that cell size also plays a role in influencing larval development when diet is kept the same...|$|R
40|$|American foulbrood disease (AFB), {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus larvae, is a disease of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and other honey bee species (Apis sp.). It is distributed world wide. Spores of the bacterium can infest <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bees,</b> ultimately leading to the death <b>of</b> the <b>larva</b> or pupa. Although often spores are present in bee colonies, it only sporadically leads to serious disease symptoms, and {{to the death of}} the colony. In most countries the disease is under an obligation of notification, and control is often carried out by the government. Until 2005 this was also the situation in the Netherlands, where the disease was controlled using a ‘stamping out’ procedure. However, since the fall of 2005 the beekeepers are responsible for the control of AFB. Therefore PPO Bee Unit together with the Dutch beekeepers organizations has developed material for disease recognition, made a script for AFB control and organized training meetings for bee health officers. In the new control script the strict ‘stamping out’ approach (destroying the whole apiary) has been abandoned. Now only the visibly diseased colonies will be eliminated, the other colonies of the apiary will be cleaned and restarted on foundation comb (limited stamping out) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} assess the {{potential}} impacts of transgenic plants on <b>larvae</b> <b>of</b> the honey <b>bee,</b> Apis mellifera, information on pollen consumption is needed. We here report on experiments that were conducted with small bee colonies kept in field cages (8 × 14 m) containing only flowering maize plants as protein source. Fully grown worker bee larvae were found to contain between 1720 and 2310 maize pollen grains in their gut before defecation, corresponding to 1. 52 – 2. 04 mg of pollen consumed per larva. On average, 74. 5 % of pollen grains were completely digested while 23. 3 % were partially digested and 2. 2 % remained undigested. Our data indicate that {{the contribution of the}} protein by directly feeding larvae with pollen is less than 5 % in relation to the total amount of protein necessary for complete larval development. We suggest that our measurement for pollen consumption should be taken into account when establishing dose regimes to assess the risk that transgenic plants pose for honey bee larvae...|$|R
