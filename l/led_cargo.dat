50|$|From 1971-5, Carr was {{a member}} of Ronnie Scott's trio, first with Tony Crombie and later with Bobby Gien. In the mid-1980s he <b>led</b> the band <b>Cargo.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1903, as {{chairman}} of the Board of the Moscow-Kazan Railway, responsible for organizing the pilgrimage of Nicholas II and his family in the Sarov monastery. Nikolai von Meck at the beginning of Russian-Japanese War <b>led</b> charity <b>cargoes</b> sent to the Far East Department of the Committee of Grand Duchess to raise funds in aid of the army under the shadow of the Russian Red Cross Society.|$|R
50|$|After the war, the {{historic}} icebreaker took {{an active part}} in research expeditions in the Polar Ocean and <b>led</b> Soviet <b>cargo</b> convoys through the polar region. Rather than being destroyed (like the Icebreaker Yermak) to make way for more modern ships, the Krassin was preserved and restored. The vessel is now a museum ship in Saint Petersburg, the only icebreaker maritime museum commemorating the Arctic convoys. She has been fully restored to operating condition and there are plans to sail her to various European ports.|$|R
50|$|Reports {{concerning}} the substantial {{value of the}} ship's <b>cargo</b> <b>led</b> to many early salvage attempts and also several lawsuits. No sooner had Islander sunk than efforts began to locate the wreck. Within days her sister ship, the SS Haling was sounding the area {{in order to determine}} the wreck's depth.|$|R
50|$|Banking {{offices were}} usually located near centers of trade, {{and in the}} late 17th century, the largest centers for {{commerce}} were the ports of Amsterdam, London, and Hamburg. Individuals could participate in the lucrative East India trade by purchasing bills of credit from these banks, but the price they received for commodities was dependent on the ships returning (which often did not happen on time) and on the cargo they carried (which often was not according to plan). The commodities market was very volatile for this reason, and {{also because of the}} many wars that <b>led</b> to <b>cargo</b> seizures and loss of ships.|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} {{trade of}} Scalloway {{on the west}} side of Mainland, Shetland in the mid-nineteenth century <b>led</b> to <b>cargo</b> vessels running in from Leith. Most famous was the clipper Queen of the Isles of 82 tons, built at Leith in 1845 for a Shetland syndicate. In 1875 Nisbet acquired an interest in the Queen of the Isles, trading between Leith and the west side of Shetland. Nisbet who skippered the Queen of the Isles for many years, proved a key figure in the island service with his long experience of the dangerous passage up the west side of Shetland.|$|R
5000|$|The ship {{returned}} to McMurdo Sound on 28 October 1956 for [...] "Deep Freeze II", having made the earliest seasonal penetration in history. Glacier then delivered stores and supplies at McMurdo and then Little America, she led seven other ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) {{through the ice}} pack to the two Antarctic bases. In January 1957 she <b>led</b> two <b>cargo</b> ships into Vincennes Bay where {{the last of the}} seven American bases for the International Geophysical Year was to be constructed. Glacier departed Wilkes Station on 17 February 1957 for the United States via Melbourne when the operation was completed.|$|R
50|$|The Ford Atlas is {{a concept}} pickup truck that was {{unveiled}} by Ford on January 15, 2013 as {{a preview of the}} thirteenth generation Ford F-Series, with the most notable change being a switch to primarily aluminum construction.Its features include <b>LED</b> lighting, hidden <b>cargo</b> ramps, all-around cameras, and active aerodynamics meant to improve fuel efficiency at high speeds.The active aerodynamics should improve the Atlas's fuel economy by two mpg.|$|R
50|$|The children’s {{playground}} area {{contained a}} playground with stairs that <b>led</b> to towers, <b>cargo</b> netting, and slides {{sitting in a}} few inches of warmer water. At the top of the playground was a wooden bucket that filled with water. Once full, it dumped water on anyone below, resulting in laughter and excitement from the children. The children’s playground had three water slides for small children but which older children and adults could use. The playground contained numerous other water toys and devices.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, jazz fusion band <b>Cargo,</b> <b>led</b> by Mike Carr, {{released}} the single [...] "Jazz Rap, Volume One" [...] http://www.discogs.com/Cargo-Jazz-Rap-Volume-One/master/260299. In 1988, Gang Starr {{released the}} debut single [...] "Words I Manifest", sampling Dizzy Gillespie's 1952 [...] "Night in Tunisia", and Stetsasonic released [...] "Talkin' All That Jazz", sampling Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr's debut LP, No More Mr. Nice Guy (Wild Pitch, 1989), and their track [...] "Jazz Thing" [...] (CBS, 1990) for the soundtrack of Mo' Better Blues, further popularized the jazz rap style.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1947, Yali {{and other}} native leaders were summoned to Port Moresby for [...] "a period of indoctrination" [...] by the Administration. They were {{concerned}} with his activities and wanted {{to bring him back}} in line. Yet Yali believed {{that he was about to}} be rewarded for his work and support with a promotion and economic assistance. Speculation about the trip <b>led</b> to <b>cargo</b> activity flourishing across the Rai Coast. Yali was away for 4 months, suffering travel and logistical problems, and was then denied the free hand-out he expected to receive from the administration. He attended a meeting of a local council in Port Moresby where the Papuans asked the local officials when they would get electricity in their village. They were told that they would get it as soon as they could afford to pay for it, which dismayed the people who had believed that electricity was a service free of charge.|$|R
5000|$|A van {{containing}} the robbers and a [...] "crash car" [...] {{arrived at the}} Lufthansa cargo terminal at 3:00 AM. The crash car, driven by Frank Burke, remained in the parking lot. Three men {{got out of the}} van and entered {{the front door of the}} cargo terminus. The two men left in the van drove to the rear of the building, cut the lock on the security fence and replaced it with one of their own. The robbers, all armed, wore dark clothing and ski masks. Three men entered the building and rounded up all ten employees at gunpoint. Since 3:00 AM was [...] "lunch hour" [...] for the shift, most personnel were already in the cafeteria. Kerry Whalen, the Lufthansa transfer agent who was returning from American Airlines rampside, saw two of the robbers sitting in a van, without mask or gloves. As Whalen entered the building he was pistol-whipped. One of the robbers <b>led</b> the <b>cargo</b> agent inside the building, where he was forced to the floor.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{traffic and}} the {{difficulty}} of handling large indivisible <b>cargoes</b> <b>led</b> to planning {{for the creation of a}} deep-water port. Beginning in 1892, Grand-Lahou, Grand-Bassam, Sassandra and Bingerville were all studied as possible locations. In 1898, a French mission including Charles François Maurice Houdaille, Captain Thomasset and Robert Wallace Crosson-Duplessis visited Ivory Coast to select the location for the port, which would also be the terminus of a projected railway (what became the Chemin de Fer Abidjan-Niger). Among the factors leading to their choice of Abidjan were the existence of an offshore canyon and the fact that Abidjan was on the shortest route between Bamako and the Atlantic.|$|R
50|$|Plans for a {{relaunch}} did not materialize. As {{the legal}} maximum of ACG's shares (49 percent) were already owned by Russian (that is, non-EU) companies, the only possibility {{to acquire the}} needed equity funding {{would have been to}} find an investor from an EU member state. According to analysts, the initial suspension of its operations had <b>led</b> to Air <b>Cargo</b> Germany losing most of its freight transport contracts, which was further hampering any efforts to regain the necessary market trust. On 4 September 2013, it was reported that all 120 employees had been dismissed, bringing an end to the history of Air Cargo Germany.|$|R
50|$|At an {{airplane}} hangar, Nathan reviews his prisoners, all hooded and confined to negate their powers. The Hunter arrives and reports that Sylar escaped. He also shows Nathan {{that one of}} the prisoners is Claire. Nathan takes her and puts her in a car to be driven home, telling her to forget what she has seen. While the rest of the prisoners are <b>led</b> onto a <b>cargo</b> plane, Claire escapes from the car and sneaks aboard. Once airborne, Claire finds that the prisoners include Hiro, Peter, and Mohinder, and she removes the drug feeds from the latter two. Peter manages to touch Mohinder and take his power, using it to break his shackles. As Peter attacks the guards, Claire grabs a taser and goes to the cockpit, stunning one guard and threatening the pilot. She discovers that Noah is in the copilot’s seat.|$|R
40|$|Karyopherin-dependent {{molecular}} transport {{through the}} nuclear pore complex is maintained by constant recycling pathways of karyopherins {{coupled with the}} Ran-dependent cargo catch-and-release mechanism. Although many studies have revealed the bidirectional dynamics of karyopherins, the entire kinetics of the steady-state dynamics of karyopherin and cargo is still not fully understood. In this study, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss in photobleaching on live cells to provide convincing in vivo proof that karyopherin-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport of cargoes is bidirectional. Continuous photobleaching of the cytoplasm of live cells expressing NLS <b>cargoes</b> <b>led</b> to progressive decrease of nuclear fluorescence signals. In addition, experimentally obtained kinetic parameters of karyopherin complexes were used to establish a kinetic model to explain the entire cargo import and export transport cycles facilitated by importin β. The results strongly indicate that constant shuttling of karyopherins, either free or bound to cargo, ensures proper balancing of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of cargoes and establishes effective regulation of cargo dynamics by RanGTP...|$|R
