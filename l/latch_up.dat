TLP characterization, and curve tracer measurements have been carried out to evaluate the proposed solution. Holding current increases up to 70 mA and holding voltage up to 10 V. 1 Introduction The electrostatic discharge (ESD) has always been one of the highest reliability concerns in the integrated (IC) manufacturing industry. With the continuous miniaturization process, the integrated circuits become more and more vulnerable to ESD. The miniaturization of the ESD protection blocks is one of the greatest challenges of smart power technologies. Silicon On Insulator (SOI) technologies allow extending the operational temperature range while providing the necessary isolation between components with a reduced silicon area. SOI technology is becoming more and more attractive to manage very high voltage blocks, to reduce parasitic NPN effect and to increase Integrated Circuit (IC) speed as well as for applications operating at high temperature [1], [2]. Electro Static Discharge (ESD) protections occupy a significant silicon IC area. Using a LDMOS as main ESD protection component is not optimal due to its high on-resistance, but it could be the only solution for some technologies. In a previous work, we proposed a new ESD component (MOS-IGBT-SCR) and improved it in order to increase ESD performance and improve the <b>latch</b> <b>up</b> immunity [3] [4]. ESD performance was excellent but margin to prevent <b>latch</b> <b>up</b> was not satisfying. In this paper, an optimized version of this structure is discussed and experimentally validated. As the technological parameters of the used technology (TFSMART 1 : SOI smart power technology) cannot be changed, we explored various layout-design solutions such as the device topology or the architecture. 2 Structure description and preview solutio...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of SiC power devices requires evaluation of benefits {{and issues of}} the technology in applications. This is important since SiC power devices are still not as mature as their silicon counterparts. This research, in its own capacity, highlights {{some of the major}} challenges and analyzes them through extensive experimental measurements which are performed in many different conditions seeking to emulate various applications scenarios. It is shown that fast SiC unipolar devices, inherently reduce the switching losses while maintain low conduction losses comparable with contemporary bipolar technologies. This translates into lower temperature excursions and an enhanced conversion efficiency. However, such high switching rates may trigger problems in the device utilizations. The switching rates influenced by the device input capacitance can cause significant ringing in the output, especially in SiC SBDs. Measurements show that switching rate of MOSFETs increases with increasing temperature in turn on and reduces in turn off. Hence, the peak voltage overshoot and oscillation severity of the SiC SBD increases with temperature during diode turn off. This temperature dependence reduces at the higher switching rates. So accurate analytical models are developed for predicting the switching energy in unipolar SiC SBDs and MOSFET pairs and bipolar silicon PiN and IGBT pairs. A key parameter for power devices is electrothermal robustness. SiC MOSFETs have already demonstrated such merits compared to silicon IGBTs, however not for MOSFET body diodes. This research has quantified this in comparison with the similarly rated contemporary device technologies like CoolMOS. In a power MOSFET, high switching rates coupled with the capacitance of drain and body causes a displacement current in the resistive path of P body, inducing a voltage on base of the parasitic NPN BJT which might forward bias it. This may lead to <b>latch</b> <b>up</b> and destruction if the thermal limits are surpassed. Hence, trade offs between switching energy and electrothermal robustness are explored for the silicon, SiC and superjunction power MOSFETs. Measurements show that performance of body diodes of SiC MOSFETs is the most efficient due to least reverse recovery. The minimum forward current for inducing dynamic <b>latch</b> <b>up</b> decreases with increasing voltage, switching rate and temperature for all technologies. The CoolMOS exhibited the largest <b>latch</b> <b>up</b> current followed by the SiC and silicon power MOSFETs. Another problem induced by high switching rates is the electrical coupling between complementing devices in the same phase leg which manifests as short circuits across the DC link voltage. This has been understood for silicon IGBTs with known corrective techniques, however it is seen that due to smaller Miller capacitance resulting from a smaller die area, the SiC module exhibits smaller shoot through currents in spite of higher switching rates and a lower threshold voltage. Measurements show that the shoot through current exhibits a positive temperature coefficient for both technologies the magnitude of which is higher for the silicon IGBT. The effectiveness of common techniques of mitigating shoot through is also evaluated, showing that solutions are less effective for SiC MOSFET because of the lower threshold voltages and smaller margins for a negative gate bias...|$|E

The deployment of solar array or any other appendage is a mission critical activity of any satellite. It is necessary to study about the deployment mechanism because once the array <b>latches</b> <b>up,</b> the satellite can have disturbance resulting in attitude change. To begin, a detail study of the drawings of all the components, assemblies and sub-assemblies incorporated in the deployment mechanism was done. A literary review was carried out to investigate the research done previously and the research currently being done in the field of deployment mechanisms. This was followed by the designing {{of the components of}} SADM in Unigraphics. The components were assembled with their respective sub-assemblies. The next step was to perform the testing of components on various testing machines & thereafter analyzing the results. A conceptual design was prepared for the Solar Array Deployment Mechanism. A proper approach was used for the supply chain management of the procurement of raw materials. The torsion spring parameters were calculated, which importantly included the pre rotation angle, spring angular and the time required by the wings to deploy. The hinges were tested on the auto hinge characterization setup and the torque value required to deploy the wings was compared with the required value. The testing of micro switches was performed and the values of loads at actuation point, deactuation point, over travel and the gap between actuation and deactuation was compared with the actual values required. Torsion springs were tested and it was seen whether the stiffness values of the torsion springs are in limit to the defined value or not. Several components of Solar Array Deployment Mechanism were modeled in 3 D. A simulating model of the preliminary design was made using Solid Works in which the deployment of the wings was shown by making use of the servo motor. The values of the torque required for hinges, loads at actuation point, deactuation point, over travel and the gap between actuation and deactuation and stiffness values of the springs were approximately accurate. Some errors had occurred due to the improper setup of the components on the fixtures. Unigraphics was used for the modeling of the components of Solar array Deployment Mechanism. The preliminary design was modeled and simulated in Solid Works. ...|$|R
