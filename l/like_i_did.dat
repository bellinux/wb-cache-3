5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

[...] "I {{heard a lot of}} talk then that I'd never get 110 points <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in the WHA," [...] said Gretzky. He proved his critics wrong, scoring 137 points in 1979–80 and winning the first of nine Hart Trophies (including 8 consecutive awards from 1980–1988) as the NHL's most valuable player. [...] Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the 1981–82 season; in assists, with 163 in the 1985–86; and in total points, with 215 in 1985–86. [...] He also scored 50 goals in 39 games, the fastest any player had reached the total in a single season.

500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I would do that in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't."

I don't want to work five days a week <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview.

In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E

500|$|Louder Now {{received}} {{a score of}} 64 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate considered the album [...] "closer to Northstar's Pollyanna" [...] than to Where You Want to Be, {{and said that the}} music wasn't [...] "anything mind-blowing. I don't get knocked on my ass <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the first time I heard TAYF, but the catchy repetitiveness is all there." [...] AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar called the album's name [...] "an apt title for a super-tight, aggressive album that falls somewhere between their last two, tapping the heartfelt vigor of Tell All Your Friends in order to give Where You Want to Be a swift, square kick in the pants." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press that the band [...] " [...] spot-on when they floor it or put it in park; it’s the sputtering along in-between that hurts the record." [...] Despite not mastering [...] "the art of the middle ground," [...] they take [...] "immense leaps forward musically on their third album." [...] According to Heisel, the band should be [...] "commended, not for just choosing not to rehash their older work, but for truly trying to branch out artistically—and succeeding most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood.

On August 6, 1962, Boros became the eighth Detroit Tiger to hit three {{home runs in}} one game — accomplishing the feat against the Cleveland Indians, including two home runs off Sam McDowell. After the game, Boros said, [...] "I'm swinging the bat <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> two years ago."

He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, [...] "I wanted to come in here and make an impression and open us some eyes and I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that.

2500|$|In July 2013, the Black Keys resumed {{recording}} with Burton at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California. They {{traveled to}} accommodate Burton, {{who lived in}} Los Angeles and had traveled for previous recording sessions with the group. Working in Studio 2, the band recorded most of Turn Blue at Sunset Sound. During the recording of the album's nearly seven-minute opening song [...] "Weight of Love", Auerbach was urged by Carney and Burton to continue playing the track's concluding guitar solo, despite his reservations {{that it would be}} self-indulgent. He said that the song's completion {{set the tone for the}} rest of the album and that instead of focusing on radio-friendly singles, they would attempt to make a [...] "headphone record". Carney said the month-long sessions at Sunset Sound were more inspired: [...] "That's where the record unfolded. The record is L.A. At that point there were no rules. It's a more open, sprawling kind of album." [...] As recording stretched into August, Auerbach finalized his divorce from Stephanie Gonis; many personal details of their separation were publicized in the press. Auerbach said that his emotional state during the divorce imbued the album with a moody feeling: [...] "I've never relied on music to get me through anything <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on this one. This past year, I realised how fortunate I was to have this thing I can do: making music, and lyrically, saying things that are personal." ...|$|E

I'm the one who has to close the middle down <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> last year.' ... He's not blaming {{everybody}} else." [...] Fisher returned on March 13, upgrading the team's defense. The Lakers won their last eight games to finish the regular season with 56 wins. O'Neal averaged 33.7 points over the final 11 games. [...] Bryant, upon returning from an injury, was willing to build off of O'Neal now that the center was in shape and playing defense. Bryant would play unselfishly in the playoffs. O'Neal referred to Bryant as [...] " [...] idol" [...] and [...] "the best player in the league, by far" [...] following a victory in Game 1 of that year's Western Conference Finals. The Lakers won the championship after a record-setting 15 wins and only one loss. After the lone loss, which was in the opening game of the NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, Jackson criticized O'Neal for his lack of defense. [...] Before the following game, Lakers coach Phil Jackson growled at O'Neal, [...] "Don't be afraid to block a shot!" [...] after O'Neal failed to block a shot in Game 1. O'Neal finished Game 2 with 28 points, 20 rebounds, 9 assists and 8 blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E
