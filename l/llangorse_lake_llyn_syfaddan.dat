50|$|One of the {{earliest}} descriptions of it is given by the 15th-century poet Lewys Glyn Cothi, who described it as living in <b>Llyn</b> Syfaddon, now <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> in Powys.|$|R
50|$|Talgarth {{features}} as a location in Alfred Walter Stewart's 1931 novel The Boathouse Riddle, written under the pen-name J. J. Connington. The boathouse which inspired Stewart was at nearby <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Treberfydd House is a Gothic Revival house, {{built in}} 1847-50 {{just south of}} <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> in the Brecon Beacons National Park in South Wales, to the designs of {{architect}} John Loughborough Pearson.|$|R
50|$|Trefeca (also Trefecca, Trevecca, and Trevecka), {{located between}} Talgarth and <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> {{in what is}} now south Powys in Wales, was the home of the 18th-century Methodist leader Hywel Harris (English: Howell Harris).|$|R
50|$|In {{his diary}} of the 1870s, Francis Kilvert noted several visits to <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake,</b> {{including}} a July 1878 outing {{in the company}} of his father, when the pair caught a brace of perch in an hour.|$|R

50|$|In 916 Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, sent an army into Brycheiniog {{to avenge}} {{the murder of}} the Mercian abbot Ecbryht and his companions.

50|$|It lies a {{few miles}} east of Brecon, between Bwlch and Brecon on the B4560, just off the A40, and {{is home to the}} largest natural lake in {{southern}} Wales, <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake.</b> Nant Cwy, a small stream, runs through the village before emptying into the lake.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is famous}} for its coarse fishing (particularly pike), watersports, the afanc (nicknamed 'Gorsey') and has the only example of a crannog in Wales. <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> {{is also one of the}} most {{mentioned}} sites in Welsh folklore. It is a site of international conservation importance.|$|R
50|$|Due to the lake's {{long history}} of human activity, it has been known by several {{different}} names during its history, both in the Welsh language and in English: other names include the lake's original Welsh name, Llyn Syfaddon/Syfaddan, and Brycheiniog Mere. The name <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> is comparatively recent.|$|R
50|$|Indeed, the Romans were in {{this area}} and another Roman fort or station as {{sometimes}} these places were referred to has in recent years been found down river of Brecon and not so very far from <b>Llangorse</b> <b>lake.</b> Aerial reconnaissance discovered the outline of a yet un-excavated fort.|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{a meeting}} which {{discussed}} the ecology and conservation of <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> in South Wales.

40|$|<b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake,</b> Wales, is a lake which formed {{after the}} glacier retreat {{following}} the LGM, upstream in the Afon Llynfi valley, {{at the edge}} of the River Wye catchment. The lake has been previously cored, from which it was shown that it contained sediments older than the Preboreal, which is the oldest date currently available for <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> sediments. Using a combination of loss on ignition (LOI) – and organic geochemical analysis methods, an attempt is made to reconstruct Late Pleistocene air temperatures based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) membrane lipids from bacteria living in soils and the water column. An end-member mixing model is proposed to separate the two sources of bacterial membrane lipids, which end up in the sedimentary archive. This correction method shows promising results for the applicability of brGDGT membrane lipids in lacustrine environments. The reconstructed temperatures show a comparable signature of Late Pleistocene air temperatures as found from other proxy methods and sedimentary archives...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{problems}} related to eutrophication of (freshwater) aquatic systems, e. g. loss of biodiversity, availability of clean water and problems with its recreational and food services, highlight the necessity for management and conservation of such systems. For this, adequate understanding of the causes and consequences of the shifts in nutrient availability is required, as well as proper reference baselines. Therefore, this study aimed to reconstruct pre-human impact baselines for two low-elevation lakes in northwestern Europe, Hijkermeer and <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake,</b> {{with the use of}} trophic state transfer functions based on diatoms. Also, the ecosystem’s response to these changes was analysed and an attempt was made to delineate natural variability from human impact. Over ca. 3400 yrs the inferred trophic state of Hijkermeer shifted from oligotrophic (12 μg TP/L) to mesotrophic (32 μg TP/L), coinciding with continuously increasing anthropogenic activity in the catchment. The reconstructed trophic state of the <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> increased from a eutrophic (54 μg TP/L) to hypereutrophic (168 μg TP/L) state between ca. 5000 and 2500 cal. yr BP and subsequently the trophic state returned again to former levels. This appeared to be related to a simultaneous temporary increase in agriculture as indicated by the pollen record. A remarkable observation was that the relation between the trophic state and diversity seemed to be unimodally distributed and the ecosystem of <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> appeared to show a recovery of diversity following the phase of increased nutrient availability and anthropogenic activity. This showcases the resilience of the ecosystem and {{could be used as a}} model for (on-going) management and conservation of the present eutrophication problems...|$|R

50|$|The largest {{landslide}} dam in Britain impounds Tal-y-llyn <b>Lake</b> (<b>Llyn</b> Mwyngil) beside Cadair Idris in Snowdonia National Park, Wales. It {{was first}} recognised by E Watson in 1962. It is probably over 10,000 years old.|$|R
50|$|Oll Lewis, an {{ecologist}} and cryptozoologist at the Centre for Fortean Zoology, {{has been}} studying the Afanc of <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> for several years, and has proposed that it may represent sightings of the abnormally large pike of the lake.

5000|$|Tal-y-llyn Lake, {{also known}} as Talyllyn <b>Lake,</b> <b>Llyn</b> Mwyngil or Llyn Myngul is a large glacial ribbon lake in Gwynedd, North Wales. It is formed by a post-glacial massive {{landslip}} damming up the lake within the glaciated valley.|$|R

50|$|Llyn Trawsfynydd {{is a large}} {{man-made}} reservoir situated {{near the}} village of Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd, North Wales. With a total surface area of 4.8 km² (1,180 acres) the reservoir is slightly more extensive than Wales's largest natural <b>lake,</b> <b>Llyn</b> Tegid (which covers an area of 4.5 km²).|$|R
50|$|During the {{deglaciation}} of Wales {{there was}} a period when ice from the Wye Valley Glacier blocked the exit of the river into the Wye. The waters of the Llynfi backed up at Llangors {{to the point where they}} overflowed the cols at Pennorth and at Bwlch (both at a height of 189m) and flowed south into the River Usk which was by this time free of ice. This situation prevailed for several hundred years as evidenced by lake deposits beneath and around <b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Llangorse</b> <b>Lake</b> is a {{eutrophic}} glacial {{lake with}} a 5 mi circumference covering {{an area of}} 327 acre. The lake is 1 mi long and 505 ft above sea level. The lake is sited between the basins of the River Wye {{to the north and}} the River Usk to the south, and occupies a glacially scoured rock basin partly enhanced by morainic debris. The Afon Llynfi provides the main input of water into the lake and continues as the lake overflow stream. The lake has a maximum depth of 7.5m.|$|R
50|$|Craig-y-llyn is a {{subsidiary}} summit of Cadair Idris in the Snowdonia National Park, in Gwynedd, northwest Wales. It {{lies at the}} western end of the long Cadair Idris ridge.

50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1973 and was {{completed}} in 1976. It has a capacity of 60 million m³ and was first filled in 1979.

The lake has a perimeter of some 9 mi.|$|R
