The life cycle assessment (LCA) technique has become a common tool to evaluate those impacts. The present study aimed {{to contribute to the}} better understanding of the application of this technique, by evaluating the influence of the selection of the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method in its results and conclusions. A specific case study was chosen, using previous information related to an anti-glare lamellae (AGL) for highway use, made with virgin and recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Five distinct LCIA methods were used: Eco-indicator 99, CML 2 (2000), EPS 2000, Eco-indicator 95 and EDIP 97. Consistent results between these methods were obtained for the Climate change, Ozone layer depletion, Acidification and Eutrophication environmental indicators. Conversely, the Summer smog indicator showed large discrepancies between impact assessment methods.

40|$|Conventional {{research}} has used aggregate statistics and bivariate methods in studying migration in Soviet society and has stressed {{the critical role}} of a single (usually structural) determinant in an individual's migration. This research tests the dominant view, using individual level data and multivariate methods. The objective is to clarify {{the extent to which}} structural-environmental factors {{and the extent to which}} personal characteristics determined the first residence and migration of Russian-born Estonians in post-war Estonia. The data of the retrospective survey on 265 ethnic Estonians born in Russia between 1915 and 1969 and settled in Estonia between 1940 and 1988 are used. It appears that the first residence and migration of the ethnic Estonians was shaped by an immigration cohort - the variable reflecting structural-environmental conditions. However, several personal characteristics - age, earlier <b>life-environment,</b> language usage and education - also turned out to be important determinants of residence and migration of the ethnic Estonians. The results provide evidence to the view that migration in the Soviet Union was a complex outcome of interaction of structural forces and people's preferences, and therefore differed less from other parts of the world than often presumed.

From the establishment of the planet's magnetic dipole, to the interplay between life and it's environment. The dynamics across all scales are characterised by their numerous interacting components. Of particular interest is how such a system may be stable at all, and the role of life in establishing this apparent stability. We present a novel analytic approach to a model of a coupled <b>life-environment</b> system. The model demonstrates that even random couplings between many many species, and a multidimensional environment can produce stable, and robust configurations. The extent to which this observation is general, rather than being unique to the intricacies of the model may only be revealed by thorough analysis. The model is found to be invariant with the number of biotic components past a lower limit. Additionally, rather than increases in environmental complexity leading to a reduction in the possibility of steady states, it is proven that the converse is true, suggesting that the proposed mechanism may be applicable to even high dimensional complexity...|$|E
40|$|Daisyworld is {{a simple}} {{planetary}} model designed to show {{the long-term effects of}} coupling between life and its environment. Its original form was introduced by James Lovelock as a defense against criticism that his Gaia theory of the Earth as a self-regulating homeostatic system requires teleological control rather than being an emergent property. The central premise, that living organisms can have major effects on the climate system, is no longer controversial. The Daisyworld model has attracted considerable interest from the scientific community and has now established itself as a model independent of, but still related to, the Gaia theory. Used widely as both a teaching tool and as a basis for more complex studies of feedback systems, it has also become an important paradigm for the understanding of the role of biotic components when modeling the Earth system. This paper collects the accumulated knowledge from the study of Daisyworld and provides the reader with a concise account of its important properties.

In the last few years the focus has been, in many ways, placed on the European “regions”, and hence the promotion of their competitiveness – and, by this means, their eco-efficiency – has become a central issue in the regions concerned. The Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE), the Southeast Finland Regional Environment Centre, the Regional Council of Kymenlaakso and the Thule Institute at the University of Oulu conducted (1 September 2002 – 31 December 2004) a LIFE project named “The Ecoefficiency of Regions – Case Kymenlaakso (ECOREG) ”.

Samples of sludge and sediments from different environments were screened and used as inoculum for enrichment of anammox bacteria in batch cultures. Enrichments were monitored in order to detect anammox bacteria or their potential activity. Candidatus "Brocadia anammoxidans" was successfully enriched, detected, and identified {{in five of the}} twelve batch cultures. Furthermore, this organism was retrieved for the first time from a brackish environment. Wide-range primers used in several Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) attempts were unable to successfully amplify the 16 S rRNA sequence from anammox populations, but were used to search for hypothetical ecological partners of anammox. A nested PCR approach with specific primers was also employed since conventional PCR was unable to amplify anammox DNA from the inocula of the successful enrichments. However, it was impossible to obtain optimal results with the different strategies utilized to improve PCR performance (higher annealing temperature or more specific primers), and only the primer set Amx 368 F-Amx 820 R resulted in an acceptable balance between both specificity and sensitivity. Although the enrichment process is relatively slow and requires lengthy incubation periods, it proved to be useful as the molecular analyses were not sensitive enough to detect anammox in the original samples or even after short enrichment periods. Therefore, a batch enrichment procedure coupled with molecular techniques was an appropriate approach to achieve successful inocula for starting-up anammox biological reactorThis research has been funded by EU <b>LIFE-Environment</b> project LIFE 03 ENV/E/ 000140 (CLONIC), CESPA-GR and PANAMMOX Project (CIT- 310200 - 2007 - 90; PET- 2006 - 0604...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss and {{illustrate}} the hypothesis that life substantially alters the state of a planetary environment and therefore, modifies {{the limits of the}} HZ as estimated for an uninhabited planet. This hypothesis lead to the introduction of the Habitable Zone for Inhabited planets (hereafter InHZ), defined here as the region where the complex interaction between life and its abiotic environment is able to produce plausible equilibrium states with the necessary physical conditions for the existence and persistence of life itself. We support our hypothesis of an InHZ with three theoretical arguments, multiple evidences coming from observations of the Earth system, several conceptual experiments and illustrative numerical simulations. Conceptually the diference between the InHZ and the Abiotic HZ (AHZ) depends on unique and robust properties of life as an emergent physical phenomenon and not necesarily on the particular life forms bearing in the planet. Our aim here is to provide conceptual basis for the development of InHZ models incorporating consistently <b>life-environment</b> interactions. Although previous authors have explored the effects of life on habitability there is a gap in research developing the reasons why life should be systematically included at determining the HZ limits. We do not provide here definitive limits to the InHZ but we show through simple numerical models (as a parable of an inhabited planet) how the limits of the AHZ could be modified by including plausible interactions between biota and its environment. These examples aim also at posing the question that if limits of the HZ could be modified by the presence of life in those simple dynamical systems how will those limits change if life is included in established models of the AHZ.

40|$|The {{development}} of value-added products made from post-consumer plastic recyclates {{has become an}} important goal {{in the quest for}} a sustainable society. To attain such goal, tools with higher accuracy and wider scope are increasingly necessary. The present work describes the application of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) /Life Cycle Costing (LCC) integrated model, with inclusion of externalities (environmental and social costs), to Anti-Glare Lamellae (AGL) made with High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). It compares an AGL currently manufactured from virgin HDPE (current AGL) with an alternative one made with recycled HDPE (optional AGL). The results obtained show that neither the current nor the optional AGL depict the best environmental performance in all impact categories. Nevertheless, there is a clear overall environmental and economic advantage in replacing virgin HDPE with recycled HDPE. The present work also makes evident that the LCA/LCC integrated model allows the identification of economic and environmental win–win and trade-off situations related to the full life cycle of products. As such, its results can be used as valuable guidelines in product development. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) Carla L.

40|$|A {{connection}} is hypothesized between the physiological consequences of mutualistic symbiosis and life's average long-term impact on certain highly biologically conserved environmental variables. This hypothesis is developed analytically {{and with a}} variant of the Daisyworld model. Biological homeostasis is frequently effective due to co-ordination between opposing physiological “rein” functions, which buffer an organism in response to an external (often environmental) perturbation. It is proposed that during evolutionary history the pooling of different species' physiological functions in mutualistic symbioses increased the range of suboptimal environmental conditions that could be buffered against—a mutual tolerance benefit sometimes sufficient to outweigh the cost of cooperation. A related argument is that for a small number of biologically-crucial physical variables (i) the difference between organism interiors and the <b>life-environment</b> interface is relatively low, and (ii) the biologically optimum level of that variable is relatively highly conserved across different species. For such variables, symbiosis tends to cause (at a cost) {{an increase in the number}} of environmental buffering functions per unit of selection, which in turn biases the overall impact of the biota on the state of the variable towards the biological optimum. When a costly but more temperature-tolerant and physiologically versatile symbiosis between one black (warming) and one white (cooling) “daisy” is added to the (otherwise unaltered) Daisyworld parable, four new results emerge: (1) The extension of habitability to a wider luminosity range, (2) resistance to the impact of “cheater” white daisies with cold optima, that derive short-term benefit from environmental destabilisation, (3) the capacity to maintain residual, oscillatory regulation in response to forcings that change more rapidly than allele frequencies and (crucially) (4) “succession”-type dynamics in which the tolerant symbiosis colonises and to an extent makes habitable an otherwise lifeless environment, but is later displaced by free-living genotypes that have higher local fitness once conditions improve. The final result is arguably analogous to lichen colonisation of the Neoproterozoic land surface, followed by the Phanerozoic rise of vascular plants. Caution is necessary in extrapolating from the Daisyworld parable to real ecology/geochemistry, but sufficiently conserved variables may be water potential, macronutrient stoichiometry and (to a lesser extent) the temperature window for metabolic activity...|$|E
40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the third millennium, we are confronted with a {{disturbing}} phenomenon: although global life expectancy still increases, {{this is not the case}} for healthy life expectancy! The explanation of this seemingly contradiction is mainly due to the rising prevalence of the new pandemia of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Even in low and middle income countries, the improvement in healthcare status and life expectancy is paralled by the increase of NCDs, as in all countries worldwide. Since the United Nations General Assembly held in New York in 2011, many publications have emphasized the close link between NCDs and nutrition. The NCDs epidemic forces us to reconsider the public health perspectives. Many governments, non-governmental organizations and other institutions are actively involved in educational nutrition programs and campaigns; however their efforts seldom obtain the results hoped for. It is extremely difficult to induce changes in lifestyle and behavior that have built up over a long period of time. However, it becomes urgent to adapt to our changing <b>life-environment</b> where traditional wisdom and intuitive choices are giving way to individual thinking and search for (often uncontrolled) information. This engenders a number of unprecedented challenges and it calls for a re-appraisal of the existing paradigms to achieve an adequate management of the upstream determinants of health instead of a (pre) dominant medical and hospital-centric approach. In the era of personalized healthcare, it is time to empower policy makers, professionals and citizens for achieving an evidence-based change in the health-disease interface and decision-making process for public health interventions. The scientific and professional society Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi) has recognized nutrition as a health technology by creating a Interest Group (IG) dedicated to research on methodologies and assessments of nutrition-related public health, while taking into account contextual factors (ethical, legal, social, organizational, economic, [...] .) in order to generate meaningful outcomes for establishing evidence-based health policies. This Research Topic aims to elaborate on some of the potential hurdles which have to be overcome for the sake of sustainable healthcare provisions anywhere in the world, such as shortcomings in methodological approaches, regulatory frameworks, gaps between evidence, its hierarchy and final recommendations for public health management...|$|E
