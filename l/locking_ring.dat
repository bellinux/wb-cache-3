25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} earthing conductor.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark 3 was {{the last}} 10-inch gun built for the U.S. Navy, with a tube, jacket, <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and screw box liner {{manufactured}} from nickel steel. Due to the [...] "smokeless" [...] powders which came into use near {{the turn of the}} 20th century, these guns boasted a higher velocity than those used during the Spanish–American War. They also had a flatter trajectory, which led to more accurate firing and aided in centralized fire control. In 1908, the armor-piercing shells were fitted with a ballistic cap lengthened to 7crh. This improved their penetration ability at longer ranges.|$|E
2500|$|The 30A plug is {{the largest}} of the family. [...] This was used for high power {{industrial}} equipment up to 7.2kW, such as industrial kitchen appliances, [...] or dimmer racks for stage lighting. Plugs and sockets were usually of an industrial waterproof design with a screw <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> on the plug to hold it in the socket against waterproof seals, and sockets often had a screw cap chained to them to be used when no plug was inserted to keep them waterproof. Use of the BS546 30A plugs and sockets diminished through the 1970s as they were replaced with BS 4343 (which later became IEC 60309) industrial combo plugs and sockets.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} at the time used a slot in the metal to <b>lock</b> the <b>ring</b> to a jewel. Other features included a decorated face plate and a triangular cross-section. <b>Lock</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been found in}} modern-day Ireland, France, and Great Britain. Gold was used for the majority of <b>lock</b> <b>rings</b> that have been found, though other artifacts constructed out of bronze, or clay, gold and bronze composite have been found.|$|R

With some doors, it is possible to swing them shut not quite far enough and then have the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> jam as it tries to close.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{generation of}} FD lenses featured a silver colored <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> at the base. Only the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> turns {{to lock the}} lens to the camera body; the lens body remains stationary.

5000|$|Track {{sprocket}} - There is no {{mechanism that}} allows the rider to coast. There are two sets of threads on the hub shell. The threads are in opposite directions. The inner (clockwise) set of threads is for a track sprocket and the outer (counter-clockwise) set is for a reverse threaded <b>lock</b> <b>ring.</b> The reverse threads on the <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> keep the sprocket from unscrewing from the hub, which is otherwise possible when slowing down.|$|R

50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a housing, in which a <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope. Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above-mentioned <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> the bolt locks by rotation; thus, the receiver with <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> bolt and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|E

50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|E

These fittings are often confused with lockrings.|$|R
5000|$|The 10-inch Mark 1 was a {{built-up}} gun {{constructed in}} {{a length of}} 31 caliber, Mod 0 and Mod 1, and also 35 caliber, Mod 2. These were both mounted in pairs on Mianonomoh and numbered 1-4 by the Navy. Both of the Mod 0 and Mod 1 guns had a tube, jacket, with the Mod 1 having a thicker jacket, and 15 hoops with a <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The hoops started [...] from the breech and extended to the muzzle. The Mod 2, was a 35 caliber gun of similar constructions but had only 14 hoops with a <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> These were all constructed of gun steel.|$|E

50|$|The door has toothed lugs {{all around}} its circumference, with the lugs {{lined up with}} {{corresponding}} openings in the <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> which turns on the hub. When closed, the door faces the hub and an O-ring gasket provides the means of sealing against internal pressure. As the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> turns, it cams the lugs of the door forward, pressing the door against the hub. This way, there is no sliding motion of the door face across the O-ring gasket. Thus, the gasket can be an inexpensive O-ring, replacements for which {{can be made in}} the user's own shop using ordinary O-ring stock, and it lasts a long time. The very few wear parts on the door are replaceable, making the autoclave a long-lived investment.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark 6 gun was {{constructed}} of gun steel using a tube, jacket, four hoops, a <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> and Welin breech block. It {{was discovered that}} the pressure curve of the charge and the strength curve of the barrel match exactly along one point of the barrel, because of this the muzzle velocity was reduced from the original [...] to [...] With the Mod 1 nickel-steel {{was used for the}} tube, two hoops and the <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> the gun was also hooped to the muzzle, because of this, the original muzzle velocity was able to be restored. The Mod 2 were Mod 0s with a hoop added to the chase along with a cylindrical liner made from nickel-steel. With these changes the original muzzle velocity was used.|$|E
