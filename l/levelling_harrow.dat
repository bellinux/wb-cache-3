40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{sprinkler}} irrigation for rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop {{is a relatively}} recent practice in Brazil. Therefore, crop soil and fertilization management are still not very well defined. Another problem is the inexistence of specific cultivars adapted to this cropping system. This study aimed to evaluate sprinkler-irrigated upland rice cultivars under different soil management practices and nitrogen sidedressing rates in relation to yield and grain quality. A randomized block design was used, arranged as a 3 x 3 x 5 factorial scheme, totaling 45 treatments consisting of the combination of three rice cultivars (Primavera, Confiança and Maravilha), three soil management systems (disk harrow + <b>levelling</b> <b>harrow,</b> moldboard plow + <b>levelling</b> <b>harrow</b> and no-till) and five nitrogen rates, applied as sidedressing (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha- 1), with four replicates. The experiment was set up during the 1999 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001 cropping seasons, in Selvíria, MS, Brazil, on a Typic Haplustox of clayey texture. Cultivars Primavera and Maravilha presented higher grain yield than Confiança; {{on the other hand}} the latter showed higher milled and head rice yields during seed processing. Soil tillage with the moldboard plow and no-till interfered positively in the agronomic and productive characteristics of the crop. In relation to milled rice yield, tilling with the levelling disk + moldboard plow showed better results in relation to no-till. Nitrogen sidedressing did not interfere with the agronomi...|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completing}} his A <b>levels</b> at <b>Harrow</b> in June 2001, Compton joined Middlesex {{on a summer}} contract, and entered into the record books in his debut Second XI Championship match, Compton {{was the last of}} five batsman out in six balls bowled by Glamorgan paceman Alex Wharf. Compton made his Middlesex first-team debut in the Norwich Union League {{at the end of the}} 2001 season, batting at six he scored just 6 runs from 9 deliveries in a 40 run defeat by Glamorgan. His promising performances for Middlesex's Under-19s and Second XI led him to receive the NBC Denis Compton Award, named after his grandfather, awarded to the most promising Middlesex player for 2001. The following winter, he was selected for the England Under-19s squad to take part in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in January and February 2002. Compton played in five of England's six matches as they reached the second group stage, Compton scoring 133 runs with one 50 at an average of 23.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results obtained in a field experiment carried out at Glicério, Northwest of São Paulo state, Brazil, whose objective was to analyze changes of selected soil physical properties and water infiltration rates on a Yellow-Red Latosol, under three different management conditions. The experimental design was arranged as completely randomized split-block with twelve treatments, which corresponded to four depths (0 - 0. 05 m; 0. 05 - 0. 10 m; 0. 10 - 0. 20 m and 0. 20 - 0. 40 m) and three conditions of soil use and management with four replications. The soil surface conditions were: conventional tillage (one disking with moulboard plus two <b>levelling</b> passes with <b>harrow),</b> nine months before starting filed experiences; recent conventional tillage (also one disking with moulboard plus two <b>levelling</b> passes with <b>harrow)</b> and native forest. The conventional tillage areas were cropped for about fifteen years with annual cultures. The considered soil general physical properties were: macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density, soil moisture and penetration resistance and, in addition; soil water infiltration rates were also recorded. According to our results, differences on general soil physical properties and infiltration rates appeared when both tilled sub-treatments and native forest were compared. Both, plots recently prepared by conventional tillage and those prepared by tillage but left nine months in rest, presented a statistically significant decrease of constant (final) water infiltration rates of 92. 72 % and 91. 91 % when compared with native forest plots...|$|R
25|$|From {{splitting}} {{with the}} Great Western Main Line at Maidenhead station, it turns North and enters a cutting, going under Grenfell Road and the A4 Castle Hill, passing over the A308 Marlow Road {{and then a}} <b>level</b> crossing on <b>Harrow</b> Lane just before its next stop, Furze Platt. From Furze Platt it passes under B4447 Gardner Road, alongside the old Maidenhead Road as it exits the town, continuing through countryside briefly before crossing over the B4447 again before the second stop, Cookham. Immediately after leaving Cookham there is a level crossing on Station Hill, a slight cutting passing under Terry's Lane, up on a viaduct over Cockmarsh before crossing the Thames, and arriving shortly after at Bourne End. Here the driver changes ends for Marlow, turning back along the north bank of the Thames by Spade Oak, passing south of the water treatment works, under the A404 Marlow bypass and finally Marlow station, where the line terminates.|$|R
