To {{study the}} <b>lapping</b> process and sphere-shaping {{mechanism}} of WC-Co cemented carbide ball under eccentric dual-rotating (EDR) V-groove <b>lapping</b> mode, the research center designs EDR V-groove <b>lapping</b> machine. This paper analyses sphericity of WC-Co cemented carbide balls after the <b>lapping.</b> During the <b>lapping</b> process, the diameter variation is measured every one hour. The diameter of ball is usually reduced 0. 05 mm every hour, {{which is more}} than the dual rotating plates(DRP) <b>lapping</b> mode, and the experiment is totally done 9 hours, the error of sphericity can be controlled around 0. 005 mm in the last, so the EDR V-groove <b>lapping</b> mode is more suitable for <b>lapping</b> of the WC-Co cemented carbide ball in roughness and semi-finishing process.

40|$|HIPed (Hot Isostatically Pressed) {{silicon nitride}} ball blanks were <b>lapped</b> from {{diameter}} 13. 255 mm to diameter 12. 7 mm by a novel eccentric <b>lapping</b> machine. A maximum {{material removal rate}} of 68 μm/hour has been achieved under a nominal <b>lapping</b> load of 43 N/ball. It {{was found that the}} material removal rate was increasing almost linearly with the <b>lapping</b> load within this load range. When the <b>lapping</b> load was higher than 43 N/ball, the material removal rate started to drop and the <b>lapped</b> ball roundness error started to increase. At the highest nominal <b>lapping</b> load of 107 N/ball, surface and subsurface damages were found on the <b>lapped</b> balls. Because of eccentric loading effect, the actual load on individual ball could be 25 ~ 28 % higher than the nominal <b>lapping</b> load. The surface residual stresses of <b>lapped</b> balls under different <b>lapping</b> loads were measured, and {{it was found that the}} <b>lapping</b> load had less effect than previous HIP process. Rolling contact fatigue tests were conducted on balls <b>lapped</b> at nominal loads of 43 N/ball and 107 N/ball. No failure occurred on the ball <b>lapped</b> at 43 N/ball after 138 million stress cycles. Ball <b>lapped</b> at 107 N/ball was failed after 13. 3 million stress cycles with a shallow spall with flat bottom inside. This research suggests that the <b>lapping</b> load for advanced ceramic balls in conventional concentric <b>lapping</b> could be doubled from 20 N/ball to 40 N/ball without degrading the surface quality of <b>lapped</b> balls...|$|R

Effects of the ratio and eccentricities on the wear uniformity are discussed in detail through MATLAB simulation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the ratio k 1 of workpiece revolution speed to <b>lapping</b> plate is the key to decide whether the <b>lapping</b> plate is <b>lapped</b> uniformly.
