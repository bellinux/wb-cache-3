5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet.</b> Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E
5|$|Under most circumstances, the {{blacktip reef shark}} has a timid {{demeanor}} and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the blacktip reef shark. Most attacks involve sharks biting the <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet</b> of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water, {{and a way of}} discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.|$|E

6000|$|That basis {{presently}} shrank to {{the scale}} of a small house hard by the hotel, {{at the entrance of}} Berkeley Square--expeditiously lighted on, it would thus appear, which again has been expensively superseded, but to the ancient little facts of which I fondly revert, since I owe them what I feel to have been, in the far past, the prime faint revelation, the small broken expression, of the London I was afterwards to know. The place wears on the spot, to this day, no very different face; the house that has risen on the site of ours is still immediately neighboured at the left by the bookseller, the circulating-librarian and news-agent, who modestly flourished in our time under the same name; the great establishment of Mr. Gunter, just further along, is as soberly and solidly seated; the mews behind the whole row, from the foot of Hay Hill at the right, wanders away to Bruton Street with the irregular grace that spoke to my young fancy; Hay Hill itself is somehow less sharply precipitous, besides being no longer paved, as I seem to recall its having been, with big boulders, and I was on the point of saying that its antique charm in some degree abides. Nothing, however, {{could be further from the}} truth; its antique charm quite succumbed, years ago, to that erection of lumpish [...] "mansions" [...] which followed the demolition of the old-world town-residence, as the house-agents say, standing, on the south side, between court and I suppose garden, where Dover Street gives way to Grafton; a house of many histories, of vague importances and cold reserves and deep suggestions, I used to think after scaling the steep quite on purpose to wonder about it. A whole chapter of life was condensed, for our young sensibility, I make out, into the couple of months--they can scarce have been more--spent by us in these quarters, which must have proved too narrow and too towny; but it can have had no passage so lively as the occurrences at once sequent to my father's having too candidly made known in some public print, probably The Times, that an American gentleman, at such an address, desired to arrange with a competent young man for the tuition at home of his three sons. The effect of his rash failure to invite application by letter only was the assault of an army of visitors who filled us with consternation; they hung about the door, cumbered the hall, choked the staircase and sat grimly individual in odd corners. How they were dealt with, given my father's precipitate and general charity, I can but feebly imagine; our own concern, in the event, was with a sole selected presence, that of Scotch Mr. Robert Thompson, who gave us his care from breakfast to luncheon each morning that winter, who afterwards carried on a school at Edinburgh, and whom, in years long subsequent, I happened to help R. L. Stevenson to recognise gaily as his early pedagogue. He was so deeply solicitous, yet withal so mild and kind and shy, with no harsher injunction to us ever than [...] "Come now, be getting on!" [...] that one could but think well of a world in which so gentle a spirit might flourish; while it is doubtless to the credit of his temper that remembrance is a blank in respect to his closer ministrations. I recall vividly his fresh complexion, his very round clear eyes, his tendency to trip over his own <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet</b> while thoughtfully circling about us, and his constant dress-coat, worn with trousers of a lighter hue, which was perhaps the prescribed uniform of a daily tutor then; but I ask myself in vain what I can have [...] "studied" [...] with him, there remaining with me afterwards, to testify--this putting any scrap of stored learning aside--no single textbook save the Lambs' Tales from Shakespeare, which was given me as (of all things in the world) a reward. A reward for what I am again at a loss to say--not certainly for having [...] "got on" [...] to anything like the tune plaintively, for the most part, piped to me. It is a very odd and yet to myself very rich and full reminiscence, though I remember how, looking back at it from after days, W. J. denounced it to me, and with it the following year and more spent in Paris, as a poor and arid and lamentable time, in which, missing such larger chances and connections as we might have reached out to, we had done nothing, he and I, but walk about together, in a state of the direst propriety, little [...] "high" [...] black hats and inveterate gloves, the childish costume of the place and period, to stare at grey street-scenery (that of early Victorian London had tones of a neutrality!) dawdle at shop-windows and buy water-colours and brushes with which to bedaub eternal drawing-blocks. We might, I dare say, have felt higher impulses and carried out larger plans--though indeed present to me for this, on my brother's so expressing himself, is my then quick recognition of the deeper stirrings and braver needs he at least must have known, and my perfect if rueful sense of having myself had no such quarrel with our conditions: embalmed for me did they even to that shorter retrospect appear in a sort of fatalism of patience, spiritless in a manner, no doubt, yet with an inwardly active, productive and ingenious side.|$|E

50|$|Zam-Buk was {{a patent}} {{medicine}} {{produced by the}} Zam-Buk Company of Leeds, England, founded by Charles Edward Fulford. It was first sold by his Bile Beans company in 1902, as a herbal balm and antiseptic ointment; {{the use of a}} complementary Zam-Buk soap was recommended to augment the treatment. The ointment was advertised as being effective against a wide range of conditions, including cuts, bruises, sprains, freckles, ulcers, bleeding piles and even colds and toothache. It could also be used as an embrocation by rubbing it into the muscles of the back, <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Guard, the {{practitioner}} {{is on his}} back controlling an opponent with his legs. The practitioner pushes and pulls with the <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet</b> to upset the balance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position comes into play often when an opponent manages to place {{the practitioner}} upon his back and the practitioner seeks the best position possible to launch counter-attacks. This is a very versatile position from which the BJJ practitioner can attempt to sweep (reverse) the opponent, {{get back to the}} feet, or apply a variety of joint locks as well as various chokes.|$|E

5000|$|Bouts usually {{continue}} until one fighter {{is struck by}} an [...] "incapacitating" [...] blow or otherwise becomes disinclined to continue. A fighter may also yield (concede victory to the opponent) {{at any time during}} the bout. An [...] "incapacitating" [...] blow is defined as a valid attack to the head, neck, torso, armpit or inner groin area. Attacks to the <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> arms are considered [...] "disabling". A hit to the arm disables that arm, which is held behind the fencer's back or hanging limply at their side. Fencers whose sword arm is disabled can switch hands. Some kingdoms use rules with additional details for strikes to the hand, which may simply disable the hand (represented by making a fist) or apply to the whole arm. For a strike to the <b>leg</b> <b>or</b> <b>foot,</b> the fencer can continue fighting but must kneel, sit on the ground, or balance on one leg. Under Cut and Thrust rules, hits to the <b>leg</b> <b>or</b> <b>foot</b> are considered incapacitating. Many kingdoms contain additional clarifications of these rules, such as only permitting sitting on the ground when the leg is hit, and/or limiting the permitted angle of approach for the opponent while seated (to avoid unsafe strikes to the back).|$|R
50|$|A {{roundhouse}} kick (also {{known as}} swinging kick or a power angle kick) is {{a kick in}} which the attacker swings his <b>or</b> her <b>leg</b> around in a semicircular motion, striking with {{the front of the}} <b>leg</b> <b>or</b> <b>foot.</b> This type of kick is utilized in many different martial arts and is popular in both non-contact and full-contact martial arts competitions. The kick has many variations based on stance, leg movement, striking surface, and the height of the kick.|$|R
50|$|Chromoblastomycosis {{results in}} subcutaneous, crusty lesions that can spread over large areas on {{different}} parts of the body such as the legs, arms and face. If not treated, the lesions continue to increase in size over the body, but do not usually pose a risk of mortality. As the lesions grow, they can take on multiple forms that resemble nodes, tumours (resemble cauliflowers), and plaques. Infection causes inflammation of the <b>leg</b> <b>or</b> <b>foot</b> tissue, resulting in granulomas.|$|R
50|$|Back pain is pain {{felt in the}} back. Episodes of {{back pain}} may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic {{depending}} on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. The pain may radiate into the arms and hands {{as well as the}} <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet,</b> and may include paresthesia (tingling with no apparent cause), weakness or numbness in the legs and arms. The anatomic classification of back pain follows the segments of the spine: neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) with the lumbar vertebrae area most common for pain.|$|E
5000|$|In {{association}} football, {{where the}} shoes themselves {{are known as}} football boots, there are three different cleat types. There are soft ground cleats which are made for wet weather. The soft ground cleats are always replaceable, and are almost always metal, so when they wear down {{they are easy to}} replace. There are firm ground cleats which are made for firm natural surfaces. In the UK, 'cleats' are universally known as studs. The term [...] "studs up challenge" [...] is considered a dangerous tackle made with the feet raised and the potentially damaging metal studs impacting on the <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet</b> of the opponent.|$|E
50|$|In {{the open}} guard, the legs are not hooked {{together}} and the bottom grappler uses his <b>legs</b> <b>or</b> <b>feet</b> to push or pull in a more dynamic fashion. There are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Spider Guard, Lapel Guard, and even the newly emerging Worm Guard made popular by Keenan Cornelius. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name {{is derived from the}} resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.|$|E
