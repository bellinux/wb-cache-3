5|$|UEFA Euro 1996 {{was a more}} {{positive}} experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, and even his overall goalscoring record for England did not <b>look</b> <b>too</b> impressive so far; five goals in 23 games.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character <b>look</b> <b>too</b> childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|William Shatner plays Captain James T. Kirk; Shatner {{felt that}} though dramatic, the script made Kirk <b>look</b> <b>too</b> prejudiced. Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as the doctor in The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors {{got to know each other}} better than they ever had.|$|E
60|$|Gallantry in {{its true}} sense is {{supposed}} to ennoble and dignify a man; and love has shed refinements on innumerable Cymons. But Mr Pecksniff--perhaps because {{to one of his}} exalted nature these were mere grossnesses--certainly did not appear to any unusual advantage, now that he was left alone. On the contrary, he seemed to be shrunk and reduced; to be trying to hide himself within himself; and to be wretched at not having the power to do it. His shoes <b>looked</b> <b>too</b> large; his sleeve <b>looked</b> <b>too</b> long; his hair <b>looked</b> <b>too</b> limp; his features <b>looked</b> <b>too</b> mean; his exposed throat looked as if a halter would have done it good. For a minute or two, in fact, he was hot, and pale, and mean, and shy, and slinking, and consequently not at all Pecksniffian. But after that, he recovered himself, and went home with as beneficent an air {{as if he had been}} the High Priest of the summer weather.|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{producers}} considered having Michael Obiora play both {{the young and}} old version of Billy Shipton. However, {{it was decided that}} Obiora in makeup would <b>look</b> <b>too</b> fake, and so Louis Mahoney was cast to play the older version. Initially, Obiora played the role with a London accent; Mahoney, however, has a thick accent. Obiora had to re-dub his lines to match. Billy mentions that the windows of the TARDIS are the wrong size for a real police box. In 2004, when the first photographs of the new series' TARDIS prop were revealed, there was a vigorous discussion of the box's dimensions on the Outpost Gallifrey Doctor Who discussion forum, in which some fans complained that the prop's windows were too big. Moffat has confirmed that this line is an in-joke aimed at the Outpost Gallifrey forum.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke <b>look</b> <b>too</b> old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
25|$|At Uxbridge, Middlesex Crusaders {{proved the}} worth of wicket-taking bowling. Irfan Pathan dug out Matthew Walker with the second ball of the game, and that set {{the tone of the}} innings. Left-arm spinner Chris Peploe took three wickets, but conceded 35 runs, yet Kent's final total of 144 for 8 did not <b>look</b> <b>too</b> threatening. Owais Shah kept {{ploughing}} on his hard-hitting form, taking James Tredwell to the cleaners in his 59 not out, and Middlesex made it to 145 for 4 with 16 balls remaining in the innings, as none of the opposition bowlers took more than one wicket.|$|E

25|$|Hampshire Hawks got {{the four}} points from a closely fought match at New Road. Worcestershire Royals {{had won the}} toss and chosen to bat, and their innings was {{shortened}} to 34 overs out of a scheduled 45 due to rain. Wickets fell regularly, four batsmen being dismissed with scores in the thirties, and the final score of 185 for 7 did not <b>look</b> <b>too</b> threatening. John Crawley and Shane Watson put Hampshire back on track after two early wickets from Kabir Ali shook them, but an economical spell from Ray Price which yielded two wickets was nearly enough. However, the other spinner Gareth Batty {{was not nearly as}} economical, and Greg Lamb took him for runs to end with 16 not out and win the game for Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Within {{five years}} of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, {{replaced}} by a one-story porch. Other modifications were {{the addition of a}} conservatory and the demolition of outbuildings, including a stable. Upon Thompson's death the house was sold by his widow to Colonel Ernest H. Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would <b>look</b> <b>too</b> opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it.|$|E
25|$|The East Room {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. The White House was unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung laundry in the bare East Room to dry. Although much of the White House was finished and decorated during Adams administration, the East Room was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the East Room. (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted too many of the trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined to appropriate funds to finish the room for fear it would <b>look</b> <b>too</b> much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the East Room partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E

Kira's designs, according to Masatsugu Iwaseauthor of the Gundam SEED mangawas intended {{to be that of}} [...] "a spineless wimp while not making him <b>look</b> <b>too</b> childish", but he later decided to make him a strong character in the manga. The manga Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: The Edge Desire features a story about Kira's recovery following Freedom's destruction.|$|E
500|$|The animators had {{originally}} drawn three {{different versions of}} Bart after he was attacked by the wolf. They picked the version that looked the least scary, as {{they did not want}} Bart to <b>look</b> <b>too</b> [...] "beaten up". An animation error during the dream sequence with Mr. Burns also caused issues when dealing with network censors, mistaking a [...] "lump in his bed" [...] which was supposed to be Mr. Smithers' knee as an erection.|$|E

For scenes {{taking place in}} Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to [...] "get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also {{making sure that the}} effects work doesn't <b>look</b> <b>too</b> computer generated". [...] "We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments," [...] Morrison explained, [...] "but {{there is no substitute for}} starting with a real image and adding what you need." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} largely panned by video game critics for its simplistic graphics, sound, {{and the fact}} that many of the levels <b>looked</b> <b>too</b> similar.|$|R
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were highlighted}} positively. Kasavin {{was impressed with}} the amount of lighting and motion blur effects, and noted that the [...] "excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look." [...] Bryn Williams of GameSpy considered the graphics as a [...] "stunning look at what the 360 hardware is capable of", but also admitted that the animation [...] "is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness". IGN credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily <b>look</b> <b>too</b> shiny. The game's audio was said to feature [...] "heavy-hitting weapon effects [...] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms".|$|E
500|$|Although Usher [...] "didn't <b>look</b> <b>too</b> far" [...] when {{starting}} {{working on his}} fourth studio album Confessions and decided to [...] "continue building" [...] with previous producers, he branched out with several musical collaborators. Usher enlisted Philadelphia producers Andre [...] "Dre" [...] Harris and Vidal Davis of Dre & Vidal, along with other musical collaborators. During the sessions, Usher asked them to create a [...] "real up-tempo beat". When they worked on the track, they partied the whole time which Dre considered a [...] "partly record". He recalled, [...] "We had some women, some drinks, some music." [...] After Dre created the beat, they decided to [...] "make sure the mood was inspiring during recording." [...] They went to club to take a break, and played the song in Usher's truck while on the way. Usher felt the collaboration was pleasing, seeing other people responded positively to the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song include {{references}} to films Bale appeared in including Newsies, Swing Kids, American Psycho, and The Dark Knight. The song begins with the phrase, [...] "He is the Dark Knight, he is professional." [...] The piece incorporates audio clips from the incident {{through the use of}} sampling. The chorus {{of the song}} references Bale's use of the word professional in his altercation: [...] "Oh, whoo wow / He is professional / But I think he's lost control". Lyrics include: [...] "Swing Kid with a violent streak", [...] "Step back, stay out of his light / Better not try to put up a fight / Newsies will get you tonight / 'Cause they're professional!", and [...] "Don't <b>look</b> <b>too</b> deep in his eyes/he can't hide what's inside of his mind/and it might get a little bit ugly/and you might meet an American Psycho".|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to <b>look</b> <b>too</b> fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not <b>look</b> <b>too</b> bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding was}} {{described}} by Friedrich Christian Weber, the ambassador of Hanover, as [...] "solemnized by the court in masks".

Witnesses described the event, which took place on 27 and 28 January 1715, and which had been prepared for three months, as a [...] "world turned upside-down". The Jolly Company dressed in ridiculous regalia, and many people behaved exactly opposite to the norm; [...] "invitations to the guests were delivered by stammerers, the bridesmen were cripples, the runners were fat men with gout, the priest was allegedly one hundred years old" [...] (and blind). Hughes notes that the event may have been a [...] "variation on the Western charivari or shaming ceremonies", through which the Tsar could demonstrate how much power he had over his subjects' lives. During the wedding, the Drunken Synod routinely sang carols in the streets of Moscow and demanded money, which became a New Year tax for the wealthy.|$|E
