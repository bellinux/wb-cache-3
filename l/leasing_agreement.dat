The David Barton Gym, the first and largest tenant of the Block 37 project, has {{pulled out of the}} project favoring, instead, the Roosevelt Collection in the south loop. The reason the gym opted out was the delayed opening of the mall, which is scheduled for fall 2009 opening rather than fall 2008 as scheduled. In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its <b>leasing</b> <b>agreement,</b> and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new storefront in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's haberdashery Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, Starfruit Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini. Also, in the face of declining advertising revenue, CBS sought to sublease part of its studio. A Loews Hotel will be built in forthcoming years.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, the Clippers {{joined the}} Lakers and Los Angeles Kings {{in the new}} Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles. In sharing the {{building}} with other tenants, such as the more popular Lakers, the Clippers, with relatively low success, were often overshadowed. Also, because {{of the terms of}} its <b>leasing</b> <b>agreement</b> with Staples Center, the Kings and Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker and Clipper-King doubleheaders (which continues as of 2016). However, in the years after, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue. Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold out every regular season and post-season home game, behind the popularity of stars Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{complexity}} of <b>lease</b> <b>agreements,</b> it seeks to establish why lease negotiations have become have become complex leading to slower turnaround time of finalizing the <b>lease</b> <b>agreement.</b> A survey approach was adopted and data was collected through questionnaires and interviews from landlords, managing agents of listed property funds and national tenants in the commercial retail property industry in Gauteng. The findings indicate that the turn-around time of finalising <b>lease</b> <b>agreements</b> is affected by complicated negotiations that {{are a result of}} both parties to a negotiation having a standard <b>lease</b> <b>agreement,</b> <b>lease</b> <b>agreements</b> that come in a large variety, lease clauses that cannot be reduced to a monetary value and factors affecting the property market.

U.S. Senator John McCain questioned whether it is really cost-effective for the USAF to lease aircraft at all, particularly as the aircraft would probably not have many, if any, buyers when their U.S. military service ended. This was derided as an uninformed criticism, as there were many U.S. allies in need of tanker aircraft. The Congressional Budget Office has also criticized the draft <b>leasing</b> <b>agreement</b> as fiscally irresponsible.
