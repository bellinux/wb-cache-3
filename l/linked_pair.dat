The lower wings were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper wings supported over the fuselage on each side by a <b>linked</b> <b>pair</b> of vertical cabane struts from the upper longeron.|$|E
40|$|A 2 -dimensional {{framework}} (G; p) is a graph G = (V;E) {{together with}} a map p: V! R 2. We consider the framework to be a straight line realization of G in R 2. Two realizations of G are equivalent if the corresponding edges in the two frameworks have the same length. A pair of vertices fu; vg is globally linked in G if {{the distance between the}} points corresponding to u and v is the same in all pairs of equivalent generic realizations of G. In this paper we extend our previous results on globally <b>linked</b> <b>pairs</b> and complete the characterization of globally <b>linked</b> <b>pairs</b> in minimally rigid graphs. We also show that the Henneberg 1 -extension operation on a non-redundant edge preserves the property of being not globally linked, which can be used to identify globally <b>linked</b> <b>pairs</b> in broader families of graphs. We prove that if (G; p) is generic then the set of globally <b>linked</b> <b>pairs</b> does not change if we perturb the coordinates slightly. Finally, we investigate when we can choose a non-redundant edge e of G and then continuously deform a generic realization of G e to obtain equivalent generic realizations of G in which the distances between a given pair of vertices are dierent. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{following}} two observations. On the one hand, there is the following special feature of the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion τM,σ of an oriented rational homology 3 -sphere M with a Spin c-structure σ: its reduction τM,σ modulo 1 induces a quadratic function qM,σ over the <b>linking</b> <b>pairing</b> λM. On the other hand, there is a canonical bijective affine correspondence σ ↦ → φM,σ between Spin c-structures of M and quadratic functions over the <b>linking</b> <b>pairing</b> λM. This correspondence was described algebraically in [2] and [5]. In [3], where the relation between Spin c-structures of M and quadratic functions over the <b>linking</b> <b>pairing</b> of M was extensively studied, we gave an explicit and geometric construction of the quadratic function φM,σ (as well as a generalization to all 3 -manifolds). It is therefore natural to ask whether qM,σ is exactly φM,σ. We answer this question to the affirmative. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Intel {{describes}} the data throughput (in GB/s) by counting only the 64-bit data payload in each 80-bit [...] "flit". However, Intel then doubles the result because the unidirectional {{send and receive}} <b>link</b> <b>pair</b> can be simultaneously active. Thus, Intel describes a 20-lane QPI <b>link</b> <b>pair</b> (send and receive) with a 3.2 GHz clock as having a data rate of 25.6 GB/s. A clock rate of 2.4 GHz yields a data rate of 19.2 GB/s.

Millar and Newcombe Houses face Dundas Street, the thoroughfare linking Castle to Cumberland Street {{at the north end of}} the city block containing Selwyn College. The two are linked to form an archway giving access to the quadrangle from the north. All three of these buildings are two storeyed and are finished in unpainted, rendered cement. Their forms are those of hipped roof houses. They are rather plain and the northward <b>linked</b> <b>pair</b> are set behind a brick wall along the street.|$|E
50|$|Tracking the {{movement}} of genes resulting from crossovers has proven quite useful to geneticists. Because two genes that are close together {{are less likely to}} become separated than genes that are farther apart, geneticists can deduce roughly how far apart two genes are on a chromosome if they know the frequency of the crossovers. Geneticists can also use this method to infer the presence of certain genes. Genes that typically stay together during recombination are said to be linked. One gene in a <b>linked</b> <b>pair</b> can sometimes be used as a marker to deduce the presence of another gene. This is typically used in order to detect the presence of a disease-causing gene.|$|E

50|$|House and Garden are a diptych (or <b>linked</b> <b>pair)</b> {{of plays}} {{written by the}} English playwright Alan Ayckbourn, first {{performed}} in 1999. They {{are designed to be}} staged simultaneously, with the same cast in adjacent auditoria, and were published together as House & Garden. House takes place in the drawing room, and Garden in the grounds, of a large country house. Each play is self-contained (although each of course refers more or less obliquely to events in the other), and they may be attended in either order. As is typical of his work, Ayckbourn portrays the mostly bittersweet relationships between more or less unhappy, upper-middle-class people. The title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the magazine House & Garden, in which country houses and gardens are often portrayed as idyllic, peaceful places.|$|E

50|$|The first village {{tax records}} for Boeotia, in 1466, {{shortly after the}} Ottoman Turkish conquest of Greece, show vividly this absence of Greek {{settlements}} in the Lowlands and {{a small number of}} enlarged refuge villages in the hills of Boeotia. Eastern Boeotia with the large plains and plateaus around Tanagra is especially empty. To recolonise this landscape between 1400−1500 AD the final Frankish Dukes of Athens and then the Ottoman rulers invited large numbers of new settlers, from Albania, with the specific direction to locate new villages near abandoned ones from the previous settlement system. This is the origin of our modern villages at Tanagra (former Bratsi) and at Kleidi (Kleideti). After some 100 years of Ottoman rule, the peaceful conditions of the Pax Ottomanic saw population rise for both Greek and Albanian villages, as well as new village foundations. The Ottoman village tax record for 1570 shows this well. Modern Ayios Thomas has a more complex history; it is rather recent, and was founded by villagers moving out of the mountains between Boeotia and Attica {{at the end of the}} Turkish era and after the War of Greek Independence, in the early 19th century AD.
