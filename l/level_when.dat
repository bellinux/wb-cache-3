5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol <b>level.</b> <b>When</b> a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing <b>level.</b> <b>When</b> a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground <b>level</b> <b>when</b> the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|The console {{features}} parental controls, {{which can}} be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age <b>level.</b> <b>When</b> one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to Nintendo GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes {{and patterns of}} lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline <b>level</b> <b>when</b> the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a <b>level</b> <b>when</b> they entered it the first time.|$|E
5|$|Born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, McGurk {{played for}} Marton Boys {{from the age}} of nine up until under-15 <b>level,</b> <b>when</b> he was {{approached}} by Middlesbrough and Sunderland to play matches for them. He was invited back to Middlesbrough after playing for them, but was offered a contract by Sunderland and stayed with the club for six months before being released. He started a Youth Training Scheme with Darlington in July 1999 and progressed through the club's youth system. He made his first-team debut on 17 November 2001, as a 45th-minute substitute in a 1–0 away win Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Cup first round. He finished the 2001–02 season with 13 appearances and signed a professional contract with Darlington on 9 August 2002. He scored Darlington's equalising goal away to Kidderminster on 17 January 2004, halting a run of five 1–0 defeats out of six matches for the team during 2003–04, which helped them avoid relegation from the Third Division. He finished the season with 31 appearances and four goals.|$|E

5|$|Louis van Gaal rated Hasselbaink {{more highly}} than Rijkaard, meaning more chances at {{international}} <b>level</b> <b>when</b> van Gaal {{took over as}} manager in July 2000. Hasselbaink scored against Spain in a 2–1 win at the Estadio de La Cartuja on 15 November 2000 but both he and Spanish captain Fernando Hierro were sent off for fighting late in the game. On 24 March 2001, he scored in a 5–0 win over Andorra at the Mini Estadi, and four days later converted a penalty in a draw with Portugal at the Estádio das Antas. On 25 April he scored in his third successive World Cup qualifying game, in a 4–0 win over Cyprus at the Philips Stadion. He later played against Estonia (twice), England, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark; he scored a penalty past Denmark in a 1–1 draw at Telia Parken.

Immediately afterwards, Alavés were almost <b>level</b> <b>when</b> Contra put another ball into the penalty area, however, Henchoz cleared the ball before an Alavés player could reach it. In the 35th minute, Alavés were again nearly level. Alonso's header fell to Javi Moreno, who went past Henchoz his shot was saved by Westerveld after it his chest. The rebound fell to Ivan Tomić, but Westerveld again saved his shot. Five minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a penalty.

5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude <b>level.</b> <b>When</b> the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E

5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power <b>level.</b> <b>When</b> later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel <b>level</b> <b>when</b> there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives.

As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks.
