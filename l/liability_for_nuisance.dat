50|$|The {{plaintiff}} Mrs Lamb, {{who owned}} a house off Hamstead Heath in London, had let this property to a tenant and then travelled to America. Whilst away, the defendant Camden London Borough Council carried out building works nearby which included the digging of a trench. This caused a water main to burst, which in turn caused subsidence. The house became uninhabitable and the tenant moved out. Mrs Lamb returned from America for six weeks to prepare the house for repair work {{and one of the}} things she did was to put all of the furniture into storage. She then returned to America. However, the house was now invaded by squatters who caused some £30,000 worth of damage. Having finally evicted the squatters and carried out the repair work, Mrs Lamb sued the Council, who admitted <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>nuisance.</b> There was thus no issue with the Council paying for the subsidence damage on its own (£50,000). The point of law which arose was whether Mrs Lamb could recover from the Council the £30,000 due to the squatters' damage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>nuisance</b> {{is often}} {{imposed on the}} ground of {{defendant}} 2 ̆ 7 s negligence or more grievous fault in causing it. The Restatement would impose strict liability only where the nuisance stems from abnormally dangerous activity on defendant 2 ̆ 7 s part. But these concepts by no means cover the whole field. There are many instances of nuisance where liability is imposed though defendant has not been negligent (still less wanton) and where his activity is not abnormally dangerous...|$|E
5000|$|By contrast, a {{nuisance}} per se is [...] "an activity, or an act, structure, instrument, or occupation which is {{a nuisance}} at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings." [...] <b>Liability</b> <b>for</b> a <b>nuisance</b> per se is absolute, and injury to the public is presumed; if its existence is alleged and established by proof, it is also established {{as a matter of}} law. [...] Therefore, a judge would decide a nuisance per se, while a jury would decide a nuisance in fact.|$|R
40|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, and after a long line of {{conflicting}} case law, the question about the basis of liability in nuisance was settled: in Scotland, damages are awarded only upon proof of fault (RHM Bakeries (Scotland) Ltd v Strathclyde Regional Council 1985 SC (HL) 17). Fault, in turn, can adopt many forms: malice, intention, recklessness, negligence, and conduct causing a special risk of abnormal damage (Kennedy v Glenbelle Ltd 1995 SC 95). Many aspects of this seemingly clear picture, however, remain problematic. On the one hand, the way in which this model is interpreted and applied gives place to particular forms of liability that can actually be characterised as strict. On the other hand, two other areas of the law of neighbours that overlap with the scope of nuisance do not fit entirely this model, namely the regulation of disputes over uses of water and of those arising from withdrawal of support. The main argument of this thesis is that damages claims in the context of neighbourhood are governed by two distinct rules: a general fault-based <b>liability</b> rule <b>for</b> <b>nuisance,</b> and an exceptional strict <b>liability</b> rule <b>for</b> abnormally dangerous conduct. For the first of these rules, the thesis offers an evaluation of the fault model adopted in Kennedy v Glenbelle Ltd, explaining the interaction between its different elements and highlighting the developments that can result in forms of strict <b>liability.</b> <b>For</b> the second of these rules, the thesis develops an analysis of its elements and nature, as well as a proposal that delineates its scope of application. This two-rule model offers a justification for the current structure of the law applicable to disputes over uses of water. The strict liability rule applicable to interferences with the natural flow of watercourses, traditionally explained as based upon the infringement of property rights, is better explained as danger-based. The regulation of disputes arising from withdrawal of support, however, is not consistent with this model, even though they have also been characterised as nuisances. It is argued that this framework entails unjustified inconsistencies, both internal and by reference to the model proposed, and that it should be adjusted accordingly...|$|R
