5|$|Across England, {{many public}} houses and inns were renamed after Daniel <b>Lambert,</b> {{particularly}} in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel <b>Lambert</b> public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, {{near the entrance}} to St Paul's Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel <b>Lambert</b> and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes <b>Lambert</b> had been wearing when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel <b>Lambert.</b>|$|E
5|$|Daniel <b>Lambert</b> {{was born}} at his parents' house in Blue Boar Lane, Leicester, on 13 March 1770. His father, also named Daniel <b>Lambert,</b> had been the huntsman to Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, {{and at the time}} of his son's birth was the keeper of Leicester's gaol. The eldest of four children, Daniel <b>Lambert</b> had two sisters, and a brother who died young.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lambert's</b> Cove Road is {{separated}} into two sections. Lower <b>Lambert's</b> Cove {{begins in the}} Town of Tisbury and contains the old cranberry bog. Upper <b>Lambert's</b> Cove begins {{in the center of}} West Tisbury and accesses <b>Lambert's</b> Cove Beach, Seth's Pond and the FOCUS Study Center. It is the sole access to a large number of summer and year-round residences.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lambert's</b> Cove is {{a region}} in Tisbury and West Tisbury, Massachusetts, {{on the island}} of Martha's Vineyard. It extends from Upper <b>Lambert's</b> Cove in west Tisbury to Lower <b>Lambert's</b> Cove in Tisbury. <b>Lambert's</b> Cove Road accesses several roads of note, {{including}} Makonikey and Longview. It is noted for its picturesque views of the hilly region of [...] "up island." [...] The road is the only access to West Tisbury's north shore coastline, and accesses the only public beach of the town. Some sites of note found along <b>Lambert's</b> Cove include <b>Lambert's</b> Cove Beach, Makonikey beach, Cottle's lumberyard, the old cranberry bog, Duarte's Pond and Seth's Pond. It also accesses the FOCUS Study Center, a faith-based summer camp near Seth's Pond. <b>Lambert's</b> Cove is also mentioned in popular folk artist James Taylor's song [...] "Terra Nova" [...] ("Out to the west of <b>Lambert's</b> Cove, there is a sail out in the sun..."), sung by then wife Carly Simon.|$|R

5|$|As the queen's son Radama grew to adulthood, {{he became}} {{increasingly}} disillusioned {{by the high}} death toll of his mother's military campaigns and traditional measures of justice, and was frustrated by her unilateral rejection of European influence. The young prince developed sympathetic relationships with the handful of Europeans permitted by Ranavalona to frequent her court, namely Jean Laborde and Joseph-François <b>Lambert,</b> with whom he privately concluded the lucrative <b>Lambert</b> Charter. The charter, which would come into effect upon Radama's accession to the throne, granted <b>Lambert</b> large tracts of land and exclusive rights to road construction, mineral extraction, timber harvesting and other activities on the island. In May 1857, when Rainilaiarivony was 29 years old, <b>Lambert</b> consequently invited Prince Radama, Rainivoninahitriniony, Rainilaiarivony {{and a number of}} other officers to conspire with him in a plot to overthrow Ranavalona.|$|E
5|$|During the 1904 World's Fair, {{ballooning}} {{was demonstrated}} {{as a viable}} means of transportation; in October 1907, the second Gordon Bennett Cup, an international balloon racing event, {{was held in the}} city. The first airplane flight occurred in late 1909, and by the next year, an airfield had been established in nearby Kinloch, Missouri. In October 1910, St. Louis hosted President Theodore Roosevelt, who became the first president to fly in an airplane after departing from the field. In 1925, local entrepreneur Albert <b>Lambert</b> purchased Kinloch Field, expanded its facilities, and renamed it <b>Lambert</b> Field. In May 1927, Charles Lindbergh departed from <b>Lambert</b> Field en route to New York to begin his solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. In early 1928, the city of St. Louis purchased the airport from <b>Lambert,</b> making it the first municipally owned airport in the United States; <b>Lambert</b> remains the area's primary airport.|$|E
5|$|In late 1809, a MrJ. Drakard {{released}} The life of {{that wonderful}} and extraordinary heavy man, the late Danl. <b>Lambert,</b> from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of <b>Lambert</b> to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but <b>Lambert</b> had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E

A residential section was also developed to house {{the families of the}} workers. Many early residents of <b>Lambert's</b> Point were involved in the coal industry. By 1900, Norfolk was the leading coal exporting port on the East Coast. The area including <b>Lamberts</b> Point was annexed by the City of Norfolk in 1911.|$|R
5|$|Joan Marie <b>Lambert</b> (Veronica Cartwright) is the {{navigator}} of the Nostromo and {{the only}} other woman on the ship besides Ripley. Disinclined to take risks beyond her console, she resents being chosen {{as part of the}} team to explore the Derelict. After Kane's infestation by the facehugger, she berates Ripley for refusing to allow her {{and the rest of the}} team aboard. When the Alien begins to kill her crew, <b>Lambert</b> insists that they evacuate the Nostromo. While preparing to leave on a shuttle, <b>Lambert</b> and Parker are confronted by the Alien which kills them. During Ripley's ICC tribunal, fifty-seven years after the first incident, a screen details the deceased members of the Nostromo crew (including <b>Lambert,</b> who is revealed as a trans woman).|$|E
5|$|On 1955-09-12, SH-8 {{underwent}} a small realignment. Previously, the highway went due north from Carmen, then turned due east, running through <b>Lambert</b> before connecting to US-64 south of Cherokee. As {{a result of}} the 1955 realignment, SH-8 cut northeast to connect to US-64 directly, bypassing <b>Lambert.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract In its {{classical}} denition <b>Lambert’s</b> problem {{deals with}} ballistic arcs, i. e. conic sections. With new propulsion technologies having reached unprecedented maturity levels {{it is now}} meaningful to consider other types of solutions to the dynamic of objects in a simple newtonian gravitational eld. It is therefore opportune to reconsider <b>Lambert’s</b> problem taking into account forced dynamical behaviors. In this work the solution to <b>Lambert’s</b> problem is given for a particular class of low-thrust trajectories named exponential sinusoids. The equivalent to <b>Lambert’s</b> Theorem is derived, the time of ight curves are parameterized with a suitable variable and some discussion is made on some possible applications. I...|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, <b>Lambert</b> {{received}} a message from Hamelin, promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and Iphigenia were both surrendered without resistance. The message also threatened that if <b>Lambert</b> refused, the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force. Recognising that food supplies were low, reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were almost empty, <b>Lambert</b> agreed to the terms. <b>Lambert</b> later received a message from Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin. Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him, but eventually agreed to accept {{the terms of the}} surrender as well. The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated, although the remainder of the prisoners were placed in a cramped and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which, despite the terms of the surrender, they were not released until British forces captured the island in December.|$|E

5|$|A set of Lambert's clothes, {{together}} with his armchair, walking stick, riding crop and prayer book, are on permanent display at the Newarke Houses Museum in Leicester. Stamford Museum exhibited a tailor's dummy, dressed with Daniel Lambert's clothes {{as if they are}} being made up for him, plus his hat and a portrait. The Daniel <b>Lambert</b> pub in Ludgate Hill no longer exists, and the memorabilia formerly displayed there are now on permanent display at the George Hotel in Stamford. The Daniel <b>Lambert</b> pub in Stamford has also closed.|$|E
50|$|The Lambert/Baxter book {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} Boxall but {{was longer and}} had a structured format.

50|$|Hodémont {{received}} his musical education at Saint <b>Lambert's</b> Cathedral in Liege. From 1595 he {{studied at the}} University of Leuven. On 15 October 1610 he was appointed as succentor at the collegiate church of Saint Pierre in Liège. In 1612 he became the canon at Saint <b>Lambert's</b> Cathedral and at the Church of St. Maternus in 1616. On 26 October 1619 he became choirmaster (maître de chant) at Saint <b>Lambert's</b> Cathedral. He held this position until 25 February 1633.|$|R
40|$|We give two new proofs of <b>Lambert's</b> theorem on the {{elapsed time}} along a Keplerian arc. The first one, in Hamilton's style, uses a variational {{principle}} {{and seems to}} be minimal {{in the sense that we}} doubt that a shorter argument may exist. The second one, in <b>Lambert's</b> style, is constructive and elementary. It starts with the remark that two Keplerian arcs related by <b>Lambert's</b> theorem correspond with each other through an affine map. We also give some related statements on Keplerian arcs and conic sections. We review an impressive list of published proofs of <b>Lambert's</b> theorem, which appears as an unachieved quest for a simpler argument. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5|$|After {{her second}} divorce from Burton in 1978, Taylor sold the diamond in June 1979 to Henry <b>Lambert,</b> a {{jeweller}} from New York for a figure believed to between $3–5 million.

5|$|Biographers {{and critics}} agree that Louis <b>Lambert</b> is a thinly veiled {{version of the}} author, {{evidenced}} by numerous similarities between them. As {{a student at the}} Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's faith was shaken {{at the time of his}} first communion. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like <b>Lambert</b> – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the dormitories.|$|E
50|$|Situated on the hilly, western {{coast of}} the Island of Martha's Vineyard, the <b>Lambert's</b> Cove region can most closely be {{distinguished}} by its hilly terrain. The area contains the northernmost extension of the hilly range that extends {{from the tip of}} Aquinnah to Upper <b>Lambert's</b> Cove. The appearance of such hills on the island falls {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively flat land of the rest of Martha's Vineyard. This flatland is often attributed to the glacial activity that separated Martha's Vineyard from the mainland 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age. The eastern parts of Martha's Vineyard, including <b>Lambert's</b> Cove, avoided the glacial scraping and thus retained their hilly terrain. The <b>Lambert's</b> Cove region is also home to many of the oak and beech trees on the island of Martha's Vineyard. As opposed to the scrub oaks and pines located on the rest of Martha's Vineyard, <b>Lambert's</b> Cove is home to many of the thicker and greener forests on the island.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of the new}} {{conifers}} {{discovered by}} David Douglas and others, including the Coast Redwood, were described {{for the first time}} in <b>Lambert's</b> books; several of these were actually described by collaborating authors, notably David Don, who included their work in <b>Lambert's</b> book.|$|R

5|$|Dennis Monroe Parker (Yaphet Kotto) is the Nostromo chief engineer; Brett is his assistant. On the ship, he incessantly demands {{bonuses for}} {{investigating}} the Derelicts distress beacon. After Dallas' fateful {{confrontation with the}} Alien, Parker investigates and finds the flamethrower left behind. When Ash attacks Ripley, Parker and <b>Lambert</b> save her and decapitate the android. After Ripley extracts the meaning of Ash's directive to allow the crew to die, Parker uses the flamethrower to incinerate his remains. He and <b>Lambert</b> are killed by the Alien when it ambushes them {{in their attempt to}} flee aboard the shuttle, with the Alien crushing Parker and finishing him off with a head bite.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lambert's</b> {{essay about}} metaphysics, Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay {{himself as a}} boy, and – as in the novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. <b>Lambert's</b> genius and {{philosophical}} erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that <b>Lambert's</b> madness reflects (consciously or not) Balzac's own unsteady mental state. His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers {{at the time to}} suspect his sanity.|$|R
