5|$|A typical {{example of}} David's {{approach}} {{in this book}} is her section on pot au feu, which covers six pages, with sub-sections on the choice of meat, the vegetables, the saucepan, quantities, preparation, cooking, serving, using <b>leftovers,</b> and regional variations of the dish.|$|E
40|$|Background: Food has {{not only}} {{considerable}} therapeutic but also economic value. The success of food provision is related to <b>leftover</b> that can indicate less optimum food provision in hospitals. <b>Leftover</b> indicates the presence of wasted cost. Objective: To analyze <b>leftover</b> and cost of <b>leftover</b> of schizophrenic inpatients at Madani Mental Hospital Palu. Method: The study used cross sectional method. Subject {{of the study were}} schizophrenic inpatients who got ordinary food portion had been mobilized from acute to common room 2 x 24 hours, put in class 3 room, were able to eat food on their own with exclusion criteria the presence of accompanying diseases that could affect appetite and got food from outside the hospital (n = 35). Data were analyzed quantitatively using chi square to find out factors related with the presence of <b>leftover.</b> Data of respondent characteristics and cost of <b>leftover</b> were analyzed descriptively. Result: There was difference in <b>leftover</b> based on sex and portion in particular rice and animal side dish <b>leftover</b> (p < 0. 05) but {{there was no significant difference}} in age, type of schizophrenic disease, duration of hospitalization and previous hospitalization (p ≥ 0. 05). Total cost of wasted food a day was Rp 1, 529. 33. Conclusion: There was difference in <b>leftover</b> based on sex and portion particularly rice and animal side dish <b>leftover.</b> Average amount of <b>leftover</b> varied according to eating time and types of food. Cost of wasted food varied according to types of food...|$|R
5|$|These {{ideas can}} be {{illustrated}} by drawing objects in pairs. It {{is difficult to}} depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a <b>leftover</b> object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, {{in the group of}} five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a <b>leftover</b> object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no <b>leftover</b> object, so 4 is even. In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a <b>leftover</b> object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no <b>leftover</b> object, so 0 is even.|$|R

5|$|Silverware is common, but food is {{traditionally}} manipulated {{with the right}} hand. Breakfast consists of <b>leftovers</b> of bread and fruit with coffee or tea. Generally breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from bananas and flour, bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from street vendors.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} food waste {{produced}} (often unintentionally or unavoidably, due to lifestyle) by consumers, advisory campaigns and articles have put forward varying advice and suggestions. The following strategies: planning before food shopping, understanding food date labels and using <b>leftovers</b> in other meals, are universally {{agreed to be}} effective in preventing food waste.|$|E

5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on <b>leftovers</b> from the streets. Around this time, he {{realised}} that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|The Cliff House Sandstone is the area's {{youngest}} rock layer. It {{was formed}} after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded {{and as a}} result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate <b>leftovers</b> from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving <b>leftovers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often <b>leftovers</b> from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of <b>leftovers</b> it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of {{childhood}} trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy. This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal, {{the female}} redback {{lives in an}} untidy web in a warm {{sheltered}} location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, It first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The Redback Spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the Redback Spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live {{on the periphery of}} the female spiders' web and steal <b>leftovers.</b> Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.|$|E

Respondents with <b>leftover</b> drugs were more educated, more knowledgeable about antimicrobial drugs, younger, and female. Of respondents with <b>leftover</b> drugs, 44 % kept them in case of future need, and 18 % had taken these drugs without medical advice. Antimicrobial drug resistance is increasing worldwide and is related to use of these drugs (1, 2). Use of <b>leftover</b> drugs may increase antimicrobial drug resistance in the community by exerting selective pressure in the commensal flora (3, 4). Retention and use of <b>leftover</b> antimicrobial drugs are widespread in countries that sell antimicrobial drugs without a prescription (i. e., over-thecounter) (5, 6). In countries in which over-the-counter antimicrobial drug sales are restricted, studies on use of <b>leftover</b> drugs have been few and mostly questionnairebased, relying on respondent recall (7, 8). A large survey of British household drug practices showed that 2 % of medicines were <b>leftover</b> or standby drugs (9), but no information was obtained about the households containing them. To inform antimicrobial drug education campaigns (10, 11) and research examining the relationship between antimicrobial drug prescribing and resistance (12), we conducted a household survey to identify antimicrobial drugs present and the characteristics of respondents who kept them...|$|R
40|$|A Laboratory {{experiment}} {{was used to}} evaluate the effect of extruded <b>leftover</b> food as an alternate source of fish diet to Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, 76. 75 ± 1. 27 g). Three experimental diets were used. Two extruded <b>leftover</b> food types [with minerals and vitamins (type- 1) and without (type- 2) were used to prepare two experimental treatments in duplicate as compared to a commercial tilapia diet (ARASCO) as a control. The final body weight and Specific Growth Rate (SGR) were not affected by different types of <b>leftover</b> feed. Whereas, the Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) and the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) were significantly affected by the different feeds. The highest significant values of FCR was shown for fish fed with extruded <b>leftover</b> feed without premix, while Nile tilapia fed with control diet recorded the highest values of PER. The present study showed that the extruded <b>leftover</b> food could be used to prepare least cost diet for Nile tilapia...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the amount of plate waste and how plate waste was {{disposed}} by early adolescent girls using a mobile food record (mFR). Participants were girls nine to thirteen years residing in O’ahu, Hawai’i (n = 93). Foods selected and <b>leftover</b> were estimated using a three day mFR. Each <b>leftover</b> food was then classified as thrown into the trash, fed to a pet, eaten later, or other (e. g., composted). Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted and Tukey’s post-hoc test were used to adjust for multiple comparisons between times (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack) on <b>leftover</b> food and <b>leftover</b> food thrown into the trash. The percentage of food <b>leftover</b> and thrown into the trash was highest at lunch. The percentage of protein, grain, vegetables, fruit, and dairy <b>leftover</b> at lunch were unexpectedly low compared to previous studies. The median for percentage of food thrown into the trash at lunch was < 5 % for all food groups, and was consistently low across the day (< 10 %). Average energy intake was 436 kcal (± 216) at lunch, and 80 % of caregivers reported total household income as ≥$ 70, 000.

40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} this survey was to {{investigate}} the frequency of <b>leftover</b> drugs at homes and related factors regarding this problem. METHOD: This descriptive study was performed among 692 non-medical personnel servicing at two military bases in December 2006. Data were collected by using a questionnaire, which had been developed by the investigators. Frequencies and percents were used as descriptive statistics. Chi-square test was used to compare the frequencies of <b>leftover</b> drugs according to certain variables. RESULTS: Of the total participants 78, 8 % were males, 72, 8 % aged between 18 to 39, and 29, 6 % were unmarried. The findings revealed that 61, 3 % of the participants had <b>leftover</b> drugs at their homes. Participants living with together 2 to 4 family members had higher frequencies of <b>leftover</b> drugs at homes. When we looked at the frequencies of <b>leftover</b> drugs according to drug use behaviors; the frequency of <b>leftover</b> drug was determined higher among those who stated; the recipe was not explained sufficiently, he did not use drugs as directed, he kept drugs until due time when did not use all of the drugs, he kept drugs in a box or bag, he visited a health center {{in order to have a}} recipe (p< 0, 05). CONCLUSION: It was determined <b>leftover</b> drugs were kept at nearly two third of the participants&# 146; homes. Regarding incompleteness of treatment, the intoxication risk for children, and drug waste, this frequency of drug <b>leftover</b> was high, and all responsible professions in the chain of rationale drug use particularly physicians should be awaked on this issue.
