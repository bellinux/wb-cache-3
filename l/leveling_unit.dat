40|$|This report {{presents}} the conceptual {{design for a}} Direct-Hydrogen-Fueled Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell System for transportation applications. The design {{is based on the}} initial selection of the Chrysler LH sedan as the target vehicle with a 50 kW (gross) PEM Fuel Cell Stack (FCS) as the primary power source, a battery-powered Load <b>Leveling</b> <b>Unit</b> (LLU) for surge power requirements, an on-board hydrogen storage subsystem containing high pressure gaseous storage, a Gas Management Subsystem (GMS) to manage the hydrogen and air supplies for the FCS, and electronic controllers to control the electrical system. The design process has been dedicated to the use of Design-to-Cost (DTC) principles. The Direct Hydrogen-Powered PEM Fuel Cell Stack Hybrid Vehicle (DPHV) system is designed to operate on the Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS) and Hiway Cycles. These cycles have been used to evaluate the vehicle performance with regard to range and hydrogen usage. The major constraints for the DPHV vehicle are vehicle and battery weight, transparency of the power system and drive train to the user, equivalence of fuel and life cycle costs to conventional vehicles, and vehicle range. The energy and power requirements are derived by the capability of the DPHV system to achieve an acceleration from 0 to 60 MPH within 12 seconds, and the capability to achieve and maintain a speed of 55 MPH on a grade of seven percent. The conceptual design for the DPHV vehicle is shown in a figure. A detailed description of the Hydrogen Storage Subsystem is given in section 4. A detailed description of the FCS Subsystem and GMS is given in section 3. A detailed description of the LLU, selection of the LLU energy source, and the power controller designs is given in section 5...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Automatic {{guidance}} of tractors in the mechanized farming practice {{has taken the}} attention of agricultural engineers {{in the last two}} decades. For this to be truly practical on the farm, it should be economical, simple to operate and entirely contained on the vehicle. Different types of steering systems such as leader- cable, laser- controlled, radio- operated and contactor- type have been developed for automatic guidance. The automatic leveling system is used on hillside machines to keep the separator level when operating on hillsides. This system has three parts: fluid level system, electrical system and hydraulic system. The fluid level system consists of fluid reservoir and a leveling control switch box. The fluid level system actuates the electrical system of the <b>leveling</b> <b>unit.</b> The electrical system which actuated by the fluid system consist of four micro switches in the leveling control switch box, two micro switches in the limit control box, a solenoid in the hydraulic control level, manual leveling control switch, and a leveling limit warning light. The hydraulic system maintains the level of the separator when the machine is operating on a hillside. The present study was aimed to develop a reliable, versatile and easy to maintain system to fit our economy and low technology level of farmers for hillside- range development or fallow farming. The automatic guidance system has been implemented successfully on agricultural vehicles on the basis of three components, i. e. sensors, processors and actuator elements. The study site (N, latitude; E, longitude; and 1810 m above sea level) was located at the Agricultural Research Center, Shiraz University, 15 km northwest of Shiraz, Fars Province, Iran. MF- 399 agricultural tractor manufactured by ITMCO, Tabriz, Iran was used for doing the experiments. Materials and Methods:The Level Sensing System: The biaxial tilt industrial sensor (ZCT 245 AL- China) with digital output can be connected to the computer and received angular position in x and y coordinates. An assumed degree could be considered as basis degree and the measured frequency was adjustable. The tilt sensor located along the axial length of tractor and leads the angles which are created by longitudinal axle transverse axle of the tractor in related to horizontal level. It was used for contour lines detecting. The potentiometer located on the steering wheel of the tractor and pressure sensor which used with goniometer sensor used keeping uniformly of leveling points in tractor motion. The pressure sensor (SN-SCP 1000 - South Korea) which is used in leveling system can detect the elevation changes. In this way, by defining a limitation of altitude for system, it would be able to stop steering turning motor which was coupled to tractor steering rod automatically. By resetting, the tractor could be able to live in a new level position. To avoid excessive left and right steering wheels deviation and interfering with other lines of travel, potentiometer was used. The deviation degree for steering rod from center to left or right was selected 120 degrees. Accordingly, the wheels {{would not be able to}} move more than 10 degrees to each direction. The Processing System: The electrical circuit graphically designed and simulated by software (Altium Designer, 2009) and installed on the tractor. The components of this circuit are as follows: Electrical board, two relays which control the electrical pathway in both directions, a battery with 12 volts of electric potential as electrical power supply, ATmeGA 32 microcontroller which was made by Atmel company as main core for information processing, RS 232 protocol was used for making correlation between serial port (COM) and the microcontroller and two capacitors for reducing noises. The Actuator System: The output signals from the a processing system, were lead in the actuator system would order and indicative of left- turn or right- turn command, were introduced to actuator- units include an electric- gearbox motor that stimulate the steering wheel shaft of the tractor by chain and sprocket and conduct the tractor in leveling traces at the desired speed. Before hitching any implements such as row planter behind the tractor, the system was successfully tested on average slopes of 14. 5...|$|E
40|$|The power <b>leveling</b> (PL) <b>unit</b> is {{required}} to maintain {{a balance of power}} flow for photovoltaic (PV) system. It is important for it to respond quickly against fluctuation of power generation. A new control scheme based on discrete time system for the PL unit in the distributed generator (DG) is proposed to improve the response. In the proposed method, the deadbeat control is performed using state equations obtained from a combination of two-quadrant chopper and super capacitors. The optimal duty ratio of PWM can be calculated and good performance of the current regulation is obtained. The control theory and the simulation results are presented in this paper. 15 th International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems, ICEMS 2012; Sapporo; Japan; 21 October 2012 ～ 24 October 201...|$|R
