Both lubimyczytac. pl and private <b>literary</b> <b>blogs</b> create an alternative place for discussing literature beyond professional, academic literary criticism. This alternative place pretends to be free from depending on market and to present an "authentic reading experience" rather than professional review. But schematic composition and language of those texts as well as the need to strive for the popularity causes the same mechanism of dependence as in professional literary criticism...|$|R

These {{are the people who}} will love this magazine.” [...] Similarly, The Library Journal wrote: [...] "This 'magazine for people who love books' distinguishes itself in the quality of its short fiction and illustrations. New works by mostly established writers include many in translation, giving Coffin Factory a distinctly international vibe. Many of the illustrations are depictions of new works currently on display in a gallery. All this gives Coffin Factory a classy freshness sure to be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates contemporary arts and literature." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{an artistic}} {{intervention}} known as culture jamming, Wassmann has also intertwined {{his work with}} contemporary literary conceits. In 2006, Rohan Kriwaczek created a sensation with his publication of An Incomplete History of the Art of the Funerary Violin (Overlook Press), which purported to trace the lost history of the funerary violin. Shortly before publication, the book was exposed to the New York Times as a hoax by a book buyer at Prairie Lights Books in Iowa City, Iowa. Wassmann stepped in to confuse matters further by using an additional character, a German curator, to defend Kriwaczek in online <b>literary</b> <b>blogs</b> and discussion pages, claiming that {{as a child in}} Leipzig, August Wassmann (the character's father) had known one of the funerary violinists Kriwaczek cites, further proof of the funerary violin. Wassmann had been sent an advance copy of the book by the owner of Prairie Lights Books, Jim Harris, allowing him to comment with apparent authority on the book's contents prior to publication.|$|R

5000|$|In January 2012 on the {{web site}} of the Poetry Foundation, home of Poetry magazine, Stucky {{published}} an essay, [...] "How to Survive in the Age of Amazon," [...] directed at independent bookstores whose existence is threatened by massive online retailers. The essay was reprinted by The Huffington Post and widely discussed by <b>literary</b> <b>blogs</b> and bloggers such as Bound: A Blog About Books & Libraries, Diana Dilworth, and Austin Allen, who declared the essay's recommendations [...] "The Stucky Plan." [...] Allen summarizes his sense of Stucky's essay:Bravo to Janaka Stucky, whose new article in Poetry on struggling independent bookstores is both the most sensible and inspiring thing I’ve read on the subject. Stucky concedes what everyone in the industry knows, that a price war with Amazon is one small bookstores cannot win. Reasoning that these stores must therefore fight on different turf, he offers some concrete suggestions: establish a lively Web presence, feature expertly curated staff selections, and above all, host more events—that is, become a hub not just for reading material but for readings. Following his own advice, Stucky himself has been hosting the monthly BASH poetry reading series since 2011 at the Brookline Booksmith, an independent bookstore in Brookline, Massachusetts. Poets reading in the series have included Joshua Harmon, Eileen Myles, and Stephen Burt.|$|R

5000|$|The {{delivery}} mechanism {{to my mind}} is secondary {{for me as a}} writer. ... But I did this once before with a story called Riding the Bullet and I never had so many guys in suits {{come up to me and}} ask me questions. But they didn't want to know about the story, they didn't want to know about the process, they wanted to know about the delivery system, but to me that's secondary. ... I think people will be more interested in the business aspect of Ur than they will in the story. I would never have agreed to it if I didn't think it was a pretty good story.I decided I would like to write a story for the Kindle, but only if I could do one about the Kindle. Gadgets fascinate me, particularly if I can think of a way they might get weird. I had previously written about homicidal cars, sinister computers, and brain-destroying mobile phones; at the time the Amazon request came in, I'd been playing with an idea about a guy who starts getting e-mails from the dead. The story I wrote, Ur, was about an e-reader that can access books and newspapers from alternate worlds. I realized I might get trashed in some of the <b>literary</b> <b>blogs,</b> where I would be accused of shilling for Jeff Bezos & Co., but that didn't bother me much; in my career, I have been trashed by experts, and I'm still standing.|$|R
