We {{assume that the}} thickness and the roughness are both of order 0 < ε << 1. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution of this problem for any value of ε and we establish some a priori estimates. Then we use the two-scale convergence technique to derive the limit problem when ε tends to zero. Moreover we show that the limit velocity and micro-rotation fields are uniquely determined via auxiliary well-posed problems and the limit pressure is given as the unique solution of a Reynolds equation.

Rubber {{suspension}} {{system is a}} new {{suspension system}} in which rubber is {{used to be the}} elastic element, thus rubber spring {{is one of the key}} components of suspension. Based on its concrete structure, a finite element model of rubber spring is made and so as to analyze the rubber suspension forces under different working conditions, to analyze the strength and stiffness for providing a reference for the design. The introduction Suspension system is the floorboard of all force connection devices of car frame and axle or wheels, its function is to transfer the force and moment between the wheels and the frame, to amortize the impact caused by uneven road surface to the frame or the car and attenuate the vibration to make sure the car goes smoothly[1]. Rubber suspension becomes popular in recent years, which has the advantage of simple structure, easy installation, light weight, free maintenance, <b>lubrication</b> <b>free,</b> favorable possibility and comfort. It can greatly reduce the vibration caused by uneven road, reduce the driver’s fatigue, protect the vehicle parts and the integrity of the goods and extend the lifespan of the parts equipped on the vehicle[2].

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a {{bachelor}} thesis implemented at Saab training systems AB in Huskvarna. It treats the concept development of the driveline on Moving infantry target, MIT. Today Saab has a problem in the shape of that their customers uses the wrong moment when tightening the cog belt of the driveline. As a consequence the cog belt has a high risk of snapping if it is too tight or pluck off if it is too loose. Thereto the electrical motors used in the MIT has gone out of production. The task boiled down to produce a number of proposals that improves the chucking or driveline solution together with finding a new electrical motor to replace the outdated one. A concept study was made containing detailed examinations together with Saab. To answer the problems questions, several product development methods were used, like Quality function deployment and Pugh’s matrix, to reach a final concept. The last concepts were modeled in a 3 D-program for an easier comparison between their feasibility. The chosen solution consisted of two motors that via a gearing actuates the respective axle. By replacing the belt drive and choosing more <b>lubrication</b> <b>free</b> gears the maintenance is expected to be improved. In addition the product price is lowered by careful choices of components. The production of a prototype could not be implemented due to lack of time...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{magnetic}} bearing and its use in exotic applications has been conceptualized for many years, over a century, in fact. Patented, passive systems using permanent magnets date back over 150 years. More recently, scientists of the 1930 s began investigating active systems using electromagnets for high-speed ultracentrifuges. However, passive magnetic bearings are physically unstable and active systems only provide proper stiffness and damping through sophisticated controllers and algorithms. This is precisely why, until the last decade, magnetic bearings did not become a practical alternative to rolling element bearings. Today, magnetic bearing technology has become viable because of advances in micro-processing controllers that allow for confident and robust active control. Further advances in the following areas: rotor and stator materials and designs which maximize flux, minimize energy losses, and minimize stress limitations; wire materials and coatings for high temperature operation; high-speed micro processing for advanced controller designs and extremely robust capabilities; back-up bearing technology for providing a viable touchdown surface; and precision sensor technology; have put magnetic bearings on the forefront of advanced, <b>lubrication</b> <b>free</b> support systems. This paper will discuss a specific joint program {{for the advancement of}} gas turbine engines and how it implies the vitality of magnetic bearings, a brief comparison between magnetic bearings and other bearing technologies in both their advantages and limitations, and an examination of foreseeable solutions to historically perceived limitations to magnetic bearing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{is often}} {{advantageous}} to add lateral damping in rotating systems to suppress excessive vibration {{in both the}} transverse and torsional directions. Magnetic dampers are advantageous to other damping mecha-nisms because they provide damping independent of temperature, and are non-contact in nature, which allows for maintenance and <b>lubrication</b> <b>free</b> operation. These damping mechanisms function through the eddy cur-rents that are formed in a conductive material when it is subjected to a time changing magnetic flux. The currents circulate inside the conductor {{in such a way}} that a new magnetic field is generated with a polar-ity that varies with the change in the applied magnetic flux. The interaction between the applied magnetic field and the field due to the eddy currents causes the generation of a force that opposes the change in flux. However, due to the internal resistance of the conductor the eddy currents will dissipate into heat, causing a removal of energy from the system. This dissipation of energy allows a magnet and conductor to form a damper that may be used to suppress the vibration of a structure. However, when used in a rotating sys-tem this additional damping often comes at the cost of a drag force which reduces the system efficiency. The present study will develop a novel eddy current mechanism in which the rotational drag is negligible. The damper will be theoretically modeled and the damping energy will be determined, while finite element analysis will be used to predict the force exerted on the shaft as it vibrates. Experiments will be performed to validate both the theoretical and finite element model and demonstrate the high damping levels available when using this system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{describe}} {{a study on}} compliant-parallel (C-P) mechanism with high precision and wide range of working area using bio-inspired compliant joints. C-P mechanism is a parallel mechanism in which all of joints are composed by wide deformable compliant joints. In {{the integration of the}} compliant joint and the parallel mechanism, a deformation of the compliant joint can be guided by mechanical constraints from the parallel mechanism; thus C-P mechanism can be precisely driven. C-P mechanism has no back-lash, requires no <b>lubrication,</b> and is <b>free</b> from machine noise and abrasion power. And, unlike conventional mechanisms, C-P mechanism can be integrated into compact, lightweight, and simple structure. From these backgrounds, we developed a widely deformable circular compliant joint inspired by Drakaea, which is an orchidaceous species. The circular compliant joint was implemented on a 3 -DOF (rotational 2 and translational 1 DOF) parallel mechanism as a first prototype. Then, our second prototype was developed to realize further wide range of working area. A serially layered-flat spring compliant joint was developed based on the bio-inspired circular compliant joint, and was implemented on a traditional 3 -DOF DELTA mechanism, as the second prototype. From the evaluation tests of these prototypes, the feasibility of C-P mechanism was shown positive to be applied to a high precision assembly robot within a wide range of working area...|$|R
40|$|Coatings for {{avoidance}} of cold welding on forming tools {{are an interesting}} possibility to achieve production methods environmentally less harmful, to reduce costs by reduction of the consumption of lubricating agents and to increase productivity by fall away of washing processes between working steps. The aim of this project financed by the OSTec-programme of the BMBF was the evaluation of various carbon based coatings (pure amorphous carbon or diamond like carbon, known as a-C:H or DLC, metal containing amorphous carbon, known as Me-C:H) for sheet metal forming. Industrially established hard coatings are successfully applied {{in order to increase}} tool life time. But they failed to reduce necessary amounts of lubricating agents at materials difficult to form like aluminium, stainless steel or titanium. The coating systems investigated were deposited in DC, RF or pulsed DC excited PECVD and reactive PVD processes at tool temperatures below 200 deg C. In order to coat large tools of formi ng technology the further development and up-scaling of these processes (reactive DC magnetron sputtering of Me-C:H, pulsed DC PECVD of a-C:H) was one of the working items of the project. Various carbon based coating systems were deposited on laboratory samples as well as on testing and production tools, characterized with respect to their mechanical and tribological properties and investigated with respect to their performance in various forming processes. Pure carbon films could proof their potential for <b>lubrication</b> <b>free</b> working in a hard modification for working of stainless steel and titanium (deep drawing, bending, stamping) as well as in a softer modification for aluminium forming (bending, folding, stamping). At aluminium forming processes with a high forming degree a significant reduction of the amount of lubrication was possible (e. g. with deep drawing well below 1 g/m 2). The absolute dry forming of aluminium requires further development of coating systems...|$|E
