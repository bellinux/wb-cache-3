40|$|Elymus repens (coach grass) is {{traditionally}} controlled by repeated and prolonged stubble cultivation. However, the efficacy is strongly depending on weather and secondly on {{the exposure of}} rhizomes. The shorter the required period of cultivation stays the more compliance with the objective in organic farming where farmers aim at minimizing leaching of nutrients by keeping the soil plant-covered during autumn and winter. Effective technique and strategies for uprooting, exposing and destroying Elymus repens are needed. In a Danish organic research project {{the focus is on}} technological solutions for uprooting, exposing and destroying of the rhizomes within a short time span.

40|$|Water {{protection}} {{is controlled by}} specific regulations in the German Federal States, e. g. the SchALVO in Baden-Württemberg. An amendment of the SchALVO demands, amongst others, a changed timing and intensity of soil tillage directly after growing crops with high-nitrogen residues. As Organic Farming highly relies on soil tillage for weed control, there is concern about decrease of yield and increase of weed infesta-tion in water protection areas if tillage is restricted. Field experiments were performed on practical farms with three treatments according to SchALVO (<b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> or mouldboard plough for primary tillage, used in October, December or February) and two treatments according to best management practice (mouldboard plough in Octo-ber or November). The treatments were combined with growing either winter wheat or spring wheat, depending on the date of tillage. There {{were no significant differences}} between the SchALVO and the practice-related treatments for yield, yield parameters, protein content and weed infestation, whereas there were differences between the winter crop and spring crop. The total Nmin in soil was slightly lower in the SchALVO treatments. Here, Nmin reached 39 – 42 kg Nmin ha- 1 (mean of the experimental years), compared to the practice-related treatments with 42 or 43 kg Nmin ha- 1 in the sub-experiment exemplarily presented in this paper. These differences were not significant at P ≤ 0. 05. Mean Nmin was 38. 5 kg ha- 1 before starting the experiment. The lowest Nmin was found after using a cultivator in October. Since the one-time use of a cultiva-tor instead of the plough did not result in obvious disadvantages for the crop, the risk of yield reduction and increased weed infestation seems to be small. Nevertheless, if the initial number of perennial weeds, e. g. thistles, is high, a plough is supposed to be more effective for weed control than non-inversion tillage by cultivator...|$|R
40|$|Traditional rice {{cultivation}} by puddling and manual transplanting is a labor intensive activity and require significant quantities {{of water and}} power. The increasing scarcity of water threatens the sustainability of transplanted rice. In many areas of Asia, transplanting of rice is being replaced by direct seeding as farmers respond to increased labor cost and decreased water availability but weed control {{is one of the}} major constraints to direct seeding. So, to control weeds in direct seeded rice studies were designed. Experiments were conducted for two years to develop sustainable and economical methods for managing weeds in aerobic rice grown by direct-seeding at Student’s Farm, Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad during the years 2008 and 2009. The first experiment was laid out in RCBD having five weed control approaches; hand weeding, hoeing (with kasula), inter row cultivation with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator,</b> inter row cultivation with spike hoe and chemical control with Nominee 100 SC along with control (no weeding). Weed dry weight was 300 g m- 2, 257 g m- 2, 225 g m- 2 and 157 g m- 2 less in hand weeding, hoeing <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> and Nominee 100 SC respectively than no weeding. Maximum fertile tillers were recorded in hand weeding (369. 73 m- 2) and were followed by hoeing (356. 94 m- 2) and <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> (346. 78 m- 2). Hand pulling, hoeing, <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator,</b> Nominee and spike hoe gave 28, 25, 22, 12 and 6 % more number of kernels per panicle respectively. Paddy yield was 221, 203, 181 and 105 % more in hand weeding, hoeing <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> and Nominee 100 SC respectively than no weeding. Highest net returns (Rs. 56905) were obtained by hand weeding while highest BCR (1. 75) was obtained in <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator.</b> A second experiment was laid out in split plot design randomizing inter row cultivation implements in main plots and inter rowbcultivation frequencies in sub plots. Weed dry weight was 199. 16 g m- 2 less when <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> was used at 15, 25, 35 and 45 DAS as compared to weed dry weight in inter row cultivation at 15 days after seeding (DAS). More fertile tillers in <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> and spike when used at 15, 25, 35 and 45 DAS were observed. Paddy yield was 159 % more when <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> was used at 15, 25, 35 and 45 as compared to paddy yield in inter row cultivation at 15 DAS. <b>Tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> gave maximum net return and BCR when used at 15, 25, 35 and 45 DAS. <b>Tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> gave maximum net return and BCR when used at 15, 25, 35 and 45 DAS.

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} research farm of The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 2011, to investigate the effects of different tillage practices and sowing methods on productivity of wheat and mungbean cropping system on silty clay loam soil. The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by rotovator (CR), mouldboard plow followed by rotovator (MR), disk plow followed by rotovator (DR) and <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> followed by rotovator (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with single box seed drill (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with seed drill and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were tilled with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator. Sowing by combined seed drill resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with seed drill. Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> followed by rotavator. Similarly, sowing by seed drill and combine drill recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by rotavator resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots tilled with moldboard plow followed by rotavator. The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with seed drill. Plots sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant- 1, soil organic matter and total nitrogen in soil were greater in plots that were sown with a combined seed drill. Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> followed by rotavator (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by seed drill (SD) and combine drill (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method. It is concluded from the studies that all tillage implements when followed by rotavator for seedbed preparation resulted better yield and net economic revenue from wheat and mungbean crops {{as compared to the}} sole used of <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> plowed twice.

Yield levels on the Saïs Plateau between Meknès and Fez in the semi-arid zone, however, remain low possibly because of sub-optimum water use due to inefficient tillage systems. A study was carried out to investigate the effect of soil tillage operations on water infiltration. Two systems of seedbed preparation on a silty clay soil were compared: traditional disc harrow (‘cover crop’) versus reduced tillage using a spring <b>tined</b> <b>cultivator</b> (‘vibrocultor’). Infiltration processes were studied using a rainfall simulator applying rainfall typical for aggressive events in the region. The effect of tillage and rainfall on the structure of the soil was assessed by both quantitative and descriptive methods. It was found that the disc harrow caused excessive pulverisation and seal formation under rainfall. Water infiltration, on the other hand, was not hindered by plough sole formation or subsoil compaction. It is suggested that reduced tillage by the spring <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> is less costly and results in lower losses of water by runoff, thus leaving more water available for the crop...|$|R

40|$|Tillage {{practices}} influence physical, chemical, {{and biological}} soil properties, which also affect soil quality and consequently plant growth. In this study, the main {{objective was to}} evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on soil physical properties by using geophysical methods, namely, ground-penetrating radar (far-field and near-field GPR), capacitance probes (ThetaProbe and 5 TE), electromagnetic induction (EMI) (Profiler and EM 38), soil sampling, and by soil penetrometer. Since 2005, three contrasting tillage systems were applied on different plots of an agricultural field: i) conventional tillage (CT) with mouldboard ploughing to 27 cm depth, ii) deep loosening tillage (DL) with a heavy <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> to 30 cm depth, and iii) reduced tillage (RT) with a spring <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> to 10 cm depth. The geophysical and soil strength measurements were performed in April 2010. We observed that tillage influences the soil resistance (deeper tillage decreases soil resistance), which could be partly seen in the radar data. Soil water content reference measurements (capacitance probes and soil sampling) were in a relatively good agreement with the water content estimates from far-field GPR. We also observed that the tillage influences surface water content. Mean surface water content was significantly lower for CT than for DL and RT, which was partly explained by lower macropore connectivity between the topsoil and the deeper layers after conventional tillage. This study confirms the potential of GPR and EMI sensors for soil physical properties determination at the field scale and for the characterization of agricultural management practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study the response of grain yield and yield components of corn (Zea mays L.) to different methods. Tillage treatments {{in the study were}} moldboard plow + two passes of disk harrow (MDD), moldboard plow + one pass of rotary tiller (MR), two passes of disk harrow (DD), one pass of <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> + one pass of disk harrow (CD), one pass of rotary tiller (R), one pass of <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> (C) and no-tillage (NT) as direct drilling method. The statistical results of the study indicated that tillage method significantly (P 0. 05) affected grain yield, number of plants per hectare (NPPH) and number of rows per ear (NRPE), but there was no significant differences in other components such as number of ears per plant (NEPP), number of grains per row (NGPR), ear diameter (ED) and ear length (EL). The maximum value of grain yield 1 (4. 15 t ha), NPPH (39830) and NEPP (0. 92) was obtained in case of MDD treatment, while maximum value of NRPE (14. 9) and ED (37. 2 mm) was observed in case of MR treatment. Also, maximum value of NGPR (51) was obtained in case of R treatment, while maximum value of EL (196. 3 mm) was observed in case of NT treatment. 1 Conversely, the minimum value of grain yield (2. 32 t ha) and NPPH (20390) was obtained in case of NT treatment, while minimum value of NEPP (0. 89) was observed in case of C treatment. Moreover, minimum value of NRPE (13. 4) was obtained in case of R treatment, while minimum value of NGPR (47), ED (35. 2 mm) and EL (190. 7 mm) was noted in case of MDD treatment. Hence, moldboard plow followed two passes of disk harrow was found to be more appropriate and profitable tillage method in improving grain yield of corn possibly due to reduced soil compaction, enhanced seed-soil contact, increased soil moisture and suppressing weed growth.

40|$|There is much {{emphasis}} on technical aspects related to sensor or mapping techniques, which enable so-called intelligent cultivators to target the intra-row spaces within crop rows. This study investigates (i) an expected advantage of an intelligent rotor <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> (the cycloid hoe) in terms of crop-weed selectivity and (ii) an expected synergistic effect between punch planting and post-emergence weed harrowing in terms of improved crop-weed selectivity. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} relationship between weed control and associated crop density decline one week after cultivation, and punch planting is a sowing technique where holes are created in the ground with a minimum of soil disturbance and seeds are inserted into them, without soil disturbance outside the holes. Two experiments were carried out with the cycloid hoe in organic sugar beets. The rotation tines were guided by RTK-GPS relative to geo-referenced sugar beets, and tines were moved into the row when there was enough space between crop plants to cultivate, and kept outside, when they were predicted to strike a crop plant. The selectivity of the cycloid hoe was tested against two machine variants without intelligent guidance: the rotor <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> in a locked mode, where tines rotate within the crop row without taking crop plants into consideration, and an ordinary flex tine weed harrow. The experiments showed no differences between the three machine variants in terms of selectivity. Five experiments with punch planting in sugar beets and carrots showed no synergistic effects between plant establishment procedures and selectivity of post-emergence weed harrowing. Even if punch planting and automated intelligent rotor tine cultivation were not combined, the results indicate that {{there is no reason to}} believe that a combination contributes significantly to the solution of the main problem in mechanical intra-row weed control in direct sown crops, low selectivity, which still remains a major challenge.

40|$|Historically, {{shifts to}} reduced and no-tillage {{management}} for production of crops were fostered by needs to decrease soil erosion {{and loss of}} organic matter, reduce fuel and labour costs and conserve soil water, as compared with conventional fallow tillage management. Recent interest in maintaining soil quality has been stimulated by a renewed awareness {{of the importance of}} soil condition to both the sustainability of agricultural production systems and environmental quality (Doran and Parkin, 1996). The aim of this project was to determine the impact on the physical, chemical and microbiological status of the soil of conventional and reduced tillage. It has been suggested that the reduced soil disturbance associated with the <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> improves soil structure, increases nutrient content in the top 10 cm of soil, increases microbial activity and improves physical characteristics. From this study it was determined that the environmental benefits linked to reduced tillage in literature, did not develop {{in the first two years}} of this programmes implementation. The results of this study determined that soil nutrients did not increase in concentration in the top 10 cm of soil under reduced cultivation. The only exception was exchangeable potassium. As potassium is not a mobile nutrient its movement is dependent on soil disturbance, therefore under reduced cultivation its concentration was allowed to accumulate in the upper horizon of the soil profile. Microbial activity was greater in the conventionally tilled treatments, as determined by total aerobic bacterial numbers. This could be due to the increased rates of soil aeration in this treatment. Numbers of aerobic bacteria were greater in the conventional tillage treatments at both incubation temperatures of 22 and 32 ° C. The physical characteristics of the soil determined, indicate that below the depth of soil cultivation, cone penetration resistance increases. Therefore the reduced cultivation treatments would be more prone to soil compaction, higher in the soil profile...|$|R

The tillage treatments were (i) conventional tillage (CT) with moldboard ploughing to 27 cm depth and (ii) reduced tillage (RT) with a spring <b>tine</b> <b>cultivator</b> to 10 cm depth. The measurements included bulk density (BD) and precompression stress (Pc) chosen as indicators of mechanical strength, and the pore size distribution (PSD) measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The tillage systems, the depth and their interaction {{had a significant effect}} on BD, Pc and PSD. In CT, in the topsoil, the soil strength was low and the total porosity n was about 50 %. In the subsoil, n decreased to 43 %. The PSD of CT was uni-modal in topsoil and subsoil in the MIP measurement range. The mean value of the mode rmax diminished from the topsoil toward the subsoil (from 2. 5 microns to 1. 9 microns). In RT, in the topsoil, the soil strength was higher than CT. BD did not vary much according to the depth. The total porosity n of RT was comprised between 40 - 45 % in the soil profile. The PSD was uni-modal and rmax increased from topsoil (around 2 microns) to subsoil (> 3 microns). This suggested the agglomeration of fine particles under the long-term action of mechanical loads, climatic agents, biological organisms or clay minerals acting as cementing agents. These phenomena could be at the origin of the increase of Pc with the depth without significant modification of BD. Such high values of Pc could be responsible of negative effects on root-growth leading to a more superficial root lateral development...|$|R

Within each cultivation treatment there were different treatment areas (TA). In {{the first year of}} the experiment, one TA was cultivated up and down the slope, one TA was cultivated on the contour, with a beetle bank acting as a vegetative barrier partway up the slope, and one had a mixed direction cultivation treatment, with cultivation and drilling conducted up and down the slope and all subsequent operations conducted on the contour. In the second year, this mixed treatment was replaced with contour cultivation. Results showed no significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or {{total phosphorus}} losses from minimum tillage when compared to the conventional plough treatment, but there were increased losses of total dissolved phosphorus with minimum tillage. The mixed direction cultivation treatment increased surface runoff and losses of sediment and phosphorus. Increasing surface roughness with contour cultivation reduced surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation in both the plough and minimum tillage treatment areas, but this trend was not significant. Sediment and phosphorus losses in the contour cultivation treatment followed a very similar pattern to runoff. Combining contour cultivation with a vegetative barrier in the form of a beetle bank to reduce slope length resulted in a non-significant reduction in surface runoff, sediment and total phosphorus when compared to up and down-slope cultivation, but there was a clear trend towards reduced losses. However, the addition of a beetle bank did not provide a significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses when compared to contour cultivation, suggesting only a marginal additional benefit. The economic implications for farmers of the different treatment options are investigated in order to assess their suitability for implementation at a field scale...|$|R

40|$|A {{three years}} {{experiment}} (2000 - 2002) {{was carried out}} on the possibility to perform the physical weed control of carrot in the typical cultural and environmental condition of the Fucino Valley (that {{is the most important}} area of carrot production in Italy), in order to obtain a “biological” product. Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific spring tine harrow two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide. A specific precision hoe with eleven units (inter-row of about 18 cm) was built, tested, improved and set up to perform weed control both between (by means of a <b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> supporting a 9 cm wide horizontal blade) and in rows (by means of vibrating teeth or torsion weeder). During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded. Moreover work chains characteristics, manpower use and physical weed control cost were determined. The results were quite good and put in evidence that physical weed control in organic carrot cultivated in the Fucino Valley can be performed, obtaining relevant and high quality yields, without the need of too many hours of manual labour and with fully acceptable costs, taking also into account that in Italy the market price of “biological” carrot is quite high...|$|R
40|$|Harrowing {{is often}} used to reduce weed competition, {{generally}} using a constant intensity across a whole field. The efficacy of weed harrowing in wheat and barley can be optimized, if site-specific conditions of soil, weed infestation and crop growth stage are taken into account. This study aimed to develop and test an algorithm to automatically adjust the harrowing intensity by varying the tine angle and number of passes. The field variability of crop leaf cover, weed density and soil density was acquired with geo-referenced sensors to investigate the harrowing selectivity and crop recovery. Crop leaf cover and weed density were assessed using bispectral cameras through differential images analysis. The draught force of the soil opposite to the direction of travel was measured with electronic load cell sensor connected to a <b>rigid</b> <b>tine</b> mounted in front of the harrow. Optimal harrowing intensity levels were derived in previously implemented experiments, based on the weed control efficacy and yield gain. The assessments of crop leaf cover, weed density and soil density were combined via rules with the aforementioned optimal intensities, in a linguistic fuzzy inference system (LFIS). The system was evaluated in two field experiments that compared constant intensities with variable intensities inferred by the system. A higher weed density reduction could be achieved when the harrowing intensity was not kept constant along the cultivated plot. Varying the intensity tended to reduce the crop leaf cover, though slightly improving crop yield. A real-time intensity adjustment with this system is achievable, if the cameras are attached in the front and at the rear or sides of the harrow...|$|R
