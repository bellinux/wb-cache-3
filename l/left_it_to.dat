5|$|The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, {{upon the}} remittal {{of the case}} to the full bench of the Federal Court.

It {{was the first time in}} over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections46 and 47 of the TPA, but <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of Crewkerne {{is in the}} 899 will of Alfred the Great who <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his youngest son Aethelweard. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and in the Domesday Survey of 1086 {{was described as a}} royal manor. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved in the fifteenth century Church of St Bartholomew. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, {{especially}} a storehouse. The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E

The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft and <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E
