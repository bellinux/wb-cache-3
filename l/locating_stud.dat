50|$|A stud finder (also stud {{detector}} or stud sensor) is {{a handheld}} device used to <b>locate</b> framing <b>studs</b> <b>located</b> behind the final walling surface, usually drywall. While {{there are many}} different stud finders available, most fall into two main categories: magnetic stud detectors and electric stud finders. Some newer technologies exist such as RF radar with 3D imaging technology.|$|R
50|$|Stud finders {{have been}} in use since the early 20th century, and the first ones were all magnetic, relying on {{internal}} magnets to detect the walling fasteners presumably attached to studs. In 1977, Robert Franklin designed a revolutionary electronic stud finder that relied on an internal capacitor to measure changes in density behind the walling. His patent was put into production by the Zircon Corporation, which became the sole producer of electronic stud finders until the patent expired in 1998. While novel, these electronic stud finders did not always prove effective in <b>locating</b> <b>studs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ashford <b>Stud,</b> <b>located</b> near Versailles, Kentucky, {{became a}} part of Coolmore in the mid-1980s. In 2001, Thunder Gulch was the first Ashford sire to top the American general sire listing. Giant's Causeway later became the leading sire in 2009, 2010 and 2012. Ashford also stands Uncle Mo, leading first year sire of 2015 and sire of 2016 Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist.|$|R
50|$|On 18 July 1994, O'Riordan married Don Burton, {{the former}} tour manager of Duran Duran. Their first child, Taylor Baxter, {{was born on}} 23 November 1997. Molly Leigh was born on 27 January 2001, and Dakota Rain on 10 April 2005. O'Riordan and Burton split up in 2014 after 20 years together. In 1998, she bought a 61 ha stud farm, called Riversfield <b>Stud,</b> <b>located</b> in Kilmallock, County Limerick. She lived there for six years before selling it in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish Riding School {{was named}} for the Spanish horses that formed one of the bases of the Lipizzan breed, which is used {{exclusively}} at the school. Today the horses delivered to the Spanish Riding School are bred at the Piber Federal <b>Stud</b> <b>located</b> {{near the village of}} Piber in western Styria, Austria. One of the original studs used to develop the breed was Lipizza, now called Lipica, near Trieste in modern Slovenia, which gave its name to the breed.|$|R
5000|$|Wall Safes: The contestants are {{introduced}} to the judges, who {{teach them how to}} install a wall safe by <b>locating</b> two <b>studs</b> and cutting out part of the wall between them. Dez and Casey, having a common wall, choose the same spot, and Casey was forced to relocate, but not without accidentally hitting Dez in the helmet with his hammer. The two and Tex (who did not use a stud finder at all) eventually fail due to cutting too big of a hole vertically (though they were more lenient on Casey). Joe also relocates, not knowing how to use a stud finder and having abandoned his first choice of location. However, he eventually manages to brute-force his safe in with a mallet (but the safe is not secured with screws). Charmaine gave up on her wall safe.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{chestnut}} stallion {{that was}} foaled at his breeder's <b>stud,</b> <b>located</b> in Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire. Glencoe was by Sultan, a versatile stallion who won races from six furlongs to over three miles. Sultan raced {{until the age}} of eight, and was leading sire in Great Britain for six consecutive years (1832-1837). The dam of Glencoe Trampoline (by Tramp), was a fairly good racemare, and an even better producer of racehorses, foaling not only Glencoe, but also Glenara and Glencaire (all by Sultan).|$|R
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{has very}} low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new foals {{registered}} with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were covered, with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year. Over the past decade, {{the highest number of}} foals registered was 113 in 2008, and between 80 and 90 foals were registered in the other years. The majority of breeding farms are located in the Poitou area, including Vendée (especially around Fontenay-le-Comte and Luçon), Deux-Sèvres (especially near Melle), Vienna and Civray, and some in Charente, near Ruffec. There are National <b>Studs</b> <b>located</b> in Saintes and Vendée. There are a few breeders in Maine-et-Loire.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} plasterboard joints on the fire performance of cold-formed steel walls. Plasterboard joints are unavoidable. However, they can be arranged {{in a way that}} they do not significantly influence the fire performance of cold-formed steel walls. Hence a research study into the effects of plasterboard joints on the fire performance of plasterboard lined cold-formed steel walls was undertaken using both full-scale fire tests and numerical studies. In this study a back-blocking technique was used to eliminate the plasterboard joints being <b>located</b> over the <b>studs.</b> Instead plasterboard joints were used between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Both experimental and numerical results from this study show that the fire resistance rating of single plasterboard lined cold-formed steel walls can be increased by 25 % through the use of a back-blocking joint arrangement in comparison to the traditional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs...|$|R
40|$|On the Colorado Plateau, {{precipitation}} comes {{either from}} winter storms {{generated in the}} Gulf of Alaska or from summer convection storms generated by the Arizona monsoon system. Understanding the current seasonal and regional patterns of precipitation inputs into an ecosystem has ramifications at several levels: on carbon and mineral cycling at the ecosystem level, on biodiversity at the community level, and on productivity and adaptation at the population and species levels. The interior deserts of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah represent the driest regions of western North America, resulting {{from a combination of}} rainshadow effects and either the southern limits of winter moisture input or the northern limits of summer moisture input or both. Shifts in strengths of storm-generating conditions in the Pacific and in the Gulf influence both the magnitude and seasonality of soil moisture availability and therefore constrain periods of primary productivity activity in these aridland ecosystems. One major consequence predicted by global climate change scenarios is a change in monsoonal (summer) precipitation; it will increase in some areas and decrease in others. A second is increased soil temperatures and increased interior drought associated with ocean-land temperature disequilibrium. This project focused on the influence of variations in summer moisture input on structure-function relationships within a cold desert ecosystem on the Colorado Plateau. The primary field sites were <b>located</b> at <b>Stud</b> Horse Point, Utah, located on the Utah-Arizona boundary in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and at the Arizona monsoon boundary region...|$|R
40|$|Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) {{walls are}} {{commonly}} used in building construction. In general, they are lined with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards with and without cavity insulation. Gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier to protect the thin-walled steel studs from rapid temperature rise. In these walls, plasterboard joints are <b>located</b> along the <b>studs</b> for ease of construction and are protected by filler materials. During fires, these plasterboard joints crack and open up, and thus allow the stud temperatures to rise rapidly and initiate premature structural failures in LSF walls. This research investigated the detrimental effects of these plasterboards joints on the fire resistance rating of single and double plasterboard lined walls based on the hot flange time-temperature profiles of studs from full scale fire tests. To overcome the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints, the back-blocking technique was used, where plasterboard joints were placed between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Full scale fire tests and numerical studies were performed on single plasterboard lined load bearing LSF wall panels to investigate the improved fire performance by using this technique. They showed that the fire resistance rating of these LSF walls was increased by 25 % {{in comparison to the}} conventional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs. This paper presents the details of this research on the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints on the fire resistance of load bearing LSF walls, and the results. It also includes a discussion and results for non-load bearing LSF walls...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether dietary supplementation with antioxidants affects semen fertility parameters in New Zealand Standardbred stallions. Fourteen Standardbred stallions of varying fertility, from 3 <b>studs</b> <b>located</b> throughout New Zealand, were allocated to one of 3 treatments: minerals (Se, Cu, Zn, Mn) and vitamin E supplement, oil (canola) supplement and control (no supplement). The studs were provided with the supplements as aliquots to be added to each feed once per day. Stallions from one stud were fed a different basal diet from the other two studs. At least 3 semen samples were collected from each stallion and sent to Equibreed NZ Ltd, before, and after feeding the supplements for around 60 days. Spermatozoa fertility parameters evaluated included total motility, progressive motility, total progressive motility, morphology (normal, loose heads, head defects, mid-piece defects, tail defects), acrosome status (FITC-PNA), membrane integrity (hypo-osmotic swelling test), and concentration. These parameters were assessed at various times including 6 - 8 h and 24 h after collection of semen, and immediately and 30 min after thawing, frozen semen. Blood levels of Se, Cu and Zn were measured before and after supplementation. Per cycle pregnancy data was also obtained from questionnaire responses from studs A and B at the end of the trial. This study demonstrates that there was a statistically significant effect of feeding oil as a dietary supplement on sperm motility at 24 h after collection (longevity) and also on the per cycle pregnancy rates when treatment groups were combined. Consequently, we were able to elucidate a difference in the actions of mineral and vitamin E supplementation when compared with oil supplementation on fertility parameters measured in this trial. Other beneficial effects of antioxidant supplementation on sperm parameters were suggested from the results of the fourteen stallions on two separate diets, but were not found to be statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section <b>studs</b> <b>located</b> at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single flange). Based on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A new {{generation}} of EN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2004) also known as Eurocode 2 is under development and currently there {{is a set of}} proposed provisions regarding section 6. 4 about punching shear, PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017). It was of interest to compare the proposal with the current punching shear design provisions. The aim of this master thesis was to compare the punching shear resistance obtained in accordance with both design codes. Furthermore the eect of some parameters on the resistance was to be compared. It was also of interest to evaluate the userfriendliness of the proposal. In order to meet the aim, a case study of a real 　at slab with drop panels was performed together with a parametric study of a pure ctive 　at slab. The parametric study was performed for inner, edge and corner columns in the cases prestressed, without and with shear reinforcement. It was concluded that the distance av from the column axis to the contra 　exural location has a big in　uence on the punching shear resistance. The factor ddg considering concrete type and aggregate properties also has a big impact on the resistance. The simplied estimation of av according to 6. 4. 3 (2) in PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017) may be inaccurate in some cases. The length b 0 of the control perimeter has a larger eect on the resistance in EN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2004) than in PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017). In PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017), <b>studs</b> <b>located</b> outside the second row has no impact on the resistance. The tensioning force in a prestressed 　at slab has a larger in　uence on the resistance in PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017) than in EN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2004). Furthermore, the reinforcement ratio is increased by the tendons, and thus aect the resistance in PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017). Clearer provisions for the denition of the support strip bs for corners and ends of walls are needed in PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017). It may be questionable if the reduction of the perimeter for a large supported area in accordance with 6. 4. 2 (4) in PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017) underestimates the resistance v in some cases. Considering the work-load with PT 1 prEN 1992 - 1 - 1 (2017), more parameters are included. However, they may not require that much eort to obtain.
