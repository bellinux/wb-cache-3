5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with <b>lupus,</b> that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the <b>lupus</b> was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his <b>lupus</b> condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had <b>lupus,</b> but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|The wolf-like canids, (genus Canis, Cuon and Lycaon) {{including}} the dog (Canis <b>lupus</b> familiaris), gray wolf (Canis <b>lupus),</b> red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), coyote (Canis latrans), golden jackal (Canis aureus), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly <b>lupus</b> anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Gaga held {{a reverse}} auction {{for one of}} the {{necklaces}} worn in the music video, designed by Brian Lichtenberg. All the proceeds from the auction went to the <b>Lupus</b> Foundation of America.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. <b>lupus</b> erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The English 'wolf' {{stems from}} the Old English wulf, which is itself thought {{to be derived from}} the Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Latin <b>lupus</b> is a Sabine loanword. Both derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *wlqwos/*lukwos.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. <b>Lupus</b> erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from <b>lupus</b> erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with <b>lupus</b> erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, <b>lupus</b> anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} named in Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, English, Swedish, and Polish. The zoological {{descriptions}} of the species by Gessner, Ray, Linnaeus, Klein and Buffon himself ("Canis ex griseo flavescens. <b>Lupus</b> vulgaris. Buffon. Reg. animal. pag. 235") are cited.|$|E
5|$|While domesticated rats are not removed {{enough from}} their wild {{counterparts}} {{to justify a}} distinct subspecies (compare Canis <b>lupus</b> familiaris), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue.|$|E
5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and <b>Lupus.</b> Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and <b>Lupus</b> can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|As World War II was beginning, Sophie's Jewish parents {{sent her}} away from Austria. She was on board of the MS St. Louis when it was turned away from Cuba {{and sent to the}} United Kingdom. She was living in a refugee camp in Canada when she met Anton. She was {{diagnosed}} with <b>lupus</b> and takes up gardening, planning elaborate landscapes every year. In 1995, after refusing further medical treatments, and with Anton by her side, she succumbs to the disease.|$|E
5|$|During {{this era}} Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with {{consumer}} electronics company Monster Cable Products to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted, headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga. Gaga also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their Creative Director and announced {{a suite of}} photo capturing products called Grey Label. Her collaboration with past producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to her production team, Mermaid Music LLC, being sued. At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for <b>lupus,</b> but claimed not {{to be affected by}} the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as <b>lupus</b> erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Imelda Marcos was {{instrumental}} in the 1980 exile of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., who had suffered a heart attack during his imprisonment. Martial law in the Philippines was later lifted in 1981 but Ferdinand Marcos continued to be president. While her husband began to suffer from <b>lupus,</b> she effectively ruled in his place. Aquino returned in 1983 but was assassinated at the Manila International Airport upon his arrival. With accusations against her beginning to rise, Ferdinand created the Agrava Commission, a fact-finding committee, to investigate her, ultimately finding her not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini {{revolves}} around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his horde of drones. The team is composed of Juno, Vela, and their wardog mascot <b>Lupus.</b> The game begins with the three characters in orbit around the planet Goldwood after barely escaping {{the destruction of the}} entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of Mizar, who has been capturing and enslaving a race of survivors known as the Tribals. When Juno, Vela and <b>Lupus</b> are attacked by several drones, the three decide to abandon their ship and go off on their own separate paths to stop the invasion. Ultimately, the heroes find themselves reunited at Mizar's Palace and face to face with Mizar, who escapes to a nearby asteroid where he sets course to impact with Earth. To help the heroes, Tribals leader King Jeff provides them with an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar's asteroid. In return, the team must rescue all the Tribals throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{terrestrial}} mammals, including horses (Equus ferus caballus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), dogs (Canis <b>lupus</b> familiaris), cats (Felis catus), {{and brown}} rats (Rattus norvegicus), are fairly {{common in the}} stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii. In one case, remains of two flying foxes {{were found in the}} stomach of this shark. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of <b>Lupus</b> during the year 1006 CE. This was the brightest recorded star ever {{to appear in the}} night sky, and its presence was noted in China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the brightness of this star as one-quarter the brightness of the Moon. Modern astronomers have discovered the faint remnant of this explosion and determined that it was only 7,100 light-years from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|Morgan married George Beavis in 1965 and {{had three}} daughters, {{all of whom}} enjoyed {{swimming}} victories at school and district level. After her marriage, she lived in the Outback towns of Griffith and Orange for six years before returning to Sydney. She experimented with coaching, but found the competition unappealing and became a schoolteacher. In 1978, she began teaching handicapped children to swim in her backyard pool, and was given a government grant to continue her work. She then ran a swimming school at Bonnet Bay for 15 years and worked at the Bates Drive Special School, receiving a grant to teach preschool handicapped children swimming. In later life, Morgan successfully fought a life-threatening battle against <b>lupus,</b> and in 2004 {{she was living in}} Sutherland Shire in southern Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800,000 years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis <b>lupus</b> into today's dog, dingo, and gray wolf. Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct {{at a time that}} coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game. The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore, and a descendant of one of those now-extinct wolf populations.|$|E
25|$|As many as 70% {{of people}} with <b>lupus</b> have some skin symptoms. The three main {{categories}} of lesions are chronic cutaneous (discoid) <b>lupus,</b> subacute cutaneous <b>lupus,</b> and acute cutaneous <b>lupus.</b> People with discoid <b>lupus</b> may exhibit thick, red scaly patches on the skin. Similarly, subacute cutaneous <b>lupus</b> manifests as red, scaly patches of skin but with distinct edges. Acute cutaneous <b>lupus</b> manifests as a rash. Some have the classic malar rash (or butterfly rash) associated with the disease. This rash occurs in 30 to 60% {{of people with}} SLE.|$|E
25|$|Systemic <b>lupus</b> {{erythematosus}} {{in pregnancy}} confers an increased rate of fetal death in utero, spontaneous abortion, and of neonatal <b>lupus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Systemic <b>lupus</b> {{erythematosus}} (SLE), or <b>lupus,</b> is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disease (or autoimmune connective tissue disease) {{that can affect}} {{any part of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Systemic <b>lupus</b> {{erythematosus}} and pregnancy confers {{an increased}} rate of foetal death in utero and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), {{as well as}} of neonatal <b>lupus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neonatal <b>lupus</b> is the {{occurrence}} of SLE symptoms in an infant born from a mother with SLE, most commonly presenting with a rash resembling discoid <b>lupus</b> erythematosus, and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such as heart block or enlargement of the liver and spleen. Neonatal <b>lupus</b> is usually benign and self-limited.|$|E
25|$|Canis <b>lupus</b> hodophilax was {{described}} by Temminck in 1839 as smaller than Canis <b>lupus</b> <b>lupus</b> (Linnaeus 1758) and of shorter legs, with its coat smooth and short. The Japanese wolf was smaller in size compared to the Hokkaido wolf and other gray wolves from the Asian and North American continents. It stood 56–58cm at the withers.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced <b>lupus</b> {{erythematosus}} is a (generally) reversible {{condition that}} usually occurs in people {{being treated for}} a long-term illness. Drug-induced <b>lupus</b> mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced <b>lupus</b> generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped. More than 38 medications can cause this condition, {{the most common of}} which are procainamide, isoniazid, hydralazine, quinidine, and phenytoin.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Histone {{antibodies}} {{are positive}} {{in up to}} 95% of patients with drug induced <b>lupus.</b> DIThe most common medications associated with drug induced <b>lupus</b> are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, quinidine, and minocycline.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has found an association between certain people with <b>lupus</b> (especially those with <b>lupus</b> nephritis) and an impairment in degrading neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These were due to DNAse1 inhibiting factors, or NET protecting factors in people's serum, rather than abnormalities in the DNAse1 itself. DNAse1 mutations in <b>lupus</b> have so far only been found in some Japanese cohorts.|$|E
25|$|Anti-histone {{antibodies}} {{are found}} in the serum of up to 75–95% of people with drug induced <b>lupus</b> and 75% of idiopathic SLE. Unlike anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE, these antibodies do not fix complement. Although they are most commonly found in drug induced <b>lupus,</b> they are also found in some cases of SLE, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. Many drugs are known to cause drug induced <b>lupus</b> and they produce various antigenic targets within the nucleosome that are often cross reactive with several histone proteins and DNA. Procainamide causes a form of drug-induced <b>lupus</b> that produces antibodies to the histone H2A and H2B complex.|$|E
25|$|Antinuclear {{antibodies}} {{are usually}} positive in drug induced <b>Lupus.</b> Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) {{can also be}} positive in association with certain drugs. Furthermore, Anti-Histone antibodies can also be positive in drug induced <b>lupus.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1988, he {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the <b>Lupus</b> Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He later established a private practice in Marietta, Georgia and treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis, <b>lupus,</b> Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and Sjögren's syndrome.|$|E
