5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the <b>left</b> <b>are</b> dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|The re-interment in the Mussolini family crypt in Predappio {{was carried}} out on 1 September 1957, with {{supporters}} present giving the fascist salute. Mussolini was laid to rest in a large stone sarcophagus. The tomb is decorated with fascist symbols and contains a large marble head of Mussolini. In front of the tomb is a register for visitors paying their respects to sign. The tomb has become a neo-fascist place of pilgrimage. The numbers signing the tomb's register range from dozens to hundreds per day, with thousands signing on certain anniversaries; almost all the comments <b>left</b> <b>are</b> supportive of Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing {{is visible}} through modern {{technical}} analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's <b>left</b> <b>are</b> visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends {{far to the left}} of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.|$|E

5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's <b>left</b> <b>are</b> more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E
5|$|In this work, the {{inscriptions}} are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature, and in {{some places}} seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult. Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated. The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the Book of Isaiah (53:6–9, 12), Revelations (20:13, 21:3–4) or the Book of Deuteronomy (32:23–24). In the right hand panel, {{the wings of the}} figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the <b>left</b> <b>are</b> the words CHAOS MAGNVM ("great chaos"), with UMBRA MORTIS ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right. A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens. Also in the section are letters reading ME OBVLIVI.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a cropped Polaroid photograph of two unidentified fans taken at a Sonic Youth show in Amherst, Massachusetts in April 1995, during a short tour undertaken while the album was still in production. The fans are depicted wearing T-shirts that were sold as merchandise during that tour; early in 1995, the band was toying {{with the idea of}} changing their name to Washing Machine. Visible on the shirt on the <b>left</b> <b>are</b> signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. The photo was taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not want to use it without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to contact them, their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E

This is {{in part because of}} the requirement of strong fragments of second-order logic to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require quantification over abstract models or deductions.|$|E
