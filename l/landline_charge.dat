50|$|Before {{satellite}} communication systems were widely available, {{the only way}} ships at sea had {{to communicate with the}} rest of the world was via radio connections to land stations. To talk to people who did not operate radio equipment, a vessel at sea would make contact with a land station, usually using high frequency AM or single-sideband (SSB) radio. The operator of the land station would patch the radio connection though to a telephone call made over the regular telephone system (referred to as a landline). The AT&T High Seas Service was a commercial radio-to-telephone connection system using the above land stations. The charges were typically settled by making the landline connection a collect call. Larger vessels maintained accounts with AT&T, but the service was available to any vessel with a marine HF radio. In the 1980s the radio link was priced at several dollars per minute plus the long distance <b>landline</b> <b>charge</b> from the High Seas station.|$|E

5000|$|In Latvia the prefix 8000-xx-xx is {{used for}} {{toll-free}} services. They are toll-free only when dialed from <b>landlines,</b> and <b>charged</b> {{the same as a}} land line when dialed from cell phones.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the base}} station, at-home calls were {{connected}} to the phone network using an ADSL broadband connection; only those with BT Broadband connections were eligible for the service. Voice over IP protocols were used to transmit the call, but this was intended to remain largely unnoticed from the user's point of view. In particular, the charges for calls made over the [...] "home" [...] part of a BT Fusion system were {{essentially the same as}} <b>landline</b> call <b>charges.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hutchison {{formerly}} operated an Australian CDMA network {{under the}} Orange brand name, as Orange One. It allowed customers {{to use their}} 3 Branded CDMA mobile phone as a Home phone when at home. Calls made from their mobile were charged at rates {{similar to those of}} a Landline. Customers also received a [...] "Local Zone [...] " [...] number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. Should the phone be out of the Local zone, Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the mobile handset. These plans started at a very competitive price of $10.00 per month, and local calls from the local Zone to a local <b>landline</b> was <b>charged</b> at 20c per local call, making their service cheaper than those of Telstra or Optus. The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange one devices to roam to the Telstra network On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006. 3 CDMA customers were offered special tariffs and incentives to continue as customers on the 3G network, all customers either moved over to 3's 3G network or to other network providers.|$|R
