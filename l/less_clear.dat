However, Brender and Spencer show that starting out from the position of no subsidy, introducing a small subsidy can improve a country's welfare.|$|E
5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is <b>less</b> <b>clear,</b> and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E

Sometimes these were more or <b>less</b> <b>cleared</b> up after the assembled wit and wisdom of the community had frowned and bitten their nails over them for several hours. Others were of a nature which it passed the wit of man--Eskimo man at least--to unravel. A few of these, like the watch, had some light thrown on them by Nazinred, who had either seen something like them in use among the fur-traders, or whose sagacity led him to make a shrewd occasional guess.|$|R

5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is <b>less</b> <b>clear</b> since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|Irish legislators {{began to}} comment {{publicly}} from 2003, some tentatively suggesting legislation, and some referring to Catholic teachings. Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition as inevitable and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage.

5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is <b>less</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{have shown}} that water {{fluoridation}} reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is <b>less</b> <b>clear</b> with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been <b>less</b> <b>clear</b> in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|The {{surviving}} regnal lists {{show only}} one king reigning {{at a time}} in Kent, but subkingdoms were common among the Anglo-Saxons and from the reign of Hlothhere, in the late seventh century, there is evidence that Kent was usually ruled by two kings, though often one is clearly dominant. It is <b>less</b> <b>clear</b> that this is the case before Hlothhere. Forged charters preserve a tradition of Eadbald ruling during his father's reign, presumably as a subking over west Kent. The papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of Æthelwald, a brother of Eadbald's, refers to Æthelwald as a king; if he existed, he would presumably have been a junior king to Eadbald.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the youngest galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is <b>less</b> <b>clear.</b> Infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E
5|$|These {{properties}} make it {{relatively easy}} to distinguish a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become <b>less</b> <b>clear</b> at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of the}} characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead have some of the characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E
30|$|The model calculates a {{saliency}} map {{by considering}} intensity and edge orientation {{information from a}} given image. Saliency at a given location is determined primarily by the contrast between this location and its surroundings {{with respect to the}} image features. The image formed on the fovea of the eye is the central object on which a person is focusing his attention resulting in a clear and sharp image. Regions surrounding the central object have a <b>less</b> <b>clearer</b> representation on the retina. To simulate this biological mechanism, an image is represented as a Gaussian pyramid comprising of layers of subsampled and low-pass filtered images. The central representation of the image on the fovea is equivalent to the image at higher spatial scales, and the surrounding regions are obtained from the lower spatial scales. The contrast is thus the difference between the various feature maps at these scales.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose that {{contrast}} must {{be treated as a}} gradient phenomenon at the phonological level, with membership of a phonemic inventory being a matter of degree. This is because, though minimal pairs provide simple and strong evidence of contrast, things are not always so straightforward. Defining “minimal” is one challenge; as is determining which aspects of a contrast are distinctive and which redundant. Non-phonological information is sometimes a necessary consideration. These complications are usually thought to affect the analysis of a phenomenon in a discrete way, tipping the binary balance held by the phonologist towards either one analysis or another. We, on the other hand, see the necessity of evaluating contrastive evidence and of taking other linguistic information into account as being an indication that contrastiveness is a scalar property. We address some patterns in the sound system of Scottish English; ones which provide <b>less</b> than <b>clear</b> evidence of phonemicity — or, as we think, evidence of <b>less</b> than <b>clear</b> phonemicity...|$|R
5|$|Áedán was {{the chief}} king in Dál Riata, ruling over lesser tribal kings. The Senchus fer n-Alban records the sub-divisions of Dál Riata in the 7th and 8th centuries, but no record from Áedán's time survives. According to the Senchus, Dál Riata was divided into three sub-kingdoms in the 7th century, each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder. These were the Cenél nGabráin, named for Áedán's father, who ruled over Kintyre, Cowal and Bute; the Cenél Loairn of {{northern}} Argyll; and the Cenél nÓengusa of Islay. Within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by the Senchus. Details of the Irish part of the kingdom are <b>less</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
5|$|As far as {{the killing}} of Jewish women and {{children}} is concerned, Meyszner's direct involvement is <b>less</b> <b>clear.</b> According to Moll, Schäfer claimed that he had received the orders and gas van directly from Berlin and had carried out the killings with little reference to Meyszner. Manoschek accepts Schäfer's assertion, stating that Schäfer also had an independent Gestapo chain of command, over which Meyszner had very limited control. Despite this, as HSSPF he was formally responsible for all his subordinates, including the Gestapo department that killed the Jewish women and children. He was also responsible for carrying out policies that saw 70,000 Serbs transported to the Reich as forced labourers, 4,000 of whom ended up in occupied Norway. The Holocaust in Serbia played little part in his trial before the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade between 9 and 22 December 1946. On 22 December, {{he was sentenced to}} death, along with most of the 20 leading members of his HSSPF staff who were tried at the same time. On 24 January 1947, Meyszner was executed by hanging.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{providing}} locomotion {{opportunities for}} winged animals and {{a conduit for}} the dispersal of pollen grains, spores and seeds, the atmosphere can {{be considered to be}} a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and <b>less</b> <b>clear</b> evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E
5000|$|From 1971 onward, a {{group of}} local {{residents}} led by Las Vegas attorney James E. [...] "Jim" [...] Rogers {{made an effort to}} take control of KORK. The group gained further momentum in the late 1970s, after Donrey began heavily preempting NBC programming in order to sell more local advertising, though NBC was far less tolerant of this than the other networks at the time. The most notable of these preemptions was the 1978 World Series, angering both NBC and several Las Vegas area viewers, some of whom complained to the Federal Communications Commission. Facing pressure from both NBC and the FCC, Donrey was forced to sell the station to the Rogers group's holding company, Valley Broadcasting Company, in 1979. Donrey retained KORK radio, and as a result on October 1, 1979 the station became KVBC, reflecting the new ownership. Since then, the station has more or <b>less</b> <b>cleared</b> the whole NBC lineup.|$|R
