40|$|Sequencing microRNA, reduced {{representation}} sequencing, Hi-C {{technology and}} any method requiring {{the use of}} in-house barcodes result in sequencing libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to {{the limitations of the}} Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e. g. detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect detection of clusters on the flowcell during initial sequencing cycles. We propose simple software modifications (<b>Long</b> <b>Template</b> Protocol) that overcome this problem. We present experimental results showing that our <b>Long</b> <b>Template</b> Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage. Second and third, we present modified guidelines, which are more stringent than the manufacturer's, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In such cases, we propose that the flowcell be re-hybridized and sequenced again using our <b>Long</b> <b>Template</b> Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the <b>Long</b> <b>Template</b> Protocol to increase accuracy...|$|E

40|$|The {{organization}} of eukaryotic chromosomes into topological domains {{has led to}} the assumption that DNA topology and perhaps supercoiling are involved in eukaryotic nuclear processes. Xenopus oocytes provide a model system for studying the role of DNA topology in transcription. Linear plasmid templates for RNA polymerases (Pols) I and II are not transcribed in Xenopus oocytes, while circular templates are transcrip-tionally active. Here we show that circularity is not required for transcription of Pol I or Pol II promoters if the linear template is sufficiently long (> 17 to 19 kb). The Xenopus rRNA (Pol I) promoter is active in central positions on a long linear template but is not transcribed when located near an end. Because supercoils generated by transcription could be retained by viscous drag against the <b>long</b> <b>template,</b> these results are consistent with a supercoiling requirement for this promoter. Surprisingly, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Pol II) promoter is active even 100 bp {{from the end of the}} <b>long</b> <b>template,</b> indicating that template length fulfills a critical parameter for transcription that is not consistent with a supercoiling requirement.

40|$|HIV- 1 RT (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus- 1 reverse transcriptase) is a multifunctional polymerase {{responsible for}} reverse transcription of the HIV genome, including DNA replication on both RNA and DNA templates. During reverse transcription in vivo, HIV- 1 RT replicates through various secondary structures on RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates {{without the need}} for a nucleic acid unwinding protein, such as a helicase. In order to understand the mechanism of polymerization through secondary structures, we investigated the DNA polymerization activity of HIV- 1 RT on <b>long</b> ssDNA <b>templates</b> using a multiplexed single-molecule DNA flowstretching assay. We observed that HIV- 1 RT performs fast primer extension DNA synthesis on single-stranded regions of DNA (18. 7 nt/s) and switches its activity to slow strand displacement synthesis at DNA hairpin locations (2. 3 nt/s). Furthermore, we found that the rate of strand displacement synthesis is dependent on the GC content in hairpin stems and template stretching force. This indicates that the strand displacement synthesis occurs through a mechanism that is neither completely active nor passive: that is, the opening of the DNA hairpin is driven by a combination of free energy released during dNTP (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate) hydrolysis and thermal fraying of base pairs.

The VDJ junctions of the expressed alleles showed little or no nontemplated (N) addition, similar to neonatal B cells from wild-type mice.

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) are an invaluable tool for studying human embryonic development and have great potential for drug development as well as cell replacement therapies. Progress in hESC research is greatly hindered by the difficulty of generating genetically modified hESC lines. Recently the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat- (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas 9) system from Streptococcus pyogenes was shown to facilitate genetic engineering, but its applicability in gene targeting with <b>long</b> donor <b>templates</b> in hESCs has not been demonstrated, yet. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop a strategy for rapid production of faithful hPSC fluorescent reporter lines. hESCs were targeted upstream to the stop codons of the pluripotency transcription factors NANOG and OCT 4 to generate NANOG-VENUS (NV) and OCT 4 -mCHERRY (OC) reporter lines expressing NV and OC fusion proteins, respectively. Homologous recombination was facilitated by targeting a site proximal to the insertion site with RNA-guided nucleases or double nickases. Furthermore the strategy involved the use of short homology arms to allow employing customizable synthetic DNA blocks and a promoter trap approach for positive selection to increase the targeting efficiency. The strategy allowed rapid and robust production of hESC reporter lines with high targeting efficiencies, though a double reporter line could not be derived in a single targeting step. In the NV reporter VENUS faithfully reflected NANOG expression, but further analyses are required to confirm the precision of the OC reporter. Despite low qualities of the CRISPR targets, mutations were only detected in a single off-target locus that was completely homologous to the target. However, at the on-target sites concomitant mutations were observed that could be prevented in the targeted allele by mutating the protospacer adjacent motif sequences in the homology arms.

The amplified products were purified and directly sequenced using a BigDye Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) making use of appropriate sequencing primers for the gag and pol genes while the env and nef were sequenced with their nested primers. The sequenced fragments from both strands were assembled and edited using SeqMan Pro and Seqbuilder program contained in the DNAStar software version 7 (DNASTAR, INC, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{assessment}} of TP 53 mutational status {{is becoming a}} routine clinical practice for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (CLL). A broad spectrum of molecular techniques has been employed so far, including both direct Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently released the MinION an USB-interfaced sequencer. In this paper we report our experience, with the MinION technology {{for the detection of}} the TP 53 gene mutation in CLL patients. Twelve CLL patients at diagnosis were included in this study. All except one patient showed the TP 53 gene deletion in Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments. Patients were investigated for TP 53 mutation by Sanger and by MinION sequencing. Analysis by Sanger was performed according with the IARC protocol. Analysis by MinION was performed adopting a strategy based on <b>long</b> <b>template</b> PCR, read error correction, and post variant calling filtering. Results: Due to the high error rate of nanopore technology, sequence data were both used directly and before correction with two different in silico methods: ALEC and nanocorrect. A mean error rate of 15 % was detected before correction that was reduced to 4 - 5 % after correction. Analysis by Sanger sequencing was able to detect four patients mutated for TP 53. MinION analysis detected one more mutated patient previously not detected from Sanger. Conclusion: In our hands, the Nanopore technology shows correlation with Sanger sequencing but more sensitive, manageable and less expensive, and therefore {{has proven to be a}} useful tool for TP 53 gene mutation detection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{biochemical}} {{properties of}} the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the hepatitis C virus were analyzed. A hexahistidine affinity-tagged NS 5 B fusion protein was expressed with recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells and purified to near homogeneity. Enzymatic activity of the purified protein was inhibited by KCl or high concentrations of NaCl and was absolutely dependent on Mg 2 +, which could be replaced by Mn 2 +. NS 5 B {{was found to be}} processive and able to copy <b>long</b> heteropolymeric <b>templates</b> with an elongation rate of 150 – 200 nucleotides/min at 22 °C. Kinetic constants were determined for all four nucleoside triphosphates and different templates. In case of a heteropolymeric RNA template corresponding to the last 319 nucleotides of the hepatitis C virus genome,Kmvalues for UTP, GTP, ATP, and CTP were ∼ 1. 0, ∼ 0. 5, ∼ 10, and ∼ 0. 3 μM, respectively. The profile of several inhibitors of RdRp activity and substrate analogs indicated that the enzyme has a strong preference for ribonucleoside 5 ′-triphosphates and that it closely resembles 3 Dpolof picornaviruses...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} that DNA methylation survives in fossil material {{provides an opportunity}} for novel molecular approaches in palaeogenomics. Here, we apply to ancient DNA extracts the probe-independent Methylated Binding Domains (MBD) -based enrichment method, which targets DNA molecules containing methylated CpGs. Using remains of a Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq individual, woolly mammoths, polar bears and two equine species, we confirm that DNA methylation survives in a variety of tissues, environmental contexts and over a large temporal range (4, 000 to over 45, 000 years before present). MBD enrichment, however, appears principally biased towards the recovery of CpG-rich and <b>long</b> DNA <b>templates</b> and is limited by the fast post-mortem cytosine deamination rates of methylated epialleles. This method, thus, appears only appropriate for the analysis of ancient methylomes from very well preserved samples, where both DNA fragmentation and deamination have been limited. This work represents an essential step toward the characterization of ancient methylation signatures, which will help understanding the role of epigenetic changes in past environmental and cultural transitions.

DNA origami gives excellent {{control over the}} size and shape of objects [14, 15]. However, this level of structural complexity requires hundreds of staple strands with different sequence as well as long annealing times [16]. In other words, obtaining nanotubes with high aspect ratio need more quantities of staple oligonucleotides within a DNA origami procedure; however, more staples in fabrication made more costs in practice. Hence, we aimed here to introduce a simple procedure for fabrication of DNA nanotubes via an origami-based technique assisted with a ligase reaction. This fabrication process provides DNA nanotube with minimum numbers of the staples within a self-assembly reaction.|$|R
