5|$|A {{spin-off}} to {{the series}} was proposed in 2008, with a pilot episode expected to debut as the Super Bowl <b>lead-out</b> program in 2009. However, The Offices creative team instead decided to develop Parks and Recreation as a separate series.|$|E
5|$|The series earned {{relatively}} average {{ratings for}} GSN's standards. Despite The American Bible Challenge debuting to record ratings for GSN, Beat the Chefs maintained {{less than a}} third of the viewers that tuned in to its lead-in. The series premiere averaged 521,000 viewers, compared to the 1.73 million viewers who watched The American Bible Challenge. The following week, Beat the Chefs dropped to 357,000 viewers, while its <b>lead-out,</b> a sneak peek of GSN's upcoming revival of Pyramid, earned 443,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no <b>lead-out</b> trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
50|$|The special gained 23.1 million viewers, {{becoming}} NBC's most-watched prime-time, non-sports, entertainment telecast (excluding Super Bowl <b>lead-outs)</b> {{since the}} Friends series finale in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{contains}} twelve {{songs and}} five transitional tracks {{that are not}} numbered. The transitional tracks {{are part of the}} songs they're listed before or after, more as introductions or <b>lead-outs</b> than anything. [...] "Panic and Geo-Primaries" [...] contains the chorus and main theme from [...] "Arch to Achtilles" [...] on the band's earlier album, Captiva.|$|R
500|$|The {{first half}} of the stage {{followed}} the coast of Picardy and Normandy along the English Channel through Dieppe to the intermediate sprint point of Fécamp, before turning inland towards the finish at Rouen, with four fourth-category climbs during the [...] parcours. The wind on the coast was expected to have an influence on the race, while the two tight turns to get over the Guillaume le Conquérant Bridge with [...] to go, were potentially disruptive for the <b>lead-outs</b> ahead of an expected sprint finish along the quayside in Rouen.|$|R
25|$|Brothers and Sisters premiered on NBC {{after the}} game, {{representing}} the Super Bowl <b>lead-out</b> program.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{this strong}} {{coattail}} effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically {{takes advantage of}} the large audience to air an episode of a hit series, or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the <b>lead-out</b> slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} announced that Games 2 and 3 of the 2015 Finals {{were to be}} broadcast by NBCSN, with the remainder on NBC. Game 2 was moved to NBC {{to serve as a}} <b>lead-out</b> for its coverage of the 2015 Belmont Stakes in favor of Game 4 on NBCSN. As Eddie Olczyk was also a contributor to NBC's Belmont coverage, he was absent during Game 2.|$|E
50|$|The Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special is a three-and-a-half-hour prime-time {{special that}} aired on Sunday, February 15, 2015, on NBC, celebrating Saturday Night Lives 40th {{year on the}} air, having premiered on October 11, 1975, under the {{original}} title NBCs Saturday Night. This special generated 23.1 million viewers, becoming NBCs most-watched prime-time, non-sports, entertainment telecast (excluding Super Bowl <b>lead-outs)</b> since the Friends series finale in 2004. It is the third such anniversary special to be broadcast, with celebratory episodes also held during the 15th and 25th seasons.|$|R
50|$|The {{first half}} of the stage {{followed}} the coast of Picardy and Normandy along the English Channel through Dieppe to the intermediate sprint point of Fécamp, before turning inland towards the finish at Rouen, with four fourth-category climbs during the 214.5 km parcours. The wind on the coast was expected to have an influence on the race, while the two tight turns to get over the Guillaume le Conquérant Bridge with 1 km to go, were potentially disruptive for the <b>lead-outs</b> ahead of an expected sprint finish along the quayside in Rouen.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the need}} for {{semiconductor}} pressure transducers {{that can be used}} in applications that require operation in harsh environments that are corrosive, oxidizing, experiencing high vibration, and involving high temperatures has increased. Accordingly, not only must the stress-sensing network of these transducers be protected from these harsh environmental conditions in some way to enable the transducer to remain operational at high temperature over extended period of time, but the entire transducer structure, including: electrical contacts, <b>lead-outs,</b> interconnects and external wiring must also be protected. Results are presented showing test data for latest high temperature “leadless ” dielectrically isolated (SOI) semiconductor piezoresistive transducers. Data is presented at temperatures for up to 1075 °F illustrating the excellent zero shift and low span sensitivity to temperature. Methods of construction of these devices are also discussed. The results indicate that ruggedized, high frequency, piezoresistive transducers are now feasible and can be manufactured for the kinds of environments that exist under the most stressful jet engine conditions. 2...|$|R
25|$|Super Bowl XLVIII was {{televised}} by Fox in the United States, with Joe Buck calling play-by-play, Troy Aikman as color analyst, and Pam Oliver and Erin Andrews as sideline reporters. The broadcast attracted 111.5million viewers, {{becoming the}} most-watched event in U.S. television history and surpassing {{the previous record}} of 111.3million viewers who watched Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. Episodes of New Girl and Brooklyn Nine-Nine were the <b>lead-out</b> programs.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{broadcasts}} of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night talk shows as its <b>lead-out</b> programs for Super Bowl 50, {{beginning with a}} special live episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game, with a sketch featuring a pre-recorded appearance by Barack Obama, and guests Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, and Megyn Kelly. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Finals {{were split}} between NBC and NBCSN, called by NBC Sports' lead {{commentary}} team of Mike Emrick, Eddie Olczyk and Pierre McGuire; {{it was originally}} announced that games two and three were to be broadcast by NBCSN, with the remainder on NBC. Game two was moved to NBC {{to serve as a}} <b>lead-out</b> for its coverage of the 2015 Belmont Stakes in favor of game four on NBCSN. As Olczyk was also a contributor to NBC's Belmont coverage, he was absent during game two.|$|E
5000|$|From its debut, The Daily Buzz {{employed}} a personality-driven on-air approach, {{one that was}} looser, faster in pace, and sometimes edgy in comparison to tradition-bound network breakfast television shows broadcast by ABC (Good Morning America), CBS (The Early Show), and NBC (Today): Slang terms, pop music, and host commentaries would be interjected in the news summaries. Pop culture segments were liberally employed (see below). The hosts' employed not-as-formal forms of dress and demeanor (dancing in <b>lead-outs</b> to commercial breaks were not uncommon). And above all, the liveliness trumped the serious. The lively tone was intentional, as {{it was meant to}} attract an audience that was younger in age and were more likely to get their news from sources other than traditional local and network TV newscasts. As Andrea Jackson described it to the Orlando Sentinel in 2005, [...] "We always talk about The Daily Buzz as morning radio on television or late-night television in the morning. It's infotainment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 2010s, {{stations}} began experimenting with 4:30 a.m., and even 4:00 a.m. newscasts in some major markets (and even gradually expanding into mid-size and some smaller markets), pushing local news further into what traditionally is known as an overnight graveyard slot. Some local morning newscasts, which formerly had both softer [...] "morning" [...] musical and graphical packages and lighter news, now resemble their later-day counterparts with hard news coverage of overnight events. Some locally produced morning shows that utilize a mainly infotainment format still exist, most prominently among some large and mid-market stations owned by the E. W. Scripps Company (which inherited the Morning Blend format originated in 2006 by the Journal Broadcast Group following its 2015 acquisition of that company's stations) and Tegna Media (which inherited many of the local talk/lifestyle shows originated by the Belo Corporation - such as Good Morning Texas on Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA - prior to the 2014 acquisition of the latter group by the predecessor broadcasting unit of the Gannett Company), and often serving as <b>lead-outs</b> of national network morning shows.|$|R
25|$|Sagan went on {{to compete}} in the Clasica San Sebastian but withdrew. He then headed to the Vuelta a España and had a {{difficult}} first week, his first notable result coming as a third place on Stage 8. That was his only podium result and he withdrew on Stage 14. He made his return on 16 September at the Coppa Bernocchi, where he acted as a <b>lead-out</b> man for his victorious teammate Elia Viviani. In November, Sagan climbed Kilimanjaro with his new team Tinkoff-Saxo as a team-building experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{program has}} rarely been pre-empted since 1978. Two notable pre-emptions {{occurred}} in 1976 and 1977, {{to make room for}} the annual telecast of The Wizard of Oz, which had recently returned to CBS after having been shown on NBC for eight years. However, CBS would, in later years, schedule the film so that it would no longer pre-empt 60 Minutes. Another exception is on years when CBS airs the Super Bowl or since 2003, alternating years where the AFC Championship Game has the 6:30p.m. Eastern start time, which is played into prime-time and followed by a special <b>lead-out</b> program.|$|E
25|$|As for WABC, {{which has}} aired Jeopardy! at 7:00 ever since, {{initially}} the same <b>lead-out</b> issues plagued the station. Hollywood Squares saw its ratings decline and was {{dropped by the}} station after its second season in favor of bringing back Entertainment Tonight, after two seasons on WWOR; Squares moved to WPIX, where it remained {{until the end of}} its run in 1989. WABC finally found a permanent partner for Jeopardy! in 1990 when it took over for WCBS as the New York home for Wheel of Fortune. Although it had been a ratings winner for the station since WCBS picked up Wheel, the station decided it wanted to go in a different direction with its pre-prime time programming (for instance, WCBS picked up Hard Copy to serve as the lead in for Wheel in 1989 and eventually paired it with Entertainment Tonight, once it became available in the fall of 1990).|$|E
25|$|Urán placed fourth on {{the fourth}} stage, {{finishing}} {{with many of the}} overall contenders for the race, on the steep uphill finish to Mûr-de-Bretagne. Wiggins became the team's best placed rider, moving into sixth place despite losing time to the top ten on the stage – a result that left him pleased {{at the end of the}} stage – and Thomas and Boasson Hagen also remained in the top ten, in seventh and eighth respectively. Boasson Hagen tried to make a solo bid for victory the next day, within the closing stages, but could not hold the pace, and was usurped by the field. Thomas placed fifth on the stage, aiding eventual stage winner Mark Cavendish's progress, as he maintained his lead in the young rider classification. Boasson Hagen earned the team's first Tour win on the sixth stage into Lisieux. Having held their attack until the time was right, Swift and Thomas formed the <b>lead-out</b> for Boasson Hagen to win the longest stage of the 2011 race.|$|E
25|$|When Jeopardy! {{made the}} move on December 31, 1984, WABC {{was looking to}} improve its ratings in the hour leading up to Eyewitness News at 5:00p.m.. Jeopardy! helped, but the station {{did not seem to}} be able to find a {{complementary}} program for it at 4:30p.m.. The station first tried Name That Tune as the accompanying program, but the show had already been struggling in the ratings in its earlier morning timeslot and did not fare better. Thus, WABC moved it to a late-night timeslot and added Divorce Court in its place in early 1985. While Divorce Court was popular, the fictional court program switched stations for the fall of 1985. WABC responded by signing on as an affiliate for the syndicated edition of Sale of the Century, which had been airing on WOR since its January 1985 premiere and was entering its second season that fall. But once again, the station was left needing another solution, as Sale became the third straight problematic Jeopardy! <b>lead-out</b> program and was cancelled by its syndicator in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The race {{begins at}} 6:00 AM (previously 5:00 AM) on Holy Saturday morning, near Mile 2 on Belize's George Price Highway, a {{favorite}} road for cycling events. Recently {{there has been}} a <b>lead-out</b> from inside Belize City at the BTL Park with actual racing beginning on the highway. Cyclists race to the western town of San Ignacio, in the Cayo District, turn there and return to Belize City, finishing at the Marion Jones Sports Complex (formerly the National Stadium) with two laps on the asphalt track (more recently on flat straight portions of Princess Margaret Drive and Marine Parade while the Complex is under renovation). The estimated distance of the Classic is some 142.4 miles. Participation is limited mainly to amateur cyclists of any country, and cyclists from Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and the United States have participated. In addition to prizes awarded {{at the end of the}} race, station prizes are handed out at strategic points on the road going and coming. These prizes are usually cash donations, farm produce or certificates for trophies, jewelry and other items. Belizeans normally line the roadway to cheer on Belize's representatives in the race. While the cyclists are pushed toward Cayo by southeasterly or even easterly winds, a combination of those same fierce winds and the usual muggy conditions of Belize in the dry season traditionally faces cyclists on the return journey.|$|E
500|$|Shortly thereafter, Cavendish {{lost the}} wheel of his <b>lead-out</b> man Mark Renshaw after {{struggling}} to come back after the crash which hindered his <b>lead-out</b> train. There were two technical turns before the finish line. Peter Sagan was sitting in third wheel of his team's train; he negotiated the final 90 degree corner with 200 m to go and profited from an unintentional <b>lead-out</b> by Jurgen Roelandts (...) , who had opened his sprint before Sagan outpowered him in the last hundred meters to win the day. It was Sagan's eleventh victory in Tour de Suisse history, equaling the records of Hugo Koblet and Ferdi Kubler. Because of a split in the peloton, Pinot lost five seconds to general classification rival Geraint Thomas of Team Sky.|$|E

This also made the episode the highest-rated scripted broadcast of a TV series in three years. The episode continued a trend of declining Super Bowl <b>lead-out</b> show retention. It attained a higher rating than the last scripted <b>lead-out</b> show, The Office episode [...] "Stress Relief", which followed Super Bowl XLIII, but was down 31percent on the premiere episode of the reality television series Undercover Boss, broadcast after Super Bowl XLIV. Both ratings and viewership significantly increased from the previous Glee episode, [...] "A Very Glee Christmas", which was viewed by 11.07million US viewers {{and received a}} 4.4/13 rating/share in the 18–49 demographic upon its initial airing.|$|E
500|$|The {{first team}} {{to move forward}} in the sprint was , with [...] {{following}} soon afterwards.
