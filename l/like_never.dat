5|$|Playing {{to small}} audiences, on tiny stages, in {{communal}} troupes where {{all but the}} stars had day jobs, and playing only Saturday and Sunday (the pious London Jews would never have tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater {{in a series of}} other locations, notably Paris, but eventually came back to London, where Israel Grodner died in 1887.|$|E

5|$|The {{ascent of}} Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, Govinda III, {{to the throne}} heralded an era of success <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before. There is {{uncertainty}} about {{the location of the}} early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time. During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the Pala Emperor Dharmapala, the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges. His military exploits have been compared to those of Alexander the Great and Arjuna of Mahabharata. Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala (Kaushal), Gangavadi, humbled the Pallavas of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in Vengi and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of Ceylon (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras all paid him tribute. As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar. The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from Cape Comorin to Kannauj and from Banaras to Bharuch.|$|E

25|$|Before World War I, Canadian Nursing Sisters {{participated in}} the South African War, Boer War, and the War of 1812. Following the {{creation}} of the Canadian Army Medical Department in June 1899, the Canadian Army Nursing Service was created and four Canadian nurses were dispatched South Africa. They were granted the relative rank, pay and allowances of an army lieutenant. Before the war was over on May 31, 1902, eight Canadian Nursing Sisters and more than 7,000 Canadian soldiers had volunteered for service in South Africa. However, World War I allowed women to emerge into the public sphere in an international conflict <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before. When Britain declared war on the German Empire, Canada was automatically compelled to fight alongside Britain. At {{the beginning of the war}} there were five Permanent Force nurses and 57 listed in reserve. Nursing was viewed as a respectable occupation for women because it embodied feminine characteristics such as nurturing, healing, and selflessness. During wartime, nursing became women’s primary way of contributing to the war effort and came to represent a distinct form of nationalism on behalf of the Canadian Nursing Sisters.|$|E

25|$|From 26 April 2013, in the {{run up to}} the elections, {{both the}} PML-N and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) started to criticise each other <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before. In the run up to the elections, Imran Khan {{challenged}} Sharif for a live television debate. Sharif immediately rebuffed the offer. However, during the confrontations, Khan was accused of personally attacking Sharif and as a result, the Election Commission of Pakistan gave notice to Khan because political candidates should refrain from personal attacks on others. Khan denied he was launching personal attacks on Sharif. On 18 August 2014, Khan announced his party would renounce all its seats it won in the 2013 elections, claiming the elections were rigged, a claim he had made before. He accused Sharif of plundering the national wealth, and demanded his resignation. He called on the public to withhold taxes and payment of utility bills to force the government to resign. On 22 August 2014 Khan and his fellow 33 PTI lawmakers resigned from the national assembly. He called for a caretaker government to be formed composing non-political people, and for fresh elections.|$|E
500|$|The {{designer}} gave Chopra {{shorts and}} singlets with loose silhouettes. Malhotra {{said that although}} the actress prefers grey, black and white, he decided to experiment with bright solid colours like [...] "the ones in the citrus family." [...] Chopra was initially apprehensive about the colours, but Malhotra changed her mind: [...] "Priyanka has worn colour <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before in this film. There’s lime, tangerine, cranberry, pink, yellow, purple ... the rainbow." [...] He wanted to design the swimsuit in a metallic gold or silver; he and Chopra settled on gold because of her dusky skin, which they thought a perfect foil for the colour. The golden swimsuit was created by combining two swimsuits; because they were small, Malhotra attached the second one to make the swimsuit seen in the film.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{conceptualized}} {{the video}} around {{the lyrics to}} the song: [...] "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more {{along the lines of}} exposing the real behind-the-scenes [...] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But I still think it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E

500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively. He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place.

I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard her say?

Thank you so much for the support and appreciation. This means the world to me." [...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while and I must admit to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before on Priyanka's global single debut. But to see these results so quickly is beyond gratifying," [...] Sanyal said, before saying that the single debut would be followed by many promotional campaigns targeting different multimedia facets.|$|E

Based on the short story [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands" [...] by Ruskin Bond, [...] 7 Khoon Maaf centres on Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman (played by Chopra) who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. The film and her {{performance}} received acclaim from critics. Nikhat Kazmi remarked, [...] "7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema." [...] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis wrote: [...] "Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts {{it in a way}} that only she possibly can. For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime and she sparkles <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before."

500|$|Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu {{commented that}} [...] "though {{the first half}} of the movie is well-paced, the second half sags with the songs and twists forced into the plot to buy time", but stated that it was [...] "passable with its slick production, a few funny lines, glam {{quotient}} and star appeal." [...] Subhash K. Jha criticised the film's [...] "dishy digressions" [...] and [...] "peripheral sub-plots", rating it 2 out of 5 overall, but was impressed with the court scene, which he considered [...] "splendid". He also found Chopra's performance to be a triumph, remarking: [...] "A star is born! As the predatory social-climbing seductress who can go to any length to satiate her lust for life, Priyanka Chopra rocks the scene <b>like</b> <b>never</b> before." [...] Jha believed that Kareena was miscast and seemed a little awkward in a non-glamorous role, but [...] "comes into her own in the climactic courtroom sequence", a sentiment echoed by Jitesh Pillai in his review for The Times of India. Pillai gave a rating of 3 out of 5 and noted that [...] "it isn't drama that directors were striving for, yet the film works." ...|$|E

[...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E
