However, Wily eventually became tired of <b>Light</b> <b>receiving</b> all the credit for what he considered their shared work, and decided to demonstrate his genius by reprogramming the first six Robot Masters to attack the city. However, Mega Man managed to defeat them and came to challenge Wily, who was imprisoned but later freed by Time Man and Oil Man of Mega Man Powered Up. When a scheme involving infecting Mega Man with a virus using a second line of Robot Masters was also thwarted, Wily headed to the mysterious Lanfront Ruins, where he came across the alien computer Ra Moon from Super Adventure Rockman. Ra Moon subsequently recreated Wily's first Robot Masters before creating a new set using designs created by Wily and Light and the remains of an alien robot found in the same ruins, creating the units from Mega Man 3. Much to Wily's surprise, his and Light's long-lost creation Blues turned up in the area, and Wily was able to repair his power supply. In gratitude, Blues pledged his loyalty to Wily, adopting the name Break Man as a means of turning his back on his former life.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{compactification}} (improvement of the <b>light</b> <b>receiving</b> density) {{and reduction}} of the directivity (dependence property for the sun position) are tried to improve {{the efficiency of the}} photovoltaics using Light Received Analysis Algorithm of a Plant Shoot (LAPS). The LAPS is a method of analysis to check the form of a plant shoot that has high <b>light</b> <b>receiving</b> density by numerical analysis using GA. A big scale plant needs big energy for maintenance and growth. A characteristic of the big scale plant is to have a branch structure. Thus, it means that a branch structure is necessary to get big energy by the solar cell module simulating a plant shoot. However, conventional LAPS was not able to express the branch structure so far. Therefore L-system is applied to LAPS. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to elucidate the influence that the branch structure gives to <b>light</b> <b>receiving</b> density. The analysis is carried out under sunshine condition of the summer solstice and the winter solstice in Sapporo, Hokkaido, and used a ginkgo for the shape of the leaf. As results, solar cell modules with the branch structure of a plant shoot optimized for sunshine condition of the summer solstice and the winter solstice were obtained. As the number of leaves increased, the solar cell module with the branch structure of a plant shoot came to have higher <b>light</b> <b>receiving</b> density than that of the solar cell module without the branch structure of a plant shoot. From this, it is confirmed that the branch structure increases the <b>light</b> <b>receiving</b> density of a plant with many leaves...|$|E

40|$|Method {{and system}} for {{controllably}} redirecting a light beam, having a central wavelength lambda, from a first light-receiving site {{to a second}} light-receiving site.
