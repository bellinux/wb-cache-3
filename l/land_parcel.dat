Watts-Russell's name came up early and he chose land adjacent to the farm established by the Deans brothers in the early 1840s at Riccarton Bush. That <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> was bounded by what are now Riccarton, Waimairi and Clyde Roads and the Waimairi Stream. While a cob house was built for them on their land, they lived with Charlotte and John Robert Godley; Godley is considered the founder of Canterbury.

Six months later, Kajiro petitioned the Superior Court of San Diego County to be appointed Fred’s guardian, stating that Fred owned the six acres (24,000 m²). The court permitted this.

25|$|In 1857, the {{merchant}} Amos Eno bought a <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> {{at the intersection}} with Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. He built the luxury Fifth Avenue Hotel on this site by 1859. The six-story-high structure, {{which was designed to}} accommodate 800 guests, became the largest hotel in the world at that time. The hotel served as the headquarters of the Republican Party and was used by Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Chester A. Arthur. When the Prince of Wales, Edward VII, visited the hotel in 1860, the commercial appeal of the adjacent neighborhood was greatly increased. The area bounded by 14th and 23rd Streets between Sixth Avenue and Broadway was soon dubbed Ladies' Mile. In 1908, the hotel was demolished and replaced by the Toy Center.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} a link between Q-fever {{positive}} farms (QFPFs) and community cases of human Q-fever. Our study {{is the first to}} investigate the potential role of contaminated land-applied manure in human Q-fever, based on a large set of nationwide notification and farm management data. Time between manure application and disease onset in geographically linked notified human cases coincided with the incubation period of Q-fever. Proximity of contaminated <b>land</b> <b>parcels</b> predicted human cases better than proximity of QFPFs (80 % vs. 58 %, 0 - 5 km in 2009). Incidence around QFPFs and contaminated <b>land</b> <b>parcels</b> decreased with distance, but not around non-contaminated <b>land</b> <b>parcels.</b> Incidence was higher around contaminated <b>land</b> <b>parcels</b> than non-contaminated <b>land</b> <b>parcels</b> (RR = [10], 95 %CI = [7], [1]-[14, 2]).

2500|$|Pivtorak {{starts with}} the meaning of kraj as ‘land parcel, territory’, attested to in many Slavic {{languages}} and states of having acquired the meaning ‘a tribe's territory’ from early in Slavic morphology; *ukraj and *ukrajina would then mean [...] "a separated <b>land</b> <b>parcel,</b> a separate part of a tribe's territory". Later, as Kievan Rus' disintegrated in the 12th century, its ukrainas would become independent principalities, hence the new (and earliest attested) meaning of ukraina as ‘principality’. Still later, lands that became part of Lithuania (Chernihiv and Siversk Principalities, Kiev Principality, Pereyaslav Principality and the most part of the Volyn Principality) were sometimes called Lithuanian Ukraina, while lands that became part of Poland (Halych Principality {{and part of the}} Volyn Principality) were called Polish Ukraina. Simultaneously, Pivtorak and other scholars claim that the words Okraina and Ukraine always had strictly separate meanings, which has been countered by other historical sources.|$|E

At the time, Fort Davis belonged to a much larger Presidio County, created by the Texas Legislature in 1850, that encompassed most of the present region of Texas west of the Pecos River. After several fruitless attempts, the county was successfully organized in 1875 then comprising present-day Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties. That year, the county accepted the gift of a [...] <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> in Fort Davis for {{the site of a}} future courthouse and county jail from local merchant Whittaker Keesey. Nevertheless, the county initially needed to rent office and court space, first in a dance hall, and then from space provided by another townsman while an additional local merchant rented furniture.

2500|$|The [...] Hudson Yards project, {{the largest}} planned {{development}} ever {{built in the}} United States, was to be constructed over the existing at-grade West Side Yard, allowing LIRR trains {{to continue to be}} stored during midday hours. The <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> is bordered by 30th Street and Chelsea on the south, Twelfth Avenue on the west, 33rd Street and Hell's Kitchen on the north, and Tenth Avenue on the east. Eleventh Avenue runs through the site, and splits the redevelopment project into two phases. To minimize construction impact on the LIRR's ability to store trains during midday and peak hours, caissons were drilled into bedrock throughout much of the site, over which the platform was to be built. However, only 38% of the ground level at West Side Yard was to be filled in with columns to support the development. Much of the platform itself will be built by a huge Manitowoc 18000 crane. The eastern platform, supporting the towers, comprises 16 bridges. The platform for the Eastern Rail Yard was completed in October 2015, and the western platform will be completed by 2016.|$|E
2500|$|The {{award for}} the {{convention}} headquarters hotel went to Marriott International in October 2002. The September 11 attacks caused a severe economic downturn in Washington, D.C., which caused the city to delay its decision on the RFP {{for more than a}} year. The award was not made until October 29, 2002. The mayor's office said the city would probably provide TIF financing to the project, which now was projected to have 1,500 rooms, [...] of meeting room space, cost $500 million, and open in late 2006 or early 2007. The Marriott/Gould bid was chosen because the <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> size, its location near the convention center, and the land, which was already owned by the partners. City officials said they intended to ask the D.C. City Council for legislation to establish a nonprofit to sell TIF bonds and own the hotel. Marriott said it would buy $24 million of the bonds to create an ownership interest in the hotel, which it said would be built by The JBG Companies. To keep interest on the bonds reasonable, the city stated it would also seek authority to divert up to $19 million in general sales tax revenue in the event the hotel didn't generate enough revenue to pay interest on the TIF bonds.|$|E

40|$|The channel {{morphology}} of the Kolubara {{river was}} changed {{during the last}} century, mostly because of the lignite exploitation. In the research area, bank erosion is widespread and causes processes of soil loss and land use changes.

In {{the area of the}} three villages, which are situated on the Kolubara River banks, there are 208 <b>land</b> <b>parcels</b> at risk from the bank erosion.
