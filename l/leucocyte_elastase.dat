40|$|The plasma {{concentration}} of human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> (HLE), measured by enzyme immunoassay as the complex with alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor, was determined in 94 patients with active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. In Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> levels were raised significantly above normal when {{the disease was}} active, and fell on remission. The mean human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> level in 31 cases of active Crohn's disease was significantly greater than the mean human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> level in 23 patients with active ulcerative colitis (p = 0. 013). The values of human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> correlated significantly with Crohn's disease activity index scores (p = 0. 05) and with the circulating concentration of C-reactive protein (p less than 0. 05 and p less than 0. 01 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease respectively), {{but not with the}} erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These results indicate that the concentration of human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> in the plasma of patients with inflammatory bowel disease reflects the activity of their intestinal disease and suggest that serial measurements of human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> may be useful in the assessment and clinical management of these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Leucocyte proteinases, e. g. <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> and {{cathepsin}} G, are inhibited by heparin.

40|$|Immunoreactive <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> was {{measured}} in the serum of patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis. No evidence was found to demonstrate the release of this enzyme in the pulmonary circulation. However the average serum concentrations (573. 0 micrograms/l; SD +/- 261. 0) were higher (2 p less than 0. 001) in this group of patients than in age matched control subjects (355. 2 micrograms/l; SD +/- 274. 8). Further studies confirmed this finding but patients with other active lung diseases had similarly increased <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> concentration in the serum. This suggests that a raised serum <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> concentration is a feature of active lung diseases and not a feature of obstructive bronchitis alone...|$|E

In a case-control study of 111 ischemic stroke patients and 119 controls, significantly higher FgEDP levels were observed in cases than in controls, both in the acute phase and in the convalescent phase.

40|$|The {{mortality}} of acute lung injury and {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ALI/ARDS) remains high and efforts for prevention and treatments have shown little improvement over the past decades. The present study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of leukocytapheresis (LCAP) to partially eliminate peripheral neutrophils and attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced lung injury in dogs. A total of 24 healthy male mongrel dogs were enrolled and randomly divided into LPS, LCAP and LCAP-sham groups. All animals were injected with LPS to induce endotoxemia. The serum levels of <b>leucocytes,</b> neutrophil <b>elastase,</b> arterial blood gas, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p 65 in lung tissues were measured. The histopathology and parenchyma apoptosis of lung tissues were examined. We found that 7, 3, and 7 animals in the LPS, LCAP, and sham-LCAP groups, respectively, developed ALI 36 [*]h after LPS infusion. The levels of NF-κB p 65 in lung tissue, neutrophils and elastase in blood, decreased significantly following LCAP. LCAP also alleviated apoptosis, and NF-κB p 65 in lung tissues. Collectively, our results show that partial removal of leucocytes from peripheral blood decreases elastase level in serum.

40|$|The {{associations}} between cigarette smoking, plasma <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> concentration, peripheral leucocyte count and FEV 1 {{were examined in}} 148 men, 72 of whom were current cigarette smokers, 40 of whom were ex-smokers, and 36 who had never smoked. All men {{were part of a}} long-term survey. Smokers had significantly higher plasma <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> concentrations than ex-smokers or those who had never smoked. Mean current FEV 1 was lower, and the annual decline in FEV 1 in the preceding 10 years was faster in smokers than the other two groups. A few smokers had slight increases in serum C-reactive protein concentrations. Although peripheral blood leucocyte counts were higher in smokers than in non-smokers or ex-smokers, no association was found in any of the three groups of men between plasma elastase concentration and peripheral leucocyte count, nor between either of these two variables and annual decline in FEV 1 or current level of FEV 1. There was also no relation between plasma elastase concentration and reported daily cigarette consumption or mixed expired carbon monoxide in smokers. The results indicate that some male smokers have increased in vivo release of elastase from peripheral blood neutrophils {{at a time when there}} is no evidence of acute infection.

40|$|Aims To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} haemostatic and rheological factors and cardiovascular outcome in subjects with angina pectoris in the general population. Methods and Results Two hundred and seven men and women aged 55 - 74 had evidence of angina at baseline. Sixty-seven (32. 3 %) had a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event during follow-up. Median levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen and <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> {{were higher in the}} event group compared with the no event group (10. 0 ng. ml(- 1) vs 7. 2 ng. ml(- 1); P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001, and 40. 3 ng. ml(- 1) vs 31. 0 ng. ml(- 1); P less than or equal to 0. 01, respectively). Whole blood viscosity was also significantly higher in the event group than in the no event group (3. 80 mPa. s vs 3. 53 mPa. s; P less than or equal to 0. 05). After adjusting for age and sex, unit increases in both tissue plasminogen activator antigen and <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of a cardiovascular event. These associations remained after further adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and baseline myocardial infarction. The relative risks were 2. 07 (95 % CI, 1. 30 - 3. 45; P less than or equal to 0. 01) for tissue plasminogen activator antigen and 1. 95 (95 % CI, 1. 12 - 3. 50; P less than or equal to 0. 05) for <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase.</b> Conclusion Disturbed fibrinolysis and activation of leucocytes may be implicated in the development of thrombotic cardiovascular events in subjects with angina pectoris in the general population...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{with the}} beige {{mutation}} {{are known to}} be deficient for polymorphonuclear <b>leucocyte</b> (PMN) <b>elastase</b> and cathepsin G and can therefore be used as a model for protease dependence of tissue destruction in inflammatory conditions. The in vitro and in vivo effect of PMN activation on cartilage damage in C 57 black/ 6 normal and beige mice was measured. In vitro it was found that stimulation of normal PMNs with chemotactic peptide caused degradation of articular cartilage matrix owing to an elastase dependent mechanism; PMNs of beige mice did not induce degradation of cartilage. In vivo, using zymosan induced arthritis, which is a model characterised by a PMN-rich infiltrate and exudate, {{no significant differences were found}} between the two strains with respect to (a) joint oedema formation as measured by technetium- 99 m uptake; (b) matrix degradation as measured quantitatively and with histology; (c) chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis as measured by radiosulphate uptake. At day 28 after induction of arthritis, when inflammation is waning, no differences in end stage irreversible damage to joint tissues were found. The relevance of these observations to the supposed role of PMN derived neutral proteases in joint inflammation is discussed...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the inflammatory response in mild and in severe psoriasis, to evaluate the endogenous systems counterbalancing the deleterious effects of the inflammation products, and to establish values of prognostic significance. METHODS: The study was performed in a control group (n = 40) and in 60 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, half presenting with mild psoriasis, {{and the other half}} with severe psoriasis. We evaluated total and differential <b>leucocyte</b> count; <b>elastase,</b> lactoferrin and lipid peroxidation as markers of neutrophil activation; total plasma antioxidant capacity (TAS), transferrin, ceruloplasmin, alpha(1) -antitrypsin and alpha(2) -macroglobulin as markers of the endogenous antioxidant and antiprotease systems; and fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, C 3 and C 4 complement proteins as markers of inflammation. RESULTS: Our data suggested that psoriasis is an inflammatory condition in which neutrophils seem to play a crucial role by contributing to the development of oxidative and proteolytic stress. The worsening of the disease seemed to be linked to the enhancement of the inflammatory response and of the imbalance between neutrophil activation products and their inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: We propose values for elastase, CRP, elastase/alpha(2) -macroglobulin, elastase/alpha(1) -antitrypsin, thiobarbituric acid/TAS and elastase/neutrophil ratios with prognostic significance for the worsening of psoriasis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> in {{catalytic}} amounts {{was observed}} to rapidly cleave the Val- 10 -Gly- 11 bond {{of the human}} cysteine-proteinase inhibitor cystatin C at neutral pH. The resulting modified inhibitor had size and amino acid composition consistent with a cystatin C molecule devoid of the N-terminal Ser- 1 -Val- 10 decapeptide. Leucocyte-elastase-modified cystatin C had more than 240 -fold lower affinity than native cystatin C for papain. Removal of the N-terminal decapeptide of human cystatin C also decreased inhibition of human cathepsins B and L by three orders of magnitude, but decreased inhibition of cathepsin H by only 5 -fold. A tripeptidyldiazomethane analogue of of the N-terminal portion of cystatin C was a good inhibitor of cathepsins B and L but a poor inhibitor of cathepsin H. It therefore appears that amino acid side chains of the N-terminal segment of cystatin C bind in the substrate-binding pockets of cathepsins B and L but not in those of cathepsin H. It is argued that the N-terminal cystatin C interaction with cathepsin B is physiologically important and hence that <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> could have a function as a regulator of extracellular cysteine-proteinase inhibitory activity at sites of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Bronchial {{leucocyte}} {{proteinase inhibitor}} (BLPI) is an 11 000 Mr protein found in human mucous secretions. This inhibitor apparently controls the serine proteinases elastase and cathepsin G, released from extravascular polymorphonuclear leucocytes.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the effects of the}} {{mucolytic}} thiol agent mercapto-ethanesulphonate (mesna) on the activity of both polymorphonuclear <b>leucocyte</b> (PMN) <b>elastase</b> and antileucoprotease in vitro. In all tests a specific synthetic substrate was used to measure elastase activity, which was then related to enzyme activity in the absence of mesna. The relative elastase activity decreased to 67. 5 % of control values after the enzyme had been incubated in a 120 mmol/l mesna solution. In the sol phase of purulent sputum, elastase activity decreased to 45 % after the sol phase had been incubated in a 600 mmol/l mesna solution. The inability to reverse the inhibition of mesna by increasing the substrate concentration indicated that mesna acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of PMN elastase. Incubation of elastase with antileucoprotease reduced the relative elastase activity to 21 %. When antileucoprotease was preincubated in a 60 mmol/l mesna solution under identical assay conditions, a relative elastase activity of 39 % was observed. Inhibition experiments with mesna treated antileucoprotease, in which sulphydryl groups were blocked with iodoacetamide, strongly suggested that the dissociation constant (Ki) of the fraction of antileucoprotease that retains activity after the incubation with mesna was not changed. Elastase inhibitory activity in mucoid sol phase, which can be ascribed mainly to antileucoprotease, decreased to 53 % after incubation with mesna at a concentration of 960 mmol/l. Incubation of PMN elastase/antileucoprotease complex with mesna did not result in any release of active PMN elastase from the antileucoprotease. It is concluded that mesna and other thiol compounds, when locally administered, may influence the proteinase-antiproteinase balance in the airways by their effect on both PMN elastase and antileucoprotease...|$|R

Surprisingly, it was shown that in this model of arthritis, using methylated bovine serum albumin as an antigen, C 57 /black/ 6 'beige' mice (deficient for leucocyte neutral proteases) developed a more severe form of arthritis than the control mice ('black' mice), resulting in a higher degree of tissue damage. The incidence and degree of bone apposition and destruction of articular cartilage at day 21 after induction of arthritis were significantly higher in the beige mice. These findings could not be ascribed to differences in the cellular immune response to methylated bovine serum albumin. Autoradiographic detection of radiolabelled methylated bovine serum albumin suggested that more antigen is retained in the joints of beige mice than in black mice, which might account for the sustained arthritis and the concomitant tissue damage.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Airway inflammation, with {{recruitment}} of neutrophils to the airway lumen, results in purulent secretions {{and a variety}} of potential adverse consequences for patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. We hypothesised that gradations of sputum colour would correlate directly with the myeloperoxidase content of sputum and with various other indicators of the activity and consequences of bronchial diseases.  METHODS—To test this hypothesis, we quantified sputum colour by reference to a sensitive nine point colour chart and correlated this assessment with indices of a number of inflammatory mediators in sputum.  RESULTS—The results indicate that standardised visual measurements of sputum colour correlated strongly with myeloperoxidase, interleukin 8, <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> (both activity and total quantity), sputum volume, protein leak, and secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (p< 0. 001 for all). In addition, there was a strong direct correlation between <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> and both myeloperoxidase (p< 0. 003) and sputum volume (p< 0. 001), but a strong negative correlation with secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (p< 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—These results indicate that sputum colour graded visually relates to the activity of the underlying markers of bronchial inflammation. The results of this simple visual analysis of sputum provides guidance concerning underlying inflammation and its damaging potential. It also provides a useful scientific tool for improving the monitoring of chronic airways diseases and response to treatment. ...|$|E

It is revealed that in this pathology activation of the congenital and got immunity takes place; the congenital immunity activation degree (on LE activity) back correlates with severity of psychomotor development disorders, activity α 1 -PI directly correlates with a psychomotor development point of children, i. e. its lowered activity is the adverse diagnostic factor; joining of autoimmune reactions (increased rates of aAB to nerve tissue proteins) characterizes the heaviest variants of psychomotor development retardations.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{leucocyte}} filtration during cardiac surgery are conflicting.

Group I: leucofiltration of arterial blood throughout cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (associated with high-flow and pressure gradients), Group II: leucofiltration of a part of the venous return blood in the rewarming phase during CPB (associated with intermediate flow, but high pressure), Group III: leucofiltration of residual heart-lung machine blood during transfusion into the patient after CPB (associated with low flow and low pressure), Group IV. control group without leucofiltration. We measured circulating <b>leucocyte</b> counts, plasma <b>elastase</b> levels and arterial blood oxygenation. Filters were postoperatively examined using scanning electromnicroscopy (SEM).

The postoperative plasma elastase levels increased in Groups II and IV and decreased in Groups I and III.

We investigated the role of IL- 1 and IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) and its significance in the pathogenesis of LPS-arthritis. Production of IL- 1 beta peaked at 6 h (196. 7 +/- 89. 4 pg/joint) after injection of 10 ng of LPS, while IL- 1 Ra peaked at 9 h (34. 5 +/- 13. 4 ng/joint). The amount of IL- 1 Ra was 180 - 200 -fold molar excess of IL- 1, and {{a large amount of}} IL- 1 Ra was sustained for 1 week. Both IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 Ra were mainly produced by synovial exudate cells. Arthritis was reproduced by rabbit IL- 1 beta. LPS-induced leucocyte infiltration was inhibited 70 - 75 % by rabbit IL- 1 Ra. Loss of PG in LPS-arthritis was prevented by IL- 1 Ra and also by neutrophil elastase inhibitor, and superoxide dismutase. In leucopenic rabbits, injection of LPS induced neither production of IL- 1 beta nor loss of PG. Direct injection of inflammatory exudated cells in leucopenic rabbits reproduced loss of PG, and there was only a partial recovery by IL- 1 Ra. These results suggest that LPS-initiated IL- 1 acts as a key mediator in LPS-arthritis and that endogenous IL- 1 Ra may suppress a part of IL- 1 activity at the site, but its amount was too low for suppression of the produced IL- 1. Loss of PG is a sequela of infiltrated <b>leucocytes</b> and leucocyte-derived <b>elastase,</b> and superoxide anion may play a pivotal role in the destruction of cartilage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is {{a common}} chronic and {{recurrent}} inflammatory skin disorder. Oxygen metabolites and proteases released by activated inflammatory cells may induce oxidative and proteolytic damage to plasma constituents and red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs have a limited biosynthesis capacity and poor repair mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To study RBCs as a potential cumulative marker of oxidative and proteolytic stress in psoriasis, and as a marker of worsening of the disease. METHODS: The study was performed in 70 patients with mild or severe psoriasis and in 40 control individuals. We evaluated total and differential leucocyte count and, as markers of <b>leucocyte</b> activation, plasma <b>elastase</b> and lactoferrin. Besides the basic RBC study (RBC count, haematocrit, haemoglobin concentration and haematimetric indices) we evaluated antioxidant defences (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and selenium), osmotic fragility and reticulocyte count; in the RBC membrane we evaluated lipid peroxidation and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation, membrane fluidity, levels of cholesterol and phospholipids, membrane-bound haemoglobin, band 3 profile and levels of vitamin E; serum levels of bilirubin, total plasma antioxidant capacity, lipid profile and lipid peroxidation were also evaluated. RESULTS: Psoriasis patients showed a rise in leucocytes, mainly neutrophils, which {{was associated with a}} rise in elastase and lactoferrin. Patients had a reduced RBC count, antioxidant defences and membrane fluidity, elevated membrane lipid peroxidation, membrane-bound haemoglobin, osmotic fragility and reticulocyte count, and a different band 3 profile. Most of these modifications were enhanced in severe psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data show that the RBCs are at a lower number in psoriasis patients, and present several changes denoting an enhanced damage and/or ageing process, which seem to be strongly connected with neutrophil activation, oxidative stress and worsening of psoriasis...|$|R

Synthetic 15 mer peptides corresponding to the major autoantigenic region of CRT (amino acids 1 – 289), each one overlapping by 12 amino acids, were used to map the B cell epitopes on the CRT protein recognized by autoimmune sera. Major antigenic epitopes were found {{to be associated with the}} N-terminal half of the protein in 69 % of the SLE sera from active disease patients, while the C-domain was not antigenic. Major epitopes were found to be reactive with antibodies in sera from SLE patients with both active and inactive disease, spanning different regions of the N and P-domains. Sera from both healthy and disease controls and primary Sjögren's syndrome patients were non-reactive to these sequences. Limited proteolysis of CRT with two major <b>leucocyte</b> serine proteases, <b>elastase</b> and cathepsin G, demonstrated that an N-terminal region of CRT is resistant to digestion. Interestingly, some of the epitopes with the highest reactivity belong to the fragments of the protein which bind to C 1 q and inhibit complement activation. Whether C 1 q association with CRT is a pathological or protective interaction between these two proteins is currently under investigation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nitrosative stress {{takes place}} in endothelial cells (EC) during corneal acute graft rejection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential role of peroxynitrite on corneal EC death. METHODS: The effect of peroxynitrite was evaluated in vivo. Fifty, 250, and 500 microM in 1. 5 microL of the natural or denatured peroxynitrite in 50 microM NaOH, 50 microM NaOH alone, or balanced salt solution were injected into the anterior chamber of rat eyes (n= 3 /group). Corneal toxic signs after injection were assessed by slit-lamp, in vivo confocal imaging, pachymetry, and EC count. The effect of peroxynitrite was also evaluated on nitrotyrosine and <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> inhibitor/LDNase II immunohistochemistry. Human corneas were incubated with peroxynitrite and the effect on EC viability was evaluated. A specific inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (iNOS) was administered systemically in rats undergoing allogeneic corneal graft rejection and the effect on EC was evaluated by EC count. RESULTS: Rat eyes receiving as little as 50 microM peroxynitrite showed a specific dose-dependent toxicity on EC. We observed an intense nitrotyrosine staining of human and rat EC exposed to peroxynitrite associated with <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> inhibitor nuclear translocation, a noncaspase dependent apoptosis reaction. Specific inhibition of iNOS generation prevented EC death and enhanced EC survival of the grafted corneas. However, inhibition of iNOS did not have a significant influence on the incidence of graft rejection. CONCLUSION: Nitrosative stress during acute corneal graft rejection in rat eyes induces a noncaspase dependent apoptotic death in EC. Inhibition of nitric oxide production during the corneal graft rejection has protective effects on the corneal EC survival...|$|E
40|$|Single-chain urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (pro-uPA) {{is bound}} to a specific surface receptor on ovarian cancer HOC-I cells that is incompletely saturated. Saturation of uncovered receptors by uPA polypeptides with intact amino-terminal fragment (ATF) derived from pro-uPA by limited proteolysis (human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> [HLE] or V 8 protease) has been studied. HOC-I cells preferentially invaded reconstituted basement membranes in a time- and plasminogen-dependent manner. This process was inhibitable by preincubation with uPA polypeptides in the medium at levels which suggested that complete saturation of cell surface uPA receptors occurred. This result indicates that occupation of uPA receptors by enzymatically inactive uPA fragments or prevention of rebinding of pro-uPA synthesised by tumour cells to the receptors specifically reduces {{the invasion of the}} tumour cells through basement membranes in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Circulating {{concentrations}} of <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> were measured in 20 adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with a flat-sheet membrane oxygenator. Eight patients (group I) received the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (9 μg/kg/h), during CPB and 2 g methylprednisolone before CPB. Eight patients (group II) received methylprednisolone but not nifedipine infusion. Four patients (group III) received neither nifedipine nor methylprednisolone infusion. In all patients the bypass procedure {{was associated with}} elevation in elastase concentrations. Enzyme concentrations correlated with the duration of bypass (r = 0. 7, p< 0. 01). Comparison between groups fails to demonstrate any significant effect of nifedipine infusion or methylprednisolone on elastase release. This study demonstrates moderate elastase release during CPB with a flat-sheet membrane oxygenator and fails to confirm inhibition of elastase release by nifedipine infusion during CPB.

40|$|An {{inhibitor}} of the serine proteinases human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> (EC 3. 4. 21. 37), of cathepsin G (EC 3. 4. 21. 20) and of trypsin (EC 3. 4. 21. 4) {{has been}} purified from human articular cartilage. The apparent Mr of the cationic (pI greater than 10) protein {{was determined to}} 15, 000 by SDS/PAGE. It was shown to cross-react in Western blot with a specific antibody to a recombinant-derived serine-proteinase inhibitor of human mucous secretions. Identity of both inhibitors is indicated by {{the determination of the}} N-terminal amino acid sequence of the cartilage-derived serine-proteinase inhibitor. In all 24 residues the cartilage inhibitor was shown to be identical with the human secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor ('SLPI'). The inhibitor molecule may {{play a crucial role in}} the protection of cartilage matrix proteins against proteolytic attack...|$|E

The long-term goal is to determine general rules of binding specificity and to apply these rules to the design of novel or improved (more specific, more potent) inhibitors. By means of high-resolution X ray crystallography, the structure of native porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE, Acta Cryst. B, in press) has been refined to 1. 65 A resolution. It forms the basis for comparison with 12 high-resolution complexes of PPE. The homologous structure of human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> (EMBO Journal, 1987) 1 as been determined. These two enzyme struc-tures form a highly interesting pair for subsequent modelling studies. The variety o...|$|E
40|$|Antineutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCAs) {{constitute a}} new class of autoantibodies that seem to recognise myeloid lysosomal enzymes. The occurrence of ANCAs with specificity for human <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase</b> (HLE) was assessed in serum samples that were routinely submitted for ANCA determination. During a study period of more than six years anti-HLE was found in only six out of 1102 serum samples that produced a perinuclear or an atypical cytoplasmic staining pattern on ethanol fixed granulocytes. These six serum samples were from four patients with a clinical diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis but without a definite histological diagnosis, one patient with systemic vasculitis, and one patient with Cogan's syndrome. To further evaluate the prevalence of anti-HLE we tested 315 serum samples from patients with different forms of vasculitis and related disorders. Anti-HLE was detected in two patients only. Thus autoantibodies to HLE are rarely found in serum samples from patients with vasculitic or related disorders...|$|E
40|$|Human inter-alpha-trypsin {{inhibitor}} (I alpha I) is a plasma {{proteinase inhibitor}} active against cathepsin G, <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase,</b> trypsin and chymotrypsin. It owes its broad inhibitory specificity to tandem Kunitz-type inhibitory domains within an N-terminal region. Sequence {{studies suggest that}} the reactive-centre residues critical for inhibition are methionine and arginine. Reaction of I alpha I with the arginine-modifying reagent butane- 2, 3 -dione afforded partial loss of inhibitory activity against both cathepsin G and elastase but complete loss of activity against trypsin and chymotrypsin. Reaction of I alpha I with the methionine-modifying reagent cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) resulted in partial loss of activity against cathepsin G and elastase but did not affect inhibition of either trypsin or chymotrypsin. Employment of both reagents eliminated inhibition of cathepsin G and elastase. These findings suggest that both cathepsin G and elastase are inhibited at either of the reactive centres of I alpha I. Trypsin and chymotrypsin, however, appear to be inhibited exclusively at the arginine reactive centre...|$|E
40|$|Human myeloblastin (leucocyte proteinase 3) {{showed a}} very slow {{approach}} to the steady-state velocity when the pH was rapidly increased from 3. 2 to 7. 0. The kinetic mechanism of this hysteretic process was interpreted as a slow conformational change of myeloblastin from an inactive form at acidic pH to the active form at neutral pH. The transition between the two enzyme forms could occur spontaneously {{in the absence of}} substrates with a first-order rate constant of 0. 0033 s- 1. In the presence of peptide substrates activation occurred more rapidly: the observed rate constant was linearly dependent upon the substrate concentration and contained a contribution of the spontaneous {{as well as of the}} substrate-dependent process, whose second-order rate constant was characteristic of the particular substrate. This pH-dependent phenomenon of hysteresis on the part of myeloblastin, that is not manifested by the closely related <b>leucocyte</b> <b>elastase,</b> may have a physiological control function during phagocytosis by damping the rate of interconversion between enzymically inactive and active enzyme conformations...|$|E
