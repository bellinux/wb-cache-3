5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Lesser</b> <b>weever</b> fish, caught whilst beach fishing at Prestatyn, North Wales. Note {{the highly}} {{distinctive}} venomous dorsal spines (separated by almost-black-coloured skin) and dark-tipped tail ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>weever</b> fish {{occur in}} the eastern Atlantic from the North Sea around the British Isles to Morocco and Madeira, and in the Mediterranean. They are {{typically}} found resting on the bottom, partially buried with eyes and tip of first dorsal fin exposed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> {{grows up}} to 18 cm long, but {{generally}} less than 15 cm, with an elongated body. Its color {{can be described}} as greyish-brown on the back and silvery-white on the sides. It has no spines in front of its eyes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> (Echiichthys vipera) is a venomous weever of {{the family}} Trachinidae, in the order Perciformes, and the class Actinopterygii. It is {{generally}} found on the sandy sea beds of the open sea, near the shore. Lesser weevers may sting swimmers badly if disturbed in the water, and fishermen when they clean their fishing nets.|$|E
5000|$|Sea angling {{is popular}} in the coastal villages. At Borth-y-Gest, flounders, bass, mullet, whiting and {{mackerel}} can all be caught. Morfa Bychan produces bass, flounders, eels, whiting and the occasional turbot. [...] Bass, flounders and huge numbers of whiting are found at Black Rock Sands, along with thornback ray, mackerel and garfish. [...] Bass, flatfish, eels and some very large mullet can be caught in Porthmadog Harbour, right {{in the heart of}} the town, though care must be taken to avoid taking the poisonous <b>lesser</b> <b>weever.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most human stings are {{inflicted by}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>weever,</b> which habitually remains buried in sandy areas of shallow water {{and is thus}} more likely to {{come into contact with}} bathers than other species (such as the greater weever, which prefers deeper water); stings from other species are {{generally}} limited to anglers and commercial fishermen. Even very shallow water (sometimes little more than damp sand) may harbour lesser weevers. The vast majority of injuries occur to the foot and are the result of stepping on buried fish; other common sites of injury are the hands and buttocks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> can {{be found}} from the {{southern}} North Sea to the Mediterranean, and is common around the south coast of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Atlantic coast of France, Portugal and Spain, and the northern coast of the Mediterranean. The high number of bathers found on popular tourist beaches in these areas means stings are common, although individual chances of being stung are low. The South Wales Evening Post stated (on 8 August 2000) that around 40 weever stings are recorded in the Swansea and Gower area every year, but many victims do not seek medical assistance and go uncounted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> is {{littoral}} and benthic, {{living on}} sandy, muddy bottoms, {{ranging from a}} few meters deep to 150 m (in winter). Resting on the bottom, its position {{can be described as}} with eyes buried and the tip of the first dorsal fin exposed. Because of its venom and its occurrence near beaches, it is considered to be one of Europe's most dangerous weever species. The venom glands are located on its first dorsal fin, which is completely black, and on the gill cover. This species has the most potent toxin of all the weevers.|$|E
50|$|The glands {{producing}} T. draco’s venom {{are located}} in the derma of the fish. The venom glands are cased in connective tissue coated with a basal lamina which has a strength of 0.1 μm. The venom glands are built up of polygonal cells with a long axis length of 40-50 μm.These cells show a relatively heterogeneous cytoplasm with noticeable large vacuoles and heterogeneous granular (Verdiglione, Mammola, Gargano, & Montesi, 2003).As in the tissue of the <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> (Echiichthys vipera / Trachinus vipera) supporting cells can be found in T. draco which develop from epidermal cells. These supporting cells form pockets inside the venom glands which are filled with differentiated glandular cells. The supporting cells most probably {{play a role in the}} cohesiveness of the venom gland and in the regeneration of the glandular cells.|$|E
5000|$|The {{potentially}} {{lethal protein}} {{component in the}} crude venom of T. draco is a 105 kDa polypeptide which is called Dracotoxin. The crude venom of T. draco {{has been shown to}} have membrane depolarizing and haemolytic characteristics. Those characteristics could be retraced to said single protein component. The depolarisation effect however could not be explained by well-established approaches. Neither does the depolarisation effect take place through Na+ or K+-channels nor through Na+-K+-ATPase activity.⁠The weever sting is often followed by first ischemic and subsequently hyperemic effects in the tissue surrounding the sting. These effects might be related to the high concentrations of histamines and catecholamines found in the venom.⁠⁠⁠While Church & Hodgson (2002) suggest a cholinesterase activity of the toxin itself, Haavaldsen & Fonnum (1963) interpreted their finding of a high concentration of cholinesterase in the venom as a sign for a cholinergic mechanism in the production of the venom because cholinesterase activity hasn’t yet been described in the venoms of the animal kingdom.⁠ As Russel & Emery (1960) stated, the toxin extract of T. draco has a greyish colour but is clear in its appearance. It is said to have a “fishy taste” and “ammoniacal odor”. The pH value of the extract seems to be 6.78 and is with that slightly sour.⁠The toxin of the closely related <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> T. vipera has been shown to contain 5-Hydroxy-Triptamine also called Serotonin but in the toxin of T. draco this finding could not be confirmed⁠.⁠The toxicity of the venom was dependent on the way of extraction. The highest toxicity was measured in live fish which were shock frozen and laired in -70 °C-freezers. Under such conditions the minimal lethal dose for mice was 1.8 μg/g while at least 110 mg could be extracted from an average sized fish.⁠ ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the feeding {{behaviour}} of <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> (Echiichthys vipera) and dab (Limanda limanda) {{in and around the}} C-Power wind farm. To find out if the presence of wind farms is influencing the feeding behaviour of both demersal fish, stomach content analyses were performed for both demersal fish species originating from the wind farm and from a nearby control area. Results on stomach fullness, frequency of occurrence and numerical percentage of prey taxa, prey diversity and prey species composition are discussed. The fullness index and prey diversity of <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> was not affected by the presence of the wind farm. However, the diet composition did change: <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> consumed significantly more of the species Jassa herdmani - which is typically associated with hard substrates and highly available in the wind farm- in both the control and to a greater extent in the impact area. The fullness index of dab also displayed no significant differences. The prey diversity and the diet composition of dab however, were influenced by the presence of the wind farm. The ampipods Nototropis swammerdamei and J. herdmani and the tube-building polychaete Lanice conchilega were responsible for those differences. The latter species is a well-known ecosystemengineer with the potential to enhance habitat complexity and heterogeneity. Its presence might have led to a significant higher prey diversity in the wind farm and hence in the diet of dab. The differences in feeding behaviour between wind farm and control area can in part be related to the presence of the wind farm, its associated fauna and the expanding reef effect...|$|E
40|$|Background: Injury by {{the sting}} of <b>Lesser</b> <b>weever</b> fish (Trachinus vipera) may lead to severe pain, edema or tissue necrosis. Cellular effects of the venom are still incompletely understood. Previous {{observations}} revealed that purified <b>Lesser</b> <b>weever</b> fish venom (LWFV) induces suicidal death of erythrocytes and HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells. The present study addressed {{the effect of the}} venom on colon carcinoma cell toxicity, shape and migration both in p 53 +/+ and/or p 53 -/- conditions. Methods: Cells were exposed to medium without or with 500 µg/ ml LWFV. Cell shape, cell area and circularity were visualized and quantified by fluorescence microscopy. Cell volume, granularity and cells toxicity were assessed via the apoptotic parameters dissipation of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, phosphatidylserine surface exposure and cell membrane permeabilization were measured utilizing flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated using wound healing assay and two-dimensional migration assay. Results: LWFV treatment was followed by a marked change of cell shape and size, significant decrease of cell area and circularity, significant impairment of cell migration, as well as induction of apoptosis after long exposition. Conclusions: LWFV exposure leads to cell shrinkage, increased granularity, apoptosis and impairment of cell migration, effects presumably contributing to LWFV-induced tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|Do {{large-scale}} industrial fisheries for sandeels impact 'human consumption' fishes by depriving them of food? In the North Sea, most sandeel fishing {{takes place}} on the Dogger Bank during spring. Here, we studied sandeel-fishery and sandeel-predatory fish interactions in 2 sampling grids, focussing on (1) how localised sandeels are distributed during the day (when feeding pelagically) and at night (when buried in the seabed); (2) how precisely the fishery can target localised sandeel concentrations; and (3) how tightly day/night sandeel distributions {{are linked to the}} local abundance of predatory fishes and their sandeel consumption. Sandeel abundance differed widely between both grids. Within each grid, marked day/night differences in distributions indicated extensive diurnal migrations, with centres of gravity of day and night distributions up to 15 km apart. Fishing effort was tightly matched with sandeel populations during the day and was far higher in the 'high sandeel density' grid. Only at the finest scale examined, effort was concentrated at sandbanks but not significantly matched with local sandeel numbers. This suggested either insufficient knowledge among fishers or vessel maneuverability issues, possibly relating to high mobility of sandeels. Ten predatory fishes (8 'human consumption' species) preyed on sandeels, most notably whiting and <b>lesser</b> <b>weever.</b> Spatial comparisons showed that the predominant sandeel predators were whiting during the day and <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> at night. Tight predator-prey interdependencies were revealed: whiting and weever exhibited 'aggregative responses' to sandeels, and most predators consumed more sandeels in the 'high sandeel density' grid. On the Dogger Bank, sandeel fishing effort is concentrated when and where sandeels are most available, but also where these are extensively and locally preyed upon by at least 10 predatory fish species. Hence concerns that this industrial fishery may indirectly impact predatory fishes by depriving them of food might have some basis. © Inter-Research 2008...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMercury (Hg) in {{fish can}} present a {{potential}} risk to wildlife and human consumers. Mercury levels were determined in 12 fish species and 2 invertebrate species from the French {{coast of the}} Eastern English Channel collected in June and November 2012. Total mercury concentrations in the muscle tissues ranged between 0. 04 and 1. 63 µg g- 1 (d. w.). Dab and sandeel displayed a significant positive correlation between Hg concentrations and fish length. Seasonal differences in Hg concentrations were observed for dab and shrimp. The <b>lesser</b> <b>weever</b> showed significantly higher concentrations of Hg (0. 97 ± 0. 34 µg g- 1 d. w.) than all other species. Gobies and sprat, which had the smallest size, showed significantly lower concentrations than herring, whiting, pout and sardine. Among the considered species, flatfish such as dab, flounder, plaice and sole displayed intermediate levels of Hg. In the present study, the fish age expressed as specimen length {{seems to be one}} of the major factors governing Hg contents in muscle tissues. Finally, mercury concentrations in commercial fish from the Eastern English Channel were below the levels fixed by the European Union for total mercury in edible parts of fish products...|$|E
40|$|Lesser {{sandeels}} Ammodytes marinus are {{eaten by}} {{a range of}} predatory fishes including commercially fished species, but are also exploited at large scale by industrial fisheries. Is availability of sandeels, as key prey source, linked to the body condition of predatory fishes? In the North Sea, the largest sandeel biomass is concentrated in the Dogger Bank region. Here we studied predator-sandeel interactions at two sites differing widely in sandeel abundance and local sandeel fishing effort. Surveys took place in 2004, 2005, and 2006, years when local sandeel densities observed at these sites were low, intermediate, and high, respectively. Five predator species [...] whiting, <b>lesser</b> <b>weever,</b> grey gurnard, plaice, and haddock [...] showed better body condition indices in either the years or study area (or both) characterised by higher local sandeel densities, when compared to sandeel-poorer conditions. Moreover, whiting, weever, and gurnard condition was better for those individuals actually observed to have eaten sandeels (based on stomach contents) than for those that had not. As body condition relates to growth, reproduction, and survival, predators in sandeel-rich conditions may be inferred {{to have a higher}} fitness. These links between sandeel availability, sandeel consumption, and predator condition hint that, if large-scale localised depletions of sandeels were to occur, negative indirect effects on predatory fish might become apparent, underlining the importance of considering the sandeel fishery in an ecosystem context. © 2012 Crown Copyright...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the diet of six {{demersal}} and semi-pelagic fish species (dab, solenette, dragonet, <b>lesser</b> <b>weever,</b> whiting and horse mackerel) in the Thorntonbank wind farm and its surrounding areas. Stomach {{analyses were conducted to}} unravel changes in feeding patterns and to discriminate between effects of the presence of the turbines and effects as a result of fisheries displacement at the border of the wind farm concession area. Differences were observed between impact, fringe and reference stations. The fullness index indicated that fish had a fuller stomach close to the wind turbines and at the borders of the concession area. This might be an indication of a higher food availability around the wind turbines. The stomach content of dab revealed more amphipods and especially hard substratum species (e. g. Phtisica marina) in the impact area compared to the reference area. However, the most abundant hard substratum species present on the turbines (i. e. the amphipod Jassa herdmani and the crab Pisidia longicornis) were not found in any of the dab stomachs. This can probably be linked to the sampling distance (500 - 1500 m) or to the prey preferences of dab. In general, differences in feeding patterns between sampling stations were observed. Whether these differences originated from the wind turbine presence or from changes in fisheries activities can only be unequivocally confirmed by replication within and between the wind farm(s) and by an optimisation of the sampling strategy...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activity}} in the North Sea is increasing, involving more motorised cargo shipping, and rapidly expanding construction and operation of oil platforms and wind farms. Furthermore, the North Sea is used {{on a large scale}} for fisheries, military purposes and the extraction and suppletion of sand. Sand suppletion is used in the Netherlands to protect the beaches along the coast. In recent years, underwater sand levees or sand suppletion near shore has been performed for coastal protection. It has been suggested that new areas created as the result of sand suppletion offshore can create new opportunities for fish, because of an increase of the suitable habitat. In near future, major sand nourishments are planned at the Dutch coast of the Delfland area (‘zandmotor’). In order to study the effect on (mostly juvenile) fish and epifauna, a sampling strategy was designed to monitor the potentially affected species. The aim of this project is: to monitor the reference situation concerning fish and epifauna in the shallow coastal waters (2 - 7 m water depth); to monitor the reference situation concerning potential habitat for fish and epifauna in the shallow coastal waters (i. e. depth, grain size, water temperature, salinity, water visibility); and to link fish abundance to habitat characteristics. This report only gives a description of the field sampling during July 2011. The monitoring took place at four locations along the Dutch coast during three weeks in July. The first location, IJmuiden, was used to test the equipment. Fishing was planned for Vlugtenburg, Texel and Ameland. The sampling method focuses on the target species plaice, sole, turbot, brill, sprat, sandeel, <b>lesser</b> <b>weever,</b> sand gobies, pipefish and brown shrimp...|$|E
40|$|Samples of the {{demersal}} fish fauna {{have been collected}} by beam trawl from the coastal waters of northwest Europe (49 – 57 °N, 8 °W 9 °E) by the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, since 1990, during {{the third quarter of}} the year. Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Bight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limanda limanda were abundant. In the Channel and {{to the west of the}} UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially poor cod Trisopterus minutus, solenette Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the <b>lesser</b> <b>weever,</b> Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen flatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Flatfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes (< 30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two faunal types. The additional influence on demersal populations of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion. Without further information on the distribution of fishing effort, it is not possible to separate the influence of natural faunal changes between regions from that of artificial changes caused by fishing activity...|$|E
