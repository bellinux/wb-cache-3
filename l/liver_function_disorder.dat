30|$|Common {{symptoms}} and complications of IPNB are abdominal pain, <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorder,</b> jaundice, or fever {{caused by the}} bile duct obstruction due to hypersecretion of mucin or the tumor itself [6, 7]. We {{could not find a}} previous report of hemobilia caused by IPNB by searching MEDLINE using the English language. Sugawara et al. suggested that the risk of hemobilia from neoplasms depended on tumor size and histological type, especially in cases of soft and fragile papillary tumors [8]. Biliary cystic tumors are rare neoplasms occurring in the liver and, less frequently, the extrahepatic biliary system [2]. They account for less than 5 % of all reported cystic lesions of the liver [9].|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveEndovascular {{occlusion}} of the celiac artery can {{be performed}} along with occlusion of a celiac trunk aneurysm or stenting of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm to prevent a type II endoleak. Because only a few individual cases have been previously available for study, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the technical details, clinical course, and outcome of this procedure based on a group of patients. MethodsThis retrospective study included 10 patients who underwent endovascular occlusion of the celiac artery between 1998 and 2006 (female/male = 1 : 4, mean age, 62. 5 ± 9. 8 years). There were five aneurysms of the celiac artery, two cases each of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and dissecting thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, and one mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the aorta. The mean follow-up period was 21. 4 ± 29. 1 months. ResultsThe celiac artery was successfully occluded in all cases, along with exclusion of the celiac artery aneurysm or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, respectively. The pancreaticoduodenal arteries were the main collateral pathways, but other anastomoses and, especially, vascular variations of the celiac artery and its territory were also significant. In one patient, abdominal angina was treated by percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the superior mesenteric artery. ConclusionsEndovascular occlusion of the celiac artery is both safe and feasible. Some vascular variations may make occlusion of the celiac trunk impossible. <b>Liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorder</b> is a relative contraindication for this procedure...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of traditional Chinese medical syndrome (TCM syndrome) of hepatocirrhosis. Methods Clinical information from the four diagnosis methods of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and related laboratorial indexes were systematically collected from 223 hepatocirrhosis cases, and the multi-statistical methods including systematic cluster analysis, principal component analysis, stepwise discrimination and variance analysis were made with the software SAS 6. 11. Results Multi-analysis showed that there were 3 categories of syndrome characteristics. Type 1 (134 cases) : damp heat, blood stasis, deficiency of liver and spleen Qi; Type 2 (62 cases) : deficiency of both Qi and Yin with severe deficiency of Qi, heat with severe dampness, blood stasis; Type 3 (27 cases) : deficiency of both Qi and Yin with severe deficiency of Yin, stasis and heat or dampness. Analysis of the changes of the related laboratorial indexes among {{the three types of}} syndrome showed that Type 1 mainly manifested asthenia syndrome with sthenia syndrome, and its indexes of AST、ALT、GGT levels were markedly higher than those of Type 2 and Type 3, both of which mainly showed sthenia syndrome with asthenia syndrome, and that Type 3 was in active inflammation, deficiency of both Qi and Yin (deficiency of Yin > deficiency of Qi), and its FN、Alb、FⅤ、FⅦ、PLT、PCT levels were obviously reduced. Conclusion The multi-statistical methods can reveal the characteristics and regularity of TCM syndrome of hepatocirrhosis, and the 3 categories of syndrome characteristics basically conform to clinical manifestations. The result of TCM syndrome distribution and laboratorial indexes infer that damp heat is the pathological basis of hepatocirrhosis, and the degree of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorder</b> and liver damage may be the pathological basis of deficiency of Yin of both liver and kidney...|$|E
30|$|Fatty liver is {{a general}} sign during the {{transition}} period of dairy cows. Several steps were taken to reduce this syndrome, rumen protected choline supplementation {{is one of the}} best steps to export hepatic fat by lipoprotein pathway and improved performance of dairy cows (Zom et al. 2011; Ardalan et al. 2011; Elek et al. 2013). Choline has significant effects on general function of animal body particularly on the immunity of liver cells. During calving, hormonal variations and negative energy balance during transition or following early lactation are significant condition of higher liver uptake of NEFA which cause overload on the liver to metabolize the esterified fatty acids (Goselink et al. 2012). Feeding ration containing deficient ratio of both Cho and Met leads to decrease of vitamin C or α or γ tocopherol production which causes infection of epithelium, degeneration of muscle and damage of hepatic tissue with decrease of VLDL hepatic transportation (Henning et al. 1997). The amount of dietary fat or cholesterol affect the production of NEFA during stress condition which mobilized into hepatic cells through lipoprotein termed as chylomicrons pathway; then these fats or cholesterol wrapped named as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and carried to liver through blood stream, but VLDL assembly or secretion from hepatic cell need phosphatidylcholine (Noga and Vance 2003). If phosphatidylcholine is not in abundant amount, the impaired VLDL secretion will start and accumulation of fat or cholesterol in hepatic cells will start and then fatty liver condition will develop, finally liver cells undergo steatosis and cirrhosis (Noga et al. 2002). Although concentration of foliate significantly increases demand of Cho derivative and Bet; if the ration is deficient in dietary foliate and Cho, the de novo synthesis also does not maintain body requirement of choline. Conversely, VLDL, Bet or Met balance undergoes stress and liver performance will go down (Noga et al. 2002). Choline deficiency showed atherosclerosis sign or <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorder</b> and increase the quantity of liver enzyme alanine amino transferase (MIC 2017). In addition, its deficiency elevates the homocysteine level and raise the risk of dystocia or retained placenta, low fetus weight and promote inflammation of hepatic cells or cause lipid metabolism disorder, increase oxidative stress or reactive oxygen species (Zeisel and Da Costa 2009; Sun et al. 2016). Most species showed fatty liver syndrome due to dietary Cho deficiency, which is developed due to deposition of fat or triacylglycerol which decrease phosphatidylcholine, conversely, VLDL synthesis or secretion will go in termination pathway (Jiang et al. 2014). Transition period of dairy ruminants categorized as low or high fatty liver period (Bobe et al. 2004), supplementation of RPC decline deposition of triacylglycerol and increase genes expression which involved in VLDL mobilization (Zom et al. 2011). More recent studies reported that, basic bovine hepatocytes improve VLDL transportation when incubated with Cho chloride (Goselink et al. 2013).|$|E

Tocilizumab has a long plasma half-life, so it can be administered intravenously biweekly or monthly. Phase I and II clinical trials showed that tocilizumab (2, 4, 5, 8 or 10 mg/kg) reduced disease activity significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Tocilizumab not only improved signs and symptoms, but also normalized inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, and reversed joint damage of RA. The efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of RA was at least as good as methotrexate. Tocilizumab was generally safe and well tolerated. Some adverse events such as significant rises in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorders,</b> decreases in white blood cell counts, diarrhoea and infection were observed. In summary, preliminary clinical results suggest that tocilizumab is effective and generally well tolerated in the treatment of IL- 6 -related inflammatory autoimmune diseases.

The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the relationship between the level of plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1)  and indices of the functional state of the liver in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its combination with diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 types depending on the trophological status. Materials and methods. It were examined 90 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its combination with type 2 diabetes mellitus – with normal body weight and obesity, as well as 20 healthy individuals. The study was carried out using the following methods: clinical, laboratory and instrumental (including liver biopsy). Results. It was inverse the relationship between the level of IGF- 1, and the level of AST, ALT, AST/ALT, total and conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase in groups of patients with comorbid disorder. There was established the significant decrease of plasma level of IGF- 1, and also impairment of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> indices in all groups in comparison with the controls, and most pronounced changes in patients with comorbid disorders and obesity.

40|$|AIM: In 2001, a {{multidisciplinary}} intestinal rehabilitation program, {{prompted by a}} nationwide collaboration on intestinal failure (Dutch Registry for Intestinal Failure and Intestinal Transplantation), was started for children who have short bowel syndrome (SBS). This study evaluates this program, focusing on children who have SBS after extensive bowel resection. DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. METHOD: Demographic data, general information on disease status, and outcome of intestinal rehabilitation of patients treated between 2001 and 2009 were collected. Outcome measures were intestinal autonomy, intestinal and/or liver transplantation, and survival. RESULTS: Ten boys and 9 girls, median gestational age 36 weeks, were treated. Eight were referred, 3 {{times as many as}} in the period 1991 - 2000. Causes of SBS were intestinal atresia (3), gastroschisis (2), volvulus (9), necrotising enterocolitis (3), and strangulation (2). The median remaining small-intestinal length was 35 cm (range, 10 to 70 cm). In 14 patients the ileocecal valve was still present. In all patients at least 25 % of colon was still present. The median follow-up was 25 months (range, 50 days to 9 years). After a median of 138 days (range, 41 days to 11 years) on total parenteral nutrition, 16 patients (84 %) reached intestinal autonomy. Central venous catheter-related complications occurred in all; there were <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorders</b> in 68 %, and a failure to thrive in 26 %. One patient underwent intestinal lengthening. No patient needed intestinal transplantation, but one underwent liver transplantation for intestinal failure-associated liver disease.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of clinical data and cross sectional study relating <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> and coagulation profile to time since surgery, in 28 surviving patients after the modified Fontan procedure. PATIENTS: 20 patients (71 %) with atriopulmonary anastomosis, seven (25 %) with atrioventricular anastomosis, and one (4 %) with total cavopulmonary connection. Follow up ranged from 2. 0 to 21. 8 years (mean 11. 1). RESULTS: Abnormal <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests, mainly reflecting cholestasis, were present in 21 patients who had a significantly longer follow up (p < 0. 01). Protein synthesis was normal in almost all patients. Coagulation profile showed abnormalities in 22 patients. "Procoagulant" abnormalities-that is, decreased plasminogen and protein C activity-were found in 11 and five patients, respectively. The extent of these abnormalities was less {{in patients with}} a longer follow up. Anticoagulant abnormalities were factor V deficiency in 16 patients and factor VII deficiency in 17, resulting in a prolonged prothrombin time in 19 patients. Thirteen patients had both pro- and anticoagulant abnormalities. A prethrombotic state was present in five patients, with a significantly longer mean time interval since surgery (p = 0. 05).

40|$|Background/Aim. During choledocholitiasis {{inflammatory}} oxidant stress {{involves the}} promotion of mitochondrial dysfunction through an intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes leading mainly to necrosis and less to apoptosis. The product of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA), is extremely cytotoxic and damages cell membranes and intracellular macromolecules. The toxicity of MDA is based {{on its ability to}} act as a mutagenic agent in a cell. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study was to establish correlation of the parameters of inflammation and biochemical markers of cholestasis with the intensity of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods. Seventy adult subjects of either sex included in the study were devided into two groups: I - 40 patients with obstructive icterus caused by choledocholithiasis, and II - 30 healthy individuals. All the participants were subjected to a clinical, laboratory and ultrasonic check-up at the Internal Department of the Military Hospital in Niš. The parameters of oxidative stress: MDA, a measure of lipid peroxidation, and inflammation parameters: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, albumins, number of leukocytes (Leu), granulocytes (Gr), lymphocytes (Ly) and monocytes (Mo) and biochemical markers of cholestasis: activity of γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzymes, the level of total, direct and indirect bilirubin were determined by standard biochemical methods. Results. Lower values of albumin (p < 0. 001), and significantly higher values of fibrinogen (p < 0. 05) and CRP (p < 0. 001) were found in the blood of the patients with cholestasis due to choledocholithiasis in relation to the controls. Significantly higher values of Leu (p < 0. 01) and Gr (p < 0. 001) with decreasing number of Ly (p < 0. 001) and Mo (p < 0. 001) were found in blood of the patients with cholestasis due to choledocholithiasis in relation to the control. Similarly, higher values of γ-GT, and AP (p < 0. 001), as well as the level of total, direct and indirect bilirubin (p < 0. 001) were found in blood of the patients with cholestasis due to choledocholithiasis in relation to the controls. The concentration of MDA (p < 0. 001) was increased in the patients with choledocholithiasis in relation to the controls. There was a significant positive linear correlation of the number of leukocytes (r = 0. 51, p < 0. 05) and the concentration of total (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 01), direct (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 01) and indirect (r = 0. 88, p < 0. 01) bilirubin with the concentration of MDA in the group of patients with choledocholithiasis. Conclusion. Neutrophils and the levels of total, direct and indirect bilirubin have a significant positive linear correlation with the level of lipid peroxidation in patients with choledocholithiasis. Neutrophilia and hiperbilirubinemia observed in this way represent important parameters in estimating the level of liver tissue damage in choledocholithiasis...|$|R

Correlation to qualitative clinical parameters such as portal hypertension was driven by the liver-to-spleen ratio rather than functional liver volume.|$|R

Mean serum prednisolone concentration after oral prednisone decreased with impaired <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> estimated by galactose elimination capacity (r = 0. 64, P less than 0. 03).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work existed in the first-time {{elevation}} of the kinetics of bendamustine and his effective metabolics in the plasma and toxicity under conditions of limited <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> The investigations were led to 12 patients (5 men, 7 women) with respectable tumors and normal <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> and 13 patients (11 men, 2 women) with advanced HCC and limited <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> Bendamustine became tins of 120 mg / m² bendamustinhydrochlorid on two successive days (patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> of the numbers 1 - 5 received on the day 2 of the gift a dose diminished on 80 mg / m²) {{in the form of}} a 30 -minute continuous intravenous drip given. The elimination of bendamustine of plasma is found delayed to patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> in comparison to patients with the norm of suitable <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> Also the education of both phases I-metabolics γ-Hydroxy-bendamustin and N-Desmethyl-bendamustin is delayed and found to a lower magnitude. The clinical compatibility turned out very good with the complete absence of degree to 4 -toxicity and the appearance of a total of only three provable degrees 3 -toxicity (oral dryness, feeling of sickness / vomiting, fever). The mildly clinical toxicity was not found differently between both patient's groups. The behaviour of the <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> parameters as well as PTT, Quick is found not changed after gift by bendamustine to patient with normal as well as limited <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> Bendamustine leads to a light, nevertheless secure decrease of haemoglobine, leucocytes and granulocytes with increasing study duration to patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> The depression of the lymphocytes is trained early already after 8 days at most, amounts in this measuring time to patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> to decreases on average about 80 % and is stronger coined in the 4 -week observation phase after bendamustine to patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> than to patient with the <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> corresponding to the norm. Taking into account all upraised parameters it is found in half-quantitative analysis securely stronger toxicity to patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> in comparison to patients with not affected <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> On the basis of the upraised data to kinetics and toxicity of bendamustine, a reduction of the dose of bendamustine is recommended to patient with limited <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> in the magnitude by bilirubine up to 3 mg / DLs (51 µ mol/l) around up to 40 %...|$|R

40|$|Interferon β- 1 a is {{a widely}} used {{immunomodulation}} treatment for multiple sclerosis. <b>Liver</b> <b>function</b> impairment is a common side effect and usually develops in the first 6 months after interferon use.

30|$|To {{accurately}} estimate <b>liver</b> <b>function,</b> {{some recent}} reports have indicated {{the utility of}} 99 mTc-GSA SPECT/CT fusion examination [18 – 21]. Additionally, 99 mTc-GSA SPECT/CT fusion imaging is also useful for cases associated with PVE [19]. In this case, we had estimated the remnant <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> using 99 mTc-GSA SPECT/CT fusion imaging at three times: on admission, after 2  weeks of PTCD, and after 2 more weeks following PVE. The <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> rate calculated by 99 mTc-GSA SPECT/CT fusion imaging was lower than the liver volume rate indicated by CT volumetry in the left liver, which had been damaged because of bile congestion (function vs. volume, 26.2 vs. 33.8  %). On the other hand, 2  weeks after PVE, the <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> rate was higher than the liver volume rate in the left <b>liver</b> (<b>function</b> vs. volume, 54.5 vs. 49.6  %). The increase of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> {{was significantly higher than}} that of the volume (function vs. volume, 28.3 vs. 15.8  %). Beppu et al. suggested that the true post-PVE <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> is possibly underestimated by traditional CT volumetry [19]. Similarly, the variation of <b>function</b> in the <b>liver</b> that has been damaged rapidly but not yet atrophied may not parallel changes in liver volume, as in this case. The present case indicates that CT volumetry may reveal overestimation of the liver with rapid dysfunction and underestimation of the liver with compensatory swelling. Preoperative underestimation of future remnant <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> after PVE may not increase the risk of postoperative morbidity; however, overestimation can lead to life-threatening PHLF. To estimate the remnant <b>liver</b> <b>function,</b> 99 mTc-GSA SPECT/CT fusion imaging may be more accurate than K-ICG test, especially in case of heterogeneous <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> such as ours. Conventionally in Japan, major hepatectomy, such as right or extended right hemihepatectomy and trisectionectomy, is allowed in patients with normal <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> (total bilirubin and ICG-R 15 are in the normal range) [13, 15]. Thus, we assessed that hepatectomy up to 60  % of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> rate, as a cutoff value, can be justified adequately in this case in accordance with it. Accumulation of cases in which the <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> associated with PVE is estimated by this useful modality is required.|$|R

30|$|This {{case series}} is {{obviously}} limited by patient number, caused by preliminary {{closure of the}} TRACE study in our hospital.

Definition and validation of thresholds for safe treatment should be based on clinical data. Large studies should answer questions with regard to the minimal acceptable remaining <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> and the numeric relation between the absorbed dose to the functional liver parenchyma and the decline in <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> posttreatment.|$|R
30|$|Survival {{analysis}} revealed that TLF was associated with overall survival after adjusting for CTP class or ALBI grade. Following independent validation of this preliminary finding, TLF may {{be considered as a}} candidate imaging biomarker that complements traditional <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> classification systems, particularly in cases of discordant findings. These results support further investigation on the incorporation of complementary volumetric functional imaging into HCC risk stratification models, which would enable quantification of global <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> and characterization of spatial heterogeneity in <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> The latter is indicated in settings where prior liver-directed therapies may have compromised regions of <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> Such <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> imaging parameters may become essential for targeted liver therapy planning of external beam radiotherapy, radioembolization, chemoembolization, and surgical resection.|$|R

40|$|Patients {{who had a}} biliary-enteric {{anastomosis}} {{often have}} elevated <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether elevated <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests are associated with recurrent episodes of cholangitis. Thirty-two patients, who received a biliary-enteric anatomosis for benign biliary disease were evaluated. Follow-up consisted of the patient's history, physical examination, determination of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests, ultrasonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy using 99 mTc-HIDA. Median duration of follow-up was 45 months (range: 1 - 192) and <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests were elevated in 22 patients (69 %) at some time during follow-up. Dilated intrahepatic ducts were found in 3 of 30 patients (10 %), all of whom had elevated <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests at follow-up. Delayed passage from the liver was observed using scintigraphy in 10 (31 %) of the patients. Seven patients (22 %) experienced one episode of cholangitis and none experienced more than one episode. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex was an independent risk factor for elevated <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests (odds ratio: 10. 9; P < 0. 05). For cholangitis, no risk factors could be identified. It is concluded that elevated <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests are relatively common after a biliary-enteric anastomosis for benign biliary tract disease and are not predictive of the occurrence of cholangitis. We, therefore, recommend omitting routine laboratory screening for elevated <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> tests in the follow-up of a biliary-enteric anastomosi...|$|R
40|$|<b>Liver</b> <b>function</b> of the {{patients}} with renal cell carcinoma was investigated on 65 cases experienced during Jan. 1963 to March 1975. <b>Liver</b> <b>function</b> was estimated by serum alkaline phosphatase, GOT, GPT, gamma-GTP, bilirubin, prothrombin time and α 2 -globulin. <b>Liver</b> <b>function</b> {{was considered to be}} impaired whenever three of above parameters showed abnormal value. Six of 65 (9. 2 %) had impaired <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> In none of them metastasis to the liver was found at the time of surgery. Hematuria was noted in three of six, pain in three, mass in five, pyrexia in five and varicocele in three. High percentage of varicocele may suggest that the cause of liver dysfunction might be tumor invasion from the renal vein to the van a cava or compression over the vena cava or hepatic circulation by tumor. Removed kidneys of six cases weighed 420 to 1000 g (average 690 g), being relatively larger than usual. Histologically, 5 was clear cell type, and one was mixed cell type. Biopsy study of the liver was made in two cases. One showed marked fatty degeneration, and another moderate fatty degeneration, hepatocellular necrosis and cellular infiltration.
