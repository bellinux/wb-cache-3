5|$|As {{a fishing}} port, Calais has several notable fishing markets {{including}} Les Délices de la Mer and Huîtrière Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, {{the latter of}} which is noted for its oysters, <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> crabs from Brittany. The Emile Fournier et Fils market on the Rue Mouron sells mainly smoked fish including salmon, trout, herring and halibut.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E
50|$|Platykotta is characterised by a broad, {{triangular}} sternum, {{unlike the}} very narrow sternum seen in Astacidea (true <b>lobsters</b> <b>and</b> freshwater crayfish) and Glypheoidea. A similar sternal form {{is seen in}} the spiny <b>lobsters</b> <b>and</b> slipper <b>lobsters,</b> <b>and</b> also several families of Anomura, including Galatheidae <b>and</b> Chirostylidae (squat <b>lobsters),</b> <b>and</b> Aeglidae. Unlike other anomurans, however, the carapace is considerably longer than wide. The pattern of grooves on the carapace indicates clear affinities with the Anomura.|$|R

5|$|In late 1986, {{questions}} were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in Lobster. Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, brought up {{the issue in the}} House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer the matter to the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in <b>Lobster</b> <b>and</b> prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer the matter to the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland {{took off}} with <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday at Le Touquet, France. He made a detour with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the cliffs of Dover, he spotted a group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The actual result was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident at Le Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Today, Twillingate's economy {{revolves}} primarily around {{careers in}} construction, logging and the tertiary sector, which involves {{providing services to}} the community. Because of the cod moratorium in 1992, fishing is not practiced {{as much in the}} area, though some fishermen still catch crab, <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> other aquatic species. The seal hunt is practiced in Twillingate.|$|E
25|$|Lobster recipes include <b>lobster</b> Newberg <b>and</b> <b>lobster</b> Thermidor. Lobster {{is used in}} soup, bisque, <b>lobster</b> rolls, <b>and</b> cappon magro. <b>Lobster</b> meat may be {{dipped in}} {{clarified}} butter, resulting in a heightened flavour.|$|R

25|$|Many of {{the first}} European colonists of New England had a {{maritime}} orientation toward whaling (first noted about 1650) and fishing, in addition to farming. New England has developed a distinct cuisine, dialect, architecture, and government.

25|$|Marine biota in {{the region}} have representatives of both the Indian and Pacific oceans which were caught in the Caribbean before the {{emergence}} of the Isthmus of Panama four million years ago. In the Caribbean Sea there are around 1,000 documented species of fish, including sharks (bull shark, tiger shark, silky shark and Caribbean reef shark), flying fish, giant oceanic manta ray, angel fish, spotfin butterflyfish, parrotfish, Atlantic Goliath grouper, tarpon and moray eels. Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> sardines (off the coast of Yucatán Peninsula).|$|E
25|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} fishery by value is American <b>lobster</b> <b>and</b> Atlantic sea scallop. The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, {{there are nearly}} 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this species of fish had recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, blue crabs, and clam fisheries. These fisheries are pretty much fully exploited.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} make the New England economy unique. The region is distant from the {{geographic}} center of the country, and is a relatively small region, and relatively densely populated. It historically {{has been an important}} center of industrial manufacturing and a supplier of natural resource products, such as granite, <b>lobster,</b> <b>and</b> codfish. New England exports food products, ranging from fish to lobster, cranberries, Maine potatoes, and maple syrup. The service industry is important, including tourism, education, financial and insurance services, plus architectural, building, and construction services. The U.S. Department of Commerce has called the New England economy a microcosm for the entire U.S. economy.|$|E
