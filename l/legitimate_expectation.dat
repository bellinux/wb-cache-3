5|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedural}} {{dimension of}} the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the substantive form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

In contrast, notwithstanding their acceptance and protection in the UK, substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> have not been universally recognized. For instance, they have been given effect in Singapore but not in Australia.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> plays a {{significant}} role in international investment law. Although {{it is only in the}} past roughly fifteen years that the concept has come to the spotlight, its importance and utilization is on the rise. Generally speaking, the concept of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations,</b> under certain conditions, allows a foreign investor to claim compensation in situations where the conduct of a host State creates a <b>legitimate</b> and reasonable <b>expectation</b> that the investor may rely on such conduct, and consequently the host State fails to fulfill those expectations, causing damages to the investor. However, the concept of protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> has stirred up debates as to the legitimacy of its use in investment law and raised concerns due to its imprecise boundaries and excessively extensive interpretation. Accordingly, it is the goal of this thesis to either confirm or refute two main propositions. The first proposition suggests that the principle of protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is an established principle of investment law with traceable origins in both domestic law and general international law. The examination of the first proposition addresses theoretical roots of the concept of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> justifying its application in investment law together [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation.</b> It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5|$|As {{regards the}} first question, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine whether a}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has been created.

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
40|$|The {{central issue}} in this book is the Europeanization of the {{principle}} of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in the context of European administrative law and of the growth of a European ius commune. First, an overview is given of the European principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> and the equivalent principles in the Netherlands, France and Belgium. Second, the application of the European principles, its spill-over effects {{and its impact on the}} principles of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in these national legal orders are examined. The principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is one of the many European general principles of law that are applicable whenever a case falls within the scope of European law. The content of the European principle and the criteria for its successful application are described. The principle is applicable in different situations and these are described on the basis of case law (f. ex. transitional measures, revocation). The same procedure is followed regarding the principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> or equivalent in the Netherlands, France and Belgium. The European principle is stricter than the principles in the Member States because of the severe criterion of a prudent trader and the absolute prohibition of contra legem application. There is a clear influence of the European principle in the situation of the direct application of European law (cases that are fully Europeanized) where authorities and judges have to apply the European principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> A national principle that offers broader legal protection can only be applied in cases that are not fully Europeanized (indirect application), as long as it falls within the confines of the European conditions of effectiveness and equivalence (and whereby the European principle is the minimum-standard). The area where the relation and tension between the European and national principles is an important issue is the area of European subsidies and state aid. The Netherlands had to give up a part of the legal protection that it offered on the ground of the national principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> (possible contra legem application, less severe conditions compared with the European requirement of a prudent trader and more protection for expectations in the context of subsidies). In France, the possible recognition of a national principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is within reach under the influence of the European principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> In Belgium, the influence of the European principle is negligible. In general, Belgian administrative law should pay more attention to Union law and the principle of European <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in particular. In all three Member States national judges must apply the European principle more often in fully Europeanized cases. In the long term, a common principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is possible. This ius commune process can be stimulated by means of a more in-depth study {{of the principle of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> (or equivalent) and the Europeanization of this principle in all the EU Member States in a common frame of reference...|$|R

5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation.</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{an unfortunate}} but {{unavoidable}} feature of even well-ordered democratic societies that governmental administrative agencies often create <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> (procedural or substantive) {{on the part}} of non-governmental agents (individual citizens, groups, businesses, organizations, institutions, and instrumentalities) but find themselves unable to fulfil those expectations for reasons of justice, the public interest, severe financial constraints, and sometimes harsh political realities. How governmental administrative agencies, operating on behalf of society, handle the creation and frustration of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> implicates a whole host of values that we have reason to care about, including under non-ideal conditions-not least justice, fairness, autonomy, the rule of law, responsible uses of power, credible commitments, reliance interests, security of expectations, stability, democracy, parliamentary supremacy, and legitimate authority. This book develops a new theory of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> for public administration drawing on normative arguments from political and legal theory. Brown begins by offering a new account of the legitimacy of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> He argues that it is the very responsibility of governmental administrative agencies for creating expectations that ought to ground legitimacy, as opposed to the justice or the legitimate authority of those agencies and expectations. He also clarifies some of the main ways in which agencies can be responsible for creating expectations. Moreover, he argues that governmental administrative agencies should be held liable for losses they directly cause by creating and then frustrating <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> {{on the part of}} non-governmental agents and, if liable, have an obligation to make adequate compensation payments in respect of those losses...|$|R

This is an Open Access article {{distributed}} {{under the}} terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial NonDerivatives Unported License 3. 0 (CC BY-NC-ND 3. 0) [URL] paper attempts a critical examination of the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in relation to non-violation complaints with a view to underlining its doctrinal significance for developing countries to justify the use of TRIPS flexibilities, such as compulsory licences, for public health considerations. Consequently, the author briefly traces some failed promises during the negotiation of TRIPS, and argues that the principle of good faith interpretation under World Trade Organisation law is more supportive of the contention that developing countries, which are generally the ones faced with complex public health issues require as a matter of fairness, greater flexibility to use compulsory licences in order to obtain affordable medicines to protect their <b>legitimate</b> public health <b>expectations.</b> This argument rests on the presumption that TRIPS allows for the substantive protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> based on the balance of rights and obligations, and presently the agreement overly protects patents on essential medicines.

5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E
25|$|The {{courts of}} the United Kingdom have {{recognized}} both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations.

In determining a claim for an alleged breach of a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation,</b> a court will deliberate over three key considerations: (1) whether a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has arisen; (2) {{whether it would be}} unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation; and (3) if it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person.|$|E
