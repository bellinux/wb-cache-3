5|$|Alabama {{continued}} their scoring {{into the third}} quarter with touchdowns on their first two possessions of the half. The first came on a 38-yard McCarron pass to Amari Cooper on a drive that also saw McCarron complete a pass to his brother Corey McCarron. The second came on a 31-yard Chris Black run that made the score 42–0. With the Crimson Tide significantly up, mostly back-up players completed the fourth quarter. After a <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> stalled at the Mocs' 23-yard line, Eddie Jackson returned a C. J. Board fumble caused by Jonathan Allen to the Chattanooga six-yard line. On the next play, Dee Hart made the final score 49–0 with his six-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 12–0.|$|E
5|$|Maryland next {{traveled}} to South Carolina {{to face a}} team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap a <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted it away and the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered a Maryland fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed {{them back to the}} 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards the final result was 24–6.|$|E

5|$|The Midshipmen {{began the}} second quarter with a two-play, 30-second drive that ended with a 61-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Polanco to receiver Corey Dryden, increasing the team's lead to 21–7. The Lobos responded with a rushing touchdown from running back Rodney Ferguson, but kicker Wes Zunker's extra point attempt was no good, making the score 21–13. Midshipmen kicker Geoff Blumenfeld added a 27-yard field goal to bring the score to 24–13. McKamey scored another rushing touchdown to cap off another <b>long</b> <b>drive,</b> this time taking up over five minutes of game time, but the team's two-point conversion attempt failed. Lane Jackson intercepted McKamey's pass on the Lobos final drive before half-time, ending {{the first half of}} the game with a score of 24–19 in favor of the Midshipmen.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began at}} 1:35p.m. PST in rainy {{conditions}} that had affected the San Francisco Bay Area for {{days before the}} contest. The Lobos scored a touchdown on the game's first drive to take an early lead, but the Midshipmen scored three touchdowns to bring the score to 21–7 {{early in the second}} quarter. After the Lobos narrowed that lead to 12 points {{by the end of the}} third quarter, the Midshipmen began a <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> which took up much of the fourth quarter. The drive ended with a field goal, which gave Navy a 15-point lead with a little over two minutes remaining in the game. On the next drive from the Lobos, the Midshipmen forced a turnover on downs and ran out the clock with their last possession to win the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{the teams}} traded punts {{to open the}} second half, Derrick Henry made the score 31–24 with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} run for the only points scored in the third quarter. Oklahoma next scored on their opening possession of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard Knight touchdown pass to Shepard that capped an eight-play drive. Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron that cut the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, the Sooners closed {{the game with a}} <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that ran down the clock and in the final minute, an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31.

5|$|In {{the second}} half, however, Cincinnati's offense managed to begin moving the ball effectively. On Cincinnati’s first {{play of the}} second half, halfback Roger Stephens broke through the Virginia Tech {{defensive}} line for 26 yards, taking the ball inside Virginia Tech territory. Cincinnati's drive would overcome two 15-yard penalties and one five-yard penalty {{en route to a}} touchdown just a few plays later. On its next possession, Cincinnati's All-American Roger Stephens again broke off another long run, this time for 19 yards, setting up another Bearcats' touchdown. Virginia Tech countered with a <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that reached the Cincinnati 23-yard line before an errant pass was intercepted by the Bearcats in the end zone. Virginia Tech managed a defensive stop, however, and marched down the field for a touchdown to climb within six points. Cincinnati sealed its victory, however, when Bearcats' halfback Harold Johnson intercepted a Virginia Tech pass late in the fourth quarter, returning {{it all the way to}} the Virginia Tech 25-yard line. That return set up a Cincinnati touchdown and put the Bearcats up by the game's final score, 18–6.|$|E

5|$|A {{victory against}} Los Angeles in the twelfth {{week of the}} season {{preserved}} Cleveland's undefeated record. The Dons began the scoring in the first quarter with a 75-yard drive engineered by quarterback Glenn Dobbs. The series ended with a short touchdown run by halfback Walt Clay. The Browns came back to tie the game in the second quarter after a 71-yard drive that features several completions from Graham to Lavelli. Lavelli caught a 49-yard pass from Graham for the score. On the next possession, Los Angeles converted a fourth down deep in their own territory, extending a <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that ended with another touchdown by Clay. Cleveland again evened the score with under two minutes left in the first half on a touchdown pass to Edgar Jones. The Browns pulled away in the third quarter, when Graham ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. Groza later kicked a 36-yard field goal, and an interception by Cliff Lewis set up a run by Tony Adamle for a final touchdown. The final score was 31–14. Graham twisted his knee in the fourth quarter, and Edgar Jones, Parseghian and Bob Gaudio also had injuries. The Browns planned to stay at the hot springs in Boyes, California to recover as they prepared to face the 49ers for a second time in San Francisco three days later.|$|E

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old Collier {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 74–33–2 record. Nick Skorich was named as his replacement the following year. Skorich came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, when the team won the championship. In Cleveland's first year under Skorich, the team improved to 9–5 but lost to the Colts in a divisional playoff. Mike Phipps was promoted to starting quarterback over Nelsen before the 1972 season. After a sluggish start, the Browns went on tear and finished with a 10–4 record. That put Cleveland in a playoff against the undefeated Miami Dolphins. The Browns took a lead in the fourth quarter on a touchdown catch by wide receiver Fair Hooker, but the Dolphins responded with a <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> of their own, aided by a pair of Paul Warfield receptions. Running back Jim Kiick ran for a touchdown, sealing a 20–14 win and preserving the Dolphins' perfect season. The following year, Phipps threw 20 interceptions and completed less than half of his passes. After winning four of the first six games, the Browns slumped and placed third in the division with a 7–5–2 record.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{ended their}} regular {{season with a}} win over the Dodgers and an undefeated record. The Browns began the game by scoring 31 {{unanswered}} points. The first score came on a short Dub Jones run that followed an 80-yard drive in the first quarter. The next score came on a 76-yard drive in the second quarter. After a pair of passes and a 14-yard run by Edgar Jones, Graham completed a long touchdown pass to Lavelli, who sped away from defender Monk Gafford on the right sideline. Graham engineered another <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> just {{before the end of}} the first half, completing 18- and 20-yard passes to Speedie. The 90-yard march ended with a short touchdown run by Graham, giving Cleveland a 21–0 advantage at the half. Groza kicked a field goal at the beginning of the third quarter, and a fumble by Gafford on the ensuing kickoff led to a touchdown pass from Graham to Gillom, putting the Browns up by 31 points. With a comfortable lead, Brown took out his starters and substituted third-string players. The Dodgers proceeded to score three touchdowns, two of which came on long passes from Bob Chappuis, but the Browns won the game 31–21. The win left the Browns on top of the standings in the AAFC's Western Division ahead of San Francisco, which had lost only two games, both to the Browns. The perfect regular season record was the first in professional football since 1942, when the National Football League's Chicago Bears won all of their games. Chicago, however, lost the NFL championship that year.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, {{and on their}} first play from scrimmage, featured six offensive linemen (albeit unsuccessfully, as Bill Belton rushed for a one-yard loss), before driving down the field on a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with Belton rushing for a five-yard touchdown; he carried the load on the drive, rushing the ball eight times for 36 yards. Penn State would never relinquish that lead. Purdue subsequently went three-and-out, and Penn State responded with another <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> (10 plays, 66 yards) that again culminated with a rushing touchdown, this time from Zach Zwinak on a one-yard run, his tenth touchdown of the season, becoming the 16th Penn State player to eclipse 10, and the first since 2008, when both Evan Royster and Daryll Clark did. Purdue's ensuing drive ended {{in the second quarter}} when quarterback Danny Etling threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Justin Sinz, making the score 14–7 Penn State. Bill Belton lost a fumble on Penn State's next drive, but Purdue turned the ball over right back to Penn State when Jordan Lucas intercepted an Etling pass. Zwinak rushed for his second one-yard touchdown of the game on the ensuing possession. The Nittany Lions scored once more in the first half, via an eight-yard pass from Christian Hackenberg to Adam Breneman, but on the ensuing kickoff, Purdue's Raheem Mostert scored a touchdown on a 100-yard return, thus ending the first half with a score of 28–14, Penn State holding the advantage. Purdue came out of halftime with a vengeance, driving down the field for 84-yards, ultimately pulling within 7 points on an 11-yard rush by Etling. The first field goal of the game occurred on Penn State's subsequent drive, a 29-yarder from Sam Ficken putting the Nittany Lions ahead 31–21. The Boilermakers turned the ball over again on their next drive, and Penn State capitalized when Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game. Purdue turned the ball over on downs their final drive of the third quarter, though Hackenberg threw an interception giving Purdue an opportunity early in the fourth quarter; again, a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition, and Penn State went up 45–21 when Hackenberg rushed for a 4-yard touchdown to culminate an 11-play, 74-yard drive that encapsulated over a third of the fourth quarter, and ended with 4:27 to play. That would be the final scoring drive of the game, which Penn State won by the aforementioned score, 45–21.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers {{won their}} first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back Ricky Bell {{recorded}} 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Bell's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record, tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII, while the Eagles' Wilbert Montgomery {{was held to}} 35 yards on 12 attempts. The Buccaneers' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown, and a Neil O'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10–0 lead. Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4-yard line and led to Bell's second touchdown run, giving the Buccaneers a 17–0 second-quarter lead. Trying to extend that lead before halftime, Doug Williams hurried a pass that {{wound up in the}} hands of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11-yard line. This set up Ron Jaworski's touchdown pass to Charles Smith. After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17–10 on a Tony Franklin field goal, a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles' rally. A 9-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers' scoring. It was only in the final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together a <b>long</b> <b>drive,</b> ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael. The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game. The Buccaneers' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery. At one point, when Leroy Harris was gang-tackled following a short reception, the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing. The Buccaneers' hard-hitting play intimidated the Eagles' receivers into dropping 10 passes. Going into the matchup, the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience. Jaworski was the third-rated quarterback in the NFC, while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks. The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals, McKay of USC and Dick Vermeil of UCLA. The game was the Buccaneers' first on national television. Word of the upset spread as far as Iran, where the hostages were surprised to learn of the Buccaneers' contention for the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Before the Barnsley and Shepley Lane Head Turnpike was built, {{this small}} hamlet was {{situated}} on the packhorse route from Penistone to Huddersfield.
