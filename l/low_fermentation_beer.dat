The highest yields obtained after 90 hour fermentation. Total viable counts, total spores and percent of spores were different between the four strains. The by product whey ultrafiltrate was utilized in spore crystal mixture recovery from the <b>fermentation</b> <b>beer</b> of the tested strains. Adjusted <b>fermentation</b> <b>beer</b> to pH 7. 0 and pH 4. 0 prior recovery showed the advantage in spore an crystal mixture recovered yield when the <b>fermentation</b> <b>beer</b> was adjusted to pH. 4. 0 Comparison between lactose solution and whey ultrafiltrate contained the same amount of lactose for spores-crystals mixture recovery from <b>fermentation</b> <b>beers</b> showed increases in the yield where in whey ultrafiltrate was employed. Bioassay against the larvae of Spodoptera littoralis, Spodoptera exigua Phthorimaea operculella and Earias insulana were performed. The LC 50, slopes, 95 % confidence limits and potencies for both two spore-crystal mixtures obtained by lactose solution or whey ultrafiltrate of the four strains were determined. The bioassay showed that the larvae of potato tuber moth and spin boll worms were highly sensitive to the four produced pathogen than S. littoralis and S. eixigua. The spore-crystal mixture recovered in the presence of whey ultrafiltrate showed high toxic effect against the assayed larvae of S. exigua, E. insulana and S. littoralis, whereas, the recovered spore-crystal mixture in the presence of lactose solution was more toxic for P. operculella...|$|R

Only 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone and dihydrodehydro-β-ionone have been described previously in the literature.

AFB 1 and the fungi that produce it can also contaminate the raw materials used for beer and wine manufacture, such as corn and grapes.

40|$|In a {{bioethanol}} {{production plant}} the separation unit performs {{the recovery of}} the ethanol from the raw <b>fermentation</b> <b>beer</b> to produce high purity ethanol. Although different separation techniques are available, distillation or distillation combined with other unit operations, remains the main technology considered for the ethanol purification. The formation of a homogeneous minimum-boiling azeotrope limits the purity allowable employing a simple distillation unit. The classical configuration for the separation of an ethanol-water mixture by extractive distillation employs three columns: the pre-concentrator, the extractive column and a stripping section. Starting from this configuration, new separation sequences are obtained applying the thermal coupling principle. Then, the column sections were rearranged taking into account the limits imposed by the recycle streams. The new arrangements were simulated considering a typical broth composition and ethylene glycol as a solvent. The new sequences report capital and energy cost reductions compared to the classical separation sequence proposed in the literature...|$|R
