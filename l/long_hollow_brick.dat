40|$|Waste tire rubber is a {{promising}} lightweight aggregate for building products that enhances their thermal and acoustic properties. Even {{the environmental benefits}} of its use are evident, higher cost and significant changes in compressive strength and workability hinder its widespread adoption. This article examines the use of crumb rubber (CR) as aggregate in dry-mix mortars to produce rubberized <b>long</b> <b>hollow</b> blocks and <b>bricks</b> using automated brick machines. CR was incorporated over a range of 10 - 40 % with water/ cement ratio varying from 0. 7 to 0. 9. The production of rubberized bricks exhibited better performance than <b>long</b> <b>hollow</b> blocks in factory trials. Tests showed important deformations and drastic reduction in compressive strength, especially for crumb rubber percentages greater than 20 %. Due to this and {{the high cost of}} CR, caution must be taken with the design of new rubberized building products {{to make sure they are}} profitable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Interlocking <b>Hollow</b> <b>Brick</b> System (IHBS) was {{recently}} {{used in the}} construction of load bearing beam and walls. The concepts behind an IHBS include the elimination of the mortar layer. The interlocking brick system investigated in this study was a load bearing brick system relied on U-shaped <b>hollow</b> <b>bricks</b> in the bed row and hollow voids in the beam that allowed the addition of reinforced concrete grout stiffeners in vertical and horizontal directions to enhance the stability and integrity of the beams. Both Normal Concrete (NC) and Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) were and concrete, grout, and mortar used as infill material. Generally, in this research, twelve specimens are prepared for full scale testing with different parameters. The size of <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> was 250 mm x 1250 x 100 and the number of rebar was 12 mm diameter. The dimensions of beam make with <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> and horizontal and vertical rebar was 3000 mm length, 125 mm width, and 300 mm height. It was found that addition of super plasticizer in beam with SCC performed better under flexural loading than NC. This behavior also allows the concrete to have a more homogeneous mix, resulting to better bonding between bricks, grout, and steel reinforcement. Different arrangement of <b>hollow</b> interlocking <b>brick</b> in bed row causes a very ductile behavior because of the horizontal reinforcement surrounded by concrete between two layers of <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> which it has better interaction among the rebar, brick, and grout...|$|R

40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} <b>hollow</b> <b>bricks</b> filled with insulation material were systematically investigated {{in a joint}} research project by the University of Applied Sciences in Stuttgart and the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics. The findings showed that the acoustic performance of filled bricks differs only slightly from that of non-filled bricks. The main difference is greater inner damping and a resulting increase in sound insulation of about 1 to 2 dB compared to non-filled bricks of the same type. Based {{on the results of}} the investigation a modified procedure for the loss factor correction of the sound insulation of vertically perforated <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> masonry was developed, which applies equally to filled as well as non-filled bricks...|$|R

Military engineer Ambrosio Garcés de Marcilla designed the factory on the basis of an English machine that he saw at the 1851 London universal exhibition, intended to mould the newly introduced <b>hollow</b> <b>bricks</b> as well as other more traditional building materials. He was also the promoter and main partner of the company established in 1852 and later provided the factory with another machine that he claimed to have invented to mould solid bricks by compressing the clay soil directly instead of the mud made with it.

5000|$|The Lucius and Maria Clinton Lane House, {{also known}} as the Carrie Lane Chapman Catt Family Home, is a {{historic}} building located west of Charles City, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. [...] The 1½-story, Late Victorian <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> structure was built in 1866 by Lucius Lane. The west wing may predate the rest of the house, being the log cabin that existed on the property when Lane bought it. [...] When building this house, it is possible that Lane was influenced by A. J.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> internal partitions {{is one of}} the most widely reported nonstructural damage after an earthquake, especially in the European area. Full-scale experimental tests on standard <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> partitions are described in the paper. In particular, bidirectional shaking table tests are performed in order to investigate the seismic performance of <b>hollow</b> <b>brick</b> partitions, subjecting the partition simultaneously to interstorey relative displacements in their own plane and accelerations in the out of plane direction. A steel test frame is properly defined in order to simulate the seismic effects at a generic building storey. A set of five couples of accelerograms are selected matching the target response spectrum provided by the U. S. code for nonstructural components in order to investigate a wide range of seismic input. Three damage states are considered in this study and correlated to an engineering demand parameter, i. e. the interstorey drift ratio, through the use of a damage scheme. The tested specimen exhibits significant damage for 0. 3 % interstorey drift and extensive damage for drift close to 1 %. The correlation between the dynamic characteristics of the test setup, in terms of damping ratio and natural frequency, and the recorded damage is shown...|$|R
