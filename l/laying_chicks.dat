40|$|Two {{thousand}} 1 -day-old layer chicks {{were used}} in the study from Lohman Brown, Isa Brown, Lohman White and Bowans White breeds. The chicks were placed in the at 3 cage densities (211. 8, 274. 5 and 370. 6 cm 2 per bird) and on 3 positions (as top, middle and bottom tiers). All birds were kept under standard management policy and a commercial vaccination program was practiced. Total specific antibody titres to Infectious Brochitis Virus (IBV), Infectious Bursal Desease Virus (IBDV), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Egg Drop Syndrome Virus (EDSV) vaccines at the ages of 5, 10 and 20 weeks were serologically determined by ELISA. Cellmediated immune response was also evaluated. In commercial white egg laying strains specific antibody titres to IBV, IBDV, NDV and EDSV vaccines were greater than in Brown egg layer strains. Keeping in cage created more stress in Brown egg <b>laying</b> <b>chicks</b> than those in white egg <b>laying</b> <b>chicks.</b> As cage density increased, the ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L ratio) slightly increased. Cage position had no influence on the titres of antibodies to IBV and IBDV vaccines but the position of cage in pullets where chicks were stocked, from top to bottom, NDV and EDSV antibody titre decreased and percentage of heterophils, H/L ratio and basophil rates were low. These findings suggest that cage-related stress could be decreased, resistance to diseases and finally well-being of hens may be improved if hens are kept under proper position and density within cage systems with respect to their physiological and behavioral characteristics that controlled by genes...|$|E

Annual median laying dates ranged from 14 to 25 April, and median hatching dates from 11 to 28 May Sites differed in laying dates but not in hatching dates. Daily survival rate of nests was positively correlated to nest age and was affected by year and by the interaction of year and site, but not by laying date. The number of eggs hatching per successful nest also did not depend on <b>laying</b> date. Maximum <b>chick</b> survival (maximum estimate of the number of chicks fledged divided by the number of chicks hatched from the nest) and the probability of raising at least one chick to fledging declined significantly with hatching date, resulting in a decline of reproductive output with <b>laying</b> date.

Duration of rainfall during the chick-raising period did not affect chick survival.

40|$|Cognitive {{processes}} include biases, such as cognitive judgment bias. Cognitive judgment bias influences how {{the surrounding}} is interpreted, {{and this can}} differ between individuals. However, thus far no formal framework exists to understand how cognitive judgment bias works. Here I investigated how environmental factors and personality influence cognitive judgment bias in Gallus gallus chicks. First I investigated how two environmental factors affected the cognitive judgment bias of <b>laying</b> hen <b>chicks.</b> Chicks were exposed to stress and/or environmental enrichment, and tested in a cognitive judgment bias test before and after collective unpredictable stressors were presented. The results showed that chicks living in enriched environments were faster to reach all cues after the collective stressors than chicks living in non-enriched environments. Individual differences are often observed in animals, even when raised under identical conditions; therefore I also investigated if variation in personality influence cognitive judgment bias. Red junglefowl chicks were thereby raised in equal environments and exposed to personality assays {{in addition to a}} cognitive judgment bias test. I demonstrated that less nervous chicks were more optimistic towards ambiguous and negative cues than more nervous chicks. Also previous studies have found indications of connections between cognitive bias and environment or personality. I conclude that environmental enrichment can buffer the influence of stress on cognitive judgment bias and that personality has a small influence on interpretations of stimuli. In the future, experiments in this field should focus on exploring more aspects on how cognitive biases occurs to improve our understanding of cognitive processes...|$|R

In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of the Salmonella Typhimurium strain Nal 2 /Rif 9 /Rtt, a strain contained in the commercially available live vaccines AviPro Salmonella Duo and AviPro Salmonella VacT, against infection with the emerging monophasic variant in poultry. Three independent trials were conducted.

40|$|Mechanisms of brood {{reduction}} {{were studied}} in Fiordland crested penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) on Open Bay Islands from July through October 1989. I quantified behavioural and environmental causes of egg and chick loss {{at the time}} of laying, during incubation, and after hatching to evaluate hypotheses advanced to explain the unique patterns of hatching asynchrony and egg dimorphism in eudyptid penguins. Although first eggs experienced lower survival than second eggs and most losses occurred during the laying interval, aggression between adult penguins did not appear to contribute to egg loss at any time. Similarly, egg mortality was not influenced by the effects of nest crowding or cover, or by the degree of intraclutch egg dimorphism. Egg temperatures were measured throughout the incubation period with thermocouples implanted in preserved eggs. Recorded temperatures increased markedly after the laying of the second natural egg, but did not differ between eggs of different sizes within a nest. First eggs were not consistently incubated in the anterior nest position and that position did not confer a thermal disadvantage. However, first eggs hatched later than second eggs. Retarded brood patch development may contribute to lower egg temperatures during the <b>laying</b> interval. <b>Chicks</b> from larger, second-laid eggs were larger at hatching, and grew more rapidly than their siblings. Overt aggression between feeding chicks was not observed and begging and feeding rates appeared to be similar. Nonetheless, large chicks experienced higher survival to the creche stage. Intra-clutch egg dimorphism was negatively correlated with the number of days two chicks survived in the same nest, but there was no relationship between survival and hatching asynchrony...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{acknowledged}} as an emerging threat for top-order marine predators, yet obtaining evidence of impacts is often difficult. In south-eastern Australia, a marine global warming hotspot, {{evidence suggests that}} climate change will profoundly affect pinnipeds and seabirds. Long-term data series are available to assess some species 2 ̆ 7 responses to climate. Researchers have measured a variety of chronological and population variables, such as <b>laying</b> dates, <b>chick</b> or pup production, colony-specific abundance and breeding success. Here, we consider the challenges in accurately assessing trends in marine predator data, using long-term data series that were originally collected for other purposes, and how these may be driven by environmental change and variability. In the past, many studies of temporal changes and environmental drivers used linear analyses and we demonstrate the (theoretical) relationship between the magnitude of a trend, its variability, and the duration of a data series required to detect a linear trend. However, species may respond to environmental change in a nonlinear manner and, based on analysis of time-series from south-eastern Australia, {{it appears that the}} assumptions of a linear model are often violated, particularly for measures of population size. The commonly measured demographic variables exhibit different degrees of variation, which influences the ability to detect climate signals. Due to their generally lower year-to-year variability, we illustrate that monitoring of variables such as mass and breeding chronology should allow detection of temporal trends earlier in a monitoring programme than observations of breeding success and population size. Thus, establishing temporal changes with respect to climate change from a monitoring programme over a relatively short time period requires careful a priori choice of biological variables. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

We used infra-red video recordings to perform all-occurrences sampling of locomotive behavioural and perching events that occurred on the ground—where bedding material, food and water were provided, in the air, and on elevated horizontal and inclined surfaces within weekly 30 -min sampling periods. Chicks preferred level ground {{during the first week of}} life compared to weeks 5 – 9 (P< 0. 0001) and performed 52 % of all behavioural events in this section. Elevated surface use began at 2 weeks of age and increased over time (P= 0. 003), where most behaviour was performed in S 2 (45 % of all events). Chicks preferred horizontal to inclined surfaces, which were used from weeks 2 – 5 with maximum use occurring during weeks 2 and 3. Lohmann LSL chicks used the space above the ground most frequently (P= 0. 05) and performed more aerial ascent/descent behaviour than other lines (P< 0. 0001). Overall activity levels declined with age (P< 0. 0001). In summary layer chicks almost exclusively locomoted on the ground but utilized elevated horizontal surfaces (perch, first platform) as early as 2 weeks.

To evaluate improvement of adaptability, effects of climatic and hygienic stress on performance, humoral immune competence, and endocrine responsiveness were investigated in hens with early life experience to the stressors and hens only exposed to the stressors in later life. Early life heat exposure did not affect performance, immune, and endocrine parameters.

Our data suggest that early life heat stress exposure did not affect adaptability of laying hens to heat stress in later life.

In the absence of a suitable pecking substrate, chicks may redirect their pecking behaviour to other birds, which possibly increases the risk of developing feather-pecking behaviour. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether housing on wood-shavings (WS treatment; n = 15 groups) as compared to housing on chicken wire (CW treatment; n = 15 groups) between day 1 - 20 could reduce feather pecking in adult birds. After day 20, all chickens were allowed wood-shavings as litter. Behavioural observations showed that CW chicks performed significantly less ground-pecking behaviour compared with WS chicks up to day 20. More CW chicks showed gentle feather pecking at day 7 and 14 as compared to WS chicks, and more CW chicks pecked at the feeder or drinker than WS chicks up to day 20. CW chicks showed rebound behaviour: the day after they were introduced to wood-shavings they displayed more ground-pecking behaviour compared to the WS chicks. Later on in the rearing period no noticeable differences between treatments were found in frequency of gentle and severe feather-pecking bouts. During laying, more gentle feather-pecking bouts were observed in CW than in WS groups but no differences in severe feather-pecking bouts were observed, nor in feather damage at the end of the trial. The results indicate that hens can display substantial flexibility in their pecking behaviour and that, despite more gentle feather pecking in CW hens in laying, the absence of substrate in early rearing does not increase the risk of developing severe feather-pecking behaviour when adult...|$|R

We manipulated the natural brood sex ratio and placed one male chick in direct competition with one female chick while concurrently controlling for differences in age, size and <b>laying</b> order.

Female chicks tended to be more alert when the parents returned to the nest and were more persistent in gull-typical begging displays. Females were more likely to get the first food item, but they did not get more food, possibly due to a size-mediated dominance over the non-monopolizable regurgitated food. Thus, it is unlikely that sex differences in competitiveness significantly contribute to male-biased mortality in black-headed gulls. The previously reported male-biased mortality is more likely due to a disadvantage of a higher food demand and a higher sensitivity towards low egg quality, as has been shown in previous studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Fearfulness of an {{individual}} can affect its sensitivity to stress, {{while at the same}} time the social situation in which an animal lives can affect its fear level. It is however unknown what the long-term effects of high fearfulness on sensitivity to stress are, on individual or group level in laying hens. We hypothesize that increased fearfulness at a young age results in increased sensitivity to stress at an adult age, and that this relation can differ between groups, due to differences in group composition. Therefore, we studied the relation between fearfulness in an Open Field (OF) test at six weeks of age and plasma-corticosterone (CORT) levels after a 5 -min Manual Restraint test (MR) at 33 weeks of age, and assessed behavior in the home pen. We used birds from a low mortality line, selected for four generations on low mortality due to feather pecking and cannibalism and a control line (n= 153 in total, eight pens/line). These lines are known to differ in fearfulness and stress physiology. Chicks from the low mortality line were more active in the OF compared to chicks from the control line. Chicks that showed a fearful response (no walking, no vocalizing) in the OF test had higher CORT at 33 weeks of age than chicks that walked and/or vocalized in the OF test and had higher activity in the home pen as adults. On group level, a passive response in the OF was related to high CORT levels after MR. Presence of at least one fearful bird in a group led to higher CORT in the other group mates compared to birds from groups with no fearful birds present. Birds from groups in which more than 50 % of birds had severe comb lesions had higher CORT levels compared to birds from groups with less than 50 % of birds affected. High fearfulness of <b>laying</b> hen <b>chicks</b> can on individual level have a long-term effect on stress sensitivity. The presence of fearful birds in a group as well as signs of social instability in a group, indicated by comb lesions, can affect sensitivity to stress of birds from the same group. The mechanism by which this occurs can lie in social transmission of (fear related) behavior, but this suggestion needs further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The breeding, egg <b>laying,</b> incubation, <b>chick</b> {{survival}} {{and growth of}} emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) were studied in a farmed population. Eggs were laid every 3 - 5 days between May to October with a peak in July. Birds laid in vegetation, or where absent, near fence lines or by artificial shelters. Clutch size was highly variable (range: 2 - 45) between individuals, and between seasons, and variability increased with {{the age of the}} hen. The fate of 578 artificially incubated eggs were recorded. Fertility levels were high (90 %) but hatching success was lower. Embryonic mortality was greatest during the first trimester with a second smaller peak at the end of incubation. 434 chicks hatched, representing 68 % of all eggs set and 83 % of fertile eggs. Weight loss for the entire incubation period was 12. 5 % and was not correlated with embryo mortality. X-ray and ultrasound equipment were unsuccessful in determining egg fertility. Natural incubation was studied in two emu nests. Egg temperatures averaging 34. 1 °C and 31. 7 °C were lower and more variable than those used in artificial incubators. Eggs hatched after 51 - 54 days. In one nest, deserted eggs cooled to 12. 2 °C hatched when incubated artificially. Rates of egg turning varied, and two thirds of all egg turns were 90 ° or less, and only 12 % were turned between 158. 5 ° - 202. 5 °. Water loss during incubation was 10 % of the initial egg weight and was greatest at the end of incubation. Males lost up to 30 % of body weight during incubation. Survival, sex ratios and growth rates were determined for emu chicks hatching from 637 artificially incubated New Zealand eggs, and 105 eggs imported from Canada for incubation under class 1 quarantine conditions. Survival rates to three months were high (88 %). Mortality due to hatch-related problems was restricted to the first week of rearing, and to weeks 8 - 12 when bone deformities became evident. Sex ratios were 50 : 50. The chicks lost weight after hatching but thereafter grew exponentially. There {{was no significant difference between}} male and female hatch weights, or rates of growth, but females grew faster and were heavier up to 18 months. Most birds that grew significantly slower from three weeks of age died within three months. The genetic identity and development of twin emu was described. DNA analysis indicated the twins were identical...|$|R
40|$|A paralytic leg {{disorder}} {{which affects}} chicks, and {{that appears to}} be different in cause and effect from rickets, hock joint dis-ease (slipped tendon) or "crazy chicks " has recently been re-ported by Norris, Heuser and Wilgus 1. This paralytic disorder first came to our attention in the fall of 1928, while studying the comparative efficiency of certain meat and fish by-products for growing chicks. It made its appearance in two lots only {{at the end of the}} third week. The leg trouble was entirely distinct in its symptoms from leg weakness, due to a mineral or vitamin D deficiency. In general they resembled those described by Nor-ris and associates 1. The affected birds could use their legs only with great diffi-culty, and generally walked upon their hocks. Their toes curled inwardly and frequently the birds walked upon the distal end of the tarso-metatarsus. In a few apparently more advanced cases the <b>chicks</b> <b>lay</b> upon the floor with legs extended in opposite di-rections. The leg muscles appeared to have lost part of their tonicity. In some cases the skin of the legs and toes of the af-fected chicks was dry and rough. No enlargement, or flattening of the hock joint, bowing of the legs, or a displacement of the Achilles tendon was noted. Growth was somewhat retarded in the afflicted chicks and a number of them died as a direct result of partial or complete starvation. Some of the paralyzed chicks gradually recovered without any special treatment and coul...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this presentation is to relate the abundance and mobility of Cd in components of terrestrial ecosystems with implications for land utilization of sewage sludge. The uptake of Cd by crop plants {{is a function of}} the quantity of the element in the soil plus other soil factors affecting the Cd ion activity or electrochemical potential at the plant root surface. The natural abundance of Cd in soils has been reported as 0. 5 j,ug/g which is higher than the background level of 0. 2,ug/g found in soils studied in Pennsylvania. Experimental results indicate that the plant availability of Cd increases with each soil addition. While the plant availability of Cd is decreased by liming to increase soil pH, it has not been possible to add Cd salts or sewage sludge Cd without significantly increasing plant uptake. Field studies have shown that land application of sewage sludge can be expected to increase the Cd concentration of corn leaves from a range of 0. 05 - 0. 1,ug/g to 1 - 3,ug/g. Two years after the last application of sludge which added up to 10 ppm Cd to the surface soil, corn grain, sorghum grain, wheat grain, and potatoes showed a 10 - to 15 -fold increase in Cd over background levels. Etudies were conducted with <b>chicks,</b> <b>laying</b> hens, and meadow voles (Microtus Pennsylvanias) to assess ttte impact of this increase in plant Cd upon the food chain. Corn and sorghum plants were grown on soils with either inorganic or sludge fertilizer for the purpos...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cereal grains}} grown in Canada are damaged prior to {{harvesting}} and become available for animal feeding. There {{is a lack}} of information about the nutritive values of such grains. Wheat frozen prior to reaching maturity can safely be- fed to both <b>laying</b> hens and <b>chicks</b> (MacNaugh-ton, 1952) but such grain has a reduced energy digestibility coefficient (Bell and Gidyk, 1954; Whiting and Bezeau, 1954) possibly due to the failure of the kernels to develop fully. Grains which have sprouted tend to contain more B-vitamins and less dry matter than non-sprouted controls (Anon., 1943; Cheldelin and Lane, 1943). The present experiment was designed to study the nutritive worth of wheat dam-aged by sprouting, freezing and mould development after maturity had been reached. A sample of Avon wheat (52 lb. /bu.) was soaked for 8 hours in water and then spread in a thin layer between sacking in an atmosphere maintained at 22 °C. The grain was sprayed twice daily with water. After 60 hours two sub-samples of the wheat, which by this time had sprouted, were removed. The first sub-sample was placed in a drying oven (50 °C.) for 24 hours, while the second sub-sample was frozen and held at 0 °C. for 24 hours be-fore similar drying. The remaining wheat was left to sprout for a further 72 hours during which there occurred a growth of moulds but little change in sprout length. The mouldy grain and a sample of the untreated wheat were dried for 24 hours.

40|$|The Sooty Tern Sterna fuscata is a pan-tropical seabird that nests {{typically}} on isolated oceanic islands. Sooty Terns nest {{always on}} the ground, generally amongst sparse herb vegetation and often in large dense colonies, sometimes numbering hundreds of thou-sands of pairs (Gochfeld & Burger 1996, Schreiber at al. 2002). In most colonies, laying is highly synchronised; e. g. on Bird Island, Seychelles, in 1973, 90 % of eggs in a colony estimated at 395 000 pairs were laid in a nine-day period early in the laying season (Feare 1976) although the remaining eggs were laid over an approximate six-week period. In that study, time of laying appeared to be critical in terms of fledging success. Eggs laid dur-ing peak <b>laying</b> produced more <b>chicks</b> of fledging age, and chicks that were heavier at fledging and which fledged earlier, than chicks from later eggs. Despite being perhaps the world’s most numerous tropical seabird (Schreiber et al. 2002), few aspects of its life his-tory have been quantified (Hamer et al. 2001). Here, I analyse data from birds ringed as chicks on Bird Island, Seychelles in 1972 – 1973 and recaptured during searches for ringed birds in 1994 – 2001, {{in order to examine}} the relationship between long-term sur-vival and (1) body mass at fledging, and (2) date of fledging. In August–October 1972 and 1973, chicks on the point of fledg-ing were ringed with monel rings in the colony on Bird Island, Seychelles (4 ° 53 'S, 55 ° 12 'E). In 1972, between 30 August and 20 September a cohort of 806 chicks on the point of fledging was ringed and weighed to the nearest g using a 300 -g Pesola balance. In 1973 a similar cohort, of 321 chicks, was ringed and weighe...|$|R
