25|$|The Battle of the Menin Road Ridge on 20 September, was {{the first}} attack with the more limited {{territorial}} objectives developed since 31 July, {{to benefit from the}} artillery reinforcements brought into the Second Army area and a pause of three weeks for preparation, during which the clouds dispersed and the sun began to dry the ground. The shorter intervals between attacks since then had several effects, allowing <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> either side to prepare and the Germans had to take more risks {{on the rest of the}} Western Front, to replace tired and depleted divisions in Flanders. German troops and ammunition trains overloaded the rail network in west Flanders, while more German artillery escaped British counter-battery fire and less time was available for wire cutting and pillbox destruction, although the Germans generally left these to give battle in the open. The British artillery preparation before Polygon Wood on 26 September, began 24 hours before the infantry attack. No formal artillery preparation was conducted before 4 October, except for the normal heavy artillery counter-battery fire and destructive fire on German strong-points.|$|E

Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers.

On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team.

500|$|The {{expedition}} {{suffered a}} series of early misfortunes which hampered the first season's work and impaired preparations for the main polar march.

At the same time, a Sunday night through train was added. The reduced travel times made the line more attractive to commuters. In 1994, Metro-North conducted a train movement analysis of service on the branch to determine whether trains would pass one another based on speeds and the condition of tracks. As a result, a new [...] passing siding was constructed at Wingdale, increasing service flexibility and allowing for increased service in 1996. Also around this time, 447 additional parking spaces were added to stations on the Branch. In 1996, four car length high-level platforms with heated shelters were built at Patterson, Pawling, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, replacing low-level platforms that could only accommodate two cars. These platforms were made {{to be compliant with}} the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

2500|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples.

However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, the [...] "Little Ice Age" [...] had reached intense levels in Greenland.

A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century—as much as 6-8°C lower than modern summer temperatures. The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. By the mid-14th century deposits from a chieftain’s farm showed a large number of cattle and caribou remains, whereas, a poorer farm only several kilometers away had no trace of domestic animal remains, only seal. Bone samples from Greenland Norse cemeteries confirm that the typical Greenlander diet had increased by this time from 20% sea animals to 80%.|$|E
