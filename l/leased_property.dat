25|$|Originally leased in 1759 to Arthur Guinness at IR£45 (Irish pounds) {{per year}} for 9,000 years, St. James' Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and {{the largest in the}} world by 1886, with an annual output of 1.2million barrels. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. The company has since bought out the {{originally}} <b>leased</b> <b>property,</b> and during the 19th and early 20th centuries the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.|$|E

40|$|Long-term <b>leases</b> on <b>property</b> {{are popular}} in many jurisdictions, both with private vendors and with local govern-ments who want o retain future control over land use. A puzzling issue for vendors and purchasers has been how to value these <b>leased</b> <b>properties</b> {{relative}} to fee-simple properties. Simple present-value models uggest {{that there should}} be little difference between the price of fee-simple and and the price of long-term leases. Transac-tion prices in Canada on 80 -year to 100 -year residential leases, however, are 20 percent to 40 percent less than comparable f e-simple properties. We outline afinancial model for valuing <b>leased</b> <b>properties.</b> The value of the option to upgrade or redevelop is considered.

25|$|Tomkins {{was born}} in St David's in Pembrokeshire in 1572. His father, also Thomas, who had moved there in 1565 from the family home of Lostwithiel in Cornwall, was a vicar choral of St David's Cathedral and organist there. Three of Thomas junior's half-brothers, John, Giles and Robert, also became eminent musicians, but none quite {{attained}} the fame of Thomas. By 1594, but possibly as early as 1586, Thomas {{and his family had}} moved to Gloucester, where his father was employed as a minor canon at the cathedral. Thomas almost certainly studied under William Byrd for a time, for one of his songs bears the inscription: To my ancient, and much reverenced Master, William Byrd, and it may have been at this period of his career, since Byrd <b>leased</b> <b>property</b> at Longney, near Gloucester. Although documentary proof is lacking, {{it is also possible that}} Byrd was instrumental in finding young Thomas a place as chorister in the Chapel Royal. In any case, all former Chapel Royal choristers were required to be found a place at university, and in 1607 Tomkins was admitted to the degree of B.Mus. as a member of Magdalen College, Oxford.|$|E
500|$|Mason had {{submitted}} {{his plan}} sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named {{the new state}} the [...] "Commonwealth of Virginia", a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected House of Delegates, chosen annually by men who owned or <b>leased</b> <b>property,</b> or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill, and could only act {{as head of the}} state militia on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson's preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson's draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on the 29th. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution's passage by unanimous vote, [...] "I have had the pleasure to see our new plan of Government go on well. This day will put a finishing hand to it. 'Tis very much of the democratic kind." ...|$|E

2500|$|If some [...] "dissolution event" [...] (e.g. {{destruction}} of the <b>leased</b> <b>property)</b> had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments {{in the form of}} repurchase price”. This reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that (or near that) of conventional bonds, which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn. Consequently, they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower than they might otherwise, although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of SPVs, as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} two decades through either leases or {{purchases}} Grand Trunk would acquire several other branch lines in Michigan. It would take control of the Michigan Air-Line Railway through a lease in 1881. The line connected with the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction at Richmond, Michigan and ran to Jackson, Michigan through Romeo and Pontiac. When Grand Trunk purchased the Great Western Railway in 1882 it also acquired the Detroit Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH) which Great Western had owned since 1877. The DGH gave Grand trunk a route from Detroit through Pontiac, Durand and Grand Rapids to Grand Haven, Michigan where it would begin its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations in 1902. [...] The DGH would connect with the Chicago and Grand Trunk at Durand and with the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction in Detroit. Durand would become a major junction point for Grand Trunk when it continued to increase its mileage. It acquired the 96 mile Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway from Ashley, Michigan to Muskegon, Michigan in 1888. GTR would obtain trackage rights to reach the line at Ashley from Owosso, Michigan with the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway, the predecessor of the Ann Arbor Railroad. Grand Trunk acquired a route into Saginaw, Michigan in 1890 with the lease of the Cincinnati, Saginaw & Mackinaw Railroad from Durand to Bay City, Michigan. The line was the last to be held as a <b>leased</b> <b>property</b> until January 1943 when it was fully merged into Grand Trunk Western.|$|E
