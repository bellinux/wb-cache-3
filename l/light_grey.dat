5|$|Eleven main colours are {{recognised}} by {{the breed}} association (most including many different shades): <b>light</b> <b>grey,</b> grey, white, emsket (dusky bluish-grey), musket (light greyish-brown), shaela (dark steely-grey), black, fawn, moorit (reddish brown), mioget (honey-toned, yellowish-brown), and dark brown.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} days, the line's colours were: funnels– dark red with black top and thin black band; hulls– black with white boot topping. During the Second World War, ships were painted in battleship grey {{and the names}} were deleted for security, except when in friendly ports. From the 1960s onwards, some ships' hulls were painted <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> and others red.|$|E
50|$|Like flava but head <b>lighter</b> <b>grey,</b> ears washed white; sexes often similar.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are mouse-grey, with black scales. The hindwings are <b>lighter</b> <b>grey.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mildew: {{which is}} {{characterized}} by <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers will turn a creamy yellow color and will not develop correctly. This can be treated in a manner not dissimilar from treating Botrytis; eliminating the conditions which caused the disease {{in the first place}} and burning the infected plants are among the recommended actions to take.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves are <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> {{and brown}} and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate {{and care for the}} young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|E
5|$|The Uranian moons {{are listed}} here by orbital period, from {{shortest}} to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in light blue and bolded. Irregular moons with retrograde orbits {{are shown in}} dark grey. Margaret, the only known irregular moon of Uranus with a prograde orbit, is shown in <b>light</b> <b>grey.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15 - 17 mm. The forewings are grey and the hindwings are slightly <b>lighter</b> <b>grey.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is violet-grey densely sprinkled with black scales. The hindwings are <b>lighter</b> <b>grey.</b>|$|R
5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, and a <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> partial collar of variable extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid <b>light</b> <b>grey,</b> failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> fluoropolymer paint.|$|E

5000|$|The slate-colored {{back panel}} of the first-generation iPad Mini was {{discontinued}} in favor of [...] "Space Gray" [...] (a <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> tone), whilst the Silver color option still remained.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 16-20 mm. The forewings are steel <b>grey,</b> <b>lightest</b> and nearly uniform in the median area and darker and more mottled elsewhere. The hindwings are <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> with somewhat darker markings. Adults are on wing from late August to October in one generation per year.|$|R
5|$|Confusion {{over the}} {{colouration}} of the Mascarene parrot {{has also been}} furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist François-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, {{and the strength of}} these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adults, {{but lack}} throat hackles, and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be <b>light</b> <b>grey.</b> The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge. The bare {{skin on the}} throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest. Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older than one year develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is {{two or three years}} of age.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
50|$|The common Mexican tree frog is {{generally}} brown-grey in color, with darker brown, irregular blotching. Its underside is typically a <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> or white. Its legs have distinctive dark banding.|$|R
50|$|Only two engines - Y152 and Y165 - were repainted {{into the}} V/Line Freight scheme, which was {{essentially}} the same as previous with a new decal and a <b>lighter</b> <b>grey.</b>|$|R
50|$|During World War II, most German {{soldiers}} {{wore the}} traditional field grey. The {{soldiers of the}} Afrika Korps of General Erwin Rommel wore a <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> uniform more suitable for the desert.|$|R
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|In November 1973, as {{a result}} of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 {{equipped}} No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In wartime, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the LORAN C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> undersurface, to protect against sea spray.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
50|$|He {{has also}} made notable {{appearances}} on Pair of Kings, Lincoln Heights, Friday Night <b>Lights,</b> <b>Greys</b> Anatomy, Blue Mountain State, The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Necessary Roughness, and on MTVs Next.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-16 mm for males. They have dark wings with <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> spots. Females are wingless. Adults are on wing from March to April or {{the beginning}} of May in western Europe.|$|R
50|$|In Poodles, a blue is a {{very slowly}} fading, very dark steel grey, whereas a silver is a quicker to clear, much <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> that can range from a pale {{platinum}} to a steel grey. Both are black at birth with minimal markings to indicate future change. Similarly, café au lait is a slower and darker and silver beige a quicker and <b>lighter</b> progressively <b>greying</b> brown, i.e. liver.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot scheme}} {{locomotives}} were delivered in overall green livery with a grey roof and black below the body. D5000 was delivered {{with a narrow}} <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> stripe at waist level while the remainder had a broad <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> stripe at solebar level. This <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> stripe may have appeared bluish and {{has been described as}} pale blue or eggshell, but in most illustrations it appears to be off-white. At first green liveried locos had plain green ends, but this was changed from 1962 to small yellow warning panels, and then from 1967 to full yellow ends, some locos receiving these while still in green livery. At least five locos were repainted in two-tone green livery (applied along with the small yellow warning panel) in a similar manner to Class 47s and some Class 25s.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{distinguished}} from the fiery-breasted bushshrike as the latter species has a much redder breast and <b>light</b> <b>grey</b> head.|$|E
50|$|In {{the image}} here, the two inner {{rectangles}} {{are exactly the}} same shade of grey, but the upper one appears to be a <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> than the lower one due to the background provided by the outer rectangles.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 22-28 mm. The body is grey, mottled and faintly spotted with darker and <b>lighter</b> <b>grey.</b> The forewings are grey with crenulated darker transverse lines, and a small whitish stigma. The Hindwings are uniform grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 14-17 mm. The forewings are brassy brown-grey, but <b>lighter</b> <b>grey</b> in the terminal area. The hindwings are dark brown-grey with faint darker markings. Adults are on wing from late October to late November in one generation per year.|$|R
