50|$|In Europe usually both rear tractor axles have dual wheels, while {{single or}} dual wheels {{are used for}} the cargo trailer. The most common {{combination}} used in Europe is a semi tractor with three axles, one a <b>lift</b> <b>axle,</b> and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a <b>lift</b> <b>axle,</b> giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but reduce tyre scrub and wear while carrying lighter loads by raising an axle set off the roadway. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.|$|E

50|$|Some {{dump trucks}} and {{trailers}} may be configured with a <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> (also {{known as an}} airlift axle or drop axle), which may be mechanically raised or lowered. The axle is lowered to increase the weight capacity, or to distribute {{the weight of the}} cargo over more wheels, for example to cross a weight restricted bridge. When not needed, the axle is lifted off the ground to save wear on the tires and axle, and to increase traction in the remaining wheels. Lifting an axle also alleviates lateral scrubbing of the additional axle in very tight turns, allowing the vehicle to turn more readily. In some situations removal of pressure from the additional axle is necessary for the vehicle to complete a turn at all.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, some {{semi-trailer}} trucks {{have eight}} tires on three axles on the tractor; these {{are known as}} six-wheelers or [...] "six leggers", with either the center or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer {{as well as the}} front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the center axle). Some trailers have two axles which have twin tires on each axle; other trailers have three axles, of which one axle can be a <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers.|$|E

5000|$|European Union heavy trucks {{often have}} two {{steering}} axles. Dump truck configurations are 2, 3 and 4 axles. The 4-axle eight wheeler has two steering axles {{at the front}} and two powered axles at the rear and is limited to 32 t gross weight in most EU countries. The largest of the standard European dump trucks is commonly called a [...] "centipede" [...] and has seven axles. The front axle is the steering axle, the rear two axles are powered, and the remaining four are <b>lift</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
40|$|The rise in <b>Lift</b> <b>Axle</b> Trucks in Maryland Roadways {{has brought}} {{attention}} to truck policies and regulations. A <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> {{is an additional}} axle located on the truck that {{has the ability to}} be raised or deployed based on the Gross Vehicle Weight or the weight of cargo carried by the truck. Lift axles allow the truck to carry substantially higher payloads or cargo for a small increase in vehicle cost. There is much concern in the <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> operation (the rise and deployment) based on weight, it could {{have a significant effect on}} the condition of pavement and bridge structures. This research study examined the federal and state truck regulations as well as <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> truck configurations. Furthermore, based on truck digital weight and size data, the study explored the behavior of pavement and highway bridges based on the rise and deployment of <b>lift</b> <b>axle,</b> punching shear, yield line analysis as well as girder analysis and pavement damage. Results show that high rear tandem axle weights will have a higher effect on pavement and bridges than compared to tridem rear axle truck configuration (single unit truck with axle down) due to the loads being more distributed...|$|E

50|$|The {{initially}} used driven {{rear axle}} features differential with integrated reduction gear; the ratios are 4.72:1 and 7.06:1 for the applications with Rolls-Royce and six-cylinder Leyland O.690, for the Leyland O.801 V8 engine the ratios are 5.25:1 and 7.85:1. The axle {{is equipped with}} differential interlock. For an option became a double reduction model BTO in 1972. A new feature was also the outstanding full load <b>lifting</b> tandem <b>axle</b> mechanism which was inherited from Vanaja; the system could <b>lift</b> the rearmost <b>axle</b> when the load on tandem was 20 tonnes. This enabled a good grip on slippery surface.|$|R
50|$|The Vanaja <b>lifting</b> tandem <b>axle</b> {{system was}} adopted to Sisu's after the merger. SAT took some {{attempts}} of co-operation with other heavy vehicle producers {{to produce the}} lifting tandem also for other makes, but only few lifting tandems were mounted on Iveco's in the Hämeenlinna factory.|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, Porsche {{launched}} the 2nd Generation 997 GT3 (commonly {{now known as}} the 997.2 GT3), with an enlarged 3.8 litre engine producing [...] It also featured a number of new options including dynamic engine mounts and a pneumatically <b>lifting</b> front <b>axle</b> to compensate for the low ground clearance. The rear spoiler was also modified along with other parts of the bodywork. Deliveries in Europe commenced in November the same year. A total of 65 units were sold in the United States and 58 units in Canada.|$|R
50|$|As {{the train}} {{passed over the}} first of two points, the {{embedded}} tyre slammed against the guide rail of the points, pulling it from the railway ties. This guide rail also penetrated the floor of the car, becoming embedded in the vehicle and <b>lifting</b> the <b>axle</b> carriage off the rails. At 10:59 local time (08:59 UTC), one of the now-derailed wheels struck the points lever of the second switch, changing its setting. The rear axles of car number 3 were switched onto a parallel track, and the entire car was thereby thrown into the piers supporting a 300 t roadway overpass, destroying them.|$|R
5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load <b>lifting</b> tandem <b>axle,</b> {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|R
50|$|Previously, Sisu tandems were {{equipped}} with an in-house developed mechanism that <b>lifted</b> the rearmost <b>axle.</b> The solution was not very reliable and it had led {{to a number of}} warranty claims. The main domestic competitor Vanajan Autotehdas had developed an outstanding lifting tandem mechanism. SAT took over the producer when the designing work of R-series was ongoing, and adopted the mechanism to Sisus. The Vanaja type lifting tandem used in R-142 6×2 variant was the most significant new feature in the R-series.|$|R
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over before the company could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load <b>lifting</b> tandem <b>axle</b> mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel-Lift (also {{called a}} [...] "spectacle lift") - {{evolved from the}} hook and chain {{technology}} to produce a large metal yoke that can be fitted under the front or rear wheels to cradle them, drawing the front or rear end of the vehicle clear of the ground by a pneumatic or hydraulic hoist {{so it can be}} towed. This apparatus generally picks up the drive wheels of the vehicle (i.e. the front wheels if it is front wheel drive, the rear wheels if it is rear wheel drive) touching only the tires. The wheel lift was designed by Arthur W. Nelson of Weld Built Body Co. in 1967. The name spectacle lift is common in Europe; the cradle resembles a pair of squared spectacles (eyeglasses). Medium and heavy trucks use a variation, the [...] "underlift" [...] or [...] "chassis lift", which <b>lifts</b> the <b>axle</b> or frame instead of the wheels. Wheel-lift trucks can have adapters which can also lift the chassis.|$|R
50|$|Carol and David Ward of Northern Amusements, {{already a}} well {{experienced}} company {{due to their}} family’s single-handed development of the Meteorite into the UK. Spring 1996 saw the sketches of their proposed Super Star, and the Autumn of the year saw a ride debut for Patrick Burton. The ride features {{a different approach to}} obtaining the looping and spinning motions, lifting a single boom arm which then twists around its own <b>axle,</b> <b>lifting</b> a spinning frame of 8 main arms with a 4-person seat gondolas In the rear of the gondola there is a hydraulic ram which pulls the seating units into an outward position. Once in this position the riders will be at a 90 degree angle when the ride is lifted to its 45 degree position. A safety system will then engage {{at the bottom of the}} ride to prevent the gondola from coming down in the event of an emergency.|$|R
50|$|Tractors {{with three}} axles or more {{can have more}} than one {{steering}} axle, which can also be driven. Most 6×2 units allow the undriven rear axle to be raised when lightly loaded, or running without a trailer, to save tire wear, save toll road fees, and increase traction on the driven axle. The 6×6 units have three axles, all can be driven, and 8×6 units have four axles, with either the rear three driven and the front axle not, or the front and rear-most two axles powered and an unpowered <b>lifting</b> bogie center <b>axle</b> to spread the load when needed. The 8×8 units also have four axles, but with all of them driven, and 10×8 units have five axles with the rear four usually driven and the front axle for steering. All five axles of 10×10 units are driven. The front two axles are usually both steer axles. The axle configurations are usually based on axle load legislation, and maximum gross vehicle weight ratings (BDM).|$|R
40|$|Future {{demands on}} {{passenger}} cars consist {{to a large}} extend of making them more energy efficient. Reducing the driving resistance by reducing the aerodynamic drag will be one important part in reducing fuel consumption. In most cases during passenger car development, early experimental investigations are performed in scale model wind tunnels. Considering that such models inevitably suffer from Reynolds number effects {{it is important to}} understand how this affects the test results. Investigations of the aerodynamics of a detailed scale model Volvo S 60 have been performed in the aerodynamic wind tunnel at Chalmers University of Technology. The investigation aimed at increasing the understanding of how the flow field in scale model testing is affected by ground simulation and different cooling air flow configurations at different Reynolds numbers. A full width moving ground system was used in the experiments. Pressure taps were distributed between the cooling air inlets, the underbody and the vehicle base. An internal six component balance was used to measure global forces and moments. By combining the results from the measurements it was possible to increase the understanding of some of the local flow features. Results showed significant Reynolds number effects both with stationary ground as well as moving ground and rotating wheels. Global aerodynamic drag as well as front and rear <b>axle</b> <b>lift</b> was found to be affected...|$|R
50|$|Millat Tractors was {{initially}} incorporated as Rana Tractors and Equipment Limited to import and market Massey Ferguson Tractors. In 1965, facilities {{were created in}} Karachi to assemble tractors from semi knocked down kits. In 1967, operations were shifted from Karachi to Lahore and in 1972, under the Economic Reforms Order, the company was nationalized and started assembling and marketing tractors {{on behalf of the}} Pakistan Tractor Corporation (PTC). In 1980, the Government decided on indigenization of the tractors and entrusted this task to Pakistan Tractor Corporation. Pakistan Tractor Corporation transferred this role of indigenization in 1981 to Millat Tractors Limited. In just one year, the company took a giant step towards self-sufficiency by setting up the first engine assembly plant in Pakistan. In 1984, sophisticated manufacturing facilities for the machining of intricate components were set up. These were previously not available in Pakistan. Currently, critical components like the engine block, sump, transmission case, <b>axle</b> housing, hydraulic <b>lift</b> cover, front <b>axle</b> support and center housing are all being machined successfully in-house at Millat Tractors from locally sourced castings. In 1992, the company was privatized, and Millat Tractors plant started its in house production. The establishment of this modern plant not only increased production capacity to 16,000 tractors per year on a single-shift basis. In the 2007-2008 financial year, production shot up to 27,260 tractors, the highest sales of tractors ever in Pakistan for any company at the time.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Henry {{was sent}} to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) to improve his {{conditioning}} and wrestling skills. In OVW, he teamed with Nick Dinsmore {{to compete in a}} tournament for the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship in mid-2001. Later that year, Henry's mother died, causing him to go on hiatus from wrestling. He felt he had to compete in the [...] "Super Bowl of weight lifting"—the Arnold Strongman Classic—in honor of his mother, who gave him his first weight set when he was a child. Four months prior to the contest, Henry began lifting the heaviest of weights and trained {{for the first time since}} 1997 for a major lifting competition. He had never been a professional strongman before, but in the coming contest he was to face the very best of the best of professional strongmen, such as the #1 ranked strongman in the world, and defending World's Strongest Man competition winner of 2001 Svend Karlsen, World's Strongest Man winner of 2006 Phil Pfister, World Powerlifting Champion of 2001 and equipped deadlift world record holder Andy Bolton, World Muscle Power Champion, Olympic weightlifting Champion Raimonds Bergmanis, and reigning America's Strongest Man of 2001 Brian Schoonveld. Then on 22, February 2002 in Columbus, Ohio the competition, consisting of four events, designed to determine the lifter with the greatest overall body power, began. Henry surprised everybody when he won the first event, setting a world record in the process by <b>lifting</b> the Apollon's <b>Axle</b> three times overhead. Only three men in history had ever been able to press it at all. By deadlifting 885 lbs for two reps in the second event and easily pushing a 5.000+lbs Hummer with nearly flat tires in the third event, Henry kept his lead continuously throughout the competition and never gave it up again. In the final [...] "Farmer's Walk"-event Henry quickly carried the roughly 850 lbs of railroad ties up an incline, winning the whole competition convincingly to capture the winning prize — a US$75,000 Hummer, a vacation cruise and 10.000US$ cash. Since Mark had only trained for four months and defeated the crème-de-là-crème of worldwide strongmen, who had been practicing for years, his win was a shock for strongman experts worldwide, but remained basically unnoticed by the wrestling audience. Henry proved to be worthy of the title [...] "World's Strongest Man" [...] not only by winning the contest, but also by achieving it in record time. By doing so he was again seen as the legit [...] "strongest man in the world" [...] by many lifting experts for a second time since 1996.|$|R
