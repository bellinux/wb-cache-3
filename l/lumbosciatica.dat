40|$|AbstractIntroductionDiscogenic <b>lumbosciatica</b> is {{a common}} {{disorder}} in patients between 30 and 40 years old. Because of the frequency and socio-professional impact of this entity, it represents a real public health problem. DiscoGel® is a class III medical device used for nucleolysis to avoid discectomy. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment in patients with discogenic <b>lumbosciatica</b> following unsuccessful conservative medical treatment. Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective, single-center study including 25 patients who were treated with DiscoGel® between 2010 and 2011 at Niort Hospital, France. The severity of lumbar and radicular pain was assessed by a verbal numeric scale (VNS) and patient satisfaction. Patients were classified as successes or failures. ResultsTreatment was found to reduce the severity of lumbar pain in 73 % and of radicular pain in 80 % of patients in the success group. Treatment was a failure in 64 % of patients. A comparison of the two groups showed that a preoperative MODIC 2 MRI signal of the adjacent vertebral end plate was significantly associated with treatment failure (Chi 2 = 8572, P <  0. 01). DiscussionThe VNS for lumbar pain and radicular pain decreased in 42 % and 50 % of patients respectively after the use of DiscoGel®. In our series, DiscoGel® treatment was unsuccessful for discogenic <b>lumbosciatica</b> in 16 patients. These results do not support others in the literature. A lack of statistical power could partly explain these results. The most important result of this study is found in the subgroup analysis which suggests that indications for DiscoGel® treatment could be modified in the future in relation to preoperative imaging data.

40|$|Introduction Pyogenic {{infection}} of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) {{is very rare}} in children. It {{is the result of}} haematogenous spread primarily affecting the joint. The process is usually monoarticular. By rule, sequestra are rarely formed, there are no greater bone destructions, but there is usually early bone sclerosing. Case outline Due to the pain in the lumbosacral area spreading down the right leg and positive Lazarevic's sign, a 13 -yearold boy was referred to a neuropediatrician. He was suffering from <b>lumbosciatica.</b> In the first three sick days, laboratory tests were done as well as X-ray examination. High febrility and laboratory results indicated the existence of {{infection of}} unknown localization. Diagnostic examination: radiography of the lungs and heart, computerized tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultrasound (US) of hips and painful sacroiliac area and US of abdomen could not localise the infection. Radiography of SIJ (Barschoni) focused the attention on SIJ. Scintigraphy of the skeleton with 99 mTc-DPD pointed to the intensified collection of radiopharmaceuticals in the area around SIJ. Localized changes, erythema and signs of abscess in the projection of SIJ appeared the fifth day since the appearance of the disease. Incision was performed as well as evacuation of purulent content, and bacterial analysis isolated Staphylococcus aureus. Therapy with antibiotics was applied according to the antibiogram three weeks parenterally (intravenously) and two weeks per os. After five weeks, clinical and laboratory results were normal. The patient has been monitored for eight months since the appearance of the disease. Conclusion In children with symptoms and signs of <b>lumbosciatica,</b> among other things, attention should be paid, differentially and diagnostically speaking, to pyogenic infection of SIJ. The skeletal scintigraphy helps early diagnosis of pyogenic infection of SIJ, when localized clinical signs have not been formed yet. In our patient, the infection was caused by localized spreading from a skin abrasion...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} effects of neurodynamic techniques are still unknown. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to provide a starting point for future research on explaining why neurodynamic techniques affect muscular activities in patients with sciatic pain. Methods: A double-blind trial was conducted in 12 patients with <b>lumbosciatica.</b> Surface electromyography activity was assessed for different muscles during prone hip extension. Pre-and post-intervention values for muscle activity onset and maximal amplitude signals were determined. Results: There was a significant reduction in the surface electromyography activity of maximal amplitude in the erector spinae and contralateral erector spinae (p < 0. 05). Additionally, gluteus maximus (p < 0. 05) activity onset was delayed post-intervention. Conclusions: Self-neurodynamic sliding techniques modify muscular activity and onset during prone hip extension, possibly reducing unnecessary adaptations for protecting injured components. Future work will analyze {{the effects of}} self-neurodynamic sliding techniques during other physical tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lumbosciatica</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} which is associated with significant pain and disability. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the efficacy of interlaminar epidural corticosteroid infiltration in the treatment of lumbosciatic pain. We evaluated retrospectively sixty patients with lumbosciatic pain that a sequential interlaminar epidural administration of 40 mg methylprednisolone in 7 mL bupivacaine 0. 25 % was administered. Each patient was interviewed and asked about the pain according to visual analogue scale (VAS) and the level of disability according to World Health Organization previously of the epidural corticosteroid infiltration and, 1 and, 6 months after starting therapy. Independently of the initial VAS value, all patients decreased their pain score after one and six months of follow-up (p< 0. 05). However, only the patients with a low grade of disability showed an improvement after the treatment (p< 0. 05). No side effects were reported after epidural corticosteroid injections. In conclusion, interlaminar epidural corticosteroid injection in association with local anesthetic may be useful, at least for six months, as additional therapy of the conservative management of lumbosciatic pain...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the long-term results of a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse. Study design: Between January 1999 and January 2007, 165 laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy procedures, using a polypropylene mesh, were performed on women affected by vaginal vault prolapse. Intraoperative complications included: 5 bladder injuries and 3 sigmoid perforations. Postoperative complications included: 10 cases of fever, 5 cases of <b>lumbosciatica,</b> 15 cases of detrusor overactivity, 2 cases of vaginal haematoma, and 5 cases of minimal dispareunia. At 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery, a clinical evaluation was carried out for all patients. After this period, we contacted the women annually. Results: We treated 165 women, with an average age of 67 (range 58 – 76 years; S. D. 19. 22), average parity of 3 (range 2 – 5), and average body mass index of 28 (range 24 – 30). In many of them, more than one additional procedure was performed. At a median follow-up of 43 months (range 6 – 96 months), out of a total of 138 patients (27 were lost at follow-up), we obtained successful treatment in 131 women (success rate of 94. 9...|$|E
40|$|Movement {{created a}} {{differentiated}} aparatus – the loco‐ motory one – the basic component {{of which is}} the kinetic unit, formed of joint‐movement‐nerves, each one playing a well‐established role, motivated only within an interde‐ pendence relation of the whole kinetic unit. Activation of the motor unit, considered as the smallest functional neu‐ romuscular unit described in 1925 by Liddel and Sher‐ rington, involves a series of complex processes, developed {{at the level of the}} three components (pericarion‐cylindrax‐ muscular fibers), the result being muscular contraction. The control of motricity, of the voluntary movements we perform so easily, sometimes wholly automatically, repre‐ sents a real computer performance, the organism organ‐ izing this type of control on successive levels, continuously enriching the phylogenetic scale, along the evolution of species, with new neuronal levels of integration, control and command. The scope of the present study was to evi‐ dence the efficiency of the facilitation techniques as to the following aspects of neuromotor recovery: recovery of the muscular tonus, recovery of the muscular power, increased joint mobility and recovery of movements coordination, by means of facilitation techniques. Materials and method. During January 2010 ‐January 2012, in the Military Hospital of Iaşi there have been hospitalized 120 patients with ages between 23 ‐ 64 years, with various etiologies of functional deficit: <b>lumbosciatica</b> with prolongued muscular contrac‐ tion in 52 cases – 43. 33 %, hemiplegia + arthroses 8 cases – 6. 66 %, systemic eritematous lupus 4 cases – 3. 34 %, post‐ fracture algoneurosistrophy (blocked knee) 4 cases – 3. 34 %, rheumatoid polyarthritis – 24 cases – 20. 00 %, scapulo‐ humeral periarthritis 28 cases – 23. 33 %. Results and dis‐ cussion. The highest frequency of patients with neuro‐motor pathology requiring the application of some techniques facilitating neuro‐motor recovery was recorded in the 46 ‐ 50 years interval of age, while the interval regis‐ tering the most numerous patients with <b>lumbosciatica</b> is between 61 and 65 years, with periarthritis – between 46 and 50 years, while rheumatoid polyarthrits is most fre‐ quently manifested between 46 and 50 years, as well as between 56 and 60 years. Functional evaluation, represent‐ ing the basic element of a functional realization, followed: the joint and muscular check up, global evaluation. Con‐ clusions: The techniques applies were oriented on the type of deficit and of disease, the results obtained aiming at maintaining joint flexibility, known as depending on the continuation of the kinetic program from the part of the patient at home...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{describe}} a single case, the fourth ever reported, of pleomorphic liposarcoma {{of the spine}} and to undertake {{a review of the}} literature. Presentation of case: A 60 year old male patient had a bilateral <b>lumbosciatica</b> over a 3 month period. Imaging tests revealed a tumor mass in L 1 –L 3 and a fracture in L 2. Also, he had a mural thrombus both in the inferior vena cava and the left renal vein. The biopsy revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma. En bloc resection of the lesion and stabilization was carried out. Due to the condition of the patient (hemodynamic instability, wound dehiscence and infection, and hypoproteinemia), a decision was made not to subject the patient to either radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The patient was subsequently found to suffer from myopathic paraparesis and a surgical wound infection. At three months, liver metastases were evident, as well as a recurrence of the lesion. A venous thrombosis that extended from the lower iliac vein to the right atrium was observed. The patient died from type I hepatorenal syndrome. Discussion: Pleomorphic liposarcoma of the spine is a rare occurrence. En bloc resection with wide margins is the treatment of choice. The use of radiotherapy in the spine is controversial. The role that should be played by chemotherapy is still unclear, although it has been employed in treatments. Conclusion: In spite of treatment, these tumors lead to a poor prognosis, with high rates of recurrence, metastasis, and mortality...|$|E
40|$|Lumbar disc {{degeneration}} is {{a disorder}} whose clinical manifestations {{are represented by}} episodic pain in the lumbar spine, without lumbar blockage and minor muscle contraction. Because lumbalgia caused by lumbar disc degeneration is not always very high intensity pain, the easiest to apply treatment is drug therapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the potential role of rehabilitation treatment in the recovery of patients and the prevention of complications compared to drug therapy alone. The study included 28 patients (17 women and 11 men) aged between 23 - 60 years, assigned to two groups: 20 patients who received rehabilitation treatment (consisting of massage, kinesiotherapy, hydrokinesiotherapy, electrotherapy and medication) and 8 patients who received drug treatment consisting of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. The treatment duration was 10 days. For the evaluation of pain, the visual analogue scale was used, for the degree of disability, the Oswestry questionnaire, and for joint mobility and muscle strength, articular and muscular testing. At the end of treatment, the study group compared to the control group had a statistically significant result for pain (p= 0. 001), as well as for the Oswestry score (p= 0. 030). The mean age of the patients was 35. 51 ± 3. 026, which shows an increased incidence among young adults. A possible connection between the development of the disease in women and age less than 45 years was also investigated, but the result was not statistically significant, p= 0. 22. Our data suggest the fact that rehabilitation treatment plays an important role in the reduction of pain and the improvement of the quality of life of patients with lumbar disc degeneration by decreasing the degree of disability. In the future, it can be proposed to monitor patients with lumbar disc degeneration over a longer time period in order to see the effects of kinetic rehabilitation programs in relation to the delay of chronicization. As studies show, genomic medicine is gaining ground and in the future we will probably witness genetic testing for lumbar disc disease and <b>lumbosciatica,</b> which will allow for personalized treatment...|$|E

In the {{presence}} of “red flags”, further tests must be done to rule out underlying problems; however, biomedical imaging is currently overused. LBP involves large in-hospital and out-of-hospital economic costs, and it is also the most common musculoskeletal disorder seen in emergency departments (EDs). Patients and methods: This retrospective observational study enrolled 1, 298 patients admitted to the ED, including all International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnosis codes for sciatica, <b>lumbosciatica,</b> and lumbago. We collected patients’ demographic data, medical history, lab workup and imaging performed at the ED, drugs administered at the ED, ED length of stay (LOS), numeric rating scale pain score, admission to ward, and ward LOS data. Thereafter, we performed a cost analysis. Results: Mean numeric rating scale scores were higher than 7 / 10. Home medication consisted of no drug consumption in up to 90 % of patients. Oxycodone–naloxone was the strong opioid most frequently prescribed for the home. Once at the ED, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates were administered to up to 72 % and 42 % of patients, respectively. Imaging was performed in up to 56 % of patients. Mean ED LOS was 4 hours, 14 minutes. A total of 43 patients were admitted to a ward. The expense for each non-ward-admitted patient was approximately € 200 in the ED, while the mean expense for ward-admitted patients was € 9, 500, with a mean LOS of 15 days. Conclusion: There is not yet a defined therapeutic care process for the patient with LBP with clear criteria for an ED visit. It is to this end that we need a clinical pathway for the prehospital management of LBP syndrome and consequently for an in-hospital time-saving therapeutic approach to the patient.
