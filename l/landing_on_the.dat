5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E
5|$|By November 1944, the First Canadian Army {{had entered}} the Nijmegen Salient which was being held {{for use in the}} {{development}} of future offensives. The 2nd Division came under the command of Major General Bruce Matthews, with Foulkes being transferred to command the I Canadian Corps on the Italian Front. The First Canadian Army launched no major offensive operations from November 1944 to January 1945; the longest hiatus the Canadians had enjoyed since <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Normandy beaches the previous June.|$|E

He {{had been hit}} by the defensive fire from the bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but managed to make a smooth <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium.

5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean {{coast and}} traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, {{which was on}} the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids.

5|$|In February 1944, Lukačević {{travelled}} to London {{to represent}} Mihailović {{at the wedding}} of King Peter of Yugoslavia.

After the war, he was tried for collaboration and war crimes and sentenced to death. He was executed in August 1945.|$|E

5|$|The Aghlabids {{had tried}} and failed to take the city soon after their initial <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island in 827–828. Despite their repulse there, they managed to {{establish}} themselves in the western portions of the island, and in the decades that followed they gradually pushed eastward into the central parts of Sicily. During this period they undertook repeated efforts to capture the capital of the Byzantine province, in 868, 869, and 873, but these failed as well.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} hostilities, I Corps was {{assigned}} to occupation duty in Japan. On 19 September 1945 the corps, with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division, sailed from Lingayen Gulf for Japan, <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Honshū on 25 September, three weeks after Japan's formal surrender. The next few years were a period during which {{the terms of the}} surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of foreign nationals, and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} {{at the time}} of their discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E

5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets and rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
