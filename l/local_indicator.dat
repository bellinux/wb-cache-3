METHODS: A total of 11, 989 confi rmed, autochthonous dengue fever cases, geocoded by address {{in the city of}} São José do Rio Preto (Southeastern Brazil), between September of 2001 and August of 2006, were included in the study.

The values of the three indices were considered high in a spatial unit when their standard values were positive and the respective <b>local</b> <b>indicator</b> of spatial association values were signifi cant.

The significant positive Moran’s I spatial correlation index of infant mortality suggests that similar traits (high/low mortality zone) are concentrated at some specific areal pockets not uniform over the whole high-focus states. The <b>local</b> <b>indicator</b> of spatial association (LISA) statistic identifies the district from the central and eastern regions (Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh) as the hot spot (having high infant death surrounded by high-value neighbors) and few districts of Jharkhand and Uttarakhand as the cold spot (low-low clustering).

40|$|The local {{economic}} information {{base for the}} UK {{does not meet the}} demand for <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> emerging from the private and public sectors. This thesis identifies an 'information gap' between the need for and provision of <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> in the public and private sectors. The existence of this 'gap' emerges in the literature review. Empirical evidence of the gap is provided by the thesis' postal survey (which investigates the use of local {{economic information}} in forecasting). The dearth of <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> is then confirmed in the analysis of guided interviews with practitioners. The literature review and practitioner interviews identify a rising need for <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> over the last decade. The increased political significance of local space has led to a growth in the need for information at this scale from the public sector. Organisational restructuring and the privatisation of utilities has also led an increase in demand from the private sector for local economic information. This need has been compounded by deficiencies in those <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> which are currently available, in terms of quality, organisation and accessibility. The literature suggests that standardisation of the criteria for organising <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> into a database would greatly assist the organisations that seek this information. However, no such set of criteria has been forthcoming. The thesis therefore incorporates a feasibility study which focuses on the establishment of a standardised local economic database. The research findings steer suggestions for its development, and <b>local</b> economic <b>indicators</b> for the <b>Local</b> Authority District (LAD) ofLuton are collected and organised into a database as a case study. The methodology is documented, and can be reproduced to develop a similar database for any other LAD in the UK...|$|R

Indeed, the good agreement between the structure of global convection obtained from SuperDARN and the time average structures obtained from the Hurst exponent suggests that the knowledge of the changes in the scaling features with the geomagnetic activity level may be also useful in developing reliable forecasting systems, providing information not available in geomagnetic indices and, at the same time, on the spatial long-range statistical nature of the geomagnetic field fluctuations at different latitudes. This information can give new key clues for the development of more actual physical models.|$|E

40|$|Due to its fuzziness, {{the model}} of {{sustainable}} development has to be particularized and contextualized {{before it can be}} used as a yardstick. A <b>local</b> <b>indicator</b> system for two German cities has been developed to meet these requirements using a new conceptualization of sustainability. Initially, local problem areas were identified in a bottom-up approach by local authority personnel. These problem areas were contrasted with a set of sustainability rules, which had been systematically derived from a basic sustainability norm that gives minimum requirements for sustainable development. Indicators were specified at the interface between local problem areas and sustainability rules. The indicators are expected to provide information on whether the city is over time becoming closer to or farther removed from the respective sustainability goals in its problem areas.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop two goal-oriented {{adaptive}} strategies for a posteriori error estimation within the generalized multiscale finite element framework. In this methodology, one seeks {{to determine the}} number of multiscale basis functions adaptively for each coarse region to efficiently reduce the error in the goal functional. Our first error estimator uses a residual based strategy where <b>local</b> <b>indicators</b> on each coarse neighborhood are the product of <b>local</b> <b>indicators</b> for the primal and dual problems, respectively. In the second approach, viewed as the multiscale extension of the dual weighted residual method (DWR), the error indicators are computed as the pairing of the local H^{- 1 } residual of the primal problem weighed by a projection into the primal space of the H_ 0 ^ 1 dual solution from an enriched space, over each coarse neighborhood. In both of these strategies, the goal-oriented indicators are then used in place of a standard residual-based indicator to mark coarse neighborhoods of the mesh for further enrichment in the form of additional multiscale basis functions. The method is demonstrated on high-contrast problems with heterogeneous multiscale coefficients, and is seen to outperform the standard residual based strategy with respect to efficient reduction of error in the goal function.
