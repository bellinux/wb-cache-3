40|$|Abstract: In modern electronics, {{specifications}} for products have constantly been tightened due to performance competi-tion. The processes for product development and manufacturing {{have been developed}} to meet the tighter specifications and quality requirements. The development of test methods and measurement devices have not been as fast, and as a con-sequence, the relative impact of measurement errors has increased. Traditionally, the measurement inaccuracies have been compensated by tightening the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> This study concentrates on analysing, through simulation, how compa-nies should minimise the failure costs by adjusting <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> The study shows, in contrast to the conventional thinking, that widening the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> makes business sense in some cases...|$|R

This <b>acceptance</b> criteria <b>limit</b> has been successfully determined using probabilistic descriptions of preflight hardware geometry, empirical bearing wear data, mission requirements, and measurement tool precision as an input for a Monte Carlo simulation. The result of the simulation is a frequency distribution of failures as a function of preflight <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> When the distribution is converted into a reliability curve, a conscious risk management decision is made concerning the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Design Space (DS) {{is defined}} as the set of factors {{settings}} (input conditions) that provides results at least better than pre-defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> The proposed methodology aims at identifying a region in the space of factors that will likely provide satisfactory results during the future use of an analytical method or process in routine, through an optimization process. First, in a Bayesian framework, DS is derived from the joint predictive posterior distribution of the responses in a multivariate multiple regression problem using non-informative as well as informative prior distribution of the parameters. The case of DS in presence of highly correlated responses will be covered. Second, a multi-criteria decision is taken with respect to the pre-defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits,</b> aiming to identify the DS of any analytical methods or other processes. A strong link is made between <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> and objective functions to optimize, using desirability functions and index.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use {{of static}} {{concentrator}} modules is {{an approach to}} reduce the cost of PV systems. Nevertheless, remarkable cost reductions and good performance of the PV system depend on the optimization of the concentrator. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the optimization of the static concentrator module PEC- 44 D for stand-alone systems in Brazil. This device consists of bifacial cells and of a linear asymmetrical optical system, shaped by part of a parabola, circle and ellipse. The tool used to achieve this goal was a computer program to simulate a ten year period of a stand-alone system. The results are the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>acceptance</b> angles as well as the slope of the concentrator that lead to the lowest cost of the PV array. The method was applied to optimize the PEC- 44 D module for 27 Brazilian cities. We concluded that the upper acceptance angle should be 90 o and the <b>lower</b> <b>acceptance</b> angle decreases with the increase of latitude. Based on these results, three different devices were selected as a function of <b>lower</b> <b>acceptance</b> angle and latitude. The comparison of the selected modules with the optimum design for each location results in an increase of the PV-array cost of only 2 %...|$|R

If an INS meets all requirements in all areas it represents a sustainable system for the supply of energy, capable of making {{a significant contribution to}} meeting the energy needs of the 21 st century. Draft manuals have been developed, for each INPRO area, to provide guidance for performing an assessment of whether an INS meets the INPRO requirements in a given area. The manuals set out the information that needs to be assembled to perform an assessment and provide guidance on selecting the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> and, for a given INS, for determining the value of the indicators for comparison with the associated <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> Each manual also includes an example of a specific assessment to illustrate the guidance.

40|$|Various {{approaches}} are compared {{for the design}} and analysis of studies to assess the transfer of an analytical method from a research and development site {{to one or more}} other sites: comparison of observed bias and precision to <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits,</b> statistical quality control-type analysis, statistical difference tests, and statistical equivalence tests. These {{approaches are}} evaluated in terms {{of the extent to which}} the risks of incorrect decisions (consumer risk of failing to detect that a site is unacceptable, and producer risk of rejecting an acceptable site) are known and/or controlled. Comparison of observed accuracy and precision to <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> is a flawed approach because both the consumer and producer risks are unknown and uncontrolled. For technology transfec where the objective is to demonstrate sufSicient acceptability or similarity, the statistical quality control and difference tests are well known to suffer from illogical characteristics (decreasing true acceptance probabilities as the sample size increases). The equivalence test is the preferred approach because it alone controls the more important consumer risk and performs in a scientifically logical manne,: <b>Acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> for accuracy and precision in the equivalence test should be based on need for intended use (ie, ensuring thar good batches will pass, and bad batches will fail, during future release testing and stability testing), and a rigorous method for selection of well-conceived limits is presented.

Women could feel free to state their preference without consequences for their personal situation. It can be difficult, however, for women to reconsider the choices they have just made facing their own doctor. This might have caused some opportunistic answers in line with the planned approach, e.g., caused by a psychological mechanism called cognitive dissonance reduction [23]. This might be the reason for (part of) the <b>lower</b> <b>acceptance</b> of complications and conversions and the fact that the less importance was ascribed to the speed of recovery in patients scheduled for AH as compared with patients scheduled for LH. Another explanation for this phenomenon might be selection bias, as women with a <b>lower</b> <b>acceptance</b> of complications and conversions already had opted for AH.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} {{shelf-life}} prediction model of lipid-containing bakery products. To this purpose (i) the temperature dependence of the oxidation rate of bakery products was modeled, taking into account the changes in lipid physical state; (ii) the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> were assessed by sensory analysis; and (iii) the relationship between chemical oxidation index and <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit</b> was evaluated. Results highlight that the peroxide number, the changes of which are linearly related to consumer acceptability, is a representative index of the quality depletion of biscuits during their shelf life. In addition, the evolution of peroxides can be predicted by a modified Arrhenius equation accounting for the changes in the physical state of biscuit fat.

40|$|A generic {{model on}} the keeping quality of {{perishable}} produce was formulated, {{based on the}} kinetics of the decrease of individual quality attributes. The model includes the effects of temperature, chilling injury and different levels of initial quality and of quality <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> Keeping quality of perishable produce {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to the sum of the rates of the separate reactions leading to quality decrease, irrespective of the kinetics of the decrease. In its static form, the model is useful for statistical analysis and for predicting keeping quality at constant conditions. In its dynamic form, it predicts keeping quality as a function of temperature, initial quality and quality <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> These limits are defined by personal, regional or national preferences. Calculation of the dynamic model requires only one simple numerical integral, even for multiple limiting attributes. Due to the fast numerical integration of that one integral, optimization of distribution chains with respect to produce quality over a broad time and space region becomes economically feasible. The model accounts for the behaviour of keeping quality of about 60 species of fruits and vegetables, including chilling-sensitive products, over a wide range of temperatures...|$|R

40|$|In {{industry}} and in laboratories, {{it is crucial}} to continuously control the validity of the analytical methods used to follow the products' quality characteristics. Validity must be assessed at two levels. The 'pre-study' validation aims at demonstrating be re use that the method will be able to achieve its objectives. The 'in-study' validation is intended to verify, by inserting quality control (QC) samples in routine runs, that the method remains valid over time. At these two levels, the analytical method will be claimed valid if it is possible to prove that a sufficient proportion of analytical results is expected to lie within given <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> [-lambda, lambda] around the nominal value. This paper presents and compares four approaches to checking the validity of a measurement method at the pre-study level. They can be classified into two categories. In the first, a lower confidence bound for the estimated probability pi of a result lying within the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> is computed and compared with a given acceptance level. Maximum likelihood and delta methods are used to estimate the quality level pi and the corresponding estimator variance. Two approaches are then proposed to derive the confidence bound: the asymptotic maximum likelihood approach and a method proposed by Mee (Commun. Stat. Theory Methods 1988; 17 (5) : 1465 - 1479). The second category of approaches checks whether a tolerance interval for hypothetical future measurements ties within the predefined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> [-lambda, lambda]. beta-expectation and beta-gamma-content tolerance intervals are investigated and compared in this context. These four approaches are illustrated on a bioanalytical HPLC-UV analytical process and compared through simulations. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} a rapid and sensitive RP-HPLC method with UV detection, using the diclofenac sodium release determination in solid pharmaceutical formulations. A novel validation strategy based on accuracy profiles {{was used to}} select the most appropriate regression model with highest accuracy within well defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> Furthermore, the strategy {{was used to determine}} the limits of quantification as well as the suitable concentration range. The validation phase was completed by investigating of the risk profiles of various acceptable regression models in order to avoid obtaining measurements outside the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> fixed a priori. On the other hand, the present study shows how the LC method can be used more accurately to assess the kinetic dissolution profiles, instead the UV-visible method required by monographs of the USP. Robustness study was also performed in order to demonstrate the capability of this method to remain unaffected by a small and deliberate variation in method parameters. The LC method was validated using the total error approach, as a decision tool, guarantees that each of the future results that will be within the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> settled at ± 5 %. The UV spectrophotometric method based on the USP monograph, gives rise of impurities from diclofenac sodium in acidic condition (HCl 0. 1 N). These impurities absorb at the same wave length (276 nm) as the active principal ingredient, which will yield some significant error in the per cent release during the dissolution test study.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{transfer is}} a complete process that consists in transferring a validated analytical method from a sending laboratory (called sender) to a receiving laboratory (called receiver) after having experimentally demonstrated that it also masters the method. The decision to transfer an analytical method is usually taken based on the combination of two criteria: one about systematic error and one about random errors. These usual criteria, their combination and their limitations are described in this paper. As it is for method validation, total error-based approaches should be also considered in method transfer. Two approaches are proposed {{in order to have}} a total error-based criterion and to take into account the precision of the true value estimate. In the first approach, a beta-expectation tolerance interval similar to the one used in method validation is calculated and then compared to <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> around the estimate of the true value. The second approach, found as slightly more powerful than the first one, consists in estimating the probability to have a result outside these <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

The validation strategy was intentionally oriented towards routine use and {{the reliability of the}} method rather than extreme performance. For this reason, validation by accuracy profile was chosen. The accuracy profile procedure, which is based on the concept of total error (bias + standard deviation), guarantees that a known proportion of future results obtained with the method will be within <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> For all the compounds tested in the present study, α-pinene, α-terpineol, β-pinene, d-limonene, Δ 3 -carene, camphene, 1, 8 -cineole, p-cymene, linalool, but not in the case of carvone, the accuracy profile procedure established that at least 95 % of the future results obtained would be within the ± 15 % <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> of the validated method over the whole defined concentration range. Other parameters, such as selectivity, recovery, repeatability, stability of the molecules of interest and the effect of temperature, were also determined.

40|$|Saffaj et al., {{recently}} {{proposed an}} uncertainty profile {{for evaluating the}} validity of analytical methods using the statistical methodology of γ-confidence β-content tolerance intervals. This profile assesses {{the validity of the}} method by comparing the method measurement uncertainty to a pre defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit</b> stating the maximum uncertainty suitable for the method under study. Several years earlier as stated by these authors a SFSTP (Société Française des Sciences et Techniques Pharmaceutique) commission has developed a similar profile called accuracy profile used to assess the validity of analytical methods.

The uncertainty profile of Saffaj et al. and the accuracy profile of the SFSTP commission are both fulfilling the same final purpose. The core question is finally what statistical tolerance interval to use ? The aim of this letter to the editor is to discuss this question and provide arguments that β-expectation tolerance intervals should be prefered to assess the validity of the method as this type of interval give the guarantee that each future results has high probability to fall within pre-specified <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
