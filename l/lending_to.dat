5|$|The {{next move}} by the {{authorities}} was to launch the Primavera Plan in August 1988, a package of economically heterodox measures that foresaw little ﬁscal adjustment. The IMF refused to resume <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> Argentina. Six months after its introduction, the plan collapsed, leading to hyperinﬂation and riots.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2008–09, making the roster out {{training}} camp and establishing himself as a third-line forward. He became known as a player for his speed and work ethic, <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> his effectiveness in puck-pursuit and forechecking. Also responsible defensively, he began to be used consistently on the penalty kill. Hansen has recalled {{the transition to the}} NHL requiring a change in his style of play to incorporate more physicality and abrasiveness. Prior to making the NHL, he relied more on skill and finesse, having been a go-to offensive player for teams up to that point.|$|E
5|$|With several {{influential}} committee posts, Neal {{has made}} economic policy {{the focus of}} his career, although his success has been mixed. He served his first two terms on the House Banking Committee, where he served on the Financial Services Subcommittee. As the banking reform law of 1991 was being drafted, he cautioned that President George H.W. Bush's proposal could negatively affect small businesses and minority-owned businesses. He introduced an amendment to require reports on <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> these businesses, which was adopted.|$|E

Then your reward will be great, {{and you will be}} children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked." ...|$|R

5|$|It targets {{the poorest}} of the poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} rate {{set by the}} central bank indirectly determines the {{interest rate}} customers must pay on their bank loans. This interest rate affects the rate of interest among individuals, investments, and countries. <b>Lending</b> <b>to</b> the poor involves more risk than <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> the rich. As {{a result of the}} larger differences in wealth in different areas of the world, a central bank's ability to set interest rate to make the area prosper will be increasingly compromised, since it places wealthiest regions in conflict with the poorest regions in debt.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{practices}} of contemporary bank regulation and central banking, including centralized clearing of payments, central bank <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> member banks, regulatory auditing, and government-administered deposit insurance, are designed {{to prevent the occurrence}} of such bank runs.|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{the current}} study investigates how team rivalry affects lenders’ choice of {{projects}} {{in the context of}} prosocial crowdfunding. We collected data from Kiva.org and show explorative results that the tendency of a lender <b>to</b> <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> a project decreases when a rival <b>lends</b> <b>to</b> the same project. The results suggest that lenders on rival teams avoid appearing cooperative.|$|R

Typically the local bank will lend about twice the amount provided by the micro-lender's guarantee, thus providing greater leverage than traditional micro-credit.|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{building}} societies actively {{compete with}} banks for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and savings accounts, and regulations permit {{up to half}} of their <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages. The world's largest building society is Britain's Nationwide Building Society. Further, in Australia, building societies also compete with retail banks and offer the full range of banking services to consumers.|$|E
25|$|Bank {{regulation}} in the United States is highly fragmented {{compared to other}} G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both {{the federal and state}} level. The U.S. also {{has one of the most}} highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and promoting <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> lower-income segments.|$|E
