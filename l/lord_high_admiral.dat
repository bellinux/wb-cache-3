5|$|Soon {{after her}} accession, Anne {{appointed}} her husband <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral,</b> giving him nominal {{control of the}} Royal Navy. Anne gave control of the army to Lord Marlborough, whom she appointed Captain-General.

5|$|William {{excluded}} George {{from active}} military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence {{until after the}} deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence {{in support of his}} wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> in 1702 was largely honorary.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral.</b> He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river with a chain or a boom {{stretching}} between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305. Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising earthworks and establishing watch-houses. Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 Charles Howard, the <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral,</b> expressed his concerns about the effectiveness of the Gravesend Blockhouse in protecting the Thames.|$|E
5|$|William's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, {{had been}} Prince Regent since 1811 {{because of the}} mental illness of their father, George III. In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second {{in the line of}} succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate {{relatively}} frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered {{only a matter of time}} before he became king. When the Duke of York died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral,</b> which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral,</b> he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remaining away for ten days. The King, through the Prime Minister, by now Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, requested his resignation; he complied.|$|E
50|$|He was a Commissioner of the Admiralty from 1699 to 1702 and a Member of the <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral's</b> Council 1702 to 1708. He {{obtained}} numerous royal honours and appointments, {{including that}} of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. Because of his naval knowledge, he became a close professional friend of Czar Peter the Great. David Mitchell's coat of arms are stated by De Neve to be appropriated for his tomb without justification from the Mitchells of Tillygrieg ('he bears arms, but hath no right', citing his humble background).|$|R
5000|$|He became Commander-in-Chief, West Indies in 1823 and, {{following}} {{promotion to}} rear admiral in 1825, {{he was appointed}} Surveyor-General of the Ordnance in 1827, made {{a member of the}} <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral's</b> Council in 1828 and was made Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station in 1829. In this capacity he had to contend with pirates and considered the use of steam ships to pursue them. Promoted to vice admiral in 1837, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet on [...] in 1841. In 1845 he had command of the Experimental Squadron. In 1846 he was promoted to admiral.|$|R
50|$|On 2 February 1771 {{the office}} of Senior Naval Lord was renamed to First Naval Lord. The first post holder was Vice-Admiral Augustus Hervey; he first served under First Lord of the Admiralty John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. In 1805, for the first time, {{specific}} functions were assigned {{to each of the}} 'Naval' Lords, who were described as 'Professional' Lords, leaving to the 'Civil' Lords the routine business of signing documents. On the 2 May 1827 the Board of Admiralty once again ceased control of Naval Affairs and was replaced by a <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admirals</b> Council: this lasted until 1828.|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century, {{tensions}} grew between Protestant England and Catholic Spain, leading ultimately to the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. Spain {{was in a}} strong position to attack the south of England from its possessions in the Spanish Netherlands. New fortifications were erected along the Medway, including a chain stretched across {{the width of the}} river below Upnor Castle. The castle itself was poorly manned until <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham highlighted this and recommended that the garrison should be increased. By 1596, it was garrisoned by eighty men who were each paid eight pence per day (equivalent to £6 today).|$|E
5|$|John Constable of HMS Windsor {{was found}} guilty of breach of orders and {{drunkenness}} and was cashiered. Samuel Vincent of the Falmouth and Christopher Fogg of the Breda were initially sentenced to be cashiered for signing the six captains' resolution, but Benbow personally declared that they had fought bravely, and their sentences were remitted by the <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral.</b> The sentences were deferred so that Queen Anne could have a chance to examine the proceedings. After her consideration in January 1703, she allowed the sentences to proceed and Constable, Kirkby, and Wade were returned to England as prisoners. Constable was imprisoned until 1704, when the Queen pardoned him. Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard HMS Bristol on 16 April 1703 while she was anchored in Plymouth Sound under Captain Edward Acton. Controversy slowly began to develop over the events of August 1702. Supporters of the disgraced Kirkby and Wade sought to discredit Benbow by publishing their own account of the action.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose {{first saw}} battle in 1512, {{in a joint}} naval {{operation}} with the Spanish against the French. The English were to meet the French and Breton fleets in the English Channel while the Spanish attacked them in the Bay of Biscay and then attack Gascony. The 35-year-old Sir Edward Howard was appointed <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> in April and chose the Mary Rose as his flagship. His first mission was to clear the seas of French naval forces between England to the northern coast of Spain {{to allow for the}} landing of supporting troops near the French border at Fuenterrabia. The fleet consisted of 18 ships, among them the large ships the Regent and the Peter Pomegranate, carrying over 5,000 men. Howard's expedition led to the capture of twelve Breton ships and a four-day raiding tour of Brittany where English forces successfully fought against local forces and burned numerous settlements.|$|E
25|$|In 1706 Commodore Gordon complained that, whilst {{entering}} {{the port of}} Tynemouth Haven, after having received some damage to a mast in a gale, Captain Jones of the Royal Navy vessel Dunwich had fired a shot at him. After sending his lieutenant to the Dunwich to enquire why the shot had been fired, he learned that Scottish Navy vessels {{were not allowed to}} show a broad pendant whilst in English waters. Gordon pointed out that English and Dutch vessels often wore a broad pendant in Scottish waters. Jones also complained when Gordon fired a morning and evening gun. Gordon and Jones wrote to their <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admirals</b> for instructions on the matter but the Act of Union, which required both vessels to fly the Union Jack, automatically rectified it.|$|R
50|$|During the Third Anglo-Dutch War Narborough {{was second}} {{captain of the}} <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral's</b> ship the HMS Prince. He {{conducted}} himself with such conspicuous valour at the Battle of Sole Bay in May 1672, following the death in action of his superior Sir John Cox, that he won special approbation, and shortly afterwards was made rear-admiral and knighted. In 1675 {{he was sent to}} suppress the Barbary piracies, and by the bold expedient of despatching gun-boats into the harbour of Tripoli at midnight and burning the ships, he induced the Dey to agree to a treaty. There is an account of the raid in the diary of the naval chaplain Henry Teonge. The Lieutenant who planned and executed the burning of the ships in the harbour was Cloudesley Shovell, who later married Narborough's widow.|$|R

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Scottish independence, Robert I {{turned his attention to}} building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late 14th century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers. James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424 he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429, were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, and the office of <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel.|$|E
5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral,</b> and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the {{relatively}} brief Second English Civil War broke out, and Rupert informed the French King {{that he would}} be returning to King Charles' service. The Parliamentary navy mutinied in favour of the King and sailed for Holland, providing the Royalists with a major fleet {{for the first time since}} the start of the civil conflict; Rupert joined the fleet under the command of the Duke of York, who assumed the rank of <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral.</b> Rupert argued that the fleet should be used to rescue the King, then being held prisoner on the Isle of Wight, while others advised sailing in support of the fighting in the north. The fleet itself rapidly lost discipline, with many vessels' crews focussing on seizing local ships and cargoes. This underlined a major problem for the Royalists—the cost of maintaining the new fleet was well beyond their means. Discipline continued to deteriorate, and Rupert had to intervene personally several times, including defusing one group of mutinous sailors by suddenly dangling the ringleader over the side of his vessel and threatening to drop him into the sea. Most of the fleet finally switched sides once more, returning to England in late 1648.|$|E
6000|$|The third cook, {{crowned with}} a resplendent tin basin and wrapped royally in a table-cloth mottled with grease-spots and coffee stains, and bearing a sceptre that looked strangely like a belaying-pin, walked upon a {{dilapidated}} carpet and perched {{himself on the}} capstan, careless of the flying spray; his tarred and weather-beaten Chamberlains, Dukes and <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admirals</b> surrounded him, arrayed in all the pomp that spare tarpaulins and remnants of old sails could furnish.

50|$|This is worn {{only by a}} few senior Officers (Admirals and Admirals of the Fleet, {{members of}} the Royal Family or Royal Household of the rank of Rear Admiral and above, the Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom). In addition, {{in the past several}} members of the Royal Family below the rank of Rear Admiral; most notably Charles, Prince of Wales and Andrew, Duke of York wore this uniform whilst holding the rank of Commander and Captain. It {{consists}} of a tailcoat with standing collar (white with gold edging - a vestige of the white uniform facings of the 18th-19th century), worn with gold shoulder boards, black and gold belt and gold laced black trousers. It is worn at parades such as <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral's</b> Divisions (BRNC) or at state occasions. Introduced in 1959, it is essentially the same uniform worn for ceremonial occasions (Full Dress) before this date only with the cocked hat replaced by the peaked hat and the epaulettes replaced by shoulder boards.|$|R

Blefuscu is also ruled by an Emperor, who is not named.|$|R
5|$|The Whigs used George's {{death to}} their own advantage. The {{leadership}} of the Admiralty was unpopular among the Whig leaders, who had blamed Prince George and his deputy George Churchill (who was Marlborough's brother) for mismanagement of the navy. With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught {{at the loss of}} her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Anne appointed the moderate Earl of Pembroke, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|George did {{not play}} a senior role in {{government}} until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral,</b> the official but nominal head of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. Actual power at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose elder brother was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother Charles Churchill, {{had been one of}} his gentlemen of the bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. His secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne's close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the Honourable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the States General of the Netherlands to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the Maritime Powers that William had held.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was granted}} the Duchy of Gloucester on 1 November 1461, and on 12 August {{the next year}} was awarded large estates in {{northern}} England, including the lordships of Richmond in Yorkshire, and Pembroke in Wales. He gained the forfeited lands of the Lancastrian John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, in East Anglia. In 1462, on his birthday, he was made Constable of Gloucester and Corfe Castles and Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine and appointed Governor of the North, becoming the richest and most powerful noble in England. On 17 October 1469, he was made Constable of England. In November, he replaced William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, as Chief Justice of North Wales. The following year, he was appointed Chief Steward and Chamberlain of Wales. On 18 May 1471, Richard was named Great Chamberlain and <b>Lord</b> <b>High</b> <b>Admiral</b> of England. Other positions followed: High Sheriff of Cumberland for life, Lieutenant of the North and Commander-in Chief against the Scots and hereditary Warden of the West March. Two months later, on 14 July, he gained the Lordships of the strongholds Sheriff Hutton and Middleham in Yorkshire and Penrith in Cumberland, which had belonged to Warwick the Kingmaker. It {{is possible that the}} grant of Middleham seconded Richard's personal wishes. However, any personal attachment he may have felt to Middleham was likely mitigated in his adulthood, as surviving records demonstrate he spent less time there than at Barnard Castle and Pontefract.|$|E
