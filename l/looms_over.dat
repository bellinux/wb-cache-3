5|$|Many {{cities in}} Poland now have {{memorials}} to the massacre in public spaces {{as well as}} within churches and cemeteries. For example, in Wrocław, a composition by Polish sculptor Tadeusz Tchórzewski {{is dedicated to the}} Katyn victims. Unveiled in 2000, it is located in a park east of the city's centre, near the Racławice Panorama building. It shows the 'Matron of the Homeland' despairing over a dead soldier, while on a higher plinth the angel of death <b>looms</b> <b>over,</b> leaning forward on a sword.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite Valley {{represents}} only {{one percent of}} the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> Yosemite Valley, {{is one of the most}} popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above the valley floor.|$|E
25|$|On the {{exterior}} of the building Charles Keck created 23 limestone panels depicting the march of civilization from east to west including wagon trains heading west from Westport Landing. Grillwork in the doors depict oak leaf motifs in memory of Oak Hall. The south facade of the museum is an iconic structure in Kansas City that <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> a series of terraces onto Brush Creek.|$|E

Several of Bongo's excuses parodied those of politicians, such as [...] "Mistakes were made". Occasionally there {{would also be a}} shadow Akbar & Jeff <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> Bongo and their nephews. One comic showed Bongo's shadow <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> Binky.|$|R

25|$|Drainage {{from the}} {{southern}} side of the fell is via a number of feeders to Stickle Gill and Great Langdale Beck. Among the tributaries is White Gill, its ravine being an interesting route of ascent. Water from the northern flanks reaches Grasmere via Easedale Beck and its feeders. Crags look down over Easedale Tarn and Blindtarn Moss to the north, while further rough ground <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> the Great Langdale road.|$|E
25|$|Kothari {{demolished}} {{his house}} on Clifton Hill in 1907, {{and at that}} site he built a magnificent pavilion, parade and pier, which he bequeathed {{to the people of}} Karachi to enjoy. Inspired by this generosity, Kavasji Hormusji Katrak built and gave to the people of Karachi the grand bandstand which <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> the cliff. He also established a school for the blind and sanatorium in Karachi around this time.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{newspapers}} and media publications {{are based in}} Casa Presei Libere (The House of the Free Press), a landmark of northern Bucharest, originally named Casa Scânteii after the Communist Romania-era official newspaper Scînteia. Casa Presei Libere {{is not the only}} Bucharest landmark that grew out of the media and communications industry. Palatul Telefoanelor ("The Telephone Palace") was the first major modernist building on Calea Victoriei in the city's centre, and the massive, unfinished communist-era Casa Radio <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> a park a block away from the Opera.|$|E

25|$|When {{ascending}} the Fella, {{the river}} valley veers east at Pontebba and continues 10 kilometers east to Malborghetto. From the latter town, Tarvisio is 10 kilometers {{farther to the}} east. To reach Tarvisio from the Soča (Isonzo) valley, a road leaves Bovec and continues about 10 kilometers north-northeast before turning west to cross the Predil Pass (1,156 meters). At {{the foot of the}} pass is Lago del Predil (Lake Predil). From there, the road continues north again for about 10 kilometers before arriving at Tarvisio. The Predil blockhouse dominates the road about 800 meters east of the pass. The Malborghetto blockhouse lies about 900 meters east of Malborghetto village. The fort is on a mountain spur that <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> the Fella valley.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{architecture}} {{contains a}} wealth of historic structures, most built during the boom of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Notable structures include the 12-story St. James Building (housing The First State Bank), with its huge Doric columns presenting a grand entrance to the ornate lobby. The West Virginia Building is a deep-red brick structure that <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> 4th Avenue. At {{the time of its}} completion, it was the tallest tower in the state, but it has since fallen to 18th, behind the office towers of Charleston. Numerous other notable buildings are scattered throughout the downtown, ranging from the beautifully restored Guaranty Bank and Trust Building to the high-rise Coal Exchange Building. Grand residential homes and mansions line Ritter Creek and the steep hills that loom behind it, many built by the railroad barons of the past.|$|E
25|$|Gerard was commemorated by an {{elaborate}} memorial in Ashley parish church, which grew and was modified over several generations. The main structure, built {{under the supervision}} of Gilbert's son, Thomas, portrays him and Anne, lying in splendour. She has her Talbot dog at her side, while he is in full armour, an uncharacteristic garb for him, with a finely modelled gauntlet at his side. Beneath the Gerards is a cadaver, but, unlike the case of a normal cadaver tomb, it appears to date from an earlier period. The kneeling figure of Thomas Gerard <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> his parents at the head end, vigilant but not in prayer. A smaller kneeling and praying figure, said to be the younger son Ratcliffe, is placed {{at the feet of the}} couple. Both kneeling figures are completely free-standing and detached from the main structure, clearly added later and at the sacrifice of part of its moulded edge. The four daughters of Gilbert and Anne, all of whom survived their parents, are portrayed on a separate rear panel. Two more smaller kneeling and praying female figures, free-standing and detached, are placed to the front of the main structure - possibly daughters who predeceased their parents, but more likely of a later generation. The monument is surmounted by a vast, densely decorated alabaster canopy, displaying the armorial bearings of the Gerards and Radcliffes.|$|E

500|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} and its numerous caverns, canyons, and valleys result in the area being of high interest to both visitors and researchers. There are several coves along the shore that have been named {{in order to identify}} them easily. Upon entering the park from the east, the first and easternmost beach available to the public is known as İçmeler Cove (...) [...] This cove's waters are shallower than any other in the park, and its beaches are sandy, unlike some of the coves farther out. Therefore, it appears to be more popular amongst tourists than most of the remaining beaches and parts of Kuşadası that are visible along the horizon from it. Aydınlık Cove is situated about [...] further to the west, and has pebbly shores and deeper waters. It marks the transition point where the waters {{of the peninsula}}'s beaches become more challenging. As a result, these beaches tend to attract more experienced swimmers and locals rather than tourists. After passing the jandarma (public safety patrol) checkpoint, a turn onto a road leads to a nearby canyon, immediately to the left. From this point on, there are several trails through the forests of the peninsula. One of them leads to the village of Doğanbey, and if followed further, leads to the nearby ancient Hellenistic port city of Karine. However, this path's final [...] are limited in access, and a permit or an accompanying tour guide is required to proceed. The third cove along the peninsula, Kavaklı Burun Cove, and the final, westernmost cove accessible to the public, Karasu Cove, both provide close views of the island of Samos, and are significantly less visited than the former coves of the peninsula. At {{the very end of the}} peninsula appears its tallest mountain, Mycale (...) , which <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> Samos and the strait of its namesake.|$|E

2500|$|Men of the Docks is a [...] oil {{painting}} on canvas. It depicts {{a group of}} men, wearing overcoats smeared in grime, standing at a dock in Brooklyn together with some draft horses. These men appear to be day laborers, at the docks to find work. They look to the left, as if receiving a message, while a large steam liner <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> them to their right. Behind them are a tugboat and the waters and ice floes of the harbor in winter. Further behind them are the skyscrapers of the lower Manhattan skyline. The winter weather about them is bleak and gray.|$|E

East of West Rock Ridge, the Metacomet Ridge spreads {{out into a}} series of low, parallel ridges toward Saltonstall Mountain in Branford, Connecticut; the only noteworthy summit in between is East Rock which <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> New Haven from the north. [...] The west side of West Rock Ridge drains into West River, then into Long Island Sound; the east side into Belden Brook thence to West River, and the north side into Mill River thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound.|$|E

During a battle with another group of enemies, one of Butters' testicles is shattered, so the boys take him to Hell's Pass Hospital and protect it while he is healed. Jimmy runs in to tell the boys to head to Stark's Pond, where they help Jimbo and Ned to stop another group of enemies from destroying the town.

2500|$|Darth Vader's iconic status {{has made}} the {{character}} a synonym for evil in popular culture; psychiatrists have even considered him as a useful example to explain borderline personality disorder to medical students. Anakin's origin story in The Phantom Menace {{has been compared to}} signifiers of African American racial identity, and his dissatisfaction with his life has been compared to Siddartha's before he became Gautama Buddha. A Mexican church advised Christians against seeing The Phantom Menace because it portrays Anakin as a Christ figure. The slime-mold beetle Agathidium vaderi is named after Vader, and several buildings across the globe are regularly compared to him. A grotesque of Darth Vader <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> the east face of the Washington National Cathedral's northwest tower. During the 2007–08 NHL season, Ottawa Senators goaltender Martin Gerber performed so well in an all-black mask that fans endearingly termed him [...] "Darth Gerber". In 2015, a statue of Vladimir Lenin in Odessa, Ukraine, was converted into one of Darth Vader due to a law on decommunization.|$|E
2500|$|Media Matters {{singled out}} MSNBC's Chris Matthews for his {{consistently}} harsh coverage of Clinton. [...] During the primaries, and {{especially after the}} Iowa caucuses, Matthews was openly enthusiastic about Obama's candidacy. The New Republic reported that Matthews was [...] "swooning" [...] over Obama {{in the days leading}} up to the January 8 New Hampshire Democratic primary. [...] On the night of that election, Matthews co-anchored MSNBC's coverage. Air America Radio host Rachel Maddow and political analyst Patrick Buchanan both noted the high turnout among women, and asserted that the media coverage made Clinton a sympathetic figure to female voters. Buchanan stated that the media had [...] "virtually canonized" [...] Obama and behaved as if he'd been [...] "born in Bethlehem." [...] Maddow told Matthews that several blogs were citing him as [...] "a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to Hillary Clinton." [...] She added that sites such as TalkingPointsMemo.com indicated that voters felt that the media were [...] "piling on" [...] Clinton, and were [...] "coming to her defense with their votes." [...] Matthews replied sarcastically, [...] "My influence in American politics <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> the people. I'm overwhelmed myself." [...] He added, [...] "I will never underestimate Hillary Clinton again." [...] The next day, Matthews appeared on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC morning show and said, [...] "I'll be brutal, the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around. That's how she got to be senator from New York. We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit." [...] While this incited more controversy, Matthews noted that Clinton's political career started after she appeared with Senator Chuck Schumer and impressed Democratic leaders with her graceful handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. [...] "I thought it was an unexceptional statement," [...] he said. These comments, among others, [...] led Media Matters to launch a campaign against him and his remarks.|$|E

You would think it stupid and humdrum, because the people are peasants; but I {{am not sure that}} you are right. The elementary things, you know, are the greatest, and those we have. Our young people fall in love and marry. The joy of birth comes to our mothers, and the tragedy of death <b>looms</b> <b>over</b> us all. Some go out into the world, some choose to remain here. A passer-by may glance upward from the road at our little hamlet, and wonder what can ever happen in such an out-of-the-way corner. I think the answer is just what I have told you. Love and marriage, birth and death happen. These things make life." ...|$|E
