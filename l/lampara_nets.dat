25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout parts of its range. Due to its abundance, it {{may be one of}} the primary species in a fishery. The availability of fisheries statistics for the species is variable throughout its range, with the Americas having separate statistics kept for the species, while in Africa and Europe it is lumped in with other carangids in statistics. In the Americas, recent catch data suggests an increased amount of the species is being taken (or reported), with the 2006 and 2007 catch averaging between 6000 and 7000 tonnes, while during the 1980s and 1990s, there was rarely an annual catch greater than 1000 tonnes. Research on the fisheries of local regions has shown how important the fish is to certain fisheries. Artisanal fisheries in Santa Catarina Island have shown blue runner to be third most important and abundant species, making up 5.6% of landings, or 4.38 tonnes. Even subsistence fisheries at the edge of its range in Brazil show a catch of 388kg in two years from beach seines. Throughout its range the blue runner is commercially taken by haul seines, <b>lampara</b> <b>nets,</b> purse seines, gill nets, and hook and line methods. The fish is sold at market either fresh, dried, smoked or as fishmeal, oil or bait.|$|E

It was conducted in four landing sites; Busana, Kikondo from Buikwe district and Lufu landing site from Buvuma district. The main aim was to determine the effect of <b>Lampara</b> <b>net</b> on the catch rate and size of the Rastrineobola argentae (mukene) harvested on Lake Victoria using various mesh sizes. The study focused on the 5 mm and 10 mm mesh sizes of the <b>Lampara</b> <b>net.</b> A total of 109 boats were sampled; from the 5 mm mesh sizes indicated catch rates of 78 - 200 kg/boat/day and yet for 10 mm mesh size was at 248 kg/boat day. Statistical tests were carried out on the these two mesh sizes using One way Anova and indicated in catches was (Anova F= 7. 476; P< 0. 05) and for the price values was (Anova F= 5. 488; P< 0. 05). This is an indication that {{despite the fact that the}} mukene fishery is on the increase, a time will come when it also be depleted so a need to use the rightful fishing gear of 10 mm mesh size is advisable for the biodiversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|Mukene"Rastrineobola argentea {{occurs in}} lakes Victoria, Kyoga, Nabugabo and the Victoria Nile. On lakes Victoria and Kyoga the {{commercial}} fishery is well developed. While some fishing occurs at isolated {{places on the}} Victoria Nile, the species {{is yet to be}} exploited on lake Nabugabo although the potential exists. Experimental fishing (light fishing and beach seining) was conducted on Lake Nabugabo based at the Lake Nabugabo Holiday and Conference Center. Specimens obtained were analyzed for biological and fisheries parameters. Mukene on Lake Nabugabo still grows to a large adult size compared to the Lake Victoria populations. Size at first maturity at 42 mmSL is close to that observed on Lake Victoria. Peak breeding occurred between August and January. Unlike on Lake Victoria, R. argentea in Lake Nabugabo is not infested by the cestode Ligula intestinalis that is common in these fishes. Catch rates of 9. 8 kg/lamp/hr by the <b>lampara</b> <b>net</b> on this lake compare favorably with many parts of Lake Victoria and on Lake Kyoga where a commercial fishery exists. The amount of by-catch species in the catches however is high and does not therefore favour the establishment of the fishery on this lake. Human exploitation of mukene on Lake Nabugabo would also affect the Nile perch fishery which depends on the species as a source of food...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at twelve fish landing sites in Java and Kalimantan Islands, west central Indonesia, from June 2005 to October 2006 {{to overcome the}} lack of knowledge on chondrichthyan species in Indonesia. Data were collected for seven consecutive days at each site from fish landings, including species diversity, fisheries, utilizations, and biological data of chondrichthyan species. A total of 23, 454 individuals of chondrichthyans, 104 species and 28 families were recorded from 12 landing sites during the study, with an estimated total biomass of more than 70, 000 kg. This total consisted of 65 species of shark representing 16 families and 58 species of rays representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan. Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae were the most common families recorded. Dasyatis kuhlii (Dasyatidae) was the most abundant chondrichthyan species in this study, while Himantura gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass. Ordination of abundance values showed a segregation between the sites that had fishing grounds in shallow waters (the Java Sea, Karimata Strait) and sites that fished the deeper waters (the Indian Ocean, Makassar {{and a part of}} Sunda Strait). The shallower areas were typified by some common dasyatids and inshore sharks, and the deeper areas by large, oceanic and deep water chondrichthyans. The present study also identified which types of fishing gear contributed most to the total biomass and size of elasmobranch landings. A total of fifteen types of fishing gear are used from fishing vessels operating in the Java Sea and adjacent area (including Karimata Strait, Sunda Strait, Makassar Strait) and off south Java (the Indian Ocean) to catch chondrichthyan fishes, either as bycatch or as target of fishing. Set gillnet was the most common gear that caught chondrichthyan fishes, but Danish seine nets contributed most to both the total number and total biomass of chondrichthyan fishes captured in the observed area during the study. The Danish seine net (cantrang) was the least selective gear that caught elasmobranchs in Java and Kalimantan during the study, following by bottom <b>lampara</b> <b>nets</b> and set gillnets that were operated in inshore waters. Danish seine nets were also considered to contribute most to overall fishing pressure in the Java Sea. H. gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass of batoids captured in the Danish seine fishery from Batang landing site which is the largest contributor to the total catch of elasmobranchs in west central Indonesia. H. gerrardi is categorized as the “first class” {{and one of the most}} sought after rays in the skin industry at Batang due to the quality of its skin. Most elasmobranch products are utilized and marketed locally and some others are sold to large cities or other countries due to their high values, such as fins, gill rakers, skins and cartilage. The present study of chondrichthyan diversity in west central Indonesia also provides detailed data on the size composition and reproductive biology of some common elasmobranchs in the region. Size composition of each species varies among regions and fishing areas. Species that were caught in large numbers from heavily fished areas matured earlier than those from the lower fishing pressure areas. Precocious maturity of some dominant species may also indicate the high level of fishing pressure in the area where they are occurred. Diets of some common dasyatids caught from the Danish seine fishery operating in the Java Sea were also investigated to find out the contribution of stomach fullness to the size and weight relationships variation. More than 90 % of the diet of H. gerrardi was crustaceans, represented by carid shrimps, mantis shrimps and penaeids. Conversely, teleosts made significant contributions to the diet of H. jenkinsii and large size classes of H. uarnak and H. undulata...|$|E
40|$|Rastrineobola argentea, local name. s Mukene (Uganda) Omena (Kenya) and Dagaa (Tanzania) {{occurs in}} lakes Victoria, Kyoga and Nabugabo (Greenwood 1966). Until {{the decline of}} the native fishes {{especially}} the haplochromines, R. argentea was of little economic importance to the fisheries of these lakes. The stocks of this species have now increased and commercial catches on Lake Victoria account for over 30 %. Fishing for R. argentea is currently still restricted to inshore areas and within the fringing islands of Lake Victoria. This fishery is not yet established on Lakes Kyoga and Nabugabo although the species is quite abundant in these lakes (Proude 1963). On moonless nights, kerosene pressure lamps are exposed on the lake to attract the fishes. These fishes are then fished out using fine meshed seine, <b>lampara</b> or lift <b>net...</b>|$|R
40|$|Catch effort data {{on which}} {{fisheries}} management regulations are sometimes based {{are not available}} for most lakes in Uganda. However, failure to regulate fishing gears and methods {{has been a major}} cause of collapse of fisheries in the country. Fisheries have been damaged by destructive and non-selective fishing gears and methods such as trawling and beach seining, by use of gill nets of mesh size which crop immature fish and by introduction of mechanised fishing. Selectivity of gears used to crop Lates niloticus L. (Nile perch), Oreochromis niloticus L. (Nile tilapia) and Rastrineobola argentea Pellegrin (Mukene) which are currently the most important commercial species in Uganda were examined in order to recommend the most suitable types, sizes and methods that should be used in exploiting these fisheries. Gill nets of less than 127 mm mainly cropped immature Nile tilapia and Nile perch. To protect these fisheries, the minimum mesh size of gill nets should be set at 127 mm. Seine nets of 5 mm caught high proportions in immature Mukene while those of 10 mm caught mainly mature Mukene. When operated inshore, both sizes caught immature Nile perch and Nile tilapia as by-catch. To protect the Mukene fishery and avoid catching immature bye-catch, a minimum mesh size of the Mukene net should be 10 mm operated as <b>Lampara</b> type <b>net</b> offshore, but since most fishermen have been using 5 mm seine nets for over five years the minimum size {{should not be allowed to}} drop below 5 mm pending further thorough investigations. Beach seining and trawling are destructive to fisheries and should be prohibited until data that may justify their use is available...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1980 - 02 - 25 Results of a {{study of}} spatial and {{temporal}} utilization of a tidal river estuary by hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp. and Salmo spp,), of overlap in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids, and of size and relative abundance of associated fish species are reported in this thesis. The investigation was conducted in Yaquina Bay, Oregon in 1977 and 1978 to provide information for evaluation of concerns over the biological impact of large releases of hatchery salmon on wild fish in the estuary. A 100 - X 3 -m beach seine was used to sample four beach study areas from July 1977 through December 1978, and a 222 -m <b>lampara</b> <b>net</b> was used to sample two channel study areas from March 1978 through October 1978. Approximately 2. 2 million hatchery salmon were released into Yaquina Bay in 1977, and 9. 6 million were released in 1978. Tags, fin clips, dye marks, scales, species, release date, external parasites, visceral fat, size, and fin erosion {{were used to determine}} hatchery or wild origin of individual salmonids in the catch. Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum (0. keta), and coho (0. kisutch) salmon, in decreasing order, were the most abundant wild salmonid species, and coho salmon were the most abundant hatchery species. In 1978 wild populations of chum and coho salmon were present in the estuary for 2 - 3 mo (March-June), and wild Chinook were present during 9 mo (January, April-November). Increase in mean length of wild chum and Chinook, and decrease in mean length of wild coho, indicated that wild chum and Chinook utilized the estuary as a rearing area, and wild coho did not. Lack of overlap in peak migration periods of wild chum (early April), coho (mid May), and chinook (late July-early August) suggests the need to minimize overlap in utilization of the estuary by hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids. The length of residence of hatchery coho in Yaquina Bay was described by the equation: N=N 0 e-kt. The "residency half-life" (E® 2) ranged from 1. 7 to 9. 0 days for different No release groups of hatchery coho in 1977 and 1978. Juvenile hatchery coho that remained for an extended period (1 - 3 mo) in Yaquina Bay during 1977 increased in mean length from 11. 5 cm FL in mid July to 21. 0 cm FL in October. Some individuals within summer release groups of hatchery chinook also remained in the estuary for extended periods (> 2 mo) a Groups of juvenile hatchery coho and chinook released into Yaquina Bay earlier in the year (June-August) remained in the estuary for longer periods than groups released later in the year (September-October), Overlap in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids in the estuary was C ften high, although overlap was found to vary with species, time, habitat, space, length of estuarine residence, and prey abundance. In terms of biomass, larval and juvenile fish (Clupeidae, Engraulidae, and Osmeridae) were the most important prey organisms of hatchery and wild coho and chinook salmon in Yaquina Bay. Approximately 58 fish species were captured at the study areas in 1977 and 1978, and 17 were identified in the stomach contents of hatchery and wild salmonids. Overlap in spatial and temporal utilization and in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmon in the estuary indicates that the potential for competition between these groups does exist, should space or food resources become a limiting factor. To reduce overlap in spatial and temporal utilization, consideration should be given to not releasing hatchery salmon during peak migration periods of wild chum, coho, and chinook salmon. To reduce length of residence of hatchery coho and chinook released after May, mid to late summer releases should be considered...|$|R
