500|$|On {{the eastern}} {{outskirts}} of Bath a toll bridge near the George Inn links Bathampton to Batheaston, {{on the north}} bank of the canal. When the A46 Bathampton by-pass was built, the [...] Bathampton Meadow was created to provide additional flood relief. The resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive {{to a number of}} migrants; wading birds such as dunlin, ringed and <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn. Sand martin and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the lake, and other migrants have included yellow wagtail, whinchat and hobby. The canal turns south into a valley between Bathampton Wood and Bathford Hill which includes Brown's Folly, a [...] biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
500|$|There {{are eight}} main pools in the reserve, {{some of which}} are {{maintained}} to support specific flora or fauna. [...] At the centre of the reserve is East Marsh Pool, the largest of the pools, which contains two islands. Tern Island is composed of gravel and pebbles which attracts certain species to breed here, notably common tern and <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b> [...] There are also a number of artificial rafts on the pool, again to induce common tern to breed; eight pairs did so in 2008. Willow Island is much larger and more grassy, providing suitable areas for lapwing, common redshank and green sandpiper. The existence of the islands helps to prevent the nests of species such as these being predated by foxes. There are three hides overlooking the pool. [...] An artificial structure alongside the pool is designed to attract sand martins to breed, as they did when the gravel quarry was operational; this was successful {{for the first time in}} 2009, with eight nestholes occupied and over 40 young fledged.|$|E
5000|$|March: The <b>Little</b> <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plovers</b> {{appear and}} start singing. Plenty of Natterjack Toad frogs croaking at night. Many trees budding, with sprouts of Willow, Common reed, Halophiles, and Common Alder.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of habitats which include grazed pasture with hedgerows, ditches, reens, reed beds and grasslands. These help to attract breeding birds such as lapwings, redshanks, oystercatchers, <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> and <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> as well as visitors such as wigeon, shovellers, teal, shelduck and pintails, bitterns, hen harriers and short-eared owls.|$|R

2500|$|Further up-river, the Sutton and Lound gravel pits {{are still}} part of an active {{quarrying}} operation which {{is run by the}} construction group Tarmac, but some 316 hectares have been designated as an SSSI. They provide an important wetland habitat for a large variety of birds. The pits won the 2008 [...] "British Trust for Ornithology - British Energy Business Bird Challenge" [...] in the category for quarries over 100 ha. A total of 172 different species of birds were recorded, including a number of birds which normally occupy the coastal fringes rather than inland sites. These include ringed plover, <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> shelduck and oystercatchers. Other birds seen include the black-necked grebe, which is rare in the United Kingdom, and the nightingale, which was extinct in Nottinghamshire before 2004. The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust have been active in planting reeds to improve the habitat, which are grown at Langford Quarry in a joint venture between Tarmac and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
50|$|The Towy and {{surrounding}} valley (Dyffryn Tywi) {{are home to}} a very large variety of water and wetland birds. Among the more distinctive species found along the river are sand martins, common sandpipers, <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> dippers, kingfishers and grey wagtails. Red kites and buzzards are numerous. Goosanders and cormorants prey on sea trout and salmon.|$|R
50|$|The Sanctuary Bird and Wildlife Reserve was {{formally}} launched in July 2004 by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Margaret Beckett MP, alongside the Mayor of Derby. The site is {{now home to}} breeding skylarks, reed buntings and lapwings, all birds considered significant under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, with additional habitat created for breeding sand martins and <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} water {{entering}} and leaving the Dole is managed, maintaining its mud flats {{to make sure they}} are available for birds like snipe and <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> throughout the year. Migratory birds like redshank and sandpipers also use the Dole as a resting and feeding place on their route north for the summer. In summer and winter, water is allowed in, to prevent the mud from drying up; in spring and autumn, water is released, to expose the mud.|$|R

5000|$|This site is {{described}} by Natural England as [...] "a nationally important site for its breeding bird assemblage of lowland open waters and their margins, wintering waterbird species, an assemblage of over 20,000 waterbirds in the non-breeding season and a rare example of wet floodplain woodland." [...] The diverse habitats include, marsh, reedswamp, rough grassland, scrub, wet ditches, woodland and rush pasture. There are at least 21 breeding bird species, including mute swans, tufted ducks, little grebes, great crested grebes, <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> and redshanks.|$|R
50|$|For {{the fourth}} series of Springwatch, the {{production}} team {{moved to a}} new location at the Pensthorpe Nature Reserve in Norfolk due to a change of ownership at the Fishleigh Estate farm. It was broadcast on BBC Two from 26 May to 12 June. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble watched local birds on the nest, including <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> goldcrests and reed buntings, all new species for Springwatch. Swallows, blue tits, great tits, greenfinches, pied wagtails and robins were amongst the returning species. Simon King was based in the Cairngorm National Park, where he brought viewers footage of ospreys with chicks, pine martens, Scottish wildcats, ptarmigan and crested tits.|$|R
50|$|The River Rom, {{which is}} the {{boundary}} between the boroughs, runs through the site, with Barking and Dagenham on the west side and Havering on the east. It was formerly a site of gravel extraction, and now has a diverse range of habitats. The River Rom has birds such as kingfishers, and the 190 species of birds recorded include skylarks, <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> and lapwings. It is also home to around 300 Green Parkeets who make their presence known with much noise, especially at sunset. Other animals include water voles, great crested newts, slow worms and badgers. The Black Poplar is Britain's rarest native tree, and the site has six of only six hundred female trees. Dry acid grasslands have some unusual species. Some areas are gazed by horses.|$|R

50|$|On the {{doorstep}} of the Peak District, the reservoir (as well as the surrounding woodland) is owned by United Utilities and supplies the town of Macclesfield with drinking water. Although a working environment, the area is a haven for wildlife. Perhaps {{best known for its}} heronry (thought to be the largest in the Peak District, with over 20 breeding pairs), the reserve is also home to ravens and birds of prey. Red deer are shy residents of the forest but can often be seen drinking from the reservoir in early morning. Changing water levels occasionally expose the reservoir banks, which become a popular feeding ground for small wading birds, including common sandpipers, green sandpipers and <b>little</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers.</b> Flocks of crossbills are regularly seen feeding in the treetops, and winter visitors include goldeneyes and goosanders.|$|R
