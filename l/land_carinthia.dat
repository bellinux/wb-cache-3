50|$|During the Protestant Reformation the Bayerhofen Castle residence, first {{mentioned}} in 1239 and rebuilt in the 16th century, became {{a center of}} Lutheranism, which nevertheless was suppressed by the Counter-Reformation. In 1759 the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa acquired all Bamberg <b>lands</b> in <b>Carinthia.</b> Wolfsberg Castle was purchased by Count Hugo Henckel von Donnersmarck in 1846 and rebuilt in a Tudorbethan style.|$|R
500|$|Illyria was {{abolished}} in 1849 and {{the crown}} <b>lands</b> of <b>Carinthia,</b> Carniola, and Austrian Littoral (...) {{were established in}} its place, with the latter including the Krk and Cres– Lošinj island groups. Through the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868 a corpus separatum was formed containing the city of Rijeka, as a territory directly controlled by Hungary. In 1881, the military frontier, containing the Senj and Velebit foothills, was absorbed by the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.|$|R
50|$|Slovenia offers {{tourists}} a {{wide variety}} of landscapes: Alpine in the northwest, Mediterranean in the southwest, Pannonian in the northeast, and Dinaric in the southeast. They roughly correspond to the traditional regions of Slovenia, based on the former four Habsburg crown <b>lands</b> (Carniola, <b>Carinthia,</b> Styria, and the Littoral). Each offers its own natural, geographic, architectural, and cultural features. Slovenia has mountains, meadows, lakes, caves, and the sea, making it an attractive destination in Europe.|$|R
50|$|As {{a cousin}} of late King Albert II, Frederick became a {{candidate}} for the imperial election. On 2 February 1440, the prince-electors convened at Frankfurt and unanimously elected him King of the Romans as Frederick IV; his rule was still based on his hereditary <b>lands</b> of Styria, <b>Carinthia</b> and Carniola, or Inner Austria.|$|R
40|$|In the {{northeast}} of Italy, between the Adriatic Sea and the Eastern Alpine Arc, lies the Friuli Venetia Giulia (FVG) region. It borders with the Italian Veneto region, the <b>Land</b> of <b>Carinthia</b> in Southern Austria and the Republic of Slovenia. In geographical terms, {{the potentialities of}} this territory are evident. The region is interested by two important European corridors, {{in terms of both}} highways and railway infrastructures. The whole system of infrastructure and productive areas located in this region can be considered as parts of a unique territorial strategic platform. The paper is aimed at exploring this scenario...|$|R
50|$|Prior to his {{imperial}} coronation, he was duke of the Inner Austrian <b>lands</b> of Styria, <b>Carinthia</b> and Carniola from 1424, {{and also}} acted as regent over the Duchy of Austria (as Frederick V) from 1439. He was elected and crowned King of Germany (as Frederick IV) in 1440. He was the longest-reigning German monarch when in 1493, after ruling his domains {{for more than}} 53 years, he was succeeded by his son Maximilian I.|$|R
5000|$|The Order of Saint George (Ordo militaris Sancti Georgii; St. Georgs-Orden) is an Austrian chivalric order {{founded by}} the Habsburg emperor Frederick III and Pope Paul II in 1469. Established as a {{military}} order to advocate the Christian faith, its original implicite goal was to combat the Ottoman incursions into the Inner Austrian <b>lands</b> of Styria, <b>Carinthia</b> and Carniola. The order resided at Millstatt Abbey and in Wiener Neustadt, until in 1598 its properties were {{handed over to the}} Jesuit college in Graz.|$|R
50|$|The army {{proceeded}} by <b>land</b> through <b>Carinthia,</b> {{with the}} permission of Duke Henry V, and then through Bulgaria without incident, relying on Anselm's negotiations with Alexius I Comnenus, Byzantine emperor, to assure them of markets and supplies. At Constantinople, rioting broke out, but he and Albert quelled it with ease and he refused the rich gifts offered by the emperor, who ferried the soldiery across the Bosphorus. At Nicomedia, in Asia Minor, he met Raymond IV of Toulouse, one of the leading barons of the capture of Jerusalem. Guided by Raymond, the army marched through Anatolia, skirmishing with the Turks at Kastamonu and between Merzifon and Amasya. These initial confrontations were successes for the Lombards. Anselm fought in these engagements and received wounds which he went to Constantinople to nurse. There he died and was buried. News of his death did not reach Milan until 1102. He was succeeded by Grossolano.|$|R
50|$|In 1098, he {{inherited}} his father's Bavarian possessions around the Ammersee and Lake Starnberg, {{as well as}} those in Upper Franconia. Around 1120, he could succeed the comital Sigimar dynasty as bailiff (Vogt) of Benediktbeuern Abbey, and thereby increased his influence considerably. He co-founded the abbey of Dießen (where in 1130 he was documented to be bailiff) and maintained relations with Admont Abbey in the March of Styria. When his daughter Kunigunde entered Admont Abbey, he donated 15 Hufen (oxgangs) of <b>land</b> in Moosburg, <b>Carinthia</b> to the monastery.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, Charles' {{younger brother}} Ferdinand I claimed his rights and became Archduke of Austria {{according}} to an estate distribution at the 1521 Diet of Worms, whereby he became regent over the Austrian archduchy and the adjacent Inner Austrian <b>lands</b> of Styria, <b>Carinthia,</b> Carniola and Gorizia (Görz). By marrying Princess Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, Ferdinand inherited both kingdoms in 1526. Also King of the Romans from 1531, he became the progenitor of the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg (Habsburg-Lorraine from 1745 on), which as Archdukes of Austria and Kings of Bohemia ruled as Holy Roman Emperors until the Empire's dissolution in 1806.|$|R
50|$|The Habsburg, who {{had ruled}} the {{territory}} of Austria since the Late Middle Ages, greatly increased their political prestige and power with the acquisition of the lands of the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia in 1526. The Hungarian aristocracy was more successful at retaining the Magyars' cultural and political preponderance in multi-ethnic Hungary than Bohemia, on three sides surrounded by German neighbours, which underwent a period of intense German colonisation, germanizing the leading classes of the Czech people as well. The common German identity of <b>lands</b> such as <b>Carinthia,</b> Styria, or Tyrol, and the ruling dynasty {{made it easier for}} these lands to accept the central government set up in Vienna in the mid-18th century.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Haider had {{concentrated}} his politics on Carinthia. In addition, Haider's personal life was heavily connected with {{this part of}} Austria: Haider became wealthy in 1983 when he inherited the estate of Wilhelm Webhofer, who had owned a large parcel of <b>land</b> in <b>Carinthia</b> commonly known as [...] "Bärental" [...] (bear valley). This estate has a history that {{came up in the}} 1990s in the Austrian media. The land had been owned by an Italian Jew until 1941. At that point in time the Nazis still hesitated to take possession of property owned by non-German Jews without any compensation. Inside Italy, Jewish property was not yet open for confiscation and the Mussolini government was not inclined to allow this happen to Jewish nationals abroad either. Thus when the estate was sold in 1941, one Josef Webhofer (a former resident of South Tyrol, Italy, and an Optant) paid 300,000 Reichsmark (about $1.5 million today) to obtain title to the land. After the war Mathilde Roifer, the widow of the former Jewish owner of Bärental, demanded compensation. Despite a panel finding that the property was fairly sold, Webhofer paid Roifer an additional 850,000 schillings (about $1 million today). In 1955 Josef Webhofer's son Wilhelm Webhofer, not a blood relative of Jörg Haider's but rather a [...] "Wahlonkel" [...] or uncle-by-choice, inherited the estate and later bequeathed it to Haider. Today the land is estimated to be worth about $15 million.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} the war and the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain stipulated the Carinthian Canal Valley stretching from Tarvisio as far as Pontafel (172 square miles) [...] go to Italy and that the Slovene-speaking areas of the Meža Valley, the Drava Valley area around Unterdrauburg, which was afterwards renamed Dravograd, and the Jezersko area (128 square miles of territory) be ceded to the new SHS State. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, however, was not satisfied with these parts of the former duchy and also occupied land north of the Karawanks mountain range, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. The Entente powers decided on a two-stage referendum, of which the first stage, the Carinthian Plebiscite was held on 10 October 1920 to determine the fate of Carinthia. The outcome in favour of Austria did not change the borders as decided upon in the Treaty of Saint-Germain.The Austrian part of the former duchy today forms the federal state of <b>Carinthia</b> (<b>Land</b> Kärnten), while the area that was ceded to Italy as a part of the claimed [...] "Julian March" [...] belongs to the autonomous region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Most of the area awarded to Yugoslavia (cf. Slovenian Carinthia) now forms part of the larger Carinthia Statistical Region in Slovenia.|$|R
40|$|The main {{goals in}} common European {{environmental}} policy are {{the preservation of}} natural values, biotic diversity and assuring the healthy human environment. Tourist areas, which development is usually based on an intact nature, {{on the other side}} represent with their high number of tourists a heavy load on the environment. Lake areas are especially vulnerable and therefore have to be minutely treated and need good working management models. In this graduation thesis a comparison of lake management between Bled and comparable Austrian places is shown. Areas from this region are used because the province of <b>Carinthia</b> (<b>Land</b> Kärnten) has many stagnant waters and also it lies near Slovenia. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a detailed description of Lake Bled is shown; moreover, its main problems are presented there. Because most of the infrastructures have already been built in Bled, problems are more of the organizational and managerial nature. Then, in the second part, the basics of Austrian environmental legislation are shown, with the emphasis on the relation between municipality – region – state. The third part includes the description of the basics characteristics of the Carinthian lakes. In the middle of the previous century, the eutrophication problems emerged in the Carinthian lakes, too. Consequently, they disabled the tourist development, and for that reason the Carinthian government, already in the year 1964, passed a program with all necessary sanitation and remedial measurements. The description of these is shown in the present thesis. Furthermore, the possibilities of financing the environmental projects, which are used in Austria, are also shown. All implemented infrastructures and a quite high number of lakes claim an integral and systematic organizational, managerial and monitoring approach; therefore, the management structure with the description of certain stakeholder tasks is also part of the thesis. Three lakes, which have the comparable morphological characteristics to Lake Bled, and they are also important for the tourist development of surrounding areas, are described in details. In the last part, the comparison with Bled is made (a management model, monitoring results, prices for municipal services) and some solutions for improving the management with our tourist pearl are suggested, above all to improve the communication among the main stakeholders...|$|R
