5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E

30|$|Femoral trochanteric {{fractures}} {{were investigated}} {{with respect to}} area classification. In area classification, the proximal femur is divided into 4 areas with 3 boundary lines: Line- 1 {{is the center of}} the neck; Line- 2 is the border between the neck and the trochanteric zone; and Line- 3 links the inferior borders of the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters.</b> A fracture in only the third area was classified as type 3; one {{in the second and third}} areas was classified as type 2 – 3.|$|R
25|$|The {{anterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} the iliopsoas, {{a group of}} two or three muscles with a shared insertion on the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> of the femur. The psoas major originates from the last vertebra and along the lumbar spine to stretch down into the pelvis. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa on the interior side of the pelvis. The two muscles unite to form the iliopsoas muscle which is inserted on the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> of the femur. The psoas minor, only present in about 50 per cent of subjects, originates above psoas major to stretch obliquely down to its insertion on the interior side of the major muscle.|$|E
25|$|Less commonly, the iliopsoas tendon {{catches on}} the {{anterior}} inferior iliac spine (AIIS), the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter,</b> or the iliopectineal ridge during hip extension, as the tendon moves from an anterior lateral (front, side) to a posterior medial (back, middle) position. With overuse, the resultant friction may eventually cause painful symptoms, resulting in muscle trauma, bursitis, or inflammation in the area.|$|E
25|$|Trochanteric {{fractures}} are {{subdivided into}} either intertrochanteric (between the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter)</b> or pertrochanteric (through the trochanters) by the Müller AO Classification of fractures. Practically, {{the difference between}} these types is minor. The terms are often used synonymously. An isolated trochanteric fracture involves one of the trochanters without going through the anatomical axis of the femur, and may occur in young individuals due to forceful muscle contraction. Yet, an isolated trochanteric fracture may not be regarded as a true hip fracture because it is not cross-sectional.|$|E
30|$|Images were {{obtained}} on a 64 multi-detector CT system (Toshiba Aquilion). The patient was positioned supine with arms above their {{head and the}} scan range was from above the diaphragms (lung bases) to the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters.</b> Images were acquired in the arterial phase after injection of 100  ml of intravenous contrast material (Omnipaque® 300, GE healthcare). The following acquisition parameters were used: 120  kV, reference tube 182 mAs, 0.5  s rotation time, helical pitch 53. The slice thickness was 1  mm and sections were reconstructed in the axial, coronal and sagittal planes of 3 [*]×[*] 3  mm.|$|R
30|$|The intertrochanteric {{region of}} the femur is acted upon by several forces. The Psoas muscle flexes abducts and {{externally}} rotates the proximal fragment. The adductors acting on the distal fragment cause shear forces as the proximal fragment is abducted by the gluteus minimus and maximus. Any osteotomy in this region also has to consider the 1, 200  lb/sq inch forces in the sub-trochanteric region [2]. The idea of an osteotomy through the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters</b> envisages {{the use of the}} proximal forces to advantage as the proximal fragment with a ledge gets locked beneath the distal fragment. The anterior ledge gives additional stability.|$|R
30|$|The post-contrast scan is {{acquired}} using a bolus tracker {{placed in}} the aortic arch, with a threshold trigger of 100  HU and a delay trigger of 9  s and extends cranio-caudally from the skull basis to the femoral <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters,</b> with a 16 [*]×[*] 1.5 -mm collimation and a pitch of 1.15, using the CARE dose 4 D automatic exposure control (Siemens Medical Systems). Moreover a portal venous phase scan of the abdomen is acquired with a fixed delay of 70  s after injection start, extending cranio-caudally with a 16 [*]×[*] 1.5 -mm collimation, pitch 0.75 and using CARE dose 4 D automatic exposure control modality.|$|R
25|$|The psoas major {{joins the}} upper body and the lower body, the axial to the appendicular skeleton, the inside to the outside, and the back to the front. As part of the iliopsoas, psoas major {{contributes}} to flexion in the hip joint. On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its supine position. In addition, attachment to the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter,</b> located on the postero-medial aspect of the femur, causes lateral rotation and weak adduction of the hip.|$|E
25|$|Of the hindlimb, {{the lower}} leg is missing. The femur or thigh bone is {{straight}} and robust. The <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> is markedly {{lower than the}} greater trochanter and separated from it by a narrow cleft. It has {{the shape of a}} wing-like expansion to the front. An accessory or posterior trochanter is lacking; likewise a fourth trochanter on the back shaft is absent. The tibia has only a weak cnemial crest, separated from its outer condyle by a deep narrow groove, the incisura tibialis. The fibula is broad on top but has a slender shaft.|$|E
25|$|On the femur, the <b>lesser</b> <b>{{trochanter}}</b> extends {{below the}} level of the femoral head, unlike Yunnanosaurus and Jingshanosaurus. Viewed from the front, the trochanter is close to the midline of the bone, like other basal sauropodomorphs except for Antetonitrus and Melanorosaurus (in which it is closer to the outer edge). Similarly, the fourth trochanter is near the midline, in contrast to many basal sauropodomorphs, including Lufengosaurus. Of the two processes {{on the bottom of the}} tibia, the one in the back is thinner, and projects more outwards than downwards than the one in front; this differs from most other sauropodomorphs in which the two are equally thick, and either they project equally outwards (as in Lufengosaurus and Jingshanosaurus) or the front one projects further outwards (as in Yunnanosaurus).|$|E

Various classifications {{were compared to}} “area classification. ” In “area classification,” the proximal femur is divided into 4 areas with 3 boundary lines: Line- 1 {{is the center of}} the neck, Line- 2 is the border between the neck and the trochanteric zone, and Line- 3 links the inferior borders of the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters.</b> A fracture only in the first area was classified as a pure first area fracture; one in the first and second area was classified as a 1 - 2 type fracture. In the same way, fractures were classified as pure 2, 3 - 4, 1 - 2 - 3, and so on. “Area classification” reliability was highest when orthopedists with varying experience classified proximal femoral fractures using 3 DCT. Other classifications cannot classify proximal femoral fractures if they exceed each classification’s particular zones. However, fractures that exceed the target zones are “dangerous” fractures. “Area classification” can classify such fractures, and it is therefore useful for selecting osteosynthesis methods...|$|R
25|$|The {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the thigh are innervated by the obturator nerve, {{with the exception of}} pectineus which receives fibers from the femoral nerve, and the adductor magnus which receives fibers from the tibial nerve. The gracilis arises from near the pubic symphysis and is unique among the adductors in that it reaches past the knee to attach on the medial side of the shaft of the tibia, thus acting on two joints. It share its distal insertion with the sartorius and semitendinosus, all three muscles forming the pes anserinus. It is the most medial muscle of the adductors, and with the thigh abducted its origin can be clearly seen arching under the skin. With the knee extended, it adducts the thigh and flexes the hip. The pectineus has its origin on the iliopubic eminence laterally to the gracilis and, rectangular in shape, extends obliquely to attach immediately behind the <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> and down the pectineal line and the proximal part of the linea aspera on the femur. It is a flexor of the hip joint, and an adductor and a weak medial rotator of the thigh. The adductor brevis originates on the inferior ramus of the pubis below the gracilis and stretches obliquely below the pectineus down to the upper third of the linea aspera. Except for being an adductor, it is a lateral rotator and weak flexor of the hip joint. The adductor longus has its origin at superior ramus of the pubis and inserts medially on the middle third of the linea aspera. Primarily an adductor, it is also responsible for some flexion. The adductor magnus has its origin just behind the longus and lies deep to it. Its wide belly divides into two parts: One is inserted into the linea aspera and the tendon of the other reaches down to adductor tubercle on the medial side of the femur's distal end where it forms an intermuscular septum that separates the flexors from the extensors. Magnus is a powerful adductor, especially active when crossing legs. Its superior part is a lateral rotator but the inferior part acts as a medial rotator on the flexed leg when rotated outward and also extends the hip joint. The adductor minimus is an incompletely separated subdivision of the adductor magnus. Its origin forms an anterior part of the magnus and distally it is inserted on the linea aspera above the magnus. It acts to adduct and lateral rotate the femur.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these fragmentary teeth, the Maevarano Formation has also yielded a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of an immature, cat-sized mammal {{that has not yet}} been fully described. It is the most complete mammal known from the Mesozoic of Gondwana. Its skull is damaged, but its unusual dentition is preserved. The incisors (two {{on each side of the}} upper and one on each side of the lower jaw) project forwards and are separated from the three or four cheektooth in each side of the lower and upper jaws by a large diastema (gap). It shows primitive features, such as the presence of epipubic bones (in the pelvis), a septomaxilla (a small bone placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla in the upper jaw), and a deep zygomatic arch (cheekbone). On the other hand, it has derived traits like the presence of a well-developed trochlea on the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone), the absence of a rim at the dorsal (upper) margin of the acetabulum (the opening in the pelvis which receives the head of the femur), a small <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanter</b> of the femur (upper leg bone), reduced contact between the fibula (the smaller of the two lower leg bones) [...] and the calcaneum (heel bone), and the dentition. In a 2000 abstract, Krause identified it as a therian (a member of the group that includes marsupials, placentals, and their closest extinct relatives) more derived than the early Cretaceous Vincelestes of Argentina, but in 2006 he and colleagues instead refused to place it in any existing higher-order mammalian group and claimed that [...] "it represents a major new nontherian clade".|$|E

30|$|Subtrochanteric femoral {{fractures}} in children are uncommon and have received limited {{attention in the}} literature. Its treatment is controversial, and different options are available: traction, spica casting, internal fixation and external fixation. The {{aim of this study}} is to present our results with external fixation of subtrochanteric femoral {{fractures in}} children using Ilizarov frame. Between January 2012 and January 2014, 14 patients with closed subtrochanteric femoral fractures were treated in Cairo University School of Medicine Teaching Hospital. The average age at the time of injury was 6.4  years (range 3.8 – 11.5  years). Pathological fractures and fractures associated with neuromuscular diseases were excluded from this study. Two patients were multiply injured with abdominal injuries (as ruptured spleen). In all cases, a low profile Ilizarov frame was inserted using two half pins inserted proximally from greater to <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters</b> parallel to the hip joint orientation line (line between tip of greater trochanter and femoral head centre) and secured to an arch, and another three half pins were inserted distally perpendicular to the femoral shaft and secured to an arch that was connected by three rods to the proximal arch. No post-operative spica was used. Average follow-up was 18  months (range 12 – 36  months). All fractures united with anatomical alignment within an average of 8  weeks (range 6 – 12  weeks). There were no deep infections and no significant limb length discrepancies. At the latest follow-up, no patient had any restriction of activities. External fixation with a low profile Ilizarov frame appears as a good treatment option for subtrochanteric femoral fractures in children.|$|R

40|$|Although {{osteoporosis}} reduces overall {{bone mass}} causing bone fragility, recent studies {{report that the}} remaining bone tissue is significantly stiffer. Preliminary studies indicate that alterations in bone tissue mineral content might explain these changes, albeit that other studies report conflicting observations. The objective {{of this study is}} to quantify whether the distribution of bone tissue mineral is altered during oestrogen deficiency. Individual trabeculae were harvested from the proximal femur of 7 ovariectomised sheep (OVX), sacrificed 12 months post-surgery, and 5 age-matched controls. Mineral content (wt% Ca) was determined using a quantitative backscattered scanning electron microscopy imaging approach. Mineral heterogeneity within individual trabeculae was compared by calculating the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of mineral density distributions. Mean calcium content, the spatial distribution of mineral within trabeculae and the inter-trabecular variation between regions of proximal femora were also compared. Oestrogen deficiency increased mineral heterogeneity within individual trabeculae compared to healthy controls, as measured by FWHM (3. 57 ? 0. 68 vs. 3. 17 ? 0. 36 wt% Ca, p = 0. 04). In particular mineral variability increased between superficial and deep regions of trabeculae of OVX animals (p = 0. 04). Interestingly, mineralisation variability between greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters</b> (i. e. intertrochanteric fracture line) was increased in OVX compared to CON, as indicated by a greater % difference in the standard deviation of trabecular mineral content (77. 11 ? 11. 70 vs. 45. 64 ? 23. 70 %, p = 0. 03). Such changes are undetectable by evaluating the mean mineral content of bone tissue, but may contribute to changes in bone mechanical strength following osteoporotic bone loss...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} femoral neck {{anteversion}} on bone mineral density (BMD) and geometry {{as measured by}} dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was assessed using 64 right proximal femora from 36 male and 28 female cadavers. The anteversion angle was measured on computed tomography (CT) images, and DXA measurements were made both in the neutral position (i. e, at 0 degree anteversion, femoral neck axis parallel to the table) and in the simulated anteverted position (i. e., femoral shaft axis parallel to the table, greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>trochanters</b> {{in contact with the}} table, and femoral neck free). The mean anteversion angle measured by CT was 19. 3 degrees (range 6 degrees- 38 degrees). Anteversion was associated with a significant elevation in femoral neck BMD of + 2. 8 % (range - 5. 3 %-(+) 9. 8 %) (p < 0. 05), and the femoral neck BMD increased with increasing anteversion (p < 0. 01). Trochanteric BMD was less affected by anteversion, with an average increase of only 0. 2 % (range - 5 %- 5. 9 %) (p = n. s.) in the anteverted position, but there was a significant positive association between the change in trochanteric BMD and the anteversion angle (p < 0. 01). Anteversion produced a mean reduction of - 2. 4 % (range - 7. 6 %-(+) 4. 3 %) (p < 0. 001) in apparent femoral neck axis length, while femoral neck width remained generally unaffected. These data confirm that femoral BMD as measured by DXA is affected by femoral anteversion with a lesser magnitude than previously reported. The use of trochanteric BMD may minimize the influence of anteversion. While the mean changes in BMD and neck axis length attributable to anteversion are modest, the considerable interindividual variability in the magnitude of the effects demonstrates that other factors, such as, the complex geometry of femoral neck modifies the effect of anteversion on BMD measurements. The error in BMD introduced femoral anteversion may represent a significant confounding influence in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Careful repositioning of the foot and leg is essential in monitoring changes in BMD longitudinally. Knowledge of the effects of femoral anteversion may assist in understanding the relation of femoral BMD and neck axis length to hip fracture. status: publishe...|$|R

Methods: Twenty-two participants with PFJ OA and 11 controls aged ≥ 40 years were recruited from the community and practitioner referrals. Muscle volumes of individual quadriceps components were measured from thigh magnetic resonance (MR) images. The CSA of the VM and lateralis were measured at 10 equally distributed levels (femoral condyles to <b>lesser</b> femoral <b>trochanter).</b> Results: PFJ OA individuals had smaller normalized VM (mean difference 0. 90 cm ·kg, α = 0. 011), VL (1. 50 cm ·kg, α = 0. 012) and rectus femoris (0. 71 cm ·kg, α = 0. 009) volumes than controls.

30|$|Different {{techniques}} {{based on}} the same surgical principles but utilizing different implants for internal or external fixation of either intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric valgus osteotomies have been described for the surgical correction of coxa vara. The surgical technique most commonly used to achieve correction is the laterally based, intertrochanteric Y-shaped wedge osteotomy described by Pauwels [6], considered to be state of the art in the surgical management of infantile coxa vara [2]. Pauwels’s Y-shaped osteotomy is performed between the <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>trochanters</b> and perpendicular to the femoral shaft. It corrects the neck–shaft angle but the femoral shaft is positioned medially. However, it compromises the hip joint’s integrity, potentially endangering the nourishing vessels of the femoral head and thus increasing the risk of avascular necrosis [2]. Medial displacement in such patients should be strongly avoided as it exacerbates the loading of the distal femoral physis and the lateral compartment of the knee in patients with knee deformity (genu valgum), which is commonly also seen in cases of coxa vara [7].|$|R
