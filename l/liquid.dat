40|$|AbstractRecently, ionic <b>liquids</b> were {{verified}} to be combustible {{instead of}} nonflammable; the contrary {{was thought to}} be true due their extremely low vapor pressure.

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among <b>liquid</b> molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the <b>liquid,</b> each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring <b>liquid</b> molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards.

If a <b>liquid</b> is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the <b>liquid</b> and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the <b>liquid</b> and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E
40|$|Background. Some {{electronic}} cigarette (EC) <b>liquids</b> of tobacco flavour contain extracts of cured tobacco leaves {{produced by a}} process of solvent extraction and steeping. These are commonly called Natural Extract of Tobacco (NET) <b>liquids.</b> The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate nicotine levels and the presence of tobacco-derived toxins in tobacco-flavoured conventional and NET <b>liquids.</b> Methods. Twenty-one samples (10 conventional and 11 NET <b>liquids)</b> were obtained from the US and Greek market. Nicotine levels were measured and compared with labelled values. The levels of tobacco-derived chemicals were compared with literature data on tobacco products. Results. Twelve samples had nicotine levels within 10 % of the labelled value. Inconsistency ranged from − 21 % to 22. 1 %, with no difference observed between conventional and NET <b>liquids.</b> Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) were present in all samples at ng/mL levels. Nitrates were present almost exclusively in NET <b>liquids.</b> Acetaldehyde was present predominantly in conventional <b>liquids</b> while formaldehyde was detected in almost all EC <b>liquids</b> at trace levels. Phenols were present in trace amounts, mostly in NET <b>liquids.</b> Total TSNAs and nitrate, which are derived from the tobacco plant, were present at levels 200 – 300 times lower in 1 mL of NET <b>liquids</b> compared to 1 gram of tobacco products. Conclusions. NET <b>liquids</b> contained higher levels of phenols and nitrates, but lower levels of acetaldehyde compared to conventional EC <b>liquids.</b> The lower levels of tobacco-derived toxins found in NET <b>liquids</b> compared to tobacco products indicate that the extraction process used to make these products did not transfer a significant amount of toxins to the NET. Overall, all EC <b>liquids</b> contained far lower (by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude) levels of the tobacco-derived toxins compared to tobacco products...|$|R

5|$|Anisotropy of <b>liquid</b> {{crystals}} is {{a property}} not observed in other fluids.

This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
