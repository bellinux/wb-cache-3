40|$|AbstractRecently, ionic <b>liquids</b> were {{verified}} to be combustible {{instead of}} nonflammable; the contrary {{was thought to}} be true due their extremely low vapor pressure.

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among <b>liquid</b> molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the <b>liquid,</b> each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring <b>liquid</b> molecules, resulting in a net force of zero.

If a <b>liquid</b> is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the <b>liquid</b> and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the <b>liquid</b> and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container.

40|$|Background. Some {{electronic}} cigarette (EC) <b>liquids</b> of tobacco flavour contain extracts of cured tobacco leaves {{produced by a}} process of solvent extraction and steeping. These are commonly called Natural Extract of Tobacco (NET) <b>liquids.</b> The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate nicotine levels and the presence of tobacco-derived toxins in tobacco-flavoured conventional and NET <b>liquids.</b> Methods. Twenty-one samples (10 conventional and 11 NET <b>liquids)</b> were obtained from the US and Greek market. Nicotine levels were measured and compared with labelled values. The levels of tobacco-derived chemicals were compared with literature data on tobacco products. Results. Twelve samples had nicotine levels within 10 % of the labelled value. Inconsistency ranged from âˆ’ 21 % to 22. 1 %, with no difference observed between conventional and NET <b>liquids.</b> Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) were present in all samples at ng/mL levels. Nitrates were present almost exclusively in NET <b>liquids.</b> Acetaldehyde was present predominantly in conventional <b>liquids</b> while formaldehyde was detected in almost all EC <b>liquids</b> at trace levels. Phenols were present in trace amounts, mostly in NET <b>liquids.</b> Total TSNAs and nitrate, which are derived from the tobacco plant, were present at levels 200 â€“ 300 times lower in 1 mL of NET <b>liquids</b> compared to 1 gram of tobacco products. Conclusions. NET <b>liquids</b> contained higher levels of phenols and nitrates, but lower levels of acetaldehyde compared to conventional EC <b>liquids.</b> The lower levels of tobacco-derived toxins found in NET <b>liquids</b> compared to tobacco products indicate that the extraction process used to make these products did not transfer a significant amount of toxins to the NET. Overall, all EC <b>liquids</b> contained far lower (by 2 â€“ 3 orders of magnitude) levels of the tobacco-derived toxins compared to tobacco products...|$|R

5|$|Anisotropy of <b>liquid</b> {{crystals}} is {{a property}} not observed in other fluids.

When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change.
