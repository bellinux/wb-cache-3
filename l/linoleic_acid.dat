5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid,</b> with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E

40|$|Japanese quail hens {{were used}} to study the effect of feeding palmitic, oleic or <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> on the {{reproductive}} performance, tissue fatty acid composition and embryo lipid metabolism. Quail fed palmitic acid consumed more feed than those fed either oleic or <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> The highest level of reproductive performance was observed in quail fed palmitic acid followed by those fed oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> The highest level of embryo survival, observed in the palmitic acid fed group, was associated with more rapid mobilization and assimilation of yolk material by the embryo during incubation {{and it was not}} related to changes in eggshell quality. High levels of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> were found in egg yolk, plasma and liver lipids from quail fed oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively. However, feeding palmitic acid resulted in elevated levels of palmitoleic acids in all three tissues. The fatty acid profiles of phospholipid, triglyceride and cholesterol esters of embryonic tissues were consistently influenced by the fatty acid composition of the yolk lipids and the stage of development. Feeding palmitic acid promoted more retention of labeled fatty acids in embryo lipids. Labeled oleic acid was preferentially esterified in the cholesterol ester fraction of yolk sac membrane lipids, and it appears that this fatty acid is utilized to a great extent by the quail embryo during its development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNigella sativa {{seed oil}} {{was found to}} contain a {{modulator}} of Na,K-ATPase. Separation analyses combined with 1 H NMR and GCMS identified the inhibitory fraction as a mixture of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> These two fatty acids are specifically concentrated in several medicinal plant oils, and have particularly been implicated in decreasing high blood pressure. The ouabain binding site on Na,K-ATPase has also been implicated in blood pressure regulation. Thus, we aimed to determine how these two molecules modify pig kidney Na,K-ATPase. Oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> did not modify reactions involving the E 1 (Na+) conformations of the Na,K-ATPase. In contrast, K+ dependent reactions were strongly modified after treatment. Oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> were found to stabilize a pump conformation that binds ouabain with high affinity, i. e., an ion free E 2 P form. Time-resolved binding assays using anthroylouabain, a fluorescent ouabain analog, revealed that the increased ouabain affinity is unique to oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids,</b> as compared with γ-linolenic acid, which decreased pump-mediated ATP hydrolysis but did not equally increase ouabain interaction with the pump. Thus, the dynamic changes in plasma levels of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> are important in the modulation of {{the sensitivity of the}} sodium pump to cardiac glycosides. Given the possible involvement of the cardiac glycoside binding site on Na,K-ATPase in the regulation of hypertension, we suggest oleic acid to be a specific chaperon that modulates interaction of cardiac glycosides with the sodium pump...|$|R

40|$|One {{constraint}} {{facing the}} pig industry is that {{ad libitum feeding}} can often result in high levels of body fat and technologies which can reduce the ratio of lean to fat deposition in the pig are continually being explored. Conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> {{have been shown to}} decrease body fat content in pigs. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether dietary conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> supplementation has any effect on meat quality and carcass characteristics in finisher pigs. Sixty female crossbred (Large White × Landrace) pigs (average initial weight 56. 6 ± 1. 9 kg and average initial P 2 backfat 11. 4 ± 1. 3 mm) were used in the present study. Pigs were individually housed and randomly allocated to 1 of 6 dietary treatments: 0, 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 or 1. 0 % (w/w) of conjugated linoleic acids- 55. The wheat-based diets were formulated to contain 14. 3 MJ DE and 9. 3 g available lysine per kg and were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks. Pigs were slaughtered and meat quality was determined on the longissimus thoracis using standard techniques. Dietary conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> reduced subcutaneous back fat in a linear manner with effects being most pronounced in the middle back fat layer. There was also a linear (P < 0. 001) decrease in intramuscular fat with increasing dietary conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> supplementation. However, there was no effect of conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> on subjective measures of marbling of the loin. Also, loin muscle ultimate pH (P = 0. 94), lightness values (P = 0. 46) subjective colour scores (P = 0. 79), cooking loss (P = 0. 71), drip loss (P = 0. 40), shear force (P = 0. 61) and subjective measures of wetness/firmness (P = 0. 19) were unaffected. Dietary conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> did not alter oxidation, as measured by the level of TBARs at day 1 post-slaughter (P = 0. 38) or after 9 days of simulated retail display (P = 0. 35). These data confirm that dietary conjugated <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> can improve carcass quality by decreasing back fat depths without having any detrimental effects on meat quality. <br /...|$|R

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of S.brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe—18.4% {{of the dry}} weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), oleic acid was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by palmitic acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid—a {{member of the group}} of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.|$|E

40|$|White Nose Syndrome (WNS) greatly {{increases}} the over-winter mortality of little brown (Myotis lucifugus), Indiana (M. sodalis), northern (M. septentrionalis), and tricolored (Perimyotis subflavus) bats, and {{is caused by}} cutaneous infections with Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) are highly resistant to Pd infections. Seven different fatty acids (myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, and, <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids)</b> occur in the wing epidermis of both M. lucifugus and E. fuscus, 4 of which (myristic, palmitoleic, oleic, and, <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids)</b> inhibit Pd growth. The amounts of myristic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> in the epidermis of M. lucifugus decrease during hibernation, thus we predicted that the epidermal fatty acid profile of M. lucifugus during hibernation has a reduced ability to inhibit Pd growth. Laboratory Pd growth experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. The results demonstrated that the fatty acid profile of M. lucifugus wing epidermis during hibernation has a reduced ability to inhibit the growth of Pd. Additional Pd growth experiments revealed that: a) triacylglycerols composed of known anti-Pd fatty acids do not significantly affect growth, b) pentadecanoic acid inhibits Pd growth, and c) 1 -oleoglycerol, which {{is found in the}} wing epidermis of E. fuscus, also inhibits the growth of this fungus. Analyses of white adipose from M. lucifugus also revealed the selective retention of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> in this tissue during hibernation...|$|R

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid,</b> one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E

Increased sPLA 2 activity (202  µmol/min/mL [188 – 258]) and FFA concentration (0.44  mmol/L [0.39 – 0.46  mmol/L]) were found. FFA qualitative analysis demonstrated an inflammatory profile, with increased levels of oleic, palmitic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids,</b> when compared to healthy subjects. Conversely, the arachidonic acid concentrations were decreased. Within-group changes suggested a decrease in the repeated concentrations of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> (p =  0.1).|$|R
