5|$|In {{the darkest}} night of hate and {{intolerance}} we see impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally 'allowed' to be love... It is for <b>love</b> <b>that</b> transcends the romantic conception {{of man and}} woman and stretches out into the impossibilities of the cosmos. It leaves room for failure but hopes for success.|$|E

Most men knew of that.|$|E

5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free <b>love</b> <b>that</b> became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Outside the temple, Nadir waits {{beside the}} funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn {{and the coming}} double {{execution}} (""). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of <b>love</b> <b>that</b> awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return ("!").|$|E
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly <b>love</b> <b>that</b> which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E

5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this <b>love</b> <b>that</b> could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and <b>love</b> <b>that</b> has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in <b>love,</b> <b>that</b> is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I <b>love</b> <b>that,</b> that's the best experience.|$|E

25|$|Love, a theme {{throughout}} the Divine Comedy, {{is particularly important}} for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the <b>love</b> <b>that</b> flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with <b>love</b> <b>that</b> is either not strong enough (Sloth) or <b>love</b> <b>that</b> is too strong (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from {{the church and the}} Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.|$|E
