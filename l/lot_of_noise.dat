5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultures}} of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, animal stereotypes grew until {{by the time of}} Virgil, animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, Homer uses animal similes in the Iliad and the Odyssey, where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion simile {{at the end of the}} Odyssey, where in Book 22 Odysseus kills all Penelope's suitors. In the Iliad, Homer compares the Trojans to stridulating grasshoppers, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the Aeneid, Book 4, Virgil compares the world of Dido, queen of Carthage, with a colony of ants. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|On the Lac du Bourget, {{with several}} {{thousand}} people in addition {{to tens of thousands}} of tourists, the water quality had gradually deteriorated from the 1950s to 1970 in a major phenomenon of eutrophication, since the lake at the time was the natural outlet of all sewer pipes, with in particular, Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains. Many motor vehicles of the time were also highly polluting, spitting their fumes which partially dissolved in the waters and spilt oil which was also found in the lake. They made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and noise generated was damaging to birds and small mammals. A remediation action has been engaged since the mid-1970s, in order to reduce the eutrophication of the lake, the aim being to arrive at the same results as for Lake Annecy.|$|E
40|$|The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is {{unsupervised}} neural net-work {{introduced by}} Teuvo Kohonen. SOM attracts attentions for clustering in these years.

40|$|Abstract — Since we can {{accumulate}} a {{huge amount}} of data including useless information in these years, it is important to investigate various extraction method of clusters from data in-cluding a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises.</b> The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) attracts attentions for clustering in these years. In our past study, we have proposed a method of using simultaneously two kinds of SOMs whose features are different (SOM), namely, one self-organizes the area on which input data are concentrated, and the other self-organizes the whole of the input space. Further, we have applied this method to clustering of data including a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> and have confirmed the efficiency. However, in order to obtain an efficient clustering performance using this method, we must determine the appropriate number of the SOMs used in the method. This problem has been remedied by proposing the Peace SOM (PSOM) method, however, PSOM algorithm must be used after executing the SOM method. In this study, we propose a method of using plural SOMs (TSOM: Tentacled SOM) for effective data extraction, which possesses both abilities of SOM and PSOM. Each SOM of TSOM can catch the information of other SOMs existing in its neighborhood and self-organizes with the competing and accommodating behaviors. The behavior of TSOM is investigated with applications to data extraction from input data including a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises.</b> We can confirm that TSOM successfully extracts clusters even in the case that we do not know the number of clusters in advance.

25|$|Positioned on {{the left}} of the Austrian army, in and around the {{strategic}} village of Markgrafneusiedl, Feldmarschalleutnant Prince Rosenberg-Orsini was in command of the 18,140 men and 60 cannons of the IV Korps. In addition, attached to his force was the much-battered Advance Guard, under Feldmarschalleutnant Nordmann, reduced to around 6,000 infantrymen and some cavalry support, as well as the 3,120 cavalrymen from Feldmarschalleutnant Nostitz's division. Receiving his orders in due time, Rosenberg began to organise his attack, forming the IV Korps into three large columns, preceded by an advance guard. The first column was formed by Hessen-Homburg's brigade, 6 battalions strong, which was directed towards the village of Grosshofen. The second column was 16 battalions strong (12 regular and four Landwehr battalions) and included the brigades of Swinburn and Weiss, with the orders to move on to Glinzendorf. The second column was preceded by an advance guard under Feldmarschalleutnant Radetzky, 10 battalions and 10 cavalry squadrons strong. The third column, under Nostitz, was 30 squadrons strong and was directed to outflank the French, towards Leopoldsdorf. Setting these troops in motion towards 4:00, just as his orders stated, Rosenberg instructed his commanders to maintain absolute silence among the rank and file as they advanced but, despite this, the troops moved forward in some disorder and with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert gave On Stranger Tides {{two out of}} four stars, {{saying that}} {{although}} the removal of Knightley and Bloom {{as well as the}} addition of Cruz were positive aspects, the film in general was [...] "too much of a muchness" [...] for him.

500|$|The {{relationships}} among the families of lemurs have been problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. [...] Two competing phylogenies exist based on genetic and molecular data. [...] One approach (Horvath etal.) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species. [...] This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. [...] The other approach (Orlando etal.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. [...] Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. [...] However, two problems create complications for both approaches. [...] First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. [...] In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42mya; such distant splits create a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> for molecular techniques.|$|E

Attempting to leave the area, B11 briefly grounded herself, breaking the surface, but was able to get herself off. B11s compass became fogged and prevented the submarine from navigating at depth; instead Holbrook had to [...] the boat at periscope depth which meant he had to go through the minefields, not below them.
