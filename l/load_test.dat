Salthouse Field has a light railway running round the perimeter {{and is used}} for donkey rides in the summer. The shore consists of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour at {{the western edge of}} the town at the mouth of the Land Yeo. The rocky beach has been designated as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Clevedon Pier, opened in 1869, is one of the earliest surviving examples of a Victorian pier. On 17 October 1970, two outward spans collapsed when the seventh set of legs from the shore failed during a routine insurance <b>load</b> <b>test.</b> A trust was eventually formed and the pier and its buildings were restored and reopened on 27 May 1989, when the Waverley paddle steamer berthed and took on passengers. Other landmarks include Walton Castle, Clevedon Court the Clock Tower and the Curzon Cinema. Clevedon's light industry is centred mainly in industrial estates including Hither Green Trading Estate near the M5 motorway junction. It is a dormitory town for Bristol. The town is home to educational, religious and cultural buildings and sports clubs.|$|E

25|$|The nail's design {{began when}} its inventor, civil {{engineer}} Ed Sutt, {{traveled to the}} Caribbean {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Marilyn. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95mph (155km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the findings showed that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse. Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the Clemson Wind <b>Load</b> <b>Test</b> Facility, which had received funding through a grant from FEMA. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity. The outcome of the project's research showed {{that the best way to}} strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the roofing and wall sheathing to the internal frame, and with this information Sutt signed on as a fastener engineer for the Stanley subsidiary, Bostitch.|$|E

2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. [...] Allowable bearing stress is the {{bearing capacity}} divided {{by a factor of}} safety. [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate <b>Load</b> <b>Test</b> is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 November 2005, {{an article}} in the Times-Picayune {{revealed}} that sonar soundings discovered that the steel sheet pilings of the levee floodwall were 2.1m (7ft) less deep than engineering specifications. Sample pilings pulled up were found to be of the length specified in the design (17 feet), but it was then revealed that this length was less than the actual depth of the canal, in retrospect an obvious engineering mistake. Current analysis concludes that the catastrophic breach was due to faulty design, rather than storm surge higher than what the canal was designed to withstand. According to an article published in the August 2015 issue of the official journal of the World Water Council, the Army Corps of Engineers misinterpreted the results of a Sheet Pile <b>Load</b> <b>test</b> (E-99 Study) conducted in the mid 1980s and concluded they needed to drive sheet pilings to depths of not more than 17 feet, rather than the necessary 31 to 46 feet. This move saved millions but greatly reduced overall engineering reliability.|$|E
2500|$|Independent {{tests of}} the nail's stretch were {{conducted}} by several organizations, including Florida International University and the International Code Council. Those tests confirmed what the researchers at Bostitch had claimed, that they had created a better nail. Among all of the different tests, {{it was found that}} the new nail had twice the [...] "uplift capacity" [...] of other power driven nails, as well as increasing a home's resistance to wind and increasing earthquake resistance by up to 50%. For further testing, Sutt asked for the assistance of Scott Schiff, the coordinator of the graduate program in civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Clemson University. Tests at the Clemson Wind <b>Load</b> <b>Test</b> Facility confirmed what had already been stated. With equipment to simulate the force of winds, roofs attached with traditional nails were pulled apart at around 13,500 pounds of force (60.1 kN). At forces up to 16,000 pounds (71kN), walls built with the HurriQuake environment nail showed minimal wall movement. As the pressure increased to 17,000 pounds (75kN), then 18,000 (80kN), then 19,000 (85kN), the walls began to make creaking and groaning noises but they still stayed attached. As the test rig pushed 20,000 pounds (89kN), the maximum it was capable of testing, it gave out, showing that the HurriQuake environment nail sustained 20,000 pounds of force (89kN) and still was not sheared or completely pulled out.|$|E
30|$|In this study, two matched {{specimen}} {{groups were}} tested by short-term ramp loading and low cycle trapezoidal fatigue loading, respectively. To limit {{the influence of}} environmental variables on the damage accumulation process, the low cycle trapezoidal fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> were chosen since the time duration of these tests is relatively short [18, 19]. The cyclic load levels for the trapezoidal fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> were determined based on the short-term ramp <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> data. Compared with the long-term constant loading method, more damage will be accumulated {{in the same period}} of time during the trapezoidal fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>test,</b> so the total test time of the trapezoidal loading can be reduced.|$|R

2500|$|The {{project had}} a long and {{difficult}} gestation— {{while it was still}} being built, original owner Kenneth Reiner (with whom Lautner collaborated closely) was bankrupted by the fraudulent dealings of his business partners and he was forced to sell the house. Lautner also faced opposition from the Los Angeles building certification authorities, who were dismayed by the radical design of the post-stressed concrete ramp, which cantilivers out {{from the base of the}} house without any columns supporting it from beneath, and is only four inches thick. Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles building inspector demanded a static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> to prove that it could take the weight of a car— a standoff that mirrored Lautner and Wright's earlier contretemps with skeptical building authorities who demanded load tests on Wright's famous [...] "lotus pad" [...] columns for the Johnson Wax Building. In the event, Lautner's load calculations proved flawless and in fact the instruments recorded more deflection in the concrete from the change in temperature when the sun went down than they did from the weight of the sandbags loaded onto the ramp to test it. The project then sat unfinished for some time. When it became available through bankruptcy in 1974, Philip and Jacklyn Burchill bought the home. They worked with Lautner to complete the home and moved in 1976.|$|E
