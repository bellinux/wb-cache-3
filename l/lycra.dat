In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or <b>lycra.</b>|$|E
25|$|Retailer Marks & Spencer reintroduced the {{material}} {{used as an}} alternative to nylon in swimsuits in the 1960s. While <b>Lycra</b> is used in most swimsuits designs because of its high elasticity, lower expense, and water wicking nature, its major drawback is that it breaks down in chlorine, commonly found in swimming pools. When worn daily, a swimsuit made of <b>Lycra</b> will break down in about 2–3 months. Speedo introduced Fastskin in 2007 as the lightest and fastest material for competitive swimwear. Unlike <b>lycra,</b> it does not break down in chlorine.|$|E

25|$|Protection {{from heat}} loss {{in cold water}} is usually {{provided}} by wet suits or dry suits. These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. Where thermal insulation is not important, <b>lycra</b> suits/diving skins may be sufficient.|$|E
25|$|After the war, DuPont {{continued}} {{its emphasis on}} new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and <b>Lycra</b> in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were {{critical to the success}} of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.|$|E
25|$|During this case, Christie raised {{another of}} his grievances with the media – {{comments}} about the figure-hugging running suits that Christie wore in his races.

25|$|In the 20th century, DuPont {{developed}} many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and <b>Lycra.</b> DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, {{and later}} more environmentally friendly refrigerants.

25|$|Turkish costumes {{are usually}} in the bedlah style. Distinctive {{features}} of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around the top edge, {{and a great deal}} of embellishment and beaded fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than <b>lycra.</b>|$|E
25|$|Williams {{has been}} noted for her unusual and {{colorful}} outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when she wore a black <b>lycra</b> catsuit at the US Open. At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots—tournament officials, however, did not allow her to wear the boots during matches. At Wimbledon in 2008, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match {{was the subject of}} much discussion since it was worn despite the sunny weather.|$|E
25|$|Lint {{contamination}} {{also presents}} {{what may be}} the most serious threat of damage to delicate mechanical devices. In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering clean rooms are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from artificial fibers that are longer and thicker, and therefore much less likely to shed any material. Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like spandex (or <b>Lycra),</b> for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break, and longer, stronger non-woven polyolefin fibers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or <b>lycra</b> content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E
25|$|Gloves (sometimes laced or fingerless) were {{popularized by}} Madonna, {{as well as}} fishnet {{stockings}} and layers of beaded necklaces. Short, tight <b>Lycra</b> or leather miniskirts and tubular dresses were also worn, as were cropped bolero-style jackets. Black was the preferred color. Prior to the mid-1980s, it had been taboo to show a slip or a bra strap in public. A visible undergarment had been a sign of social ineptness. With the new fashion's most extreme forms, young women would forgo conventional outer-garments for vintage-style bustiers with lacy slips and several large crucifixes. This was both an assertion of sexual freedom and a conscious rejection of prevailing androgynous fashions.|$|E
500|$|Bikinis can {{and have}} been made out of almost every {{possible}} clothing material, and the fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are {{an essential element of}} their design. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey. DuPont's introduction of <b>Lycra</b> (spandex) in the 1960s completely changed how bikinis were designed and worn, as according to Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of The Bikini Book, [...] "the advent of <b>Lycra</b> allowed more women to wear a bikini...it didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore." [...] Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras complemented the {{adolescent}} boutique fashions of the 1960s, allowing those to be minimal. DuPont introduced <b>lycra</b> (DuPont's name for spandex) {{in the same}} decade. [...] Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits {{could be made to}} fit like a second skin without heavy linings. [...] "The advent of <b>Lycra</b> allowed more women to wear a bikini," [...] wrote Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of The Bikini Book, [...] "It didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore." [...] Increased reliance on stretch fabric led to simplified construction. It allowed designers to create the string bikini, and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini. Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early '70s.|$|E
500|$|Lucy O'Brien {{first came}} to like Madonna in 1985, {{when she saw the}} singer on television, {{performing}} on The Virgin Tour. She previously thought that Madonna [...] "was that cheesy pop bimbo in <b>lycra,</b> writhing on a Venetian gondola for the 'Like a Virgin' video." [...] However, The Virgin Tour changed her opinion and by the time Madonna's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan was released, O'Brien confessed that Madonna had won her admiration. The author had admired Madonna's lack of fear, and her ability to incorporate alternative culture and sexuality in her work.|$|E
500|$|The fitness {{boom of the}} 1980s led to one of {{the biggest}} leaps in the {{evolution}} of the bikini. According to Mills, [...] "The leg line became superhigh, the front was superlow, and the straps were superthin." [...] Women's magazines used terms like [...] "Bikini Belly", and workout programs were launched to develop a [...] "bikini-worthy body". The tiny [...] "fitness-bikinis" [...] made of <b>lycra</b> were launched to cater to this hardbodied ideal. Movies like Blue Crush and TV reality shows like Surf Girls merged the concepts of bikini models and athletes together, further accentuating the toned body ideal. Some women, motivated by yearly Spring Break festivities that mark the start of the bikini season in North America, engage in eating disorders in an attempt to achieve the ideal bikini body.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Warn, {{editor-in-chief}} of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com {{wrote that the}} episode's focus on Naomi and Emily [...] "was one of the best-developed and most honest depictions of a lesbian teenage relationship that I've ever seen on TV." [...] A critic for PopSugar.com thought both Naomi and Cook to be more likable after the episode and enjoyed {{the development of their}} friendship throughout. They found Emily's plea to Naomi as Naomi left the campsite [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and called Kieran [...] "one of my favourite recurring characters this series". Digital Spy's Dan French gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "full of lady-lovin'". He praised Naomi's relationship with Kieran, which he saw as a reference to the affair between Chris Miles, a first generation character from Skins first and second series, and his teacher Angie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that Naomi and Emily's storyline was [...] "definitely one of the best portrayals of teenage lesbians I've ever seen", writing that [...] "when the focus is more on cute girls falling for each other, this show isn't half bad". Another eurOut.org writer, Cate O'Neil, said that [...] "Naomi" [...] was [...] "probably the best individual lesbian episode I have seen on TV. Ever." [...] In response to O'Hanlon's nude scene as Kieran, Sara Nathan of The Sun said, [...] "If seeing [...] clad in <b>lycra</b> as Thermoman in My Hero wasn't bad enough, now he's leaving nothing to the imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{included}} Claire {{among the}} characters {{they would like}} to see returning for Resident Evil 6, with Schedeen calling Claire [...] "leagues above that walking bag of useless called Sheva." [...] PlayStation Universe also chose Claire in her original outfit from Resident Evil 2 as one of the five characters they wanted to appear in Resident Evil 6s Mercenaries mode as she [...] "is long overdue a canonical appearance in the series." [...] In 2012, RE6 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi wrote they have [...] "heard a lot of love for Jill and Claire recently and people asking if they’ll be in the next Resident Evil." [...] Including Claire among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, GamesRadar staff commented in 2013: [...] "Sadly she's fallen into the background of the series, which makes sense she avoided work as a government zombie hunter, but we hope Capcom has plans for her in the future. Here's a suggestion: a co-op focused RE that teams Claire up with the almost as underused Jill. It's your move Capcom." [...] Reacting to Claire's return in Revelations 2 IGN's Mitch Dyer wrote: [...] "The Resident Evil series places women in prominent, powerful, playable roles. Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers, Sheva Alomar, and Ada Wong, to name a few. Still, they're often opposite a male lead. This is the first time a Resident Evil game has revolved around the story of two women. It's fun to get to play as Claire again." [...] According to a CVG preview of Revelations 2, [...] "she's older, calmer and more capable, but she still retains everything that made her compelling in the first place. Where Rachael from the first [...] was part centrefold, part melted-ice cream, Claire feels distinct from many women in the Resi universe in that there's more to her than lady-lumps and <b>lycra.</b> She's the perfect choice for the game's brand of isolated horror." ...|$|E

2500|$|A singlet is a {{one-piece}} wrestling garment made of spandex {{that should}} provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from nylon or <b>lycra</b> and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage.

[...] Pictures were taken, scanned, processed and then digitally screen-printed to give the characters their bright red, explosive appearance. [...] The foliage seen on the heads and backs of some characters is made from crinyl and cristalette, which are both extremely light-weight materials.

Distribution was expanded by sales in large chain department stores such as JC Penney and Sears. The company also expanded production, opening manufacturing facilities in South America and Europe. In 1960, Warner Brothers Company purchased major American shirt manufacturer C.F. Hathaway strengthening the company’s foothold in the sportswear market. Warner Brothers went public in 1961 and was soon generating revenues in excess of $100 million. [...] In 1966, it acquired another large clothing maker, the White Stag Manufacturing Company.|$|E
2500|$|Feld also {{introduced}} multiple new variants on Wonder Woman's uniform beginning in season two.

A diving uniform was introduced—this consisted of a navy-blue <b>lycra</b> body suit with matching gloves, gold bracelets, flat boots, and a flexible tiara; this was featured whenever aquatic activity was required. The same uniform, with low-heeled boots and a gold helmet, was used to ride motorcycles. At first, Wonder Woman would switch to these newer uniforms by performing an extended spin in which she first changed from her Diana Prince clothes to Wonder Woman's standard uniform, then continued to spin until a second light explosion occurred and she would appear in one of the newer variants. However, this extended spin device was dropped for expediency and Diana was then able to change into any of Wonder Woman's uniforms in a single change.|$|E
