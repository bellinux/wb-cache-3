5000|$|High torque <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> {{wheel motor}} invented: The motor was {{incorporated}} into the wheel without gearing and addressed torque considerations {{through the use of}} a new high torque, <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> motor invented by Edward Parkhurst of Woburn, MA in patent # 422,149 in 1890 (and mismentioned in Parcelle's patent as #320,699).|$|R
5000|$|The ECU mapping revised for {{improved}} throttle response at <b>low</b> <b>rpm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... (AEC system: Same idea as the now {{standard}} {{power valve}} design, but using a 'butterfly flap' {{to open and}} close an addition chamber on the cylinder head (open @ <b>low</b> <b>RPM,</b> closed at higher). This effectively expands the exhaust system at <b>low</b> <b>RPM,</b> to allow the exhaust to be tuned for high RPM. The AEC system opens at around 7500 RPM) ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "technical update" [...] in 1998 {{included}} dual VANOS, which improved <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> torque.|$|R
5000|$|Variable exhaust: {{butterfly}} valve in upper tailpipes closed at <b>low</b> <b>rpm,</b> open at high rpm ...|$|R
50|$|Scavenging {{of small}} {{two-stroke}} engines relies on inertial scavenging through the Kadenacy effect. At <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> and <b>low</b> gasflow velocities, {{this effect is}} reduced. Scavenging thus becomes less effective when idling, {{and so it is}} when idling (at either <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> or <b>low</b> throttle) that four-stroking is most likely to become a problem. Schnuerle or loop scavenging is considered to be less prone than the simpler cross-scavenging.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the design}} overall {{pressure}} ratio of an engine cycle increases, {{it becomes more}} difficult to operate at <b>low</b> <b>rpm,</b> without encountering an instability known as compressor surge. This occurs {{when some of the}} compressor aerofoils stall (like the wings of an aircraft) causing a violent change {{in the direction of the}} airflow. However, compressor stall can be avoided, at <b>low</b> <b>rpm,</b> by progressively: ...|$|R
5000|$|Variable intake: {{butterfly}} valve in carbon fiber intake manifold closed at <b>low</b> <b>rpm,</b> open at high rpm ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{a running}} engine is coating the {{cylinder}} walls {{with much more}} oil than an engine that is being cranked at <b>low</b> <b>RPM,</b> which helps the seal.|$|R
50|$|A {{variant of}} the N54B30 with higher power and torque (but a slight {{reduction}} in <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> torque) {{is used in the}} F01 740i and E92 335is.|$|R
50|$|Motors: 2 Advanced DC Motors DC FB1-4001 9", one driving each {{rear wheel}} with over 1000 lbft Nm of {{combined}} torque at <b>low</b> <b>rpms.</b> 8,000 rpm redline.|$|R
50|$|Due to the <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> {{design and}} cast iron {{construction}} of these engines, {{it is not}} uncommon to see them reach over 300,000 mi before needing a major overhaul.|$|R
50|$|As the annular cutters require very <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> (from min 50 RPM), these cutters can {{be easily}} used with light duty {{drilling}} machines or portable magnetic base drilling machines.|$|R
50|$|In November 2013, Honda {{announced}} the CTX1300, a cruiser motorcycle {{powered by a}} version of the ST1300's engine modified for better fuel economy and increased torque at <b>low</b> <b>RPMs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Turbulence grooves may {{increase}} swirl inside the combustion chamber, thus increasing torque, especially at <b>low</b> <b>rpm.</b> Better mixing of the fuel/air charge improves combustion {{and helps to}} prevent knocking.|$|R
50|$|Anti-stall {{mechanisms}} in internal combustion engines are aimed to prevent stalling {{of the engine}} at <b>low</b> <b>rpm.</b> Anti-stall mechanisms use dashpots to arrest the final closing movement of the throttle.|$|R
50|$|With minor trail {{oriented}} modifications, Thundercat snowmobiles {{can produce}} {{in excess of}} 200 horsepower and reach speeds of 130+ miles per hour, while maintaining ride ability and smooth <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> performance.|$|R
50|$|The siema Yamaha X-1 {{is powered}} by a 2 valve, 4 stroke, 115cc motorcycle. It is a <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> motor that uses air cooling. Designed to beat Honda Wave 125 in {{performance}} and fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Automobile engines {{may also}} use a heat riser, which heats the air/fuel mixture after it has left the carburetor; this is a low {{temperature}} fuel economy and driveability feature with most benefits seen at <b>low</b> <b>rpms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hi-Dyne used a {{turbocharger}} {{characteristic curve}} that was adequate to provide full boost at <b>low</b> <b>rpm,</b> but was choked above this as engine speed increased, {{so that the}} boost reduced and thus also the output torque.|$|R
5000|$|The L-4 {{was used}} {{mostly on the}} Cessna UC-78 Bobcat, Cessna 195, and Stearman PT-18 Kaydet. [...] Due to the {{tendency}} of the L-4 engine to vibrate heavily at <b>low</b> <b>rpms</b> it was given the nicknames Shakin' Jake and Shakey Jake.|$|R
50|$|The GO-300's tainted {{reputation}} was largely undeserved, since its problems {{were the result}} of pilots who were unfamiliar with gear reduction engines, simply not operating the engine as specified in the C-175 Pilot's Operating Handbook. Pilots unfamiliar with the engine often operated the engine at the <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> settings (2300-2700) appropriate to direct-drive engines, while the 175's Operating Handbook called for cruising at 2900 <b>RPM.</b> The <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> caused harmonic vibration in the reduction gear between the quill shaft (that turned the propeller) and crankshaft, and the low power resulted in low airspeeds that prevented the engine's air-cooling system from operating effectively, resulting in chronic reliability problems for engines not operated at the recommended power settings.|$|R
25|$|The first Austro-Daimler six-cylinder {{engine was}} {{designed}} by Dr-Ing Ferdinand Porsche to be an aircraft engine from the outset. Of high quality manufacture the Austro-Daimler was modestly rated at relatively <b>low</b> <b>rpm,</b> which gave the engine family a reputation for robustness and reliability.|$|R
50|$|It {{also means}} that the torque and power curves of the engine are unusual. The engine {{produces}} peak torque and almost maximum power at a relatively <b>low</b> <b>RPM,</b> {{and from there to}} the rev limiter the torque drops and the power does not increase much.|$|R
25|$|Yanmar of Japan {{produced}} some small, charge-cooled rotor engines for chainsaws and outboard engines. One {{of its products}} is the LDR (rotor recess in {{the leading edge of}} combustion chamber) engine, which has better exhaust emissions profiles, and reed-valve controlled intake ports, which improve part-load and <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> performance.|$|R
50|$|Start - The {{pinion gear}} on the starter motor is engaged with the {{flywheel}} and the starter motor runs {{to turn the}} engine over. In most cases, only the left magneto is active (the right p-lead is grounded) due to timing differences between the magnetos at <b>low</b> <b>RPMs.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of vegetable oils, {{and in particular}} the palm oil, as fuel in the power generation has had a remarkable development in the last few years. Generally the vegetable oil can be used with a particular marine-derived diesel ICE, with <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> and an electric conversion efficiency of about 40...|$|R
50|$|On 3 May 2013, a Jetstream {{belonging}} to Avies got trouble with both engines after departure from Sveg. They had too <b>low</b> <b>RPM,</b> {{but there was}} no warning from the plane system for that. The pilots returned to Sveg and managed to get better power from the engines before landing.|$|R
50|$|The primary turbo (located at {{the left}} rear of the engine) {{delivers}} boost in the <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> and load range, while the secondary turbo comes in to aid mid-to-high range breathing. During the primary turbo stage, boost pressure is controlled by a conventional arrangement of an ECU-controlled duty-cycle solenoid and an internal wastegate.|$|R
30|$|As the {{centrifugation}} rpm increased, the UV-vis {{absorption of}} MOG- 90 decreased almost linearly (Fig.  3 e), suggesting a nearly uniform distribution of FLGO (size or weight). On the other hand, MOG- 60 showed a rather rapid decrease at <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> but relatively slow decrease at high rpm. A similar behavior was observed from MOG- 30 {{but with a}} much faster decrease at <b>low</b> <b>rpm.</b> This {{can be explained by}} the number of heavy (or large) FLGO present, which decreases in the order of MOG- 30, MOG- 60, and MOG- 90 solution, and indicated that a lower degree of oxidation resulted in a lower degree of exfoliation. As noted, however, very similar UV-vis absorptions were observed at 4  k rpm centrifugation, regardless of the oxidation time, suggesting that a very low degree of fragmentation occurred upon MS exfoliation for all solutions.|$|R
50|$|Yanmar Diesel, a Japanese engine maker, was {{pioneer in}} {{introducing}} reed valves for flow control at intake ports of its small Wankel engines, showing {{an improvement in}} torque and performances at <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> and under partial load of the engine. Toyota discovered the benefits of injecting fresh air into the Wankel RCE exhaust port, and also used a reed valve in prototypes where they tested the SCRE concept (Stratified Charge Rotary Engine). However, this kind of intake port arrangement never reached the production line for automobile size RCEs. According to David W. Garside, who developed the Norton line of Wankel-powered motorcycles, data from other RCE producers pointed that reed valves do improve performances at <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> and under partial load, but reduce the high speed power output of the engine, a feature considered inconvenient for motorcycle engines.|$|R
25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{camshaft}} can be advanced to produce better <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> torque, or retarded for better high RPM power. Changing cam timing moves the overall power produced by the engine down or up the RPM scale. The amount of change is very little (usually < 5 deg), and affects valve to piston clearances.|$|R
50|$|Due to SAE Net {{horsepower}} ratings, {{it appeared}} {{that there was a}} power drop from earlier engines {{but this is not the}} case. The Oldsmobile 455 also had significant torque at <b>low</b> <b>RPM.</b> For 1975 the 4-4-2 equipped with a 455 was rated by Oldsmobile at 190 hp @ 3400 rpm and 350 lb-ft @ 2000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Corresponding to the {{enlargement}} of the second generation body, the engine was changed from the E07A to the improved E07Z. About 20% while improving <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> torque, low-emission vehicles (LEV) became in compliance. In 5-speed MT and 3-speed AT with follow basically the second transmission, the AT car (Column Shift) was adopted. A new four-wheel drive powertrain is introduced.|$|R
50|$|In {{carbureted}} engines, poorly atomized fuel reduces {{efficiency and}} power at lower rpm (at higher rpm the large air speed keeps the mixture in suspension). The inlet manifold of a reverse-flow cylinder head may {{be connected to}} the exhaust by a heat riser to transfer further heat, improving <b>low</b> <b>rpm</b> response and emissions as a result.|$|R
5000|$|The {{timing of}} the {{camshaft}} can be advanced to produce better <b>low</b> <b>RPM</b> torque, or retarded for better high RPM power. Changing cam timing moves the overall power produced by the engine down or up the RPM scale. The amount of change is very little (usually < 5 deg), and affects valve to piston clearances.Refer to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz1RE0ugcfU ...|$|R
