50|$|The {{water demand}} in 2001 was 750 million <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> {{day and the}} actual supply is only 570 million <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day and the per capita usage is about 105 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day.

5000|$|Water for washing, {{drinking}} and cooking. Canada recommends 2 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> {{person per day}} for drinking plus an additional 2 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> person per day for cleaning and hygiene. New Zealand recommends 3 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> person per day for drinking. US recommends 1 gallon (3.78 <b>litres)</b> <b>per</b> person per day. Extra water for pets may be included as well.|$|R

50|$|Compared to a {{conventional}} boat powered by diesel with same functional features and safety standards which costs 231,000 US$, the solar ferry costs 370,000 US$. An efficient conventional boat consumes 120 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day (12 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour), or 3,500 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> month and 42,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> year of diesel. This amounts to 39,000 US$ for diesel (@ 0.93 US$/litre) and {{total operating costs}} including lube oil and other maintenance costs amounts to 44,600 US$ per year.|$|R
50|$|Pakistani and Afghani camels are {{supposed}} to produce the highest yields of milk, up to 30 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day. The Bactrian camel produces 5 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day and the dromedary produces an average of 20 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day. Intensive breeding of cows has created animals that can produce 40 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day in ideal conditions. Camels, with their ability to go 21 days without drinking water, and produce milk even when feeding on low-quality fodder, are a sustainable option for food security in difficult environments.|$|R
50|$|In both 2011/12 and 2012/13 the company's leakage {{figure was}} 69 million <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day, {{compared}} to a yearly average of 73 million <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day between 2005-10.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{difference}} between U.S. annual per capita alcohol consumption (8.6 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> year) and French consumption (11.4 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> year) is only 2.8 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> year more. Alcohol consumption in France is lower than in Luxembourg (15.6 litres), the Czech Republic (13.0 litres), Hungary (13.6 litres), Germany (12.0 litres), and Croatia (12.3 litres) where no similar paradoxes are observed.|$|R
50|$|The farmer {{memberships}} {{which stood}} at 45000 during takeover of dairies from the erstwhile Kerala Livestock Development & Milk Marketing Board during 1983 {{has grown to}} over 8.0 lakhs through 3100 milk Co-operatives {{by the end of}} 2013-14. Similarly, milk procurement has also shown a phenomenal growth from 52,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day during 1983 to over 10,00,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day in 2013-14. The success of the marketing network and customer acceptance has been proved by the growth in sales from 55,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day during 1983 to 12,10,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day by the end of 2013-14.|$|R
50|$|The spring {{flow rate}} is {{usually in the}} range of 0.5 to 2.0 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> second (8th {{magnitude}} spring), however some large boggomosses have a flow rate of up to 10.0 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> second (7th magnitude spring).|$|R

50|$|Muslim {{engineers}} used norias {{to discharge}} water into aqueducts which carried {{the water to}} towns and fields. Some of the norias used in the medieval Islamic world were as large as 20 meters in diameter, the norias at Hama being a surviving example still used in modern times (although currently only serving aesthetical purposes). It has 120 water collection compartments and could raise more than 95 <b>litres</b> of water <b>per</b> minute. Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi's Kitab al-Hawi in the 10th century describes a noria in Iraq that could lift as much as 153,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour, or 2550 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> minute. This {{is comparable to the}} output of modern norias in East Asia, which can lift up to 288,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour, or 4800 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> minute.|$|R
50|$|Maglekilde is {{the most}} {{powerful}} of several natural springs in Roskilde, Denmark. It formerly issued water at a rate of some 90,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour but has now dropped to 15,000 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> hour. A wellhouse was built over the spring in 1927. It is now listed.|$|R
50|$|The cost of {{conversion}} may be justified in areas where aviation gasoline costs significantly more than jet fuel, and {{by the fact that}} the diesel fuel flow at cruise is about 10 gallons (38 <b>litres)</b> <b>per</b> hour, compared to about 13.5 gallons (51 <b>litres)</b> <b>per</b> hour with the original engine.|$|R
50|$|In February 2010, the Iranian {{government}} implemented {{an energy}} price reform {{by which the}} energy subsidies were to be removed in five years; the most important price hike was in gasoline, as the price went up from 100 rials ($0.10 US) to 400 rials ($0.40 US) <b>per</b> <b>litre,</b> with a ration of 100 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> month for private passenger cars (later reduced to 60 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> month).|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{drinking}} water required is variable. It depends on physical activity, age, health, and environmental conditions. It is estimated that the average American drinks about one litre {{of water a day}} with 95% drinking less than three <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day. For those working in a hot climate, up to 16 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> day may be required.|$|R
50|$|The points system led to points trading, with points {{being sold}} {{for up to}} 25 Danish krone whilst {{the price of a}} bottle of beer was just 5 krone. However, {{consumption}} dropped from 18.7 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> person to 13.8 litres by 1980. Following the scrapping of the rationing system in 1982, consumption rose to 22 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> person.|$|R

50|$|The cave {{contains}} {{a number of}} water features which make it extremely difficult to explore, such as large waterfalls, ponds, dripstone pools, sumps, and siphons.

The water temperature is around , making it extremely cold year-round requiring appropriate clothing.|$|R

25|$|Hajipur, near Patna, {{remains a}} major {{industrial}} {{town in the}} state, linked to the capital city through the Ganges bridge and good road infrastructure. The level of urbanisation (10.5%) is {{below the national average}} (27.78%). Urban poverty in Bihar (32.91%) is above the national average of 23.62%.

50|$|National and {{international}} organisations have labelled Ireland {{as having a}} problem with over-consumption of alcohol. In 2003, Ireland had the second-highest per capita alcohol consumption in the world, just below Luxembourg at 13.5 <b>litres</b> (<b>per</b> person 15 or more years old), according to the OECD Health Data 2009 survey. According to the latest OECD figures, alcohol consumption in Ireland has dropped from 11.5 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> adult in 2012 to 10.6 <b>litres</b> <b>per</b> adult in 2013. However, research showed that in 2013, 75% of alcohol was consumed {{as part of a}} drinking session where the person drank six or more standard units (which equates to three or more pints of beer). This meets the Health Service Executive's definition of binge drinking.|$|R
