French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed. Americans drink {{three times as much}} coffee as tea. Marketing by U.S. {{industries}} is <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Greene {{published}} his {{book about the}} excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House. Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum, in which the findings are described in more detail. Howard-Davis was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for the post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artefacts and, with Brown, for their analysis.|$|E
50|$|On 9 and 16 March 2017, Leali was the {{starting}} goalkeeper in both UEFA Europa League last 16 legs against Besiktas, but was <b>largely</b> held <b>responsible</b> for his team's elimination due {{to at least}} three serious goalkeeping errors, one in the home game and two on the road; the respective matches ended 1-1 and 4-1 to the Turkish side.|$|R
5000|$|The later Greek {{historian}} Diogenes Laërtius dubiously {{reported that}} after the execution of Socrates [...] "Athenians felt such remorse" [...] that they executed Meletus and banished his associates from the city. He also argues that it was Antisthenes, the disciple of Socrates and founder of Cynicism, whom was <b>largely</b> thought <b>responsible</b> for the execution of Meletus.|$|R

5|$|Nodes were {{designated}} 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending upon {{how long they}} were expected to hold out. Home Guard troops were <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for the defence of nodal points and other centres of resistance such as towns and defended villages. Category 'A' nodal points and anti-tank islands usually had a garrison of regular troops.|$|E
5|$|Owen's {{argument}} that the Federal Reserve's deflationary stance was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for causing the Great Depression {{would have been considered}} unorthodox at the time he made it. In more recent decades, however, such a view has come to be widely accepted, {{due in large part to}} the influence of the 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} over 1,400 {{visual effects}} shots, and the London-based company Double Negative created more than 950 of them.

The family lived in a tied cottage, his oldest sister Lena <b>largely</b> being <b>responsible</b> for his early upbringing.|$|R
5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> {{for the production of}} the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E
5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for his casting. In {{the years}} leading up the {{production}} of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and wanted him to fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he found its production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered resistance from 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios was in need of renovation.|$|E
5|$|Climbié's {{death was}} <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for various changes in child {{protection}} in England, including {{the formation of}} the Every Child Matters programme, an initiative designed {{to improve the lives of}} children; the introduction of the Children Act 2004, an Act of Parliament that provides the legislative base for many of the reforms; the creation of ContactPoint, a database designed to hold information on all children in England and Wales (now no longer in operation); and the creation of the post of children's commissioner, who heads the Office of the Children's Commissioner, a national agency serving children and families.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Peter Villa led a {{management}} buyout of Air UK's charter business, resulting in reconstituting BIA as a charter-only airline and his departure from Air UK {{along with the}} four BAC One-Eleven 400s. In addition to the tough economic climate and merger blues during the airline's inception {{as a result of}} combining two organisations with vastly different cultures and management styles, the operation of these aircraft had <b>largely</b> been <b>responsible</b> for Air UK's poor financial performance that threatened the airline's survival.|$|R

50|$|A {{large portion}} of CERN, the European {{laboratory}} for particle physics, {{is located in the}} territory of Saint-Genis-Pouilly; the ALICE experiment is located {{on the periphery of the}} town, and the main entrance to the primary CERN campus (Meyrin) and the ATLAS experiment are located only 3 km from the centre of St Genis. CERN is the world's largest fundamental physics research laboratory and its presence has <b>largely</b> been <b>responsible</b> for the development of the community of St Genis since the middle of the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
5|$|Development of the LS {{began in}} 1983 as the F1 project, the code {{name for a}} secret {{flagship}} sedan. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process {{at a cost of}} over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his role on the councils, Laybourne Smith was an adviser during {{the development of the}} State Building Act of 1923, and he was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for the framing of the 1939 Architects Act, (which provided for the formal registration of architects in South Australia). Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a direct result of his involvement {{in the creation of the}} Architects Act.|$|E

50|$|As the Commission's mandate {{was one of}} inquiry, {{no action}} was taken against most of those warned by it, but rather {{recommendations}} were made. Most Jewish politicians were determined to be <b>largely</b> not <b>responsible,</b> with the exception being the Internal Security Ministry, Prof. Shlomo Ben-Ami. The commission recommended that he be removed from his post, and he would later become foreign minister. Also, three Arab figures (two Arab members Knesset {{and the head of}} the northern branch of the Islamic movement in Israel) were found to be partially responsible by incitement that preceded the riots.|$|R
2500|$|The {{domestic}} dog has <b>largely</b> been <b>responsible</b> {{for introducing}} canine distemper to previously unexposed wildlife and now causes a serious conservation threat to {{many species of}} carnivores and some species of marsupials. The virus contributed to the near-extinction of the black-footed ferret. It also {{may have played a}} considerable role in the extinction of the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and recurrently causes mortality among African wild dogs. In 1991, the lion population in Serengeti, Tanzania, experienced a 20% decline {{as a result of the}} disease. [...] The disease has also mutated to form phocid distemper virus, which affects seals.|$|R
5|$|Lincoln is <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for the {{institution}} of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{due to the}} {{influence}} of Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Ælfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984, and was consecrated on 19October that year. While bishop he was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> {{for the construction of a}} large organ in the cathedral, audible from over a mile (1600m) away and said to require more than 24men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches, and promoted the cult of Swithun and his own predecessor, Æthelwold of Winchester. One act promoting Æthelwold's cult was the translation of Æthelwold's body to a new tomb in the cathedral at Winchester, which Ælfheah presided over on 10 September 996.|$|E
5000|$|Friends of Science (FoS) is a Canadian {{non-profit}} {{advocacy organization}} based in Calgary, Alberta. The organization takes a position that humans are <b>largely</b> not <b>responsible</b> for the currently observed global warming, contrary to the established scientific position on the subject. Rather, they propose that [...] "the Sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change," [...] not human activity. They argued against the Kyoto Protocol. The society was founded in 2002 and launched its website in October of that year. They are {{considered by many to}} promote climate change denial. They are largely funded by the fossil fuel industry.|$|R

50|$|Chinetti {{also was}} {{the founder of the}} North American Racing Team, an {{official}} arm of Ferrari. It became the team that established the high ranking of Ferraris in American racing circuits, and <b>largely,</b> was <b>responsible</b> for Ferrari's survival as a retailer of cars through the quantity he sold to wealthy individuals in North America. The team, sometimes abbreviated as N.A.R.T., also had a very successful endurance racing program both at Sebring and at Le Mans, right into the 1970s. In addition to the racing cars, the team commissioned many limited-run special variants of Ferrari road cars, most notably, the spyder version of the Ferrari 275GTB/4.|$|R
