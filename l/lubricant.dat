5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It is a good <b>lubricant</b> at both low and high {{temperatures}} (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN <b>lubricant</b> is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative <b>lubricant)</b> would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E
5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much <b>lubricant.</b> Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive <b>lubricant.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the prevalence {{and type of}} rectal <b>lubricants</b> use and factors associated with exclusive use of latex-condom compatible <b>lubricants</b> (water-based <b>lubricants)</b> among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) using data from a large-scale cross-sectional survey conducted in 2009 / 10 in three Indian states. Using time-location cluster sampling, 3880 [*]MSM were recruited from cruising sites. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between type of <b>lubricants</b> used and sociodemographic and programmatic indicators. Among those who reported using <b>lubricants</b> (64 %) more than half (53 %) exclusively used water-based <b>lubricants,</b> less than one-tenth used exclusively oil-based <b>lubricants,</b> and nearly 40 % used both water-based and oil-based <b>lubricants.</b> Factors associated with exclusive use of water-based <b>lubricants</b> were exposure to HIV prevention interventions (AOR: 6. 18, 95 % CI 4. 82 to 7. 92) and kothi-identified MSM—feminine/anal-receptive (AOR: 2. 56, 95 % CI 2. 12 to 3. 10). Targeted HIV interventions among MSM need to promote and distribute latex condom-compatible <b>lubricants</b> for use during anal sex—irrespective of their presumed or stated sexual role in anal sex, and educate them not to use oil-based <b>lubricants</b> with condoms...|$|R

5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or <b>lubricant</b> {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted <b>lubricant</b> or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and <b>lubricant.</b> c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E

50|$|Most {{widely used}} <b>lubricants</b> {{in use today}} are of the {{hydrophobic}} category. Hydrophobic <b>lubricants</b> are generally good <b>lubricants</b> and are usually effective at relatively low concentrations. Many also have both anti- adherent and glidant properties.

5|$|In {{the areas}} in which it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin.

5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a <b>lubricant,</b> the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a solid <b>lubricant</b> and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong {{films on}} metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E

Graphite is combined with clays to form the 'lead' used in pencils used for writing and drawing.

The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave <b>lubricant</b> and material from the bullets on the hands.

5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a <b>lubricant</b> and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E

40|$|Conventional liquid <b>lubricants</b> fail {{to perform}} {{adequately}} in extreme environments, i. e. at high temperatures and loads. As an example, modern turbine engines require bearings which can operate {{at up to}} 800 °C under loads of several Mpa at relative velocities of up to 50 m/s. Dry particulate <b>lubricants</b> are promising candidates for such applications [1]. The required functionalities of particulate <b>lubricants</b> are their load carrying capability, accommodation of the velocity difference and separation of the first bodies. Of course, a small coefficient of friction (COF) is energetically favorable.

5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor <b>lubricant,</b> and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E

Gaining his flying certificate with the Royal Aero Club at Hendon in October, he joined the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant on 14January 1916.

In bivalves, the foot is adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from the foot.|$|E
