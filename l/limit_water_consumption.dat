40|$|The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) {{extension}} plan {{includes the}} construction of a third lane with new locks at both sides of the Canal. The design ship is a so-called Post- Panamax 12 000 TEU container carrier. In order to maximize the transit throughput of the new locks, and at the same time, to limit hawser forces under an acceptable maximum threshold, many numerical studies and two physical model studies have been carried out. In a first phase, the filling and emptying (F/E) system of the locks has been preoptimized with numerical models (1 D, 2 D and 3 D models). Then, to complete the design, a study have been carried out on a 1 / 30 physical scale model at Compagnie Nationale du Rhône Hydraulic Laboratory, Lyon, France, operating as member of the consortium CPP. The F/E system is a “double culverts” sidewall and ports system composed of: a main culvert connected by a central flow divider to two secondary culverts in middle section of the lock chamber; each secondary culvert is equipped with 10 ports which feed the lock on 80 % of its length. In order to <b>limit</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumption,</b> each lock includes 3 Water Saving Basins (WSB). The scale model represents two locks chambers, 3 WSB associated with the lower chamber, a fore and a tail bay. The Post-Panamax container ship vessel is also modelled. A special emphasis is put on the hawser forces measurements and in the definition of a threshold value for them as no standard values presently exists for Post-Panamax locks given such operating conditions (use of water saving basins or not, hydraulic heads ranging from 3. 5 m to 20 m). The experimental setup and the scenarios of tests are described and an overview of the main results (F/E times, times series of water levels with and without ship in the lock chamber, time series of hydraulic efforts on the ship hull) are given. The results of this physical model are an input for the design-build tender for {{the construction of}} the third set of locks, presently in progress...|$|E
40|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{a separation}} method {{used for the}} beneficiation of a considerable portion of the world's mineral ores. The majority of flotation occurs in mechanical flotation cells, where effective gas dispersion is a primary requirement for particle-bubble contacting. Due to the mineralogical complexity of ores, it is required that particles be ground even finer to liberate valuable minerals. Mining operations tend to run flotation circuits at fairly high solids concentrations in order to maximise residence time, accommodate higher tonnages and <b>limit</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumption.</b> Mineral slurries processed at fine particle sizes and high solids concentrations {{have been shown to}} exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behaviour. The effect of slurry rheology on gas dispersion in a 100 litre mechanical flotation cell was investigated by varying the solids concentration. The study was conducted using kaolin, Bindura nickel and Platreef slurries. All three ores displayed typical non- Newtonian rheological behaviour where the slurry yield stress and viscosity increased exponentially with solids concentration. Bubble size varied from 0. 55 to 1. 10 mm for all the ores tested. At low solids concentration bubble size was found to decrease with impeller speed, a characteristic trend that was expected. At moderate solids concentrations bubble size was found to either increase/remain relatively constant with impeller speed; this trend was also expected. Unexpectedly, at the highest solids concentration, a dramatic decrease in bubble size was observed. This unexpected drop in bubble size was attributed to slurry rheology. It was also observed that there was a slight increase in bubble size at the highest solids concentration with increasing impeller speed. This increase was attributed to a trade-off relationship between the rheology of the slurries and the existing hydrodynamics (as a result of the rotating impeller). Gas hold-up varied from 2 to 15 % across all the ores tested. At low solids concentrations gas hold-up increased with impeller speed as expected. At moderate solids concentration gas hold-up was viewed to either increase/remain relatively constant with impeller speed. A significant drop in gas hold-up was observed at the highest solids concentration. The gas hold-up however still increased with impeller speed albeit at a lower rate at the highest solids concentrations. This drop in gas hold- up at the highest solids concentration (along with the decrease in bubble size) was attributed to the effect of slurry rheology. At high solids concentrations, all three slurries (kaolin, Bindura nickel and Platreef) exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour illustrated by means of high viscosities and yield stresses. High viscosities result in turbulence damping in the cell which inhibits bubble break-up, resulting in larger bubbles and correspondingly lower gas hold-up. It was concluded in this study that the yield stress is the dominant rheological property due to the significant changes observed with increasing solids concentration. High yield stresses resulted in the formation of a 'cavern' of slurry around the impeller region. Within this 'cavern', high power intensities exist around the impeller where small bubbles are formed. However due to the formation of the 'cavern', the slurry in the bulk cell remains relatively stagnant. As a result small bubbles formed around the impeller remain localised in the 'cavern' and cannot be dispersed throughout the cell. This localization and poor dispersion of bubbles resulted in low gas hold-ups...|$|E

This situation has been followed by more and more restrictive legislation aimed at <b>limiting</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> and thermal pollution. Rejecting enormous quantities of heat in large condensation type thermoelectric plants has {{become more and more}} of a problem. In some cases the solution has been found in the use of dry cooling towers that exploit the atmosphere's own cooling power. Given the very low density of the water vapour at the condenser, however, this solution calls for very big exchangers and leads to a rise in heat rejection temperature. To solve these and other problems, the idea of using alternative fluids in the cooling circuit, or even in the final phase of expansion, has been presented. Thus experimental systems have been built using ammonia both in dry cooling towers and in bottoming cycles.

Water deficit {{was applied for}} 4 weeks. Physiological parameters, {{including}} stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E), leaf and soil water potentials (Ψleaf; Ψsoil), and pot water loss, were monitored throughout the stress. Moreover, ABA, H 2 O 2 contents, and the expression of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (NCED 3), regulation of abscisic acid signaling (ABI 1), and coding for a catalase enzyme (CAT 2) known to favor H 2 O 2 scavenging were monitored. During the experiment gs, A, and E values were {{most of the time}} higher in 2 x compared to 4 x. During the water deficit period, pot water loss decreased faster in 2 x compared to 4 x, leading to a faster decrease in all physiological parameters in 2 x. The higher sensitivity of 2 x compared to 4 x was correlated with more numerous thinner roots, higher leaf ABA and H 2 O 2 contents, and with the lower leaf water potential. ABI 1 and NCED 3 expression was not strictly correlated with the ABA content. However, the higher CAT 2 expression in 4 x was correlated with the lower leaf H 2 O 2 contents.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Small {{commercial}} and non-commercial animal enterprises (SCAEs) raise a few beef cows, horses, pigs, sheep, poultry, {{and other animals}} on a few acres. These enterprises are often located in suburban areas of watersheds and show potential for degrading water quality through to increased bacterial, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. SCAEs implement Best Management Practices (BNIPs) {{on a voluntary basis}} to control their water quality impacts. Off-stream watering areas, with animal access to streams, and covered manure storages are two BMPs which were analyzed in this thesis for effectiveness in reducing bacteria, nitrogen, and phosphorus from entering surface and groundwater in four SCAEs. The four cooperating SCAEs were located in the Tualatin River Basin, and the potential water quality improvements from implementing these two practices in all SCAEs in the basin were discussed. The BMP analyses use results from several studies. Two of these studies analyzed off-stream watering areas for reducing time animals spend watering at the stream. This time was measured and used to estimate the manure defecated in the stream. Reducing time animals spend at the stream decreases direct defecations in the stream and reduces water quality impacts of SCAEs. A third study analyzed a pasture pump as a possible off-stream watering device. It was analyzed for its ability to provide water to 27 Holstein dairy heifers without <b>limiting</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumption.</b> Daily <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> from the pasture pump was not significantly different than daily consumption from an open water trough.

The approach is developed for the case of the Office du Niger and based on a field study of 3 years. First, a simulation model is presented in which all relevant physical and social aspects of water management at the farmers' level are considered. Next, simulations are performed to evaluate the impact on performance of different combinations of management practices and different external conditions. Finally, the combinations are selected that succeed in <b>limiting</b> seasonal <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> to 1, 400 mm and avoiding irrigation problems, but which are also realistic from a farmer's point of view.

40|$|This {{report is}} the third {{in a series of}} reports {{sponsored}} by the U. S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Program in which a range of water-related issues surrounding geothermal power production are evaluated. The first report made an initial attempt at quantifying the life cycle fresh water requirements of geothermal power-generating systems and explored operational and environmental concerns related to the geochemical composition of geothermal fluids. The initial analysis of life cycle fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> of geothermal power-generating systems identified that operational water requirements consumed the vast majority of water across the life cycle. However, it relied upon <b>limited</b> operational <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> data and did not account for belowground operational losses for enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs). A second report presented an initial assessment of fresh water demand for future growth in utility-scale geothermal power generation. The current analysis builds upon this work to improve life cycle fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates and incorporates regional water availability into the resource assessment to improve the identification of areas where future growth in geothermal electricity generation may encounter water challenges. This report is divided into nine chapters. Chapter 1 gives the background of the project and its purpose, which is to assess the <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> of geothermal technologies and identify areas where water availability may present a challenge to utility-scale geothermal development. <b>Water</b> <b>consumption</b> refers to the water that is withdrawn from a resource such as a river, lake, or nongeothermal aquifer that is not returned to that resource. The geothermal electricity generation technologies evaluated in this study include conventional hydrothermal flash and binary systems, as well as EGSs that rely on engineering a productive reservoir where heat exists, but where water availability or permeability may be limited. Chapter 2 describes the approach and methods for this work and identifies the four power plant scenarios evaluated: a 20 -MW EGS binary plant, a 50 -MW EGS binary plant, a 10 -MW hydrothermal binary plant, and a 50 -MW hydrothermal flash plant. The methods focus on (1) the collection of data to improve estimation of EGS stimulation volumes, aboveground operational consumption for all geothermal technologies, and belowground operational consumption for EGS; and (2) the mapping of the geothermal and water resources of the western United States to assist in the identification of potential water challenges to geothermal growth. Chapters 3 and 4 present the water requirements for the power plant life cycle. Chapter 3 presents the results of the current data collection effort, and Chapter 4 presents the normalized volume of fresh water consumed at each life cycle stage per lifetime energy output for the power plant scenarios evaluated. Over the life cycle of a geothermal power plant, from construction through 30 years of operation, the majority of water is consumed by plant operations. For the EGS binary scenarios, where dry cooling was assumed, belowground operational water loss is the greatest contributor depending upon the physical and operational conditions of the reservoir. Total life cycle <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> requirements for air-cooled EGS binary scenarios vary between 0. 22 and 1. 85 gal/kWh, depending upon the extent of belowground operational <b>water</b> <b>consumption.</b> The air-cooled hydrothermal binary and flash plants experience far less fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> over the life cycle, at 0. 04 gal/kWh. Fresh water requirements associated with air- cooled binary operations are primarily from aboveground water needs, including dust control, maintenance, and domestic use. Although wet-cooled hydrothermal flash systems require water for cooling, these plants generally rely upon the geofluid, fluid from the geothermal reservoir, which typically has high salinity and total dissolved solids concentration and is much warmer than normal groundwater sources, for their cooling water needs; thus, while there is considerable geofluid loss at 2. 7 gal/kWh, fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> during operations {{is similar to that of}} aircooled binary systems. Chapter 5 presents the assessment of water demand for future growth in deployment of utility-scale geothermal power generation. The approach combines the life cycle analysis of geothermal <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> with a geothermal supply curve according to resource type, levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and potential growth scenarios. A total of 17 growth scenarios were evaluated. In general, the scenarios that assumed lower costs for EGSs as a result of learning and technological improvements resulted in greater geothermal potential, but also significantly greater water demand due to the higher <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> by EGSs. It was shown, however, that this effect could be largely mitigated if nonpotable water sources were used for belowground operational water demands. The geographical areas that showed the highest water demand for most growth scenarios were southern and northern California, as well as most of Nevada. In addition to water demand by geothermal power production, Chapter 5 includes data on water availability for geothermal development areas. A qualitative analysis is included that identifies some of the basins where the <b>limited</b> availability of <b>water</b> is most likely to affect the development of geothermal resources. The data indicate that water availability is fairly limited, especially under drought conditions, in most of the areas with significant near- and medium-term geothermal potential. Southern California was found to have the greatest potential for water-related challenges with its combination of high geothermal potential and <b>limited</b> <b>water</b> availability. The results of this work are summarized in Chapter 6. Overall, this work highlights the importance of utilizing dry cooling systems for binary and EGS systems and minimizing fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> throughout the life cycle of geothermal power development. The large resource base for EGSs represents a major opportunity for the geothermal industry; however, depending upon geology, these systems can require large quantities of makeup water due to belowground reservoir losses. Identifying potential sources of compatible degraded or low-quality water for use for makeup injection for EGS and flash systems represents an important opportunity to reduce the impacts of geothermal development on fresh water resources. The importance of identifying alternative water sources for geothermal systems is heightened by the fact that a large fraction of the geothermal resource is located in areas already experiencing water stress.
