5|$|The first siding west of Saskatoon was Goodrich, {{which is}} more {{commonly}} known as Radisson today. There were two L.I.D.'s that formed the municipality. the northern one was <b>L.I.D.</b> 21-D-3 and the southern portion was <b>L.I.D.</b> 20-D-3 The local improvement districts administered the area between 1906 {{and the formation of}} Great Bend No. 405 in 1910. Local Improvement district No. 21-J-3 handled affairs between 1905 and 1910 when the local government was taken over by Mayfield No. 406 rural municipality.|$|E

30|$|In {{preliminary}} experiments, mushrooms of S. commune and of C. atramentaria were incubated upside-down in {{dishes with}} plastic <b>lids</b> or in dishes with glass <b>lids.</b> Spore collected overnight in plastic <b>lids</b> whereas spores were {{not present in}} glass <b>lids</b> (data not shown). The results suggested that an electrostatic disposition possibly helped to attach ejected spores {{to the surface of}} the plastic <b>lids.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} factors and {{possible}} mechanisms associated with decreased self-awareness of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (<b>LIDs)</b> {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We enrolled 30 PD patients with <b>LIDs.</b> Patients were video-recorded in an "on" phase while experiencing <b>LIDs.</b> <b>LIDs</b> were objectively rated {{by means of the}} Unified Dyskinesias Rating Scale (UDyRS) by two movement disorders specialists while examining the patients. Patients were asked to rate the body site and the severity of their <b>LIDs</b> according to the 5 -point UDyRS. Patients then rated their own <b>LIDs</b> while watching the video recording of themselves. Lastly, the patients rated the <b>LIDs</b> of other reference PD patients on a video recording. The same reference video recordings were shown to 15 healthy individuals matched for age, gender and education. Results: Seven of the 30 PD patients investigated were subjectively unaware of the presence of their <b>LIDs.</b> The majority of patients, however, recognized their <b>LIDs</b> when watching video recording of themselves. Patients displayed a specific poor self-awareness of trunk <b>LIDs,</b> in both the subjective evaluation and in the video recording-based subjective evaluation. By contrast PD patients correctly recognized <b>LIDs</b> in video recordings of reference PD patients. Poor self-awareness correlated with predominance of motor symptoms on the left body side. Conclusions: Poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> is present in a proportion of PD patients as a form of anosognosia. The poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> in the trunk is likely to be due to a complex interplay involving both anosognosic mechanisms and deficits in proprioceptive axial kinesthesia.

5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper <b>lid</b> and two rows on the lower <b>lid.</b> Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its <b>lid</b> had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin <b>lid.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>lids</b> of CorningWare and Pyroflam (Europe) are {{not made}} of vitroceramic material. Though the {{original}} fin handled <b>lids</b> from 1958-1961 were made of Borosilicate glass, all subsequent <b>lids</b> for pieces in the Visions, Corning Ware Soft Beige and Pyroflam Amber lines are made of tempered soda-lime glass as are the <b>lids</b> for the white collection. Unlike the vitroceramic cookware, these <b>lids</b> cannot touch burners or fire directly, but they do fine in the oven (if not touching the source of heat) or on the stove top, {{as long as they}} are over their vitroceramic bases.|$|R

5|$|The {{main event}} was next, {{featuring}} The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He {{tried to put}} The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the <b>lid,</b> however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the <b>lid.</b> Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed the <b>lid</b> to gain the victory.|$|E
5|$|The south {{transept}} {{contains the}} important late Saxon stone {{panel of the}} Harrowing of Hell. It dates from before the Norman Conquest {{and may have been}} carved around 1050. Following a fire in 1831 it was found being used as a coffin <b>lid</b> under the Chapter House floor.|$|E

5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the <b>lid</b> of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|Ascospores are {{ellipsoidal}} in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with {{dimensions of}} 17–22 by 7–9µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical <b>lid</b> to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17|µm. The {{diameter of the}} club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10µm at the apex.|$|E

30|$|The data in Table  1 {{implicate}} {{for several}} species {{that not all}} basidiospores released from reversed mushrooms are attracted to plastic <b>lids.</b> Experiments in which {{the distance between the}} upside-down laid mushrooms and the plastic <b>lids</b> above for several species were varied further support an influence by spore properties on spore yields in the <b>lids.</b> For all species, numbers of spores attached to the <b>lids</b> decreased in linear trends on the log scale with increasing distance to the reversed mushrooms (Fig.  3). Roughly, three groups in line steepness might be distinguished (Fig.  3 a, d, j–l, steepest: C. comatus, A. solidipes, Lepista nuda, P. squarrosa, S. commune; Fig.  3 b, e, g, h, medium: C. cinerea, C. atramentaria, C. domesticus, Tubaria furfuracea; Fig.  3 c, f, i, flattest: C. truncorum, C. micaceus, Kuehneromyces mutabilis). Break-offs of all lines (lowest distances where no spores detected in <b>lids)</b> were abrupt. Between species, break-offs occurred at different heights, following different orders of magnitudes (ranging from < 104 up to nearly 106) of absolute spore numbers at the last positive height. Absolute numbers of spores collected in <b>lids</b> at low distances did not correspond throughout to the possible longest distance over which spores of a species were found to be attracted to plastic <b>lids</b> (Fig.  3). C. atramentaria as a species with highest spore numbers in <b>lids</b> at short distance (> 107 at 1  cm distance) also yielded reasonable amounts of spores in <b>lids</b> at highest distances (> 105 at 7  cm distance; Fig.  3 e), followed by Coprinellus truncorum and C. micaceus with both ca. 4  ×  105 spores in <b>lids</b> at 1  cm distance and ca. 5 to 7  ×  104 spores at 6  cm distance (Fig.  3 c, f). In all other cases, maximum heights of spore detection varied between 3  cm and 5  cm distance. Spore sizes (lengths, see Table  1) or volumes (as calculated for an ellipsoid V =  4 / 3  π × ½ length ×  2  × ½ width; data not shown) did also not correlate with maximum heights at which spores were attracted to plastic <b>lids</b> (Fig.  3). Attraction between higher up-flying spores and the plastic <b>lids</b> might be expected to be stronger than between less far up-flying spores and the <b>lids.</b> Basidiospores do also have electric charges (Buller 1909, 1922; Gregory 1957; Swinbank et al. 1964; Webster et al. 1988; Saar 2013; Saar and Parmasto 2014; Saar and Salm 2014). Individual differences in charging of spores remain as explanation for the observations.|$|R
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the <b>lid</b> of the container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To study {{bacteria}} from eye <b>lids</b> and {{conjunctival sac}} of patients undergoing cataract surgery {{before and after}} the application of antiseptics. Material and Method: Patients undergoing elective cataract extraction in one university hospital were randomly enrolled. Cultures for bacteria and candida were done by swabbing the eye <b>lids</b> before and after cleaning with 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate. Subsequently 7 % povidone iodine was applied on eye <b>lids</b> and conjunctival sacs. Cultures of specimens from eye <b>lids</b> and conjunctival sac were taken after the application of 7 % povidone iodine {{and at the end of}} the operation. Results: Fifty-one patients were enrolled. Positive cultures were found in 90. 2 % and 82. 4 % before and after cleaning the face with 4 % chlorhexidine. After topical application of 10 % povidone iodine, only 19. 6 % had positive cultures from eye <b>lids</b> and conjunctival sac; a significant reduction (p= 0. 001). At the end of the operation, positive cultures were found from eye <b>lids</b> in 10 patients and from the conjunctival sac in 4 patients. Isolates were skin flora and candida species in 2 patients. None of the patients had endophthalmitis. Conclusion: Cleaning eye <b>lids</b> with 4 % chlorhexidine followed by applying 10 % povidone iodine was effective in decreasing skin flora in cataract surgery. The organisms were not completely eliminated. Post-operative follow-up to detect infectious complications is warranted...|$|R
