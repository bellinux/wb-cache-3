40|$|High {{efficiency}} kesterite based {{thin film}} solar cells typically feature Cu poor, Zn rich absorbers although secondary phases occur easily in non stoichiometric Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4. We therefore applied high resolution X ray fluorescence analysis using a synchrotron nanobeam {{to study the}} local composition of a CZTSe cross section <b>lamella</b> <b>cut</b> from a sample with an integral composition of Zn Sn 1. 37 and Cu Zn Sn 0. 55. We find submicrometer sized ZnSe, SnSe SnSe 2, and even CuSe Cu 2 Se like secondary phases, while the local compositions of the kesterite are highly Zn rich yet barely Cu poor with 1. 5 Zn Sn 2. 2 and Cu Zn Sn 1. 0. Consequently, great {{care must be taken}} when relating the integral composition to other material properties including the device performanc...|$|E

The influence of applied electric and magnetic fields on ferroelectric domain configurations has been mapped, using piezoresponse force microscopy. The {{extent to which}} magnetic fields alter the ferroelectric domains {{was found to be}} strongly history dependent: after switching had been induced by applying electric fields, the susceptibility of the domains to change under a magnetic field (the effective magnetoelectric coupling parameter) was large. Such large, magnetic field-induced changes resulted in a remanent domain state very similar to the remanent state induced by an electric field. Subsequent magnetic field reversal induced more modest ferroelectric switching...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Reoperations after {{refractive}} surgery {{have increased in}} frequency during the past 10 years. The spectrum of the indications for repeat LASIK may have changed. Methods. All cases of reoperations after {{refractive surgery}} performed between May 1, 2004 and April 30, 2005 at the Institute of Refractive and Ophthalmic Surgery (IROC) were retrospectively investigated regarding indication for repeat surgery and visual and refractive results. The 1 -month results were used to estimate the refractive and visual success rate. Results. Of the 76 reoperations, 69 were performed as re-lifts, 3 eyes had new <b>lamellae</b> <b>cut,</b> and 3 cases needed keratoplasty. The reoperations took place 7. 5 ± 13 months after the primary operation (range 0. 5 to 60 months). The most frequent indication was residual astigmatism of 0. 5 D and more. Visual loss of more than 1 decimal line did not occur and unaided visual acuity increased from 0. 64 to 1. 05. No complications were reported, however, 3 eyes needed additional enhancement. Conclusions. Reoperations after LASIK performed as re-lifts appear to be effective and reasonably safe when using the technique described and respecting a residual stromal thickness of 280 microns...|$|R
30|$|Imaging {{the silicon}} {{crystals}} in the amorphous silicon layer was done using a FEI Tecnai F 20 ST/STEM {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) operated at 200 kV. Thin samples for TEM were prepared in cross section following a standard procedure after gluing the two samples together face to face: a 500 - μm-thick <b>lamella</b> was <b>cut</b> out using a diamond saw, subsequently thinned to approximately 15 - μm thickness by mechanical polishing, glued on a copper support ring, and argon ion-milled to electron transparency. The silicon nanocrystals were marked using the freehand selection tool in ImageJ [17]. The surface area was then determined, and an effective diameter was recorded.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{recommended}} {{thickness of}} the graft lamella in Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) is 120 - 180 microm. To adjust for the large variation in central corneal thickness (CCT) of eye bank donor corneas, microkeratome plates of different heights are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the lamella thickness predictability of different keratome plates in a clinical routine setting. METHODS: In a prospective study of 60 consecutive DSAEK procedures, CCT was measured with a 50 MHz ultrasound pachymeter after meticulous epithelium removal immediately before and after lamella creation. Selected plate thickness was 300, 350, or 400 micro, respectively. Cutting depth was calculated by subtracting the remaining CCT of the deep <b>lamella</b> after the <b>cut</b> from the initial CCT before the cut. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) cutting depth was 320 +/- 45 microm with the Amadeus 350 keratome, 317 +/- 48 microm with the Moria 300 keratome, 388 +/- 58 microm with the Moria 350 keratome and 467 +/- 94 microm with the Moria 400 keratome. Neither the duration nor the type of donor preservation had an effect on the accuracy of the cutting depth. CONCLUSION: The mean cutting depth for the DSAEK keratomes is more accurate than the cutting depth of the same keratome heads designed for LASIK. This might be due to the fact that DSAEK <b>lamellas</b> were <b>cut</b> after complete epithelial removal. Despite the accurate mean cutting accuracy, there is a substantial variation between individual cuts which have to be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Wood is a {{competitive}} material to metal and concrete {{in the production}} of bearing members. These wooden bearing members are increasingly applied in building constructions. By reason of its natural character and properties, this material improves the architectural look of the structure, and hence it is suitable for use in different constructions. Design feature – hollow wooden post is produced by gluing 12 lamellas with trapezoidal cross-section, furnished with slip feather and groove. Each <b>lamella</b> side is <b>cut</b> at an angle of 15 ° in order to achieve a closed circle in itscross-section. Hollow wooden post is especially made of spruce timber.

30|$|The {{cross-sectional}} transmission {{electron microscopy}} (XTEM) samples were prepared {{by means of a}} FEI Nova 220 Dual-Beam workstation—focused ion beam (FIB)/scanning electron microscopy (SEM) system. This technique enabled us to cut through the nanoindentation and locate the specific site of interesting efficiently. In practice, we first milled two crosses alongside the indented area for markers and, then deposited a 1 μm-thick Pt layer to protect this area of interest from Ga+ion beam damage and implantation. Material was removed {{from both sides of the}} selected area with an ion current of 5 nA, followed by successive thinning steps with decreasing current ranging from 3 nA to 300 pA until the lamella was about 1 μm-thick. Subsequently, the bottom and one side of the <b>lamella</b> were <b>cut</b> free while titling the sample at an angle of 45 ° to the ion beam. A central area containing the nanoindentation apex of a few micrometers in length was then chosen and thinned further to a thickness of ∼ 100 nm, leaving at the sides thicker areas that prevented the lamella from collapsing. An ion dose of 70 pA was adopted for final cleaning steps. Finally, a small area of interest was selected and thinned until electron transparency was achieved. The transfer of the lamella from the sample holder to a holey carbon coated TEM grid was made ex situ by using a shape glass tip under an optical microscope outside FIB station. A JEOL- 2010 TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used to study the microstructures of XTEM lamella.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the clinical efficacy of modified deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) {{for the treatment}} of advanced-stage keratoconus with steep curvature. Materials and Methods: In this interventional, non-comparative case series, 30 patients with advanced stages of keratoconus and curvature of more than 60 D underwent a modified DALK procedure. In this technique, after big-bubble formation, posterior stromal <b>lamella</b> was <b>cut</b> and removed 5 mm centrally (baring Descemet′s membrane completely) with posterior stromal layer remaining peripherally. Results: The study included 30 eyes (30 patients with a mean ± SD age of 25 ± 5. 4 years). The follow-up examination was performed for all participants up to 12 months after the surgery. The mean uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) increased from 20 / 800 before the surgery to a subsequent 3 / 10 (P = 0. 12). Likewise, best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) improved, reaching 6 / 10 postoperatively (former quantity 20 / 200) (P = 0. 18). In addition, mean keratometry and keratometric astigmatism managed to achieve considerable improvement, from 58. 8 ± 5. 4 D to 46. 5 ± 2. 1 D and 7. 8 ± 2. 1 to 4. 54 ± 1. 54 D, respectively (P = 0. 52). Descemet′s membrane wrinkling was not seen in any patient postoperatively. Conclusions: This technique is effective in restoring acceptable vision and corneal regularity in advanced cases of keratoconus with a curvature more than 60 D who are also at risk of Descemet′s membrane wrinkling after DALK. Therefore, this procedure could prevent from Descemet membrane wrinkling in such cases...|$|R
40|$|The intimal {{layer of}} the {{thoracic}} and abdominal aortic segments of Cebus apella monkey presented an evident inner elastic lamina. The medial {{layer of the}} thoracic aorta segment showed a basic lamellar elastic pattern having a medium average of 23. 12 <b>lamellae</b> per analyzed <b>cut</b> sections, which appeared disposed circular and oblique relatively to the aortic lumen. The aortic adventitial layer, at this level, was formed mainly by collagen fibers, irregularly disposed between elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells. The aortic abdominal portion, in this monkey, at the suprarenal level presented a medium number of 19. 12 elastic lamellae which showed a relatively disorganized and broken up pattern. At the infrarenal level the aortic medium layer showed a medium average of 11. 75 elastic lamellae and next to the emission of the internal iliac arteries it was found only a middle average of 8. 37 elastic lamellae intermingled with smooth muscle cells and collagen fibers whose concentration seemed to be increased next to the adventitial layer. The external elastic lamina was only present in the more distal aortic segment near to the emission of the internal iliac arteries...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a new system for obtaining corneal lamellar grafts of preset sizes. the system consists of the combination of an artificial anterior chamber (MALKS) and an automated microkeratotome (MASYK). Methods: A prospective study was performed. Lamellar tissue was obtained with the microkeratotome from 40 human corneoscleral buttons mounted in the artificial anterior chamber. the instrument was set to <b>cut</b> <b>lamellae</b> with a center thickness of 350 mu m and a diameter of 10 mm. A new cutting blade for the microkeratotome was used for every 8 cases. Thickness was measured by ultrasound pachymetry. the lamellar diameter was assessed with a micrometric caliper. Results: the center thickness of the corneal lamellae ranged from 230 to 430 mu m (mean, 322 +/- 48 mu m; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 307 - 337 mu m). the diameter of the stromal ranged from 9. 26 to 10. 74 mm (mean, 10 +/- 0. 27 mm; 95 % Cl, 9. 9 - 10 mm). There were no cases of perforation or incomplete/irregular lamellae. the interface between the residual stroma and the lamellae was macroscopically smooth. the repetitive use of the same blade up to 8 times did not significantly change these results. Conclusion: the MALKS and MASYK system showed good accuracy in obtaining lamellae of specific thickness and size taken from human corneoscleral buttons. It is a promising instrument for use in deep lamellar keratoplasty. the technique may be useful in obtaining precut lamellar donor tissue for distribution by eye banks.
