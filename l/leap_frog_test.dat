50|$|The {{next big}} {{step in this}} {{technology}} was <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog’s</b> <b>Leap</b> Pad. The Leap Pad makes regular books interactive by enabling children to hear a word aloud, have the story read to them, have words and sounds spelled for them, play interactive learning games on many pages and more, simply by touching the included “pen” to different places on the page. The system is divided into “Leap Levels” for different-aged children and includes everything from picture books to chapter books, with separate Leap Pads corresponding to each level. There is also a unit that allows new content to be downloaded from <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog’s</b> Web site. The technology of the Leap Pad continued evolving, and <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> next {{came out with the}} Tag (LeapFrog). Instead of a Pad unit where books must be inserted, the Tag system is essentially a “pen” onto which books can be downloaded. Then, the pen can be scanned across the corresponding book to read it aloud, unlock activities and more.The goal for these products is to help children get more out of their books and learn to read, according to <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog.</b> <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> even has its own publishing company, <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> Press, which creates books specifically designed for its system. The products are not cheap, though- the Leap Pad can cost as much as $80. The Tag is usually sold in gift packs that run anywhere from $20 to $75. Books for each are sold separately and typically cost $12 or more.Of course, <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> is not the only company with products like the Leap Pad or Tag system that use technology to enhance the reading experience for children. However, {{it was one of the}} first, and now several companies have copied the idea and made similar products.|$|R

40|$|Part 3 : Pattern Recognition and Image ProcessingInternational audienceIn {{this paper}} a 2 D <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> Algorithm {{is applied to}} solve the {{so-called}} noisy Photometric Stereo problem. In 3 -source Photometric Stereo (noiseless or noisy) an ideal unknown Lambertian surface is illuminated from distant light-source directions (their directions {{are assumed to be}} linearly independent). The subsequent goal, given three images is to reconstruct the illuminated object’s shape. Ultimately, in the presence of noise, this problem leads to a highly non-linear optimization task with the corresponding cost function having a large number of independent variables. One method to solve it is 2 D <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> Algorithm. During reconstruction, problem that commonly arises, renders the outliers generated in the retrieved shape. In this paper we implement 2 D <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog.</b> In particular we focus on choosing snapshot size and on invoking two algorithms that can remove outliers from reconstructed shape. Performance of extended 2 D <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog</b> is illustrated by examples chosen especially to demonstrate how this solution is applicable in computer vision. Remarkably, this optimization scheme can also be used for an arbitrary optimization problem depending on large number of variables...|$|R

40|$|A full <b>leap</b> <b>frog</b> Fourier {{method for}} {{integrating}} the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation u//t plus uu//x minus epsilon u//x//x//x equals 0 {{results in an}} O(N** minus ** 3) stability constraint on the time step, where N {{is the number of}} Fourier modes used. This stability limit is much more restrictive than the accuracy limit for many applications. The authors propose a method for which the staibility limit is extended by treating the linear dispersive u//x//x//x term implicitly. Thus timesteps can be taken up to an accuracy limit larger than the explicit stability limit. The implicit method is implemented without solving linear systems by integrating in time in the Fourier space and discretizing the nonlinear uu//x term by <b>leap</b> <b>frog.</b> A second method they propose uses basis functions which solve the linear part of the KdV equation and <b>leap</b> <b>frog</b> for time integration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Jumping {{is another}} type of motion analysis. We have long jump, triple jump, static jump and <b>leap</b> <b>frog</b> jump. The long jump which athletes combine speed, {{strength}} and agility {{in an attempt to}} land as far from the take-off point as possible. The triple jump occurred when the athlete runs down a runway until he reaches a designated mark, from which the jump is measured. The <b>leap</b> <b>frog</b> jump means jumping by both foots by maintains subjects kneels or bends over for the next jump. The static jump means jumping with both foots at one place. In this study, we will acquire the force, moment and center of pressure. This experiment will consist of subjects standing on two feet, wearing and not wearing shoes. The comparison will be made between long jump vs triple jump and static jump vs <b>leap</b> <b>frog</b> jump. The experiment was held at Biomechanic and Motion Analysis Laboratory, UniMAP. Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) software been used for this purpose where this software aid us in analyzing motion of the subject as shown in Figure 1. Two Bertec force plate and five high frequency cameras were used to capture the motion of the subjects while doing the experiment. The result shown force exerted at toe will be highest in <b>leap</b> <b>frog</b> jump compare to others...|$|R

40|$|Bebop SPACES is {{inspired}} by the performance entitled <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog,</b> by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. The project {{is a series of}} architectural improvisations or “takes ” that spontaneously transpose, manipulate, and articulate various links, connections, joints and transitions present in jazz music. The improvisations start with an underlying source that is developed into an extension line network. This vehicle is played as a series of chromatic encodings which take multiple trajec-tories. The bebop SPACES video is an attempt to represent the tonality of this poetic design process as actions instead of words. Initially, the designer records the live action on the computer screen. The video footage is sped up and edited into a rough demonstration, set to a short out take track of <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog.</b> Through illusory animation and time compression, the video represents what is occurring {{in the mind of the}} designer as he creates these works. A second take is created with newer, more extensive footage, as a mostly intuitive and subliminal response to the master take of <b>Leap</b> <b>Frog.</b> The main devices used are speed and repetition with slight variation. The third take attempts to consciously and precisely link the events of the visual compositions to the im-provisational structure of the music, building on the knowledge gained from the previous intuitiv...|$|R
