40|$|Abstract. In {{this report}} we compare {{parameters}} for <b>Lithium</b> <b>lens</b> in use for collection of antiprotons {{and the one}} suggested for collection of positrons in ILC. 1. OVERVIEW In our recent publication we described the <b>Lithium</b> <b>lens</b> design suitable for usage in ILC. All engineering parameters are fixed and the lens is ready for detailed modeling of transit-time processes. General output, however, is that the energy deposited by the beam is much smaller, than the one delivered by running current. For example, the temperature rise in hottest spot {{at the entrance of}} the front window is around 35 o C- 50 o (depending on the position of lens behind the target) after a single train passage, while the temperature raised by the current becomes 170 o C [1], [2]. This makes detailed modeling less critical, as the lithium lenses for collection of antiprotons is successfully working under such severe conditions. Although usage of <b>lithium</b> <b>lens</b> for focusing of (anti) protons is more or less known worldwide, usage of <b>Lithium</b> <b>lens</b> for focusing of positrons remains widely unknown; the only operational <b>Lithium</b> <b>lens</b> for this purpose resides in BINP (see references in [2]). In this contest it is interesting to compare the suggested <b>Lithium</b> <b>lens</b> for ILC and routinely operational lenses for a/protons. Support for this investigation obtained from ILC GDE Regional Directorship of America. 2. LENS FOR ILC Lens suggested for ILC is represented inFig. 1.

40|$|TM- 1946 {{summarizes}} {{the status of}} the NuMI project. This note presents more details on the technical design of the various NUMI beams. Several beam]Line options are investigated for producing neutrinos [...] (l) a wide-band beam(WBB) using horns, (2) a beam using a single <b>lithium</b> <b>Lens,</b> and (3) a two stage narrow-band beam(NBB) using a <b>Lithium</b> <b>Lens,</b> quadrupoles and dipoles. The first two are designed to maximize the muon neutrino event rate; the third is designed to have a tunable range of parent momenta from 5 - 60 GeV/c. In the context of NuMI, the Double Horns-and its target were concepts first described in 1991. The <b>lithium</b> <b>Lens</b> has been used at Fermilab for pbar production for several years. With recent upgrades, it forms the basis of what will be used by NuMI. Narrow band beams using conventional dipoles and quadrupoles have been studied, but have less acceptance than one using a <b>lithium</b> <b>lens.</b> The following practical limits are imposed on each of the systems: (1) Horns: The necks will not have a smaller radius than 1 cm; the maximum current will not exceed 170 kAmp. Keeping the inside diameter large allows the primary proton beam to vary in position, yet not strike the fragile neck. In addition, there is a trade-off between decreasing the radius and increasing the wall thickness to maintain the required strength in the conductor material. (2) Magnets: Reasonable conventional designs are used. The maximum gradient for quadrupoles is 12 kG/half-aperture; the maximum field for dipoles is about 16 kG; larger apertures scale the gradients and fields downward. Although not a primary consideration, optically it is desirable for the magnification in each plane to be comparable (within a factor of 2 or 3 is OK). (3) Lithium Lens: The maximum radius is 1. 0 cm with a maximum gradient of 100 kG/cm.

This publication {{is a part}} of preparation work for numerical modeling of LL. OVERVIEW Usage of <b>Lithium</b> <b>Lens</b> (LL) for positron collection was suggested years ago [1]-[4]. <b>Lithium</b> <b>lens</b> with solid Lithium is in exploitation for decades now. Usage of LL for antiproton collection is also a well developed topic [5]-[11]. Naturally, usage of LL for positron collection in a scheme with undulator [13], developed in Novosibirsk, included LL from the very beginning [14]-[15]. From the other hand usage of LL for positron collection still not a widely accepted idea, so Novosibirsk lens remains the only one in operation. In resent times we applied some efforts to implement LL into ILC positron source [16]-[21]. Development of positron source for ILC as it is now in baseline design described in [22]. Latest results on practical test undulator-based positron source demonstrated positron polarization ~ 80 % and electron polarization ~ 90 % respectively obtained with Tungsten target [23]. Also interesting looks a possibility for implementation of LL for muon collider [24]-[25]. System with Liquid Lithium is under consideration for Fusion Materials Irradiation studies [26].

40|$|The present {{visit to}} CERN {{was as a}} result of an {{invitation}} from Dr. Colin Johnson of the Antiproton Accumulator (AA) group. Two activities were planned for this visit. First, the second beam test of one of the original Fermilab <b>lithium</b> <b>lenses</b> (serial No. 2). Second, the installation and beam tests for a new Fermilab lens of improved design (serial No. 5). It should be mentioned here that CERN, after realizing the possible gains to be obtained, has started a considerable development effort in short focal length lenses. Presently they have 3 operational <b>lithium</b> <b>lenses,</b> transformers and power supplies for tests. They are in the process of constructing 3 other transformers and designing lenses of 4 cm diameter (twice the present Fermilab lenses). Fermilab should devote some added effort in the field to maintain the initiative. The first beam test of lens No. 2 was performed during the summer of 1983, when the lens was used as an antiproton collecting lens. For this test the original lens was used as a strong focusing element in the 26 GeV proton beam in conjunction with a current carrying target Preliminary tests for this geometry were conducted during 1984, when the lens was exposed to over 2 *E 6 pulses at 320 kAmps and 1. 3 *E 13 protons per pulse. Lens No. 5 was installed as an antiproton collecting lens, immediately following the AA production target, in a geometry similar to the one designed for the Tevatron 1 project at Fermilab. Targets of a different design than the one use normally at CERN were also required. After completion of the antiproton yield measurements and optimization the lens was left in the beam during regular operation for antiproton accumulation. During antiproton accumulation for the Lear accelerator new records were achieved on the accumulation yield and accumulation rate of antiprotons for the AA machine. CERN activities in the development of a Plasma Lens, as an alternative to the lithium ones, and new broad band pick-ups for stochastic cooling were observed as they are of great interests to Fermilab...|$|R

Pre-mature failure of these lenses has led to extensive efforts to understand {{the cause of the}} failures. One of the main unknowns is the structural behavior of lithium under such extreme loading conditions. Lithium can be categorized as a soft or "plastic " solid with relatively low modulus of elasticity and yield strength.

The first type of antiproton production target used from 1980 to 1982 comprised a rod of copper 3 mm diameter and 120 mm long embedded in a graphite cylinder that was itself pressed into a finned aluminium container. This assembly was air-cooled and it was {{used in conjunction with}} the Van der Meer magnetic horn. In 1983 Fermilab provided us with lithium lenses to replace the horn with a view to increasing the antiproton yield by about 30 %. These lenses needed a much shorter target made of heavy metal - iridium was chosen for this purpose. The 50 mm iridium rod was housed in an extension to the original finned target container so that it could be brought very close to the entrance to the <b>lithium</b> <b>lens.</b> Picture 1 shows this target assembly and Picture 2 shows it mounted together with the <b>lithium</b> <b>lens.</b> These target containers had a short lifetime due to a combination of beam heating and radiation damage.

40|$|An {{analyzes}} {{of efficiency}} of 3 –dimensional ionization cooling of muons is performed {{with use of}} transport equa-tion approach in a scheme with bent <b>lithium</b> <b>lenses</b> and high field dipoles. As it was already shown [1, 2, 3], the ionization cooling is efficient for transverse beam emittances {{and not at all}} for the longitudinal one. The natural longitudinal decrement is equal to the derivative of mean rate of energy loss with respect to particle energy. In a region of logarithmic grow of ionization loss, the value of k does not exceed 7 % of ?, whereas at momentum below 400 MeV=c, where k is negative, its absolute value grows fast with energy decrease and becomes of the order of ? at pc 100 MeV, thus resulting in a strong heating of muon beam instead of cooling. Meanwhile, with no efficient cooling of longitudinal emittance, the energy spread in a beam is growing, and chromatic aberration in a lens, matching the amplitude functions of low-beta focus at slowing target and that of rather long-wave accelerator, results in sufficient increase in transverse emittance, which restricts from below its value, achievable without an efficient cooling in longitu-dinal direction. Thus, the violent redistribution of summary decrement between transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom has to be produced in a system for ionization cooling by way of creation of transverse gradient of energy loss rate, correlated with dispersion function. With the use of transport (kinetic) equation for ionization cooling of muons [1] a system of differential equations is got for definition of mean square characteristics of particle beam and all correlations between them: hr 2 i, hri, h 2 i, hE 2 i, and so on. In common the full number of equations is rather big, and solution is to be got numerically. However, for anal-ysis we can consider the free transverse motions and the longitudinal one separately. For free radial motion, which is extracted through a change of variables = r − Epv and #r = r − 0 E pv, the equations read...|$|R

Geneva, Switzerland March 15, 2002 1. Historical introduction During a period of six years from 1981 to 1987 CERN conducted an active research program into the optimization of secondary particle production from high-density targets in the CERN PS 26 GeV/c proton beam. This was directed towards the production of 3. 5 GeV/c antiprotons for the Antiproton Accumulator, AA [1], and later the Antiproton Collector, ACOL [2]. At the same time other secondaries, notably electrons, pions and muons of the same momentum were captured and used for machine alignment being more readily observable than the relatively scarce antiprotons [3]. Initially production targets were copper rods 3 mm diameter and length roughly equal to the interaction length (148 mm). The secondaries were fed into a magnetic horn for matching to the downstream quadrupole transport line. Development at Fermilab [4] of lithium lenses of shorter focal length than the horn offered an improved antiproton yield but only if the length of the production target could be reduced significantly (depth of focus effect). High-density targets having much shorter interaction lengths were req [...] ...|$|E

The long term effects on the lens were studied by further pulsingandinspectiinot thelensin thelaboratoryafter the first beam test. The resutts proove that the plasma lens technology is reliable for accelerator applications. h-ROOUCllON The CERN plasma lens {{is based on a}} dynamical z-pinch discharge.

40|$|The idea {{of using}} a muon storage ring to produce a high-energy ({approx_equal} 50 GeV) {{neutrino}} beam for experiments was first discussed by Koshkarev in 1974. A detailed description of a muon storage ring for neutrino oscillation experiments was first produced by Neuffer in 1980. In his paper, Neuffer studied muon decay rings with E{sub {mu}} of 8, 4. 5 and 1. 5 GeV. With his 4. 5 GeV ring design, he achieved a figure of merit of {approx_equal} 6 x 10 {sup 9 } useful neutrinos per 3 x 10 {sup 13 } protons on target. The facility we describe here ({nu}STORM) {{is essentially the same}} facility proposed in 1980 and would utilize a 3 - 4 GeV/c muon storage ring to study eV-scale oscillation physics and, in addition, could add significantly to our understanding of {nu}{sub e} and {nu}{sub {mu}} cross sections. In particular the facility can: (1) address the large {Delta}m{sup 2 } oscillation regime and make a major contribution to the study of sterile neutrinos, (2) make precision {nu}{sub e} and {bar {nu}}{sub e} cross-section measurements, (3) provide a technology ({mu} decay ring) test demonstration and {mu} beam diagnostics test bed, and (4) provide a precisely understood {nu} beam for detector studies. The facility is the simplest implementation of the Neutrino Factory concept. In our case, 60 GeV/c protons are used to produce pions off a conventional solid target. The pions are collected with a focusing device (horn or <b>lithium</b> <b>lens)</b> and are then transported to, and injected into, a storage ring. The pions that decay in the first straight of the ring can yield a muon that is captured in the ring. The circulating muons then subsequently decay into electrons and neutrinos. We are starting with a storage ring design that is optimized for 3. 8 GeV/c muon momentum. This momentum was selected to maximize the physics reach for both oscillation and the cross section physics.

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{environment at}} the NuMI experiment {{has received a}} lot of attention {{in the last few years}} in preparation for project construction. One important issue is the induced radioactivation of the components in the beam line and the shielding materials. This arises from irradiation by hadrons that are generated in the target. Since the level of the residual activity has to be considered when determining access procedures for maintenance during NuMI operation, an understanding of the properties of the remnant radiation is important. To this end, experimental studies were performed in the target vault at AP 0 which is similar in design to the NuMI target area. Here 120 GeV protons bombard a target, generating the hadrons that produce the induced radioactivity. Two sets of samples each consisting of three small cylindrical or rectangular solids of iron and steel, one sample of aluminum, and one of concrete were irradiated. One set was hung just below the bottom of a module near the <b>lithium</b> <b>lens</b> (in-vault), and the other was placed on top of the modules downstream of this location (above-vault), just beneath the movable concrete roof of the vault at AP 0. Further, four thin activation foils of Au, Au+Cd, In, and Al (along with small disks of the same iron, aluminum, and concrete samples discussed above) were mounted on four 10. 2 cm diameter Al disks, one placed on the in-vault module and three at above-vault downstream locations as well. The radioactivity of all these materials on the 10. 2 cm Al disks was determined at the Radioisotope Analysis Facility in an attempt to characterize the radionuclides produced during irradiation. The activities of the thin foils were employed in an effort to unfold a spectrum of the neutrons produced during the hadronic cascades in the target. The MARS Monte Carlo code (MO 95, MO 00) was used to predict and analyze the residual radiation produced during the beam irradiation. New subroutines have been developed for the MARS 14 version providing reliable estimation of residual dose rates in arbitrary composite materials for arbitrary irradiation and cooling times (RA 01).

The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|E
