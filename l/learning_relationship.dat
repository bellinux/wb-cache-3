50|$|The {{traditional}} way of organising a secondary school in the UK uses a horizontal or Year System. Invariably, a Year 7 student joins a tutor group of about 25-30 fellow students all from the same Year. In the US this is sometimes called a home group and in the UK this system of pastoral organisation is called a tutor group. A form tutor, the person (usually a teacher) assigned to the tutor group, has oversight of tutees' pastoral and academic needs and usually stays with their form group throughout the students' time at the school. Tutor time (the time that the tutor and tutees actually spend together) is usually {{at the start of}} the day. Schools see this as a settling in time and an opportunity to get basic school administration done. The tutor task in the UK is to form a <b>learning</b> <b>relationship</b> with each tutee and act as a guide and mentor through the complexities of school life.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of relationships in {{education has been}} well established in the literature. However, the nature of relationship is seldom defined {{and as a result}} interpersonal and <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> are conflated and so implicitly treated as synonymous. In this paper we argue that <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> are different from interpersonal relationships, but crucially that interpersonal relationships are a pre-requisite to <b>learning</b> <b>relationships.</b> We define <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> as those which allow for the emergence of, and passage through, the zone of proximal development. At present there is a paucity of research which examines relationship formation of any type in education and in this paper we seek to address this gap. At the point of transition from one school to another there is a normative imperative to form new relationships. This paper focuses on the experiences of students in their transition to secondary school and explores the formation of relationships with their new teachers. An ethnographic method was employed which followed children during their final year of primary school and into their first year of secondary school. Through student and staff voices and observational data, the opening and closing of opportunities for the formation of interpersonal relationships, and by extension, <b>learning</b> <b>relationships,</b> are explored. The paper presents data from three schools in the UK and identifies the themes of courtesy, rules and resistance, and school systems and pedagogical practice as key determinants in relationship formation. We acknowledge that these findings represent the focal schools, but argue that the data demonstrate that attention must be paid to the construction of enabling transition contexts to facilitate the formation of interpersonal relationships which may lead to <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> in the new school. We further call for more focussed research which explores the nature of <b>learning</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R

50|$|Increasingly, UK {{schools are}} {{recognising}} {{that the long}} established Year System can have an adverse effect {{on the quality of}} teaching and learning. When the orthodox horizontal system of pastoral care is critically examined in the light of group psychology, systems thinking and customer relations, many false assumptions are revealed about <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> and <b>learning</b> disadvantages come to the fore. In particular, the role of the tutor can be too easily compromised by poor <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> rather than beneficial and supportive ones. In essence, the Year System tends to undermine the importance of the tutor's role rather than enhance it as intended, and this can have a debilitating and negative knock-on effect on teaching and learning.|$|R
50|$|Haydn, {{having worked}} {{for over a}} decade as the music {{director}} for a prince, had far more resources and scope for composing than most other composers. His position also gave him the ability to shape the forces that would play his music, as he could select skilled musicians. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building and developing ideas in his music. His next important breakthrough was in the Opus 33 string quartets (1781), in which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.Haydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was {{at the same time in}} accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities, playing for the general public. This meant he needed to write operas and write and perform virtuoso pieces. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted to achieve both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of J.S. Bach, the means to discipline and enrich his artistic gifts.Mozart rapidly came to the attention of Haydn, who hailed the new composer, studied his works, and considered the younger man his only true peer in music. In Mozart, Haydn found a greater range of instrumentation, dramatic effect and melodic resource. The <b>learning</b> <b>relationship</b> moved in both directions. Mozart also had a great respect for the older, more experienced composer, and sought to learn from him.|$|E

Of these relationships, that between student and supervisor has long been viewed as key. There are, however, limited data to describe the student perspective on what makes this relationship valuable. In the present study, we discuss the findings of semi-structured interviews with biomedical Ph. D. students from the United Kingdom and the United States to: i) determine if the <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> identified in an Australian biomedical Ph. D. cohort are also important in a larger international student cohort; and ii) improve our understanding of student perceptions of value in their supervisory relationships. 32 students from two research intensive universities, one in the United Kingdom (n =  17), and one in the United States (n =  15) were recruited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Verbatim transcripts were transcribed, validated and analysed using a Miles and Huberman method for thematic analysis. Students reported that relationships with other Ph. D. students, post-doctoral scientists and supervisors were all essential to their <b>learning.</b> Effective supervisory <b>relationships</b> were perceived as the primary source of high-level project guidance, intellectual support and confidence. Relationships with fellow students were viewed as essential for the provision of empathetic emotional support. Technical learning was facilitated, almost exclusively, by relationships with postdoctoral staff. These data make two important contributions to the scholarship of doctoral education in the biomedical sciences. Firstly, they provide further evidence for the importance of multiple <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> in the biomedical doctorate. Secondly, they clarify the form of a 'valued' supervisory relationship from a student perspective. We conclude that biomedical doctoral programs should be designed to contain a minimum level of formalised structure to promote the development of multiple <b>learning</b> <b>relationships</b> that are perceived as key to student learning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Learning {{processes}} {{allow the}} central nervous system to <b>learn</b> <b>relationships</b> between stimuli. Even stimuli from different modalities can easily be associated, and these associations can include the learning of mappings between observable parameters of the stimuli. The data struc-tures and processing methods of the brain, however, remain very poorly understood. We investigate the ability of simple, biologically plausible processing mechanisms to <b>learn</b> such <b>relationships</b> when the data is rep-resented using population codes, a coding scheme that has been found in a variety of cortical areas. We require that the <b>relationships</b> are <b>learned</b> not just {{from the point of view}} of an omniscient observer, but rather the network itself must be able to make effective use of the learned re-lationship, within the population code representations. Using a form of Hebbian learning, local winner-take-all, and homeostatic activity regula-tion away from the periphery, we obtain a learning framework which is able to <b>learn</b> <b>relationships</b> from examples and then use the learned rela-tionships for a variety of routine nervous system tasks such as inference, de-noising, cue-integration, and decision making. ...|$|R

Managing learning and change in the unique context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can obtain benefits from network alliance. The paper seeks {{to draw attention to}} learning approaches from adaptive learning to generative learning in a SME in the context of asymmetric <b>learning</b> <b>relationship.</b> A qualitative research is conducted on a towing company of Taiwan with 14 in-depth interviews on persons of strategic alliances. This study discusses an asymmetric <b>learning</b> <b>relationship</b> where a large enterprise dominates the central place of the network, decides the learning policies and practices and guides learning involving adaptive and generative learning. This case of the SME assumes adaptive learning to ensure the development of network capability and adopts generative learning through communication channels and resources provided by the central firm. The outcomes of generative learning are the enhancement of absorptive capacity, the transfer of knowledge, shared identities, and shared contextual understanding in the towing industry. Though acquiring generative learning development, the case of the SME gets a competitive advantage but chooses to stay small and to be a business owner. This situation meets the psychological needs of the Chinese people.|$|E
