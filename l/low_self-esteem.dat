5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{expressed}} {{emotion in}} carers predicts relapse in psychosis, {{but it is}} not known why this is so. In our cognitive model of psychosis, we postulated that the effect is mediated through affective changes. AIMS: To investigate the relationships between carer expressed emotion, patients' symptoms and carer characteristics during a recent relapse of psychosis. METHOD: A total of 86 patients and carers were investigated in a cross-sectional design. RESULTS: Patients whose carers showed high expressed emotion had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression, but not more psychotic symptoms or lower self-esteem. Linear regression showed that carers'critical comments predicted anxiety in patients. Critical comments were related to <b>low</b> carer <b>self-esteem</b> and avoidant coping strategies. <b>Low</b> carer <b>self-esteem</b> was also related to carer depression, stress and carer 'burden', and to <b>low</b> patient <b>self-esteem.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis was partially supported. Carer criticism was associated with patient anxiety, <b>low</b> carer <b>self-esteem</b> and poor carer coping strategies. Family interventions should focus on improving these after a relapse of symptoms of psychosis...|$|R

5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal.

5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with <b>low</b> <b>self-esteem</b> would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether {{explicit}} and implicit self-esteem, the interaction between these two constructs, and their discrepancy are associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. Participants were 95 young female adults (M = 21. 2 years, SD = 1. 88) enrolled in higher education. We administered the Name Letter Task to measure implicit self-esteem, and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale to assess explicit self-esteem. The results indicated that explicit but not implicit self-esteem was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. The interaction of implicit and explicit self-esteem was associated with suicidal ideation, indicating that participants with high implicit self-esteem combined with a <b>low</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> showed more suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem was positively associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. In addition, results showed that the direction of the discrepancy is an important: damaged self-esteem (high implicit <b>self-esteem</b> combined with <b>low</b> explicit <b>self-esteem)</b> was consistently associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness, while defensive or fragile self-esteem (high explicit and <b>low</b> implicit <b>self-esteem)</b> was not.

40|$|The present paper {{studies the}} explicit, implicit, and {{combined}} (explicit and implicit) self-esteem of troubled youths {{in comparison to}} normal youths. Influential family factors are also discussed. The main results of this paper can be summarized as follows： 1. The explicit self-esteem of troubled youths is significantly {{lower than that of}} normal youths. 2. In comparison to normal youths, troubled youths are more likely to come from divorced and remarried families, and have parents with lower levels of education; troubled youths also experience significantly greater amounts of physical and sexual abuse and emotional and physical neglect. 3. For troubled youths, the closer they are with their parents,the higher their explicit self-esteem; abuse experiences in childhood significantly predict low explicit self-esteem; and high explicit self-esteem can be predicted by communication, trust, intimacy and enjoyment with their parents. For normal youths, only <b>low</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> can be predicted by abuse experiences in childhood. 4. The implicit self-esteem of troubled youths is significantly higher than that of normal youths. 5. 	The implicit self-esteem of troubled youths is affected by their parents’marrital status; youths from divorced families have higher implicit self-esteem than those from intact families. <b>Low</b> implicit <b>self-esteem</b> in normal youths can be predicted by communication,trust, intimacy and enjoyment with their mothers. 6. Youths with <b>low</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> and high implicit self-esteem (LEHI) form the greatest proportion {{of the total number of}} troubled youths, and youths with high explicit <b>self-esteem</b> and <b>low</b> implicit <b>self-esteem</b> (HELI) form the greatest proportion of normal youths. Youths with LEHI have the most abuse experiences in childhood, the worst parent-child relationships and the most mental problems; In contrast, youth with HELI have the least abuse experiences, the best parent-child relationships and the least mental problems of the four categories of combined self-esteem. Furthermore, the combined self-esteem of youths can be predicted by abuse experiences in childhood. 本文围绕问题青少年的自尊状况展开研究，通过对比问题青少年和普通青少年的差异，考察了问题青少年在外显自尊、内隐自尊以及两类自尊组合方式上的特点，并且进一步考察了影响这三者的家庭因素。 本文的主要结论是： 1. 问题青少年的外显自尊显著低于普通青少年。 2. 相比普通青少年，问题青少年更多来自离异和再婚家庭，并且父母的文化程度较低；问题青少年童年期受到的身体虐待、性虐待、情感忽视和身体忽视显著高于普通青少年。 3. 对问题青少年来说，父母感情越好，外显自尊水平越高；其童年期受到的虐待可以显著地预测低外显自尊，而和父母的沟通、信任、亲密、欣赏等积极亲子因素可以预测高外显自尊；对普通青少年来说，只有童年期受到的虐待可以预测其低外显自尊。 4. 问题青少年的内隐自尊显著高于普通青少年。 5. 对问题青少年来说，父母的婚姻状况能够影响他们的内隐自尊，来自离异家庭青少年的内隐自尊显著高于来自完整家庭青少年的内隐自尊。而对普通青少年来说，和母亲的沟通、信任、亲密、欣赏等积极母子因素能够预测其低内隐自尊。 6. 在问题青少年中，外低内高型自尊所占比例最大；而在普通青少年中，外高内低型自尊所占比例最大。在四种自尊的组合方式中，外低内高型自尊者童年期受到的虐待最多，亲子关系最差，心理问题也最多；而外高内低型自尊者童年期受到的虐待最少，亲子关系最好，心理健康程度也最高...|$|R
