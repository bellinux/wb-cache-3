50|$|An {{optical filter}} {{with the same}} {{function}} can correctly be called a low-pass filter, but conventionally is called a <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> (low frequency is long wavelength), to avoid confusion.|$|E
5000|$|A dichromatic {{mirror is}} a <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> {{designed}} to reflect at certain boundary wavelengths. It is coated {{with layers of}} dielectric materials {{similar to those found}} in thin-film interference filters. [...] Such devices are used in fluorescence microscopy.|$|E
5000|$|Pulse-resolved {{spectral}} {{information was}} obtained by extracting wavelengths far {{from that of the}} input pulse using a <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> and detecting the filtered light with a photodiode and a real-time digital oscilloscope. [...] The radiation can also be spectrally resolved with the time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (TS-DFT), which produces a wavelength-to-time mapping such that the temporal traces collected for each event correspond to the actual spectral profile over the filtered bandwidth. The TS-DFT has subsequently been used to stretch the complete (unfiltered) output spectra of such broadband pulses, thereby allowing measurement of full pulse-resolved spectra at the megahertz repetition rate of the source (see below).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>longpass</b> (LP) <b>Filter</b> is {{an optical}} {{interference}} or coloured glass filter that attenuates shorter wavelengths and transmits (passes) longer wavelengths over the active {{range of the}} target spectrum (ultraviolet, visible, or infrared). <b>Longpass</b> <b>filters,</b> which can have a very sharp slope (referred to as edge filters), are described by the cut-on wavelength at 50 percent of peak transmission. In fluorescence microscopy, <b>longpass</b> <b>filters</b> are frequently utilized in dichroic mirrors and barrier (emission) filters. Use of the older term 'low pass' to describe <b>longpass</b> <b>filters</b> has become uncommon; filters are usually {{described in terms of}} wavelength rather than frequency, and a [...] "low pass filter", without qualification, would be understood to be an electronic filter.|$|R
40|$|In this work, two {{significant}} advances in photolithographic patterning of polyaniline (PANI) films are reported. Firstly, flash welding was enhanced {{through the use}} of polymeric substrates, enabling complete penetration of the welding of PANI films with thicknesses ranging from 5 to over 14 mu m, significantly thicker than reported previously. Masking of parts of the PANI films during flash welding enabled the formation of adjacent conducting and insulating regions as the welding changes the electrical properties of the film. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the sharpness of these edges, and indicated that the interface between the flash welded and masked regions of the PANI films was typically less than 15 mu m wide. Secondly, using <b>longpass</b> <b>filters,</b> light with a wavelength less than 570 nm was found not to contribute to the welding process. This was confirmed by the use of a 635 nm laser diode for welding the PANI films. This novel approach enabled patterning of PANI films using a direct writing technique with a narrow wavelength light source...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of broadband optical monitoring to an industrial optical coating production environment is investigated. Different monitoring strategies {{have been applied}} to the deposition of beamsplitters and <b>longpass</b> edge <b>filters</b> by electron beam evaporation without any plasma or ion assistance. While the shift and reproducibility in the optical constants were poorly specified, pure optical broadband monitoring of the coatings did not prove superior to traditional quartz crystal monitoring. On the contrary, {{the introduction of a}} hybrid monitoring strategy that combines quartz crystal and broadband optical monitoring led to significant improvements in the coating performance reproducibility compared to a pure quartz crystal monitoring approach. Accompanying computational manufacturing experiments performed for the beamsplitter design reveal the same trend...|$|R
40|$|When ultrafast noncritical {{cascaded}} second-harmonic {{generation of}} energetic femtosecond pulses {{occur in a}} bulk lithium niobate crystal optical Cherenkov waves are formed in the near- to mid-IR. Numerical simulations show that the few-cycle solitons radiate Cherenkov (dispersive) waves in the λ= 2. 2 - 4. 5 range when pumping at λ_ 1 = 1. 2 - 1. 8. The exact phase-matching point depends on the soliton wavelength, and we show that a simple <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> can separate the Cherenkov waves from the solitons. The Cherenkov waves are born few-cycle with an excellent Gaussian pulse shape, and the conversion efficiency is up to 25...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Heterostructure of Ag/ZnO was {{synthesized}} by {{a reduction}} of Tollen’s reagent on ZnO powders. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/ZnO was investigated through the degradation of three different dye solutions (methylene blue, rhodamine B and reactive orange 16) under visible light using the fluorescent lamps with a 420 nm <b>longpass</b> <b>filter.</b> The efficiencies of dye degradations for all three dyes by Ag/ZnO are better than that of pure ZnO. Furthermore, the parameters including photocatalyst loadings and initial pHs of dye solutions were also studied. The photocatalytic degradations for all three dyes were increased with the increasing of catalyst loadings. The effect of pHs on photocatalytic activity of Ag/ZnO {{can be explained by}} the interaction between the charge on the surface of photocatalyst and the charge of dye ions...|$|E
30|$|The {{morphology}} {{and size}} {{distribution of the}} microparticles were analyzed using optical and fluorescence microscopies. In order to estimate the size distribution of the microparticles, we fixed 5  μL of the microparticle suspension in 10  μL of 50 % glycerol on a slide. The samples were examined {{by means of an}} Axio Observer 3 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) with an LD A-Plan 40 x/ 0.55 M 27 lens in a light field. Fluorescent images were obtained using an HBO 100 mercury illuminator (Burner Mercury) with an XF 115 - 2 FITC <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> set, including a 505 DRLP dichroic filter, a 475 AF 40 excitation filter, and a 510 ALP emission filter (Omega Optical, USA), an EC Plan-Neofluar 100 x/ 1.30 Oil Iris M 27 lens (WD[*]=[*] 0.20 [*]mm), a numerical aperture adjustable from 0.7 to 1.3, and Immersol 518 F immersion oil (Carl Zeiss, Germany).|$|E
40|$|Flow {{inside a}} scaled model of nasal cavity was {{measured}} by tomographic PIV. The model was constructed with transparent silicon. A refractive index of working fluid was matched to the model index by mixing glycerol and water. Four cameras and double pulse laser system were used for tomographic PIV. To obtain high SNR, red fluorescence particles and <b>longpass</b> glass <b>filters</b> were used. A complex model shape was estimated by accumulating three-dimensional particle positions obtained by least square based triangulation. Morphological operations such as opening and closing were used to improve the estimation quality. The geometry information was used to distinguish the fluid and solid regions in the tomographic reconstruction procedure. The model estimation and tomographic reconstruction procedures were evaluated by synthetic image test. The synthetic images were generated by placing a computer model (stereolithography file from CT data) to a virtual 3 D coordinates and by seeding particles in the flow region randomly. Perspective transformation matrix for synthetic image generation was adopted from the experimental camera matrix. The synthetic image test shows that the reconstruction quality for a complex 3 D geometry was improved by a masking technique. Finally, flow velocity field was calculated from 3 D cross-correlation of reconstructed voxel intensities...|$|R
40|$|We present deep Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging {{observations}} of two Galactic globular clusters, 47 Tuc and M 15, using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) <b>longpass</b> (LP) <b>filter</b> and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC 2) F 606 W and F 814 W filters. These globular clusters {{have very different}} metallicities ([Fe/H] = - 0. 7 dex for 47 Tuc, and [Fe/H] = - 2. 2 dex for M 15), essentially spanning the metallicity distribution of the entire Milky Way globular cluster system, and were chosen to investigate the relationship between magnitudes in the non-standard STIS LP system and the better characterized WFPC 2 magnitudes. We determine this relationship by combining our new STIS data with archival WFPC 2 data, taking care to provide a robust and reliable transformation. Examining the 47 Tuc and M 15 data separately, {{there is no evidence}} for a metallicity dependence in the transformation relations. This allows us to combine the data for both clusters, and also include the stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud that lie within the field of view of the 47 Tuc images, to determine final transformations that are valid for main sequence stars with colors in the range 0. 3 < V 606 -I 814 < 1. 8. These final relations predict STIS magnitudes within 0. 05 mag (1 sigma) of those measured for stars in both clusters. In an appendix, we discuss the differences between our empirical transformation relations and those predicted by synthetic photometry.

30|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) {{was carried out}} on a JEOL 2100 TEM. Scanning TEM (STEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were recorded using a JEOL 2010 FETEM with an Oxford EDS detector. Samples were prepared by drop-drying the purified NC solution in chloroform onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The atomic percentages from EDS data were averaged over more than five individual areas and each area contained at least 100 NCs. Due to the low contrast in bright-field TEM images (especially for small NCs in early stages), the diameters of the samples were measured from the STEM images perpendicular to the scanning direction in case of scanning noise, and averaged over above 100 NCs. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with Siemens-Bruker D 5000 diffractometer. Samples were prepared by drop-casting a concentrated NC solution in chloroform on a low background quartz substrate. UV-vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded at RT with Agilent 8453 diode array UV-vis spectrophotometer and Horiba Jobin-Yvon Fluoromax- 3 spectrofluorometer, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, the excitation wavelengths for measuring Mn PL QY after surface exchange/passivation were 380  nm for Mn-doped ZnSxSe 1 −x NCs, 290  nm for Mn-doped ZnS NCs, 420  nm for Mn-doped CdS NCs, and 430  nm for Mn-doped CdSxSe 1 −x NCs. A 500 -nm <b>longpass</b> color <b>filter</b> was used for Mn-doped ZnS NCs. C 153 (QY[*]=[*] 54.4  % in ethanol [43]) {{was used as the}} reference dye for Mn PL QY measurements due to its large Stokes shift and similar absorption/PL spectral range with the doped NCs (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). No reference dye was selected to measure the relative QY of the band-edge PL for Mn-doped ZnSxSe 1 −x NCs. Therefore, only the integrated PL peak areas normalized to the absorbance at the excitation wavelength were compared. For the Mn-doped ZnS NCs, due to the absorption in the UV range, the relative QY versus C 153 was estimated using the emission spectrum of the Xe lamp in the spectrofluorometer. EPR measurements were performed on a concentrated chloroform suspension of NCs at 9.20  GHz using a Varian E-line X-band spectrometer at RT.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} an optical method for imaging the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{space and the}} movement of CSF in mice using a near infraredfluorescence imaging methodology. Indocyanine green bound to high-density lipoprotein (ICG-HDL) was injected into the lumber subarachnoidspace of nude mice. The time course of CSF movement was followed over 48 h. The imaging system was configured for epi-fluorescencemeasurements at near infrared wavelengths using the illumination light and narrow band excitation filtration with central wavelength of 755 nm. Emission light was filtered with a <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> with a cutoff at 798 nm. After the injection of ICG-HDL, a strong fluorescencesignal clearly delineated the cisterna magna, bilateral supracerebellar/cerebello-pontine angle cistern, and interhemispheric cistern. Much ofthe fluorescent tracer was washed out within 24 h after the injection. This study has therefore demonstrated that an optical method, employingnear infrared fluorescence imaging, can determine the CSF space {{and the movement of}} CSF in nude mice...|$|E
30|$|To {{examine the}} photokilling effect, {{the cells were}} {{irradiated}} with the visible light from a 150 -W Xe lamp (Shanghai Aojia Electronics Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). Two pieces of quartz lens were used to obtain a concentrated parallel light beam. An IR cutoff filter was set in the light path to avoid the hyperthermia effect. A 400 -nm <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> was used {{to cut off the}} UV light. The visible-light power density at the liquid surface in cell wells was 12 mW/cm 2 as measured by a power meter (PM 10 V 1; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After irradiation with this visible light for 4 h, cells were incubated in the dark for another 24 h until further analysis were conducted. The cytotoxicity examinations were carried out with the same procedure as the photokilling effect examinations but without the light irradiation, i.e., the TiO 2 -treated cells were incubated in the dark for 28 h.|$|E
30|$|For {{validation}} purposes, one mouse {{was also}} imaged ex vivo with a newly developed 360 ° free-space FMT-XCT system which combines fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) with small animal X-ray CT (XCT) into a hybrid imaging device [29]. The system {{was capable of}} simultaneous three-dimensional visualization of small animal anatomy and biodistribution of fluorescent probes in vivo. For volumetric FMT reconstructions, 12 angular projections distributed over full 360 ° range were acquired close to the excitation and emission wavelengths of PSS- 794. Following the FMT-XCT measurement, the euthanized mice were cooled to - 80 °C. For further verification of the in vivo MSOT and FMT images, cross-sectional color photographs (RGB) and fluorescence images were also obtained using a cryotome supplemented by a home-built multispectral epi-fluorescence system [30]. The system consisted of a white light source and a sensitive CCD camera with motorized filter wheels for selection of the excitation (740 nm, 40 nm bandpass filter) and emission (785 nm <b>longpass</b> <b>filter)</b> wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|H 1517 + 656 is {{an unusual}} source, even for a BL Lac object. It {{is one of the}} most {{luminous}} BL Lacs known, with extreme emission properties at radio, optical, and X-ray frequencies. Furthermore, in our WFPC 2 snapshot survey we discovered a series of peculiar arcs describing a 2 ′ ′. 4 radius ring surrounding the source. This paper describes follow-up observations with additional WFPC 2 bands and the STIS <b>longpass</b> <b>filter,</b> which have revealed this structure to be the remnants of a very recent galaxy merger. Population synthesis modelling has shown that regions of the arcs have stellar populations with age < 20 Myrs. Additionally, the circularity of the arcs indicates that the plane of the collision and hence accretion is very close to the plane of the sky. Given that BL Lac jets are thought to be aligned with the line of sight, this observation may provide a direct link between the transfer of angular momentum in an interaction and the generation of a radio source. – 2...|$|E
30|$|The general {{morphology}} and the crystallinity of {{the samples}} were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quantum F 400, FEI Company, Hillsboro, USA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku SMARTLAB XRD, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Their detailed microstructure and chemical composition were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai 20 FEG, FEI Company) with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer attached to the same microscope. Optical absorption was measured using a Hitachi U 3501 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660 C, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) with 0.35 M Na 2 SO 3 and 0.24 M Na 2 S solution as the hole scavenger electrolyte, CdSe nanotube arrays on ITO as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt foil as the counter electrode. The illumination source was the visible light irradiation (100 mW/cm 2) from a 150 -W xenon lamp (Bentham IL 7, Berkshire, UK) equipped with a 400 -nm <b>longpass</b> <b>filter.</b> Photocatalytic activities of the nanotube arrays were evaluated from the degradation of 0.5 ppm MB aqueous solution (5 ml) with and without adding 10 vol.% ethanol.

40|$|Knowledge of in-situ fuel {{distributions}} {{in practical}} combustion devices, such as internal combustion engines, {{is crucial for}} research and devlopment purposes. Numerous imaging techniques, mostly based on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), have been developed and yield high levels of 2 -D spatial information, but generally lack the temporal resolution (frame rates) necessary to resolve important timescales at sub-millisecond levels for sustained times. A planar LIF technique for quantitatively visualizing fuel distribution is presented which gives not only high spatial resolution, but also high temporal resolution. Using a high-speed CMOS camera, a lens-coupled image intensifier, and frequency-tripled diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser allows for capturing LIF images of biacetyl that {{is used as a}} fluorescence tracer at 12 kHz (one crank-angle resolution at 2000 RPM) for hundreds of consecutive engine cycles. The LIF signal strength of biacetyl doped in iso-octane is shown to vary substantially over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The low absorption coefficient at 355 nm and a <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> in the detection path exclude bias errors due to laser beam attenuation and fluorescence trapping. An intensifier gate time of 350 ns is shown to suppress the detection of phosphorescence signals under practical conditions. An example for a quantitative high-speed measurement of fuel concentration at varying pressure and temperature conditions is presented. Quantitative equivalence ratio maps are shown for the fuel injection event within a single cycle in a spark-ignition direct-injected engine, showing the ability of the technique to not only reveal static fuel concentration maps, but also the motion of the fuel cloud along with very steep gradients. Spray velocities determined from the moving fuel cloud are in agreement with previous particle image velocimetry measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} {{naturally}} fluorescing components (autofluorophores) encountered in most biological samples hinders the detection and identification of labeled targets through fluorescence-based techniques. Time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) {{is a technique}} by which the effects of autofluorescence are reduced by using specific fluorescent labels with long fluorescence lifetimes (compared with autofluorophores) in conjunction with time-gated detection. A time-resolved fluorescence microscope (TRFM) is described {{that is based on}} a standard epifluorescence microscope modified by the addition of a pulsed excitation source and an image-intensified time-gateable CCD camera. The choice of pulsed excitation source for TRFM has a large impact on the price and performance of the instrument. A flash lamp with rapid discharge characteristics was selected for our instrument because of the high spectral energy in the UV region and short pulse length. However, the flash output decayed with an approximate lifetime of 18 μs and the TRFM required a long-lived lanthanide chelate label to ensure that probe fluorescence was visible after decay of the flash plasma. We synthesized a recently reported fluorescent chelate (BHHCT) and conjugated it to a monoclonal antibody directed against the waterborne parasite Giardia lamblia. For a 600 -nm bandpass filter set and a gate delay of 60 μs, the TRFM provided an 11. 3 -fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of labeled Giardia over background. A smaller gain in an SNR of 9. 69 -fold was achieved with a 420 -nm <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> set; however, the final contrast ratio between labeled cyst and background was higher (11. 3 versus 8. 5). Despite the decay characteristics of the light pulse, flash lamps have many practical advantages compared with optical chopper wheels and modulated lasers for applications in TRFM. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} efforts {{for the development}} of compact and miniaturized oxygen sensor for various applications including multianalyte sensor and sensors with a reliable and accurate monitoring of oxygen concentration in controlled environments requiring measurements under low oxygen concentration. This work has been devoted to the development of structurally integrated luminescence quenching based sensors, the structure comprising of Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) as excitation source, oxygen sensitive dyes as the sensing element and PECVD based thin film photodiodes for detection. The whole structure can also be extended towards the development on flexible substrates.;The developed sensor is less cumbersome and bulky and easy to use compared to the existing sensors. The commonly used Clark electrode for measuring dissolved oxygen suffers from interference from the ambient, requires frequent maintenance and electrolyte change, and also consumes oxygen during the measurement resulting in a little inaccurate measurement and hence restricts the resolution of the sensor. In addition the whole set-up is very bulky, which further motivates the development of these luminescence-based sensors. Another advantage of these luminescence-based sensors is the ease of tunability of sensitivity for different oxygen levels merely by changing the sensor dye.;This work has been devoted mainly to the development of appropriate thin film, low temperature grown thin film photodiodes optimized for best possible performance of the whole sensor configuration. In addition the three component integration issues were solved by overcoming all the challenges due to electromagnetic noise generated by the OLED, interfering with the photodiode response and hence limiting the sensitivity.;Amorphous silicon/silicon germanium and nanocrystalline silicon thin films were characterized for better performance in photodiodes. The sensitivity spectrums of the photodiodes were engineered to have maximum sensitivity around 640 nm and minimum around 535 nm, which is the peak emission wavelength of OLED. This process development resulted in enhanced immunity of the photodiode to the background resulting in enhanced sensitivity.;Two types of detection modes were used: intensity monitoring and PL lifetime monitoring mode. In the intensity mode, the reduction of the PL intensity in presence of oxygen due to quenching effects was monitored. The oxygen sensitive film partially absorbs the OLED light at 535 nm and then it emits at around 640 nm. Two filters were used, one bandpass on top of OLED to reduce the background tail emission followed by the sensor film and then a <b>longpass</b> <b>filter</b> to stop any unabsorbed OLED light. Sensor dyes films were either platinum or palladium based (PtOEP or PdOEP) respectively. A lock-in amplifier was used, to reduce the noise during detection and hence enhancing the sensitivity. But the major challenges were the OLED tail extending to 650 nm, which was solved by coumarene doping of the Alq 3 based OLED resulting in narrower spectrum.;The photoluminescence lifetime of the sensor dye film also changes with higher oxygen concentration and thus provides an alternate method of oxygen monitoring. For the PL lifetime based technique, the OLED was pulsed and it was off during the measurement. This resulted in the possibility of elimination of the filters and hence further minimizing and simplifying the sensor configuration. At this point the frequency response of the photodetectors becomes very important and their response time becomes the major issue. Proper impedance matching of the detecting circuit is critical for fast operation of the photodetectors. The boron diffusion during growth was observed to dominantly affect the frequency response, which was partially solved by using nip structure instead of pin structure photodiode. Using nanocrystalline and development of quantum dot photodetectors with amorphous layer grain boundary passivation further improved the response speed. Absolute quantum efficiencies were improved for the detectors. The thin film photodiodes were grown using PECVD, using both ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) and VHF (Very High Frequency) PECVD techniques...|$|E
