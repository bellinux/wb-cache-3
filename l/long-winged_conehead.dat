50|$|Conocephalus discolor, the <b>long-winged</b> <b>conehead,</b> is {{a member}} of the family Tettigoniidae. This {{bush-cricket}} is native to the British Isles. This species can be easily confused with the short-winged conehead (Conocephalus dorsalis), a close relative. These two species are phenotypically similar; however, the distinguishing factor between the two is the fully developed set of wings the <b>long-winged</b> <b>conehead</b> possesses that allows for flight. In the short-winged coneheads the hind wings are shorter than the abdomen, causing the wings to be vestigial and the species is incapable of flight. For this reason it is hard to discriminate between the two species during the early stages of their life cycle before the wings have fully developed. The colouration of the conehead is typically a grass green, though there are some brown phenotypes, with a distinctive brown stripe down its back.|$|E
50|$|C. discolor can {{be found}} in parts of France, Italy, and the Netherlands, but it has made is biggest {{appearance}} in the United Kingdom. When the species was first discovered in Britain in the 1940s it was confined to the South Coast but in the 1980s there was dramatic population growth and its range expanded more than 150 miles in 20 years. Today the <b>long-winged</b> <b>conehead</b> {{can be found}} in northwestern parts of the country beyond the River Thames and as far west as Wales.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increase}} in the global climate {{over the past few}} decades has had a significant impact on the spread of this species. The northward range expansion coincides with the worldwide {{increase in}} temperature due to the greenhouse effect. Universally, species respond to fluctuations in climate by increasing or contracting their breeding ranges. If the opportunity arises for a species to expand its realised niche due to favourable conditions that have become available, it is advantageous for them to do so. In the 1950s the climate began to cool in the northern hemisphere, causing longer winters in southern Europe. This kept the <b>long-winged</b> <b>coneheads</b> in the southern part of the UK, where they were first sited, for a period of time. In 1975 the effects of the greenhouse gases began to neutralise the cooling effects from the previous decades, and as the climate in the United Kingdom slowly rose, the <b>long-winged</b> <b>coneheads</b> started to increase the limits of their range farther northward. However, the major expansion did not occur until 1980 when global warming caused a significant increase in temperature in the northern hemisphere. Since 1980 the temperature has risen linearly by [...] ± [...] per decade and the greatest impact fell between 40°N and 70°N latitude. This latitudinal region includes the United Kingdom and southern Europe, which explains why the long-wing conehead, and other European fauna, has responded most readily to the warming climate and expanded its range.|$|R
50|$|Like many behaviours, {{there are}} costs and {{benefits}} to the calling song. Mating calls are beneficial to the individuals because their song attracts females that they can potentially mate with. However, songs can also signal predators and alert them of the male's presence and presents a risk to his life. Though male stridulation can lead to death, <b>long-winged</b> <b>conehead</b> males continue to produce their song because the benefits of attracting a female outweigh the costs of being eaten. It is within the individuals best interest to maximise his reproductive success, including his ability to find a mate, and therefore this mating behaviour within the species.|$|E
