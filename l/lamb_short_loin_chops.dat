40|$|Purple rice is {{a strain}} of glutaneous rice rich in {{anthocyanins}} and γ-oryzanol. Both types of compounds are involved in antioxidant and lipid metabolism of mammals. Three experimental diet types were used which consisted approximately by half either of purple rice, white rice or corn. Diets were fed to 3 × 10 pigs growing from about 30 to 100 kg. Meat samples were investigated either as raw or cured <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> or as smoked bacon produced from the belly. Various physicochemical traits were assessed and data were evaluated by analysis of variance. Traits describing water-holding capacity (drip, thaw, and cooking losses) and tenderness (sensory grading, shear force) of the meat were mostly not significantly affected by the diet type. However, purple rice feeding of pigs resulted in lower fat and cholesterol contents of loin and smoked bacon compared to white rice, but not compared to corn feeding except of the fat content of the loin. The shelf life of the raw <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> was improved by purple rice as well. In detail, the occurrence of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances after 9 days of chilled storage was {{three to four times}} higher in the white rice and corn diets than with purple rice. The n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in the raw <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> was 9 : 1 with purple rice and clearly higher with 12 : 1 with the other diets, meat lipids. Level and kind of effect of purple rice found in raw meat was not always recovered in the cured <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> and the smoked bacon. Still the impression of flavor and color, as well as overall acceptability were best in the smoked bacon from the purple-rice fed pigs, whereas this effect did not occur in the cured <b>loin</b> <b>chops.</b> These findings suggest that purple rice has a certain, useful, bioactivity in pigs concerning meat quality, but some of these effects are of low practical relevance. Further studies have to show ways how transiency and low recovery in meat products of some of the effects can be counteracted...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} omega- 3 intramuscular {{fatty acids}} in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum of commercially prepared Australian lamb <b>loin</b> <b>chops.</b> Meats, denuded of external fats were cooked {{by means of}} conductive dry-heat using a fry grilling hot plate, to a core temperature of 70 °C. An untrained consumer panel assessed meat appearance, aroma, tenderness, juiciness, taste and overall liking. Results showed no compositional alterations (P > 0. 05) to omega- 3 fatty acids due to cooking treatment, whereas on absolute terms (mg/ 100 g muscle) omega- 3 fatty acids significantly (P < 0. 05) increased. The mean EPA + DHA content of the cooked meat at 32. 8 ± 2. 3 mg/ 100 g muscle exceeded the minimum 30 mg/ 100 g per edible portion required for the defined Australian classification as 'source' long-chain (≥ C 20) omega- 3 for cooked lamb. A 3. 4 % intramuscular fat content in the initial raw meat was sufficient to maintain acceptable overall sensory eating quality.

40|$|Changes in the {{features}} of food demand and consumption have moved from the mass consumption model towards an increasing qualitative differentiation of products and demand. This movement towards addressing consumers’ demand for food products with more advanced quality attributes has led to increasingly complex food qualification processes and a proliferation of standards. Accompanying these changes in the agro-food system is a growing consumer concern for food safety and quality. One important attribute of “quality” is the origin of a food product. This paper focuses on lamb originating from the Karoo region of South Africa and tests consumers’ willingness {{to pay a premium}} for this specific origin attribute of the product. A random nth price auction was conducted to obtain willingness to pay estimates for a premium on a 500 g packet of certified Karoo lamb <b>loin</b> <b>chops.</b> Various demographic and behavioural variables were linked to participants’ individual bids {{in order to determine the}} possible influence of these variables on participants’ bidding behaviour.

40|$|Meat colour is an {{important}} criterion in the appeal of meat to consumers {{at the point of}} sale.
