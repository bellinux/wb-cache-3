5|$|The fort is {{the second}} largest Danish fort after Kronborg, the {{inspiration}} for Shakespeare's Hamlet. It was built by Ove Gjedde {{with the help of}} local laborers in Danish style. The <b>lower</b> <b>compartment</b> in the basement adjoining the fort was used as a store room, prison and a rest room for the soldiers, while the governor and priests resided in the second level. Fort Dansborg was the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. Originally a fishing village, Tharangambadi (referred as Tranquebar) was fortified by the Danish, who used the port as the main trading post for the colony, with the major export of the colony being cotton textiles. During the middle of the 18th century, the commercial importance of the town declined and the centre of textile production moved to Serampore in the state of Bengal. But Tranquebar still remained the headquarters of the Colony. The fort and the town was sold to the British in 1845 and, along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not a trading post anymore.|$|E
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment</b> twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
25|$|The concept itself {{consisted}} of pre-packed meals or snacks — usually, Spam salads out and sandwiches back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment {{in the seat}} back {{in front of each}} passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic food container. This simple refrigeration technique prevented food for the return trip that would spend several hours inside a small, confined space from going off. For the airline's cabin staff, it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment</b> that could only be opened by cabin staff during the aircraft's turnaround at the destination airport (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).|$|E

6000|$|There {{having been}} three {{principal}} styles of architecture in Venice,--the Greek or Byzantine, the Gothic, and the Renaissance, {{it will be}} shown, in the sequel, that the Renaissance itself {{is divided into three}} correspondent families: Renaissance engrafted on Byzantine, which is earliest and best; Renaissance engrafted on Gothic, which is second, and second best; Renaissance on Renaissance, which is double darkness, and worst of all. The palaces in which Renaissance is engrafted on Byzantine are those noticed by Commynes: they are characterized by an ornamentation very closely resembling, and in some cases identical with, early Byzantine work; namely, groups of colored marble circles inclosed in interlacing bands. I have put on the opposite page one of these ornaments, from the Ca' Trevisan, in which a most curious and delicate piece of inlaid design is introduced into a band which is almost exactly copied from the church of Theotocos at Constantinople, and correspondent with others in St. Mark's. There is also much Byzantine feeling in the treatment of the animals, especially in the two birds of the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment,</b> while the peculiar curves of the cinque cento leafage are visible in the leaves above. The dove, alighted, with the olive-branch plucked off, is opposed to the raven with restless expanded wings. Beneath are evidently the two sacrifices [...] "of every clean fowl and of every clean beast." [...] The color is given with green and white marbles, the dove relieved on a ground of greyish green, and all is exquisitely finished.|$|E

5000|$|The rescue chamber was a {{pear shaped}} steel chamber, the big end uppermost, seven {{feet at the}} {{greatest}} diameter and ten feet high. It is divided into an upper closed compartment and a lower open compartment by a horizontal bulkhead which has a water tight hatch in its middle. Surrounding the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment</b> is a ballast tank of a capacity just {{equal to that of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment.</b> Inside the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment</b> is a reel with 400 ft of [...]5 in steel wire on it. The reel is operated by a shaft leading into the upper compartment. The shaft is rotated by an air motor. On the bottom edge of the <b>lower</b> <b>compartment</b> a rubber gasket is embedded into a circular groove, so that when the chamber is brought into contact with a flat surface (the hatch ring) a water tight joint may be effected with the application of pressure. Attached to the upper compartment is an air supply and an atmospheric exhaust hose, wire wound for strength. Also electric cables for telephone and light are attached. A wire pendant for hoisting and lowering is shackled into a pad-eye on top. This wire is also used for retrieving the chamber in case of emergency. The forward and after hatches of American submarines were fitted for attaching the rescue chamber. They have a flat doughnut shaped plate welded to the hatch coaming upon which the bottom of the chamber rests and a bail over the center of the hatch to which the haul down wire must be attached by the diver.|$|E

40|$|Acute <b>lower</b> {{extremity}} <b>compartment</b> syndrome (ALECS) {{is associated}} with a high mortality rate in trauma victims and necessitates fasciotomy. The presented protocol provides a guideline to screen trauma patients for acute <b>lower</b> extremity <b>compartment</b> syndrome if they are at high risk. Methods: This prospective observational study included screening of 45 intensive care patients in the Shock Trauma Unit who met at least one high risk criterion, including pulmonary artery catheter-directed shock resucitation, open or closed tibial shaft fracture, major vascular injury below the aortic trifucation, abdominal compartment syndrome, pelvic or lower extremity crush in jury. Screening started at admission and was repeated every 4 hour for the first 48 hours. The screening began with physical exam, including lower leg circumference, pain assessment, neurological exam, and vascular exam. Compartment pressures were measured in suspected patients. Positive screening, (Delta) P< 30 mmHg (where (Delta) P is the difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the compartment pressure), led to an aggressive four compartment fasciotomy. Results: The incidence of acute <b>lower</b> extremity <b>compartment</b> syndrome in the screened patients was 20 % (nine o...|$|R

50|$|Mineral jigs or gravity {{concentrators}} {{were designed}} to allow for separation of materials with different densities. This process is accomplished by flowing a stream of liquid-suspended material over a screen and subjecting the screen to a vertical hydraulic pulsation. This pulsation momentarily expands or dilates the screen bed and allows the heavier materials to work toward the bottom. Heavier material, or concentrate, that is finer than the screen openings will gradually work through the beds and the retention screen into the hutch, or <b>lower</b> <b>compartment.</b> That material, the concentrate, is continuously discharged from this compartment or hutch through a spigot. If the concentrate is coarser than the screen, it will work down {{to the top of}} the shot bed, and can be withdrawn either continuously or intermittently.
