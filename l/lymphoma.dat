Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia.

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's <b>lymphoma,</b> primary central nervous system <b>lymphoma,</b> and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is <b>lymphoma,</b> which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E

40|$|Objective-The {{present study}} aims at {{examining}} the <b>lymphomas</b> in Iran and {{the similarities and}} differences with those of western countries. Methods-In a descriptive observational study, the histochemical and immunohistochemical markers were used to examine the biopsied specimens of 263 patients with Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s <b>lymphomas</b> collected from six diagnostic centers. The non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s <b>lymphomas</b> were classified according to the updated Kiel classification and Rye classification, respectively. Results-Out of the 225 cases that were diagnosed as <b>lymphomas,</b> 170 were non-Hodgkin’s and 55 were Hodgkin’s <b>lymphomas.</b> Sixty-nine percent of the Non-Hodgkin’s <b>lymphomas</b> were of the B-type, 6. 5 percent of the T-type and the rest were Hodgkin’s <b>lymphomas</b> (24. 5 %). Conclusion-The comparison made between {{the findings of this study}} and those of western countries indicates that high-grade non-Hodgkin’s <b>lymphomas</b> are more prevalent than low-grade <b>lymphomas</b> in Iran. The use of the updated Kiel classification reveals {{the similarities and differences}} between the <b>lymphomas</b> of our study and those of western studies. Such studies provide useful information for a more precise diagnosis and hence more success in the treatment of <b>lymphomas.</b> The results also call for more research into the reasons for the prevalence of high-grade <b>lymphomas</b> and rare occurrence of follicular <b>lymphomas</b> in Iran...|$|R
