The project is currently under evaluation by the Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea to allow a large scale application. In order to identify areas, where contamination exceeds the limits set by law (DM 152 / 2006) for industrial sites, soil samplings and analyses were carried out.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of methanol extract of <b>Laurus</b> <b>nobilis</b> against paracetamol induced liver damage in rats. Materials and Methods: The methanol extract of <b>Laurus</b> <b>nobilis</b> (200 mg/kg & 400 mg/kg) was administered orally to the animals with hepatotoxicity induced by paracetamol (400 mg/kg). Silymarin (25 mg/kg) was given as reference standard. All the test drugs were administered orally by suspending in 0. 5 % Carboxy methyl cellulose solution. Results: Paracetamol has enhanced the levels of ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin, whereas the group receiving high dose (400 mg/kg body weight) methanol extract of <b>Laurus</b> <b>nobilis</b> was effective in protecting the liver against the injury induced by paracetamol in rats than that of low dose (200 mg/kg body weight) treated group. This was evident from a significant reduction in serum enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} the essential oil of <b>Laurus</b> <b>nobilis</b> <b>L.</b> (Lauraceae) and its three main components on α-glucosidase and reactive oxygen species scavenging activity. The chemical composition of the essential oil from <b>Laurus</b> <b>nobilis</b> <b>L.</b> leaves was analyzed by GC/GC-MS and resulted in the identification of 29 compounds, representing 99. 18 % of the total oil. 1, 8 -cineole (68. 82 %), 1 -(S) -α-pinene (6. 94 %), and R-(+) -limonene (3. 04 %) were determined to be the main components. The antioxidant features of the essential oil and its three main components were evaluated using inhibition of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals, inhibition of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation assays. The results show that the DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide radical as well as hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities of the essential oil are greater than the positive controls and the three main components of the oil when tested independently. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the oil occurred less frequently than with 1, 8 -cineole and R-(+) -limonene alone, but the effects were more pronounced than those seen with 1 -(S) -α-pinene and the positive controls. An α-glucosidase inhibition assay was applied to evaluate the in-vitro antidiabetic activity of the essential oil. IC 50 -values were obtained for laurel essential oil, 1, 8 -cineole, 1 -(S) -α-pinene, and R-(+) -limonene: 1. 748 μL/mL, 1. 118 μL/mL, 1. 420 μL/mL and 1. 300 μL/mL, respectively.

The repellent potential of 19 essential oils from the island of Corsica, France, was evaluated in a bio-assay with the mosquito Aedes aegypti, in order to assess the 'space repellent' properties of these oils. Lavendula stoechas, Helichrysum italicum (leaves) and <b>Laurus</b> <b>nobilis</b> oils showed a capability of reducing the attractivity of a human finger for yellow fever mosquitoes in a Y-tube olfactometer.
