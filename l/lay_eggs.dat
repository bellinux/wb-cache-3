5|$|The American robin {{begins to}} breed shortly after {{returning}} to its summer range. It {{is one of the}} first North American bird species to <b>lay</b> <b>eggs,</b> and normally has two to three broods per breeding season, which lasts from April to July.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Rouen duck, {{the other}} popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> from early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after {{hatching}} weigh up to , {{large enough to}} eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of the}} game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> from early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|While most mollusc shells are {{composed}} mainly of aragonite, those gastropods that <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> {{with a hard}} shell use calcite (sometimes with traces of aragonite) to construct the eggshells.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} tree snake <b>lays</b> <b>eggs</b> in clutches {{from five}} to seven, with one female recorded as <b>laying</b> 11 <b>eggs</b> in January.|$|R

50|$|A non-hermaphrodite, it <b>lays</b> <b>eggs</b> in {{characteristic}} disk-shape clutches, {{adhering to}} various substrates. Unlike some other apple snails, this snail <b>lays</b> its <b>eggs</b> below the waterline.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E
5|$|The adult robin is preyed upon by hawks, cats, and snakes, {{but when}} feeding in flocks, {{it can be}} {{vigilant}} and watch other birds for reactions to predators. Brown-headed cowbirds <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> in robin nests (see brood parasite), but robins usually reject the cowbird eggs.|$|E
5|$|The female pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) will <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> in a willie wagtail nest, {{although}} the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood parasitism is rare. Parasitism by the fan-tailed (Cacomantis flabelliformis), brush, (C. variolosus), Horsfield's bronze (Chrysococcyx basalis), and shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) {{has also been}} reported.|$|E
50|$|Biomphalaria glabrata snails <b>lay</b> <b>egg</b> masses at {{rather a}} high rate (about 1 per day). One snail can <b>lay</b> 14,000 <b>eggs</b> during its whole life span.|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, the {{question}} mark flies and <b>lays</b> <b>eggs</b> {{in the spring}} {{until the end of}} May. The summer adults emerge and fly from May-September, <b>laying</b> <b>eggs</b> that develop into the winter form; these adults appear in late August and spend the winter in various shelters.|$|R
50|$|Sexes are {{separate}} (gonochorism). Females <b>lays</b> <b>eggs</b> (oviparous).|$|R
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E
5|$|The main {{spawning}} season for bigfin reef squids usually begins in May, but they <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> {{all year round}} and {{spawning season}}s can vary by location. A single female can spawn {{more than once in}} her lifetime. Females can release 20 to 1180 eggs per individual and will die soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to <b>lay</b> <b>eggs.</b> These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{horn fly}} <b>lays</b> <b>eggs</b> in fresh cow manure, {{and the female}} is known to <b>lay</b> her <b>eggs</b> in the feces before the cow has even {{completed}} defecation.|$|R

5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, {{the adult}} females {{of this species}} <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> in {{tower-shaped}} structures. The eggs hatch as veliger larvae, which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the seabed as tiny snails. Crabs are a predator of this sea snail. After {{the death of the}} snails, if the shells are still intact they are often used by hermit crabs.|$|E

5|$|Most mammals are viviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, <b>lay</b> <b>eggs.</b> The {{monotremes}} have a sex determination system {{different from that of}} most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} {{is found in the}} Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in {{saltwater}} and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to <b>lay</b> <b>eggs.</b> The {{loggerhead sea turtle}} has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become , producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E

5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which {{are larger than}} those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and <b>lay</b> <b>eggs,</b> but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|P. schultzi usually <b>lays</b> <b>eggs</b> on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the}} top of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, <b>lay</b> the <b>eggs</b> on it, and then cover the eggs. P. schultzi has been seen <b>laying</b> <b>eggs</b> in a rolled-up leaf in a web of Ischnothele karschi.|$|R
