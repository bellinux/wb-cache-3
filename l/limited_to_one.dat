5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder would be <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but {{is limited by the}} availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> jump.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt was <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> term by Kentucky's {{constitution}} at the time. He {{returned to}} his legal practice in Hopkinsville, and in December 1967, became Special Counsel in Kentucky for Southern Railway. In July 1968, he was named director of the Ford Foundation's Institute for Rural America, suggesting legislative remedies for poverty including the establishment of state area development districts. In 1971, he helped found the Coalition for Rural America and was elected its chair. The Coalition worked to implement the suggestions of the Institute for Rural America. Breathitt also {{served as president of}} the American Child Centers to promote private preschool education and was appointed as the federal representative on the Southern Interstate Nuclear Board in September 1968. When Southern Railway became part of Norfolk Southern Corporation in 1972, Breathitt became vice-president for public affairs, a position he held until his retirement in 1992.|$|E

She uses this ability to her advantage to attack others she believes deserve to be kicked, but this causes her to be shunned and bullied by her peers. Although she initially shows no attraction towards Yuu, she eventually falls in love with him and stays by his side even after he loses all of his memories of her. She is a fan of Zhiend, influenced by her older brother , who once had the ability to control air movements and vibrations, which he used when playing the guitar.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{made his}} senior {{international}} debut {{later that year}} at the 1993 World Championships in Munich and Dortmund, Germany, where he earned another silver medal with Sweden. He contributed a goal and an assist over eight games. Three years later, he was added to Sweden's roster for the 1996 World Championships in Vienna, Austria, after the Canucks were eliminated in the NHL playoffs. He was pointless while competing in one game, as Sweden failed to medal. Several months later, Näslund competed in the inaugural 1996 World Cup, but was again <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> game. Sweden reached the semifinal, where they were eliminated by Canada. Competing in his third World Championships in 1999, Näslund helped Sweden to a bronze medal with a 10-point effort in 10games.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E

5|$|The Indianapolis Colts {{opened the}} 1999 {{season with a}} 31–14 victory over Buffalo, but gave up a 28–7 lead the {{following}} week against the Patriots and lost. After defeating San Diego 27–19 in {{a game in which}} Manning threw for over 400yards, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week, they lost again, to Miami. The Colts responded by winning 11 of their remaining 12 games, finishing 13–3 and the AFC East division. The 10 game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record. As the second seed in the AFC, the Colts earned a first round bye, and faced Tennessee in the playoffs. The Colts lost 19–16 to the Super Bowl bound Titans and Manning was <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> touchdown run. Manning finished the year with 4,135 passing yards and 26 passing touchdowns, and was named both Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl, both firsts for him.
