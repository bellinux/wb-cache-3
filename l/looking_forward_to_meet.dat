The American sailor is not a cheering animal, like his English relative, but he quite as clearly understands what ought to be received with congratulation, as those who are apt to make more noise. The Vineyard men, in particular, were habitually quiet and thoughtful, there being but one seaman in the craft who did not husband his lay, and <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the wants of a future day. This is the result of education, men usually becoming quiet as they gain ideas, and feel that the tongue has been given to us in order to communicate them to our fellows. Still, the joy at receiving this unlooked-for assistance was great among the Vineyard men, and each party went to work with activity and zeal.|$|R

Pepe Nietnagel (Hansi Kraus) and his classmates are not <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their new teacher, but Dr. Bach's easy-going and frank personality soon gains their genuine sympathy and support. Oberstudiendirektor Dr. Taft (Theo Lingen) as the old-fashioned traditionalist he is, however, just as quickly disapproves of Dr. Bach's approach to the students, and together with the majority teaching staff's majority (this not including young music teacher Julia Schumann, played by Gerlinde Locker) decide {{to get rid of}} him as quickly as possible. When Pepe and his friends learn about this, they begin to fight tooth and nail to keep Dr. Bach at their school, culminating in a school play in which Dr. Bach and the students present a very liberal re-interpretation of Schiller's William Tell.|$|E

During this dinner Peter Morrison reveals a story {{he has just}} been told by old schoolmate Ivan Blessington who heard it from Lloyd-James himself recently: after the infamous party in 1945 the mean Lloyd-James had left half a crown instead of the ordinary five shillings for cleaning up. The outraged housekeeper, a young woman, had gone searching for Lloyd-James and found him sleeping. As {{it turned out the}} two of them had sex and she became pregnant. Lloyd-James didn’t know of this until recently when she wrote to him, telling him she had born him a son (officially with another) in 1946. She was now a widow and lived in poor circumstances and therefore asked Lloyd-James for some help. According to Blessington, Lloyd-James had been happily surprised and had been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> his son.|$|E

A group known as Intolerance Free Weyburn started a petition urging organizers to reconsider LaBarbera's involvement, and planned a protest at the event itself, citing AFTAH's history of anti-gay rhetoric, and for being designated as a hate group by SPLC. Despite receiving similar criticism in 2013 for inviting a speaker from Courage International to the convention, the decision was defended by the organization's president Marcy Mallette, who stated that [...] "his website is for truth, and that's not hateful at all", but also {{went on to say}} that she [...] "welcomed dialogue", given that [...] "there's nothing worse than just being silent about everything." [...] LaBarbera himself confirmed that he would still appear at the event, characterized the protest as a [...] "homo-Marxist attempt to shut down my speech", and indicated that he was also <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Bill Whatcott, a fellow anti-gay and pro-life supporter that he dubbed [...] "the most fearless truth-teller" [...] he had ever met, at the event as well. Debra Button, mayor of Weyburn, announced that she and her city council would consider pulling the CDN$1,000 in funding it had provided for the event in response to the controversy.|$|E

40|$|As políticas públicas para desenvolvimento na Amazônia Brasileira desenvolvidas nas décadas de 1960 e 1970 estão diretamente relacionadas comum projeto {{nacional de}} desenvolvimento, que tinha forte apoio do governo militar e que tinha como base a construção de rodovias, a ocupação ordenada de “vazios demográficos”, a produção agropecuária e a intervenção estatal. A rodovia federal Cuiabá – Santarém (BR – 163) foi uma das obras compreendidas como essenciais no que tange às políticas para Amazônia compreendidas dentro desse grande projeto nacional de desenvolvimento. O projeto de construção daBR – 163 foiiniciado na década de 1970 e logo depois foi abandonado. No final de década de 1990 com o avanço do setor agropecuário nas regiões Centro – Oeste e Norte do país houve um forte apelo para a retomada do projeto. Com vistas a atender as crescentes demandas pelo asfaltamento da referida rodovia, o governo anunciou a retomada do projeto no ano 2000. Diante da iminência de asfaltamento da referida rodovia houve uma manifestação, principalmente da sociedade civil organizada, a fim de exigir medidas de mitigação de impactos socioambientais. A fim de amenizar possíveis impactos desagregadores no que tange a questões ambientais, sociais e até mesmo econômicas, o Governo Federal em uma ação interministerial optou pela criação de um Distrito Florestal Sustentável (DFS) na área de influência da BR – 163. Essa dissertação de mestrado se propõe a verificar se de fato o DFS conseguiu atenuar os impactos ambientais na região, considerando que se encontra numa área com diversas políticas desenvolvimentistas. ______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe public {{policies}} {{for the development}} of the Brazilian Amazon, created during the 60 ’s and 70 ’s, are directly related to a common national Project of development, that had a strong support of the military government and was based on the construction of highways, organized occupation of “empty demographic spaces”, the agricultural production and State intervention. The federal highway between Cuiabá and Santarém (BR – 163) was one of the works considered essential, regarding Amazon’s policies among this big national project of development. The building project of BR – 163 was initiated at the 70 ’s and abandoned right after its start. At the end of the 90 ’s, with the advance at the agricultural sector on the Midwest and North regions of the country, there was a strong appeal for the recovery of that project. <b>Looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the growing demands for the paving of that highway, the government announced the return of the project at the year of 2000. With the imminence of the paving of the referred highway, there was a manifestation of the organized civil society, demanding measures of mitigation of the socio-environmental impacts. In order to ease the possible dangerous impacts, regarding environmental, social and even economic issues, the Federal Government (on an action among ministries) created a Sustainable Forest District (DFS) at the area under the influence of the BR – 163. This master’s dissertation has the proposal to check if the DFS has in fact been able to soften the environmental impacts on that region, considering that it is on an area among several development policies...|$|E
