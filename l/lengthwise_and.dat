5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
25|$|Snails need hiding places, {{especially}} during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local garden center can be split in two <b>lengthwise,</b> <b>and</b> stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.|$|E
25|$|Splitboard: A {{snowboard}} which splits in half <b>lengthwise,</b> <b>and</b> {{allows the}} bindings to be quickly connected to hinges aligning them longitudinally on the board, allowing the {{halves of the}} boards to function as cross country skis. Used with removable skins {{on the base of}} the board, which easily slide forward on snow but not backwards, they allow a snowboard to easily travel into the backcountry. Once the rider is ready to descend, the board halves can simply be joined back together.|$|E
5000|$|In garter-stitch fabrics, the [...] "purl" [...] rows {{stand out}} from the [...] "knit" [...] rows, which {{provides}} the basis for shadow knitting. Garter-stitch fabric has significant <b>lengthwise</b> elasticity <b>and</b> little tendency to curl, due to the symmetry of its faces.|$|R
50|$|Tricot is {{very common}} in lingerie. The {{right side of the}} fabric has fine {{lengthwise}} ribs while the reverse has crosswise ribs. The properties of these fabrics include having a soft and 'drapey' texture with some <b>lengthwise</b> stretch <b>and</b> almost no crosswise stretch.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-15 mm. The forewings are whitish or pale {{gray with}} dark <b>lengthwise</b> stripes <b>and</b> three dark {{spots in the}} median area. The inner margin is shaded with brown near base and the terminal line is dark. The hindwings are uniform whitish.|$|R
25|$|Gatsby usually {{consist of}} long bread rolls cut <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> {{opened up to}} form a sort of cradle which is filled with various fillings. While the choice of filling in a Gatsby varies widely {{depending}} on customer preference and vendor, one standard item is usually hot chips, i.e., French fries or slap chips (French fries with vinegar). Hot dog buns and roti flat bread are sometimes used, and it is typically prepared using a sauce, most commonly achar or piri piri. They are typically a large-sized sandwich, and {{have been described as}} suitable for sharing among several people.|$|E
25|$|T. longicaudatus is {{the most}} {{widespread}} notostracan species, and {{may be found in}} western North America, South America, Japan, South Korea, and several Pacific Islands. It is most active at a temperature of approximately , and is usually found scratching the mud at the bottom of pools, searching for benthic food. Triops collect food particles by straining the water with hairs on their limbs. Loose food particles are collected in a groove running down the underside of the body <b>lengthwise,</b> <b>and</b> held together by a sticky secretion until they are swallowed by their very small (2mm wide) mouth. The tiny mouth is deep in its underbelly, and while the animal is capable of breaking up plant roots or dead fish, it is incapable of chasing down and eating prey larger than it is.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} was the bow ard, {{which consists}} of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) {{and the other a}} share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard does not clear new land well, so hoes or mattocks must be used to pull up grass and undergrowth, and a hand-held, coulter-like ristle could be used to cut deeper furrows ahead of the share. Because the ard leaves a strip of undisturbed earth between the furrows, the fields are often cross-ploughed <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> widthwise, and this tends to form squarish fields (Celtic fields). The ard is best suited to loamy or sandy soils that are naturally fertilised by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, {{and to a lesser extent}} any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. By the late Iron Age, ards in Europe were commonly fitted with coulters.|$|E
25|$|Chicken Kiev is {{made from}} a boned and skinned breast which is cut <b>lengthwise,</b> pounded <b>and</b> stuffed with butter. Western recipes usually call for garlic butter, while in Russian ones regular butter is used. Herbs (parsley and dill) {{can be added to}} the butter. In some American recipes butter is {{replaced}} by blue cheese.|$|R

The proscenium arch has rendered pilasters and entablature with a laurel frieze.|$|R
500|$|According to Nyiszli, [...] "Eight {{hundred to}} a {{thousand}} people were crammed into the superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable to stretch out completely, they slept there both <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> crosswise, with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other {{in an effort to}} get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep".|$|E
500|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a convex cap of [...] {{across that}} later {{develops}} a depression. It sometimes {{has a small}} umbo, and in colour can be a reddish-brown, rusty or dark-cinnamon, later paling to buff, though darker in the middle. The cap can be fairly rigid to flexible, and smooth to slightly wrinkled. At first, the margin is incurved though it is sometimes slightly furrowed. The stem is 3â€“7cm long and between 6 and 13mm thick, and is generally cylindrical though can be club-shaped. The stem is sometimes furrowed <b>lengthwise,</b> <b>and</b> is generally the same colour as the cap, though paler at the top. The flesh is pale and {{there is only a}} thin layer in the cap. The crowded gills are adnate to slightly decurrent, and can be white or pink in colour. It has white, plentiful milk that does not stain fabrics yellow, differentiating it from other species of Lactarius, such as L. decipiens. It has a faint, oily scent.|$|E
2500|$|A double {{junction}} can be grade separated {{so that there}} is no flat crossing, reducing conflicts and reducing congestion. Flyovers require a lot of space both <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> crosswise, and cannot always be built. Flying junction example at Aynho Junction. Diving junctions such as at Chatswood are a variant. [...] Weaver Junction is the oldest flying junction in the United Kingdom and perhaps the world. [...] See also Aynho Junction.|$|E

It was advertised as [...] "three cars in one": an economy compact, a convertible alternative {{because of the}} sunroof, and a roomy station wagon alternative because of the fold down rear seat.|$|R
50|$|Dress and Ornaments: Traditional dress {{used by the}} men {{is called}} Pachhati - about five feet long cloth {{manufactured}} by themselves which worn round the waist. Women usually wear blouses with traditional Lahing/Fanek or Chakshabi (a coarse cloth with <b>lengthwise</b> stripes <b>and</b> embroidered on both sides lengthwise) with an Enaphi (Single or multicolor coarse cloth with laces on both ends) and an Angei or blouse.|$|R
50|$|In Cuban cuisine, tostada {{refers to}} a slice of hand made Cuban bread, cut <b>lengthwise,</b> buttered, <b>and</b> pressed. The bread is similar to French bread or Italian bread usually made in long, baguette-like loaves. It is the Cuban {{equivalent}} of toast. Typically, tostadas are served as a breakfast alongside (and perhaps dunked into) a hot mug of cafe con leche (strong dark-roasted Cuban coffee with scalded milk).|$|R
2500|$|Its main {{access is}} the Cagayan Valley National Highway that {{traverses}} {{in a general}} north-south direction virtually slicing the municipality <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> connects it with other municipalities in Isabela. To the east lies a provincial road which links Quezon to the municipality of Santo Tomas, Isabela. [...] Quezon is approximately [...] south of the Cagayan Valley regional center of Tuguegarao City, about [...] east of Tabuk City, the provincial capital of Kalinga province; and about [...] north of Manila, {{the capital of the}} Philippines, with an average travel time of 8 to 9 hours by land.|$|E
2500|$|The blocks {{along the}} street are {{elongated}} {{but only a few}} meters in width; those on the eastern side oriented <b>lengthwise,</b> <b>and</b> those on the western crosswise. [...] Only four blocks thus forms {{the eastern side of the}} street while some 20 are lined-up along the western side. [...] Most of the front doors of the buildings are located either on the quiet PrÃ¤stgatan, the parallel street passing along the eastern side, or in one of the numerous alleys on the street's western side. [...] The intact faÃ§ades of the northernmost blocks are hiding the semi-detached offices of the Riksdag. [...] To the south of those are the remaining numerous and very narrow blocks and alleys which before the great fire of 1625 occupied the entire western side of the street.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the game}} is played at a neutral site, the {{designated}} [...] "home" [...] team alternates from year to year, with ticket distribution split evenly between the fans of the two teams. Beginning in the late 1980s, fans from Florida and Georgia were assigned seats grouped in alternating sections of the stadium to minimize incidents, and the contrasting colors worn by the fans (red and black for Georgia, orange and blue for Florida) created a [...] "beach ball" [...] visual effect in the stands. [...] More recently, the seating arrangement has split the stadium <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> fans sit on the side corresponding to the sideline their team occupies. For many years, the [...] "home" [...] team wore their home jerseys and the visitors their white visiting jerseys. From 2014 to 2016, both teams wore their home jerseys. [...] In 2017, Georgia wore their road white jerseys.|$|E
5000|$|Formica {{laminate}} {{was invented}} in 1912 by Daniel J. O'Conor and Herbert A. Faber, while working at Westinghouse, resulting in a patent grant on 1 February 1913. They originally conceived it {{as a substitute for}} mica used as electrical insulation, made of wrapped woven fabric coated with Bakelite thermosetting resin, then slit <b>lengthwise,</b> flattened, <b>and</b> cured in a press. They left Westinghouse immediately afterwards.|$|R

5000|$|Before {{performing}} any fret work, the fingerboard {{and body}} of the instrument are covered with low tack tape to prevent any damage from files and other tools. Leveling is achieved by running a leveling [...] file or leveling bar <b>lengthwise</b> up <b>and</b> down the neck. This process takes [...]002 to [...]005 inches of material off the frets, bringing them to a uniform height while creating flat tops on the frets.|$|R
2500|$|A main {{stage is}} where a {{featured}} performer will dance {{as part of a}} rotation. In most clubs the main stage is a dominant feature of the layout and the center of activity. A common type of strip club main stage is the thrust stage, also known as a runway stage, but the other major forms are also used regularly. Theatre in the round is also a popular form of strip club staging for the main stage. [...] During each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage. [...] A dancer collects tips from customers either while on stage or while mingling with the audience after her performance. [...] A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar bill folded <b>lengthwise</b> <b>and</b> placed in the dancer's garter from the tip rail. [...] The area of the tip rail is equivalent to the apron in traditional theatre. [...] It is referred to in slang as [...] "ringside", [...] "gynecology row", [...] "pervert row", and other names.|$|E

40|$|Expansive pedicle screws {{significantly}} improve fixation {{strength in}} osteoporotic spines. However, the previous literature does not adequately address {{the effects of}} the number of <b>lengthwise</b> slits <b>and</b> the extent of screw expansion on the strength of the bone/screw inter-face when expansive screws are used with or without cement augmentation. Herein, four designs for expansive pedicle screws with different numbers of <b>lengthwise</b> slits <b>and</b> different screw expansion levels were evaluated. Synthetic bones simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a comparative platform for each screw design. The prepared speci-mens were then tested for axial pullout failure. Regardless of screw design, screws with cement augmentation demonstrated significantly higher pullout strength than pedicle screws without cement augmentation (p 0. 05). Taken together, our results show that pedicle screws combined with cement augmentation may greatly increase screw fixation regardless of screws with or without expansion. An increase in both the number of slits and the extent of screw expansion had little impact on the screw-anchoring strength. Cement augmentation is the most influential factor for improving screw pullout strength...|$|R

More generally, for every c> 0, we {{construct a}} 2 -membership comparable set that is not n c-tt-reducible to any p-selective set. Our construction exploits {{the fact that the}} p-selector may be asked to examine inputs of vastly different lengths. We show that this generality is in fact necessary. Consider <b>lengthwise</b> comparators <b>and</b> <b>lengthwise</b> selectors which may only be asked to compare strings of equal length. We show that, given P = PSPACE, every lengthwise 2 -membership comparable set is 2 tt reducible to a lengthwise p-selective set.
