25|$|It {{is part of}} {{the routine}} {{immunization}} schedule in the US. Some European countries include it as part of universal vaccinations in children, but not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost. In the UK as of 2014, the vaccine is only recommended in people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox. In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an Enzyme immunoassay. An immunoassay measures the levels of antibodies against the virus that give immunity to a person. If the levels of antibodies are <b>low</b> (<b>low</b> titer) or questionable, reimmunization may be done.|$|E
25|$|While air {{pollution}} hotspots affect {{a variety of}} populations, some groups {{are more likely to}} be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are <b>low.</b> <b>Low</b> socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability, including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.|$|E

2500|$|Serotonin {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of single-cell organisms for various purposes. SSRIs {{have been found to be}} toxic to algae. The {{gastrointestinal}} parasite Entamoeba histolytica secretes serotonin, causing a sustained secretory diarrhea in some people. Patients infected with E. histolytica have been found to have highly elevated serum serotonin levels, which returned to normal following resolution of the infection. E. histolytica also responds to the presence of serotonin by becoming more virulent. [...] This means serotonin secretion not only serves to increase the spread of enteamoebas by giving the host diarrhea but also serves to coordinate their behaviour according to their [...] population density, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. Outside the gut of a host, there is nothing that the entoamoebas provoke to release serotonin, hence [...] the serotonin concentration is very <b>low.</b> <b>Low</b> serotonin signals to the entoamoebas they are outside a host and they become less virulent to conserve energy. When they enter a new host, they multiply in the gut, and become more virulent as the enterochromaffine cells get provoked by them and the serotonin concentration increases.|$|E

60|$|She {{had been}} there above an hour and was in truth ill with the cold when she heard,--and {{scarcely}} heard,--a light step come quickly along the passage towards her door. Her woman's ear instantly told her who owned that step, and her heart once more rose with hope. Was she coming there to comfort her, {{to speak to the}} poor bruised sinner one word of feminine sympathy? The quick light step stopped at the door, there was a pause, and then a <b>low,</b> <b>low</b> knock was heard. Lady Mason asked no question, but dropping from the bed hurried to the door and turned the key. She turned the key, and as the door was opened half hid herself behind it;--and then Mrs. Orme was in the room.|$|E
6000|$|Personally, {{though they}} have been true friends to me, I loathe destroyers, and all the raw, racking, ricochetting life that goes with them--the smell of the wet [...] "lammies" [...] and damp wardroom cushions; the galley-chimney smoking out the bridge; the obstacle-strewn deck; and the pervading beastliness of oil, grit, and greasy iron. Even at {{moorings}} they shiver and sidle like half-backed horses. At sea they will neither rise up and fly clear like the hydroplanes, nor dive {{and be done with}} it like the submarines, but imitate the vices of both. A scientist of the lower deck describes them as: [...] "Half switchback, half water-chute, and Hell continuous." [...] Their only merit, from a landsman's point of view, is that they can crumple themselves up from stem to bridge and (I have seen it) still get home. But one does not breathe these compliments to their commanders. Other destroyers may be--they will point them out to you--poisonous bags of tricks, but their own command--never! Is she high-bowed? That is the only type which over-rides the seas instead of smothering. Is she <b>low?</b> <b>Low</b> bows glide through the water where those collier-nosed brutes smash it open. Is she mucked up with submarine-catchers? They rather improve her trim. No other ship has them. Have they been denied to her? Thank Heaven, we go to sea without a fish-curing plant on deck. Does she roll, even for her class? She is drier than Dreadnoughts. Is she permanently and infernally wet? Stiff; sir--stiff: the first requisite of a gun-platform.|$|E
