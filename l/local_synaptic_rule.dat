As {{a model for}} learning in the brain, however, deep learning has long been regarded as implausible, since it relies in its basic form on a non-local plasticity rule. To overcome this problem, energy-based models with local contrastive Hebbian learning were proposed and tested on a classification task with networks of rate neurons. We extended this work by implementing and testing such a model with networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.

Here we explore the hypothesis that single-layer neuronal networks perform online symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) of the similarity matrix of the streamed data. By starting with the SNMF cost function we derive an online algorithm, which can be implemented by a biologically plausible network with local learning rules. We demonstrate that such network performs soft clustering of the data as well as sparse feature discovery. The derived algorithm replicates many known aspects of sensory anatomy and biophysical properties of neurons including unipolar nature of neuronal activity and <b>synaptic</b> weights, <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules</b> and the dependence of learning rate on cumulative neuronal activity. Thus, we make a step towards an algorithmic theory of neuronal function, which should facilitate large-scale neural circuit simulations and biologically inspired artificial intelligence.

We study a model in which spatial navigation problems can rapidly be solved in the brain by parallel mental exploration of alternative routes using propagating waves of neural activity. A wave of spiking activity propagates through a hippocampus-like network, altering the synaptic connectivity. The resulting vector field of synaptic change then guides a simulated animal to the appropriate selected target locations. We demonstrate that the navigation problem can be solved using realistic, <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules</b> during a single passage of a wavefront. Our model can find optimal solutions for competing possible targets or learn and navigate in multiple environments.

40|$|We {{show that}} the local Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule {{has the effect of}} {{regulating}} the trans-synaptic weights of loops of any length within a simulated network of neurons. We show that depending on STDP's polarity, functional loops are formed or eliminated in networks driven to normal spiking conditions by random, partially correlated inputs, where functional loops comprise synaptic weights that exceed a non-zero threshold. We further prove that STDP is a form of loop-regulating plasticity for the case of a linear network driven by noise. Thus a notable <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> learning <b>rule</b> makes a specific prediction about synapses in the brain in which standard STDP is present: that under normal spiking conditions, they should participate in predominantly feed-forward connections at all scales. Our model implies that any deviations from this prediction would require a substantial modification to the hypothesized role for standard STDP. Given its widespread occurrence in the brain, we predict that STDP could also regulate long range functional loops among individual neurons across all brain scales, up to, and including, the scale of global brain network topology...|$|R

Most sensory and motor tasks {{can be described as}} dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent network, e. g. the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules</b> as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit.

Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and robust computation at the population level. Comment: In press in Neuron journa...|$|R

Here, we introduce Synaptic Sampling Machines, a class of neural network models that uses synaptic stochasticity as a means to Monte Carlo sampling and unsupervised learning. Similar to the original formulation of Boltzmann machines, these models {{can be viewed as a}} stochastic counterpart of Hopfield networks, but where stochasticity is induced by a random mask over the connections. Synaptic stochasticity plays the dual role of an efficient mechanism for sampling, and a regularizer during learning akin to DropConnect. A <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rule</b> implementing an event-driven form of contrastive divergence enables the learning of generative models in an on-line fashion. Synaptic sampling machines perform equally well using discrete-timed artificial units (as in Hopfield networks) or continuous-timed leaky integrate & fire neurons. The learned representations are remarkably sparse and robust to reductions in bit precision and synapse pruning: removal of more than 75 % of the weakest connections followed by cursory re-learning causes a negligible performance loss on benchmark classification tasks. The spiking neuron-based synaptic sampling machines outperform existing spike-based unsupervised learners, while potentially offering substantial advantages in terms of power and complexity, and are thus promising models for on-line learning in brain-inspired hardware...|$|R

In particular, the self-organized behavioral development provides more questions than answers. Are there special functional units for curiosity, motivation, and creativity?

40|$|The {{structure}} of <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> circuits {{is the key}} to understanding cortical function and how neuronal functional modules such as cortical columns are formed. The central problem in deciphering cortical microcircuits is the quantification of synaptic connectivity between neuron pairs. I present a theoretical model that accounts for the axon and dendrite morphologies of pre- and postsynaptic cells and provides the average number of synaptic contacts formed between them as a function of their relative locations in three-dimensional space. An important aspect of the current approach is the representation of a complex {{structure of}} an axonal/dendritic arbor as a superposition of basic structures—synaptic clouds. Each cloud has three structural parameters that can be directly estimated from twodimensional drawings of the underlying arbor. Using empirical data available in literature, I applied this theory to three morphologically different types of cell pairs. I found that, within a wide range of cell separations, the theory is in very good agreement with empirical data on (i) axonal–dendritic contacts of pyramidal cells and (ii) somatic synapses formed by the axons of inhibitory interneurons. Since for many types of neurons plane arborization drawings are available from literature, this theory can provide a practical means for quantitatively deriving <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> circuits based on the actual observed densities of specific types of neurons and their morphologies. It can also have significant implications for computational models of cortical networks by making it possible to wire up simulated neural networks in a realistic fashion.

Furthermore, there was a striking segregation in the location of sites that evoked excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic inputs, such that inhibitory presynaptic neurons were distributed more proximal to the islet cell soma. This was paralleled in part by a differential distribution of transmitter receptor sites on the islet cell, in that inhibitory sites were confined to the peri-somatic region while excitatory sites were more widespread.

In this study, we examined how synaptic transmission is modulated by acetylcholine in auditory thalamus where sensory relay neurons form parallel lemniscal and nonlemniscal pathways. The former mediates tonotopic relay of acoustic signals, whereas the latter is involved in detecting and transmitting auditory cues of behavioral relevance. We report here that activation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors had opposite membrane effects on these parallel synaptic pathways. In lemniscal neurons, muscarine induced a sustained membrane depolarization and tonic firing by closing a linear K+ conductance. In contrast, in nonlemniscal neurons, muscarine evoked a membrane hyperpolarization by opening a voltage-independent K+ conductance. Depending {{on the level of}} membrane hyperpolarization and the strength of <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> input, nonlemniscal neurons were either suppressed or selectively engaged in detecting and transmitting synchronized synaptic input by firing a high-frequency spike burst.

In particular, the thesis aims at developing novel spike timing-based learning circuits that advance the current neuromorphic systems, in terms of power consumption, compactness and synaptic modification (learning) abilities. Furthermore, the thesis investigates {{the usefulness of the}} developed designs and algorithms in specific engineering tasks such as pattern classification. To follow the mentioned goals, this thesis makes several original contributions to the field of neuromorphic engineering, which are briefed in the following. First, a programmable multi-neuron neuromorphic chip is utilised to implement a number of desired rate- and timing-based <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules.</b> Specific software programs are developed to set up and program the neuromorphic chip, in a way to show the required neuronal behaviour for implementing various <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules.</b> The classical version of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), as well as the triplet-based STDP and the rate-based Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) rules are implemented and successfully tested on this neuromorphic device. In addition, the implemented triplet STDP learning mechanism is utilised to train a feedforward spiking neural network to classify complex rate-based patterns, with a high classification performance. In the next stage, VLSI designs and implementations of a variety of <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules</b> are studied and weaknesses and strengths of these implementations are highlighted. In addition, the applications of these VLSI learning networks, which build upon various <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules</b> are discussed. Furthermore, challenges in the way of implementing these rules are investigated and effective ways to address those challenges are proposed and reviewed. This review provides us with deep insight into the design and application of <b>synaptic</b> plasticity <b>rules</b> in VLSI. Next, the first VLSI designs for the triplet STDP learning rule are developed, which significantly outperform all their pair-based STDP counterparts, in terms of learning capabilities. It is shown that a rate-based learning feature is also an emergent property of the new proposed designs. These primary designs are further developed to generate two different VLSI circuits with various design goals. One of these circuits that has been fabricated in VLSI as a proof of principle chip, aimed at maximising the learning performance—but this results in high power consumption and silicon real estate. The second design, however, slightly sacrifices the learning performance, while remarkably improves the silicon area, as well as the power consumption of the design, in comparison to all previous triplet STDP circuits, as well as many pair-based STDP circuits. Besides, it significantly outperforms other neuromorphic learning circuits with various biophysical as well as phenomenological plasticity rules, not only in learning but also in area and power consumption. Hence, the proposed designs in this thesis can play significant roles in future VLSI implementations of both spike timing and rate based neuromorphic learning systems with increased learning abilities. These systems offer promising solutions for a wide set of tasks, ranging from autonomous robotics to brain machine interfaces. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Each SQ classi"er is a linear classi"er augmented by a subset k of the K"O(d�) second-order product terms available in d dimensions. Using a randomized classi"cation task, we show that the error rate of an SQ classi"er depends only on: (1) the product term ratio p"k/K, which identi"es a family of isomorphic classi"ers, and (2) the number of bits contained in the SQ classi"er's speci"cation. Finally, we quantify the increase in memory capacity of any SQ classi"er relative to its linear counterpart...|$|R
40|$|Fura- 2 and imaging {{technology}} {{were used to}} detect intracellular Ca 2 + changes in CA 1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices. During focal synaptic stimulation, one or more highly localized regions of Ca 2 + elevation (hot spots) were detected in the dendrites. Ca 2 + spread {{from the center of}} hot spots with properties consistent with diffusion. Several lines of evidence indicate that these hot spots were due to Ca 2 + entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate synaptic channels. The spatial and temporal resolution of the method was sufficient to detect the response of single hot spots to single stimuli, thus providing a real-time method for monitoring <b>local</b> <b>synaptic</b> activity. Using this method, we show that synapses on the same dendrite differ in their probability of response and in their facilitation properties...|$|R
