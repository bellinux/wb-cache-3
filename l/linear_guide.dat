40|$|In this project, {{nonlinear}} characteristics on {{the rolling}} interface of a <b>linear</b> <b>guide</b> were studied by the {{finite element analysis}} and experimental verification. Contact of the ball/surface rolling interface in the rolling guides was simulated as a three-dimensional membrane element without thickness. By introducing Hertzian contact theory and applying proper normal/shear stiffness to such contact elements in the overall finite element model, dynamic behaviors of linear guides affected by preload were thus investigated. In the finite element procedure, three contact models, 1 D point-to-point, 2 D point-to-point and 3 D surface-to-surface, were sequentially introduced for purpose of verification with experiments. As a validation in this project, vibrational experiments on linear guides with different preloads were conducted and related frequency spectrums were derived. Both the finite element and the experimental results reveal that the natural frequency of a <b>linear</b> <b>guide</b> increases with the increment of the preload. In addition, the dynamic characteristics predicted by finite element analysis agree well with those measured from instrumental experiments. The proposal of current study may provide an alternate and reliable way for understanding of the dynamic characteristic of the rolling contact components in machine design field. (c) 2006 IMACS.

40|$|White light {{reflectance}} spectroscopy is used {{to determine}} the reflective properties of human tissue. It is believed that the reflectance of the human tissue is dependent on the pressure applied to the tissue. The reflectance of the human tissue might be an indication if the tissue is diseased. Spectroscopy and a pressure measurement have to be performed simultaneously to determine this relation. Two possibilities are researched to determine the pressure. The first method is to apply a pressure to the tissue and measuring this using a sensor. The second method is to apply a known pressure to the tissue, which makes the measurement obsolete. The pressure measurement or application can be done directly at the tissue or farther away fromthe tissue. When the pressure ismeasured away fromthe tissue a force transfer mechanism is needed to transfer the force outside of the body. Determining the pressure outside of the body brings a lot of advantages. The only parts entering the body will be the optical fiber used for the spectroscopy and the guide to transfer the force outside the body. The research goal then becomes: Design of a <b>linear</b> <b>guide</b> to transfer a force through an optical fiber for pressure sensitive white light reflectance spectroscopy. For the guide was chosen to use a compliant rolling mechanism. This mechanism consists of rolled-up flat strips connected to the optical fiber that can roll along the inner wall of the guide. During the rollingmotion energy is conserved and no forces are added to the measurement. Two models are made to determine the support force which prevents the optical fiber from slipping along the wall. First an analytical model was made and secondly, a finite element analysis is done to validate the analytical model. To determine if the compliant rolling mechanism behaves as described in the model two measurements are done. The first measurement was done to determine if the model to calculate the preload force was correct. The second measurement was done to determine if axial forces are present in the measurement. These measurements showed that the predicted preload forces were correct, but the axial forces were not the same, a stiffness and hysteresis were measured. The measured stiffness can be compensated for, but the hysteresis will give an error to the measurement. To {{be able to use the}} compliant rolling mechanism a design is made where the hysteresis does not influence the measurement outside the boundaries of what is tolerable. From the information gathered from the measurements a design for the <b>linear</b> <b>guide</b> could be made. A size minimization was performed to make the total width of the linear guid as small as possible. This resulted in a <b>linear</b> <b>guide</b> of 20 mmwide when the tested materials are used. By using thinner materials the design can be made even smaller, which makes it more suitable for usage in minimally invasive surgery. An assembly method by where the compliant rolling mechanism is slid place is described. In conclusion, by taking the hysteresis forces in account a <b>linear</b> <b>guide</b> is designed which transfers a force through an optical fiber from the tissue to the outside of the body. This is achieved by using a compliant rolling mechanismwhich can be slid in place for assembly. iMechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringPrecision and Microsystems Engineering (PME...|$|E
