25|$|Despite storm warnings, a <b>lobster</b> <b>boat</b> capsized along {{northern}} Honduras with 83people aboard, {{with two}} people missing. The storm's fringes damaged three houses in Cortés Department, after heavy rainfall was reported along the coast. One person {{was injured in}} San Pedro Sula.|$|E
500|$|On September20, Hurricane Gert was {{attributed}} to generating a rogue wave that swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park {{along the coast of}} Maine. The crew of a <b>lobster</b> <b>boat</b> later found their bodies. Although the storm never approached the United States, seas in the area generally ran [...] above normal.|$|E
500|$|At the lighthouse, Mr. Briscoe {{decides to}} brave the storm in a landing craft, but is {{immediately}} swamped {{with water and}} carried by the tide towards the mainland. After Castro avails himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a <b>lobster</b> <b>boat</b> over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper [...] "He's been thinking about this for some time, George." ...|$|E
50|$|Portland has a {{substantial}} fleet of deep-sea fishing vessels which offload their catch primarily at the Portland Fish Exchange. Numerous towns and islands serve as ports for <b>lobster</b> <b>boats.</b> Recreational fishing boats {{can also be}} chartered.|$|R
50|$|Judique is {{credited}} with spectacular sunsets. Christy's Look-off is halfway between the Canso Causeway and Judique {{where there is a}} view of the waterway to the Strait of Canso. Waters are warm for swimming in July and August. In spring, <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> depart from three harbours in the area.|$|R
50|$|Mining {{activity}} ceased following World War II and {{the railway}} was abandoned {{during the late}} 1980s. Today Mabou is primarily a fishing port for a small fleet of <b>lobster</b> <b>boats.</b> It also hosts a high school serving central Inverness County. It {{is also a very}} strong community with many farms.|$|R
2500|$|Palinurus charlestoni {{was first}} {{described}} by Jacques Forest and E. Postel in 1964.

50|$|The central {{story of}} the show is the {{struggle}} of first-year captain Scott Christopher and his boat, Dragon Lady, in their attempt to gain a foothold on the hotly contested fishing grounds of the Georges Bank. In 2007, Lobster Wars debuted, following not only Dragon Lady, but also four other <b>lobster</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rhythm was {{launched}} in early 2003 and {{is used as a}} private fishing boat in New Zealand. The boat was designed to look similar to some US <b>lobster</b> <b>boats,</b> but it uses modern hull technology Rhythm is 13.5 metres long and has a top speed of 27 knots and a cruise speed of 20 knots.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> {{neared the}} shore, teams had to swim to shore and drive dune buggies {{down the beach}} for the third memory challenge. They had to {{assemble}} six Adirondack chairs painted with things encountered during the Race, and arrange them in chronological order. If the chairs were properly assembled and in the correct order (see below), the carpenter would give them their final clue.|$|R
5000|$|This boat {{can now be}} seen in use {{all over}} coastal Nova Scotia, North America, and the world. It {{is closely related to}} the Maine <b>lobster</b> <b>boat.</b> Cape Island style fishing boats are also {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "Novi" [...] boats.|$|E
50|$|Officers {{have access}} {{to a wide range of}} boats for patrol and {{emergency}} response ranging from 10 foot aluminum row boats to a 42-foot Westmac <b>lobster</b> <b>boat.</b> Officers also {{have access to}} all terrain vehicles and snowmobiles for use in patrol and search & rescue operations.|$|E
50|$|Michael Dix Thomas as Eric Burke, Vicki’s twin brother, {{who works}} on the crew of his best friend Paul's <b>lobster</b> <b>boat.</b> He and Vicki used to be inseparable, but they have drifted apart {{over the past four}} years, after she went to college and he moved to Ragged Isle.|$|E
50|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} between Net or Trap. In Net, teams had to take their boat to a marked fishing {{platform}} and use a net to catch 15 fish out of a marked pen {{in order to receive}} their next clue. In Trap, teams had to take their boat to a group of marked <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> where they pulled up one weighted lobster trap to get the clue from inside.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 June 1812 Musquito, {{which was}} shorthanded, intercepted {{a group of}} <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> off Heligoland. She then {{impressed}} two seamen from the boats. The men and their colleagues sued for their release, and in 1813 were granted a writ of habeas corpus. The argument was that because Britain had taken possession of the island and its fisheries in 1807, the Heligoland fisheries were British possessions and thus fell within a defined statutory exception for [...] "the fisheries of this Kingdom".|$|R
50|$|In early 2010, he {{appeared}} on the Discovery Channel Canada show Breaking Point alongside Jonathan Tippett. The show premiered Monday, January 18, 2010, and was six episodes long. In each episode, the guys would investigate the limits of large scale everyday objects, such as armored limos, <b>lobster</b> <b>boats,</b> fuel tankers, buses, and more. Hackett and Tippett would conduct extreme tests {{on one of these}} objects until they found its breaking point. Then they would come up with ways to make the object safer and stronger.|$|R
50|$|The {{program is}} also known for its {{coverage}} of offbeat sports and competitive events.

5000|$|On August 17, 1962 three {{fishermen}} from Rockstown drowned {{when their}} <b>lobster</b> <b>boat</b> hit submerged rocks and sank off Binion Head.  The three men were Patrick Doherty (aged 40), John McGilloway (aged 50) and his son, also called John McGilloway (aged 24).  Patrick Doherty {{left behind a}} wife and five children {{ranging in age from}} ten to four years.|$|E
50|$|This {{community}} {{is also the}} French Shore's busiest port with draggers, trawlers, seiners, cod, crab and <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> docking there. The fishing industry {{has long been the}} main source of income in Meteghan. Clare's shipbuilding industry began in Meteghan in 1890 with the construction of the first dry dock built in conjunction with a shipyard. Notable vessels include the Royal Canadian Navy training schooner HMCS Venture, built in 1937. The largest remaining shipyard is the A.F. Theriault & Sons Shipyard in nearby Meteghan River.|$|R
2500|$|George I. ("Sonny") Hodgdon, Jr., who {{was born}} in 1922 and reputedly started work in the yard at an early age, rebuilt the boat-building sheds and {{obtained}} a contract to build the first boat designed by William Tripp Sr., Katingo. In addition to securing contracts to build boats for noted designers, including Sparkman & Stephens, John Alden, and L. Francis Herreshoff, he designed and built 24 small vessels, [...] between 1956 and 1969. In 1969, Hodgdon moved to another facility to build <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> under the business name of [...] "G.I. Hodgdon, Co." ...|$|R
5000|$|Alexa is {{the name}} of Billy Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray Joel. The Alexa Ray was a Jarvis Newman 46' {{fiberglass}} hull custom finished by Lee S. Wilbur and Co of Manset, ME. The hull was based on the Maine <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> known as a [...] "downeaster". Joel has had several other boats since the Alexa Ray, all based on similar hulls.

50|$|Tod and Buz (and later, Linc) symbolized restless youth {{searching for}} {{meaning in the}} early 1960s. The two men take odd jobs along their journey, like toiling in a California {{vineyard}} or manning a Maine <b>lobster</b> <b>boat,</b> bringing them in contact with dysfunctional families or troubled individuals in need of help. The lead characters are not always the focus of any given episode, and their backstories are revealed only in occasional references across widely spaced episodes.|$|E
50|$|At Shinnecock East County Park, {{teams had}} {{to ride a}} jet ski to a <b>lobster</b> <b>boat,</b> where they had to pull seven lobster traps from the water, empty them, {{and replace them with}} new traps. Once this was completed, they {{received}} a box containing the flags of all of the countries visited, which they had to tie to the mast in the order visited. Once all of the flags were in the right order, a fisherman would give them their next clue while the boat headed back to shore.|$|E
50|$|In the 1800s, {{the village}} of Walpole was noted for brickmaking and ice harvesting. Brickyards along the Damariscotta River {{supplied}} many of the bricks used to build Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. The ice business faded {{with the advent of}} refrigeration, but the Thompson Ice House, established in 1826, is now preserved as the Thompson Ice Harvesting Museum. Bristol Yacht Building Company, later known as H.F. Gamage Shipbuilding, built minesweepers for the United States Navy during World War II. Shipbuilding has remained important, with schooners, fishing trawlers, <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> and yachts constructed at the town. The Hudson River Sloop Clearwater was built here in 1968. Other industries in South Bristol are fishing, lobstering, clamming, aquaculture and tourism.|$|R
5000|$|This {{section of}} the river {{downstream}} from Tidnish Bridge also forms part of the interprovincial boundary with New Brunswick. The river provides safe harbour in this downstream area. The river is carefully navigable in its upper reaches past the Chignetco bridge during high tides. The mouth of the river supports a smelt fishery, although this activity has been in slow decline. Typically, fishermen use large bag nets of about 28 feet in width. These are set from rafts or, in winter, from holes cut in the ice and allowed to [...] "strain" [...] the tide to catch smelt. No <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> {{run out of the}} Tidnish River, but on occasion, herring and mackerel boats may be seen.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouth of}} the estuary is a small delta, closed by a sandbar except for a narrow channel. Although this channel is {{permanently}} open, it is usually very narrow and shallow, and so is now dredged every year to allow passage by western rock <b>lobster</b> fishing <b>boats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On Friday August 17, 1962 three {{fishermen}} from Rockstown drowned {{when their}} <b>lobster</b> <b>boat</b> hit submerged rocks and sank in calm seas off Binion Head.  The three men were Patrick Doherty (aged 40), John McGilloway (aged 50) and his son, also called John McGilloway (aged 24).  Patrick Doherty {{left behind a}} wife and five children {{ranging in age from}} ten to four years. [...] A forth man, John Devlin, the brother-in-law of John McGilloway, normally joined the fishing crew, but chose to stay at home {{on the day of the}} disaster.|$|E

Prior to that he worked for the [...] "Innovations in American Government" [...] program at Harvard University.|$|E
5000|$|Edge of America follows Edgers as {{he discovers}} and participates in traditions such as bicycle jousting and Pig-N-Ford Races in Oregon, <b>lobster</b> <b>boat</b> racing in Maine, and a calf {{testicle}} festival in Oklahoma. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Edgers described the content of the show: [...] "It's history, entertainment and action ... To me, this is the greatest kind of Americana, where people take a necessity—like castrating cows and killing rattlesnakes—and make a big party out of it." [...] Edgers also said that the show would feature [...] "strange American things in scenic American places" [...] in an interview with The Boston Globe.|$|E
5000|$|At first, {{having been}} swept {{up by the}} natural beauty of the island, I found myself copying the {{landscape}} - something I had never done before. As time went on, I began to distill the spirit of the island into my 'invented' panoramas... The quality of swiftly changing light, atmospheric conditions, water patterns, as well as imagery inspired by the island - <b>lobster</b> <b>boats,</b> traps, ropes, kerosene lamps and the like - seeped into my paintings. John Hultberg Hultberg primarily made Abstract expressionist paintings that were minimalist and dark, and also made Surrealist invented landscapes with [...] "linear perspectives and angular shapes." [...] Hultberg was described as an Abstract realism, who combines [...] "abstract" [...] and [...] "concrete" [...] with attention to detail, bold color use, and strong design.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of a fishing trip, the <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> travel the coast picking up recruited dive teams and boat hands. They then search for lobster at known lobster banks between Honduras and Columbia, often illegally and usually over the course of 12-16 days. The divers are paid by the pound for lobster tails alone. In {{the early days of the}} boom, lobster tails of 1-2 pound were common whereas by the early 1990s a diver needed 2-3 lobsters to make the same weight. At that time, the average diver brought in, per trip, 150-180 pounds of lobster. By 2011 the estimated average was down to 74 pounds/trip. Following the catch, the boats return the crew members to their communities, and the catch is processed in the Bay Islands or Puerto Cabezas before being shipped to primarily the United States.|$|R
2500|$|The chasse marées took return cargoes {{where they}} were available, so tended {{to move into the}} {{cabotage}} trade (coastal tramping). In particular, having taken fish south to Bordeaux, they would return with salt from Lower Charente (then known as Charente Inférieur) or from Vendée to more northerly coasts of France. Early vessels were replaced progressively by the luggers, then dundees, brigs and schooners. The rig called in French dundee is a little obscure. The Nouveau Petit Larousse Illustrée (1934) describes it only as a 'large sailing ship'. Other available dictionaries ignore it but the [...] describes it as a gaff ketch and says that the rig was used principally in <b>lobster</b> <b>boats</b> and herring drifters. The article includes an illustration showing a vessel well adapted to the chasse-marée trade, with a large sail area and strikeable bowsprit and bumkin. Apparently, the yawl rig (cotre à tapecul) used by French tunnymen was sometimes but improperly called a dundee.|$|R
