40|$|Agriculture in African South of the Sahara (SSA) can be {{transformed}} if the right public support is provided at the initial stage, and it can sustain itself once the enabling environment is put in place. Successes are also specific to the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> In Ghana, interesting insights are obtained from the successful Kpong Irrigation Project (KIP), contrasted with other major irrigation projects in the country. Through an exploratory review, we describe how a productive system evolved in KIP and how public support for critical aspects (accumulation of crop husbandry knowledge, selection and supply of profitable varieties, and mechanization of land preparation) might have created a productive environment {{that the private sector}} could enter and fill in the market for credit, processing, mechanization of harvesting, and other institutional voids that typically have constrained agricultural transformation in the rest of SSA.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{organizational}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> where talent is pivotal and can walk away. Conventional wisdom says that such projects will be hosted by narrow-focused firms that provide strong incentives for talent. Offering high-powered incentives within corporations sacrifices synergies, making corporations less suited to financing of such projects. Yet in many industries talent is discovered, trained, and employed by multi-project corporations where incentives are often blunt. The central {{result is that}} weak property rights over talent encourage multi-project corporations to invest. Weak property rights create an ex-post market for talent that relaxes the tradeoff between incentives and synergies within corporations. It does so by forcing corporations to match talent’s outside option, thereby making credible its commitment to share surplus with talent. Holdup by talent thus limits expropriation by corporations, an instance of the second-best principle that two distortions can {{cancel each other out}} rather than adding up. We use the model to shed light on several apparently puzzling phenomena in markets for talent...|$|E
40|$|Inner-city {{neighborhood}} retail development often engenders vigorous {{popular and}} political {{debate about the}} scale, scope, and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> {{as well as their}} intended and inadvertent effects for urban landscapes, residents, and consumers. The term commercial revitalization is frequently used to characterize the resurgence of retail activity in neighborhoods previously considered moribund and perilous areas to avoid. In most instances, however, the factors animating commercial revitalization are implicitly assumed and, as such, are conceptually and empirically underdeveloped. This article elucidates commercial revitalization and focuses on the agency of neighborhood small business owners as underexplored stakeholders. Using the extended case methodology, this article examines Black business owners in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, who mounted a relatively successful campaign of retail restructuring by cultivating political clout, establishing civic alliances, participating in neighborhood planning, and promoting the commercial district as an economic and cultural enclave. However, merchants failed to develop mechanisms to sustain their vision and advance commercial revitalization. The article concludes with a discussion of planning and policy implications. commercial revitalization; neighborhood small business; community economic development...|$|E
40|$|Cost-benefit {{analysis}} {{is a practical}} way, the aim {{of which is to}} choose among alternative public investment projects. As costs and benefits are a time stream of utilities foregone and provided by those projects, Steiner, Marglin and Feldstein built their models to maximize the net present value at marginal social rate of discount, and social opportunity costs of public investment are defined as funds transferred from one sector to another sector, or one purpose to another. We admit these models might be a guarantee of the optimum solution for resource allocation between inter-sector i. g. public vis private and inter-temporal i. g. present consumption vis future consumption. We recognize, however, these models omitted optimizing inter-regional allocation of public investment, which is a most important matter in selecting the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> So we emphasize that the costs which are brought about by the changed population {{as a result of the}} public investment, should be induced in the model. These costs would be able to be accounted for as the marginal social cost of changed population and as the opportunity costs which occurred by using added labours from another area to generate the benifits of the investment...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of {{pluralism}} by evaluating different stakeholder views on the expected and realised value of strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The research followed a single embedded case study approach (of a national-level SEA for renewable energy planning in South Africa) and engaged with four different stakeholder groups, namely government, industry, conservation groups, and interested and affected parties (IAPs). A total of 21 different value expectations (VEs) across all four stakeholder groups were identified. However, stakeholder groups contrast significantly in terms of VEs, with government concerned more with process and mandate; industry with cost, efficiency and certainty; conservation groups with data and technical aspects; and the IAPs with local scale issues. In terms of realisation of VEs {{the results suggest that}} SEA does provide opportunities for learning; focussing project level EIA and providing spatial guidance on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> However, SEA was less successful in realising integration of decision making and alignment of policy within government. Recognition and better understanding of the pluralistic nature of expected and realised VEs could potentially improve the legitimacy of SEA processes and methodologies if they are designed and implemented to accommodate pluralism...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{geothermal}} energy technology {{is still considered}} an emerging technology for energy generation. Like other emerging energy technologies, how the public perceive the technology and under what conditions {{they are likely to}} accept or oppose the technology, remains relatively unknown. In response, this exploratory research utilised online focus groups to identify: (1) the extent of agreement with geothermal technology before and after information, including media reports focusing on a range of the technology’s attributes; and (2) how the characteristics of individuals with different levels of agreement vary. After information, within the sample of 101 participants, fewer reported being unsure, the minority disagreed and the majority agreed. Overall, the preference was for projects to be located away from communities. Participants that disagreed or were unsure, {{were more likely to report}} lower subjective knowledge of the technology, lower perceived benefits and higher risks, and were less likely to believe people in their community would have the opportunity to participate in consultation. These characteristics suggest there are advances to be made by analyzing what contributes to different levels of acceptance. The findings also suggest that the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> will be an important consideration and that the conditions of acceptance are likely to vary amongst community members...|$|E
40|$|This work, {{inspired}} by the first experience of its writer as a lender on the web platform Kiva. org, presents an analysis involving 4221 investors {{in order to show}} that preferences of individuals may play an important, somewhat counterintuitive role in the social-lending crowdfunding environment. First, in fact, it is found that lenders who are able to satisfy their initial preferences regarding a project to support tend to invest fewer times compared to individuals who are not able to find a project available that fully satisfies them. Second, between lenders who faced this “mismatch” between their preferences and the projects available, those who experienced the stress of moving to a different country – relocation anxiety – tend to invest fewer times. Third, however, the geographical <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> {{does not appear to be}} a critical variable at play when formulating preferences regarding a project, so that investors who do not give importance to geography when selecting projects tend to support more of them. It is therefore crucial for managers of social-lending platforms to get to know their users’ behavior in this regard, to analyze it and to consider it carefully in order to provide them with the best answers to their needs...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{four key}} {{dimensions}} o f international joint venture (JV) activity in Ghana and Nigeria: strategic motives, host country location factors, finance and performance. These dimensions are explored in a multi-method empirical study. Drawing on official annual aggregate and project level data, the trends {{and patterns of}} FDI in Ghana and Nigeria are examined across several characteristics, trends over time, ownership type of FDI, origin of foreign investor, geographical <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> and distribution by sector. The result shows that the more preferred mode of entry for FDI is through the equity joint venture. Primary data was collected {{by means of a}} self-administered questionnaire survey from a cross section sample of 57 JVs in Ghana and Nigeria, with partners from Western Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific. First, the relative importance of a set of strategic motives and host country location factors influencing foreign investors’ decisions to form JVs in Ghana and Nigeria are identified. The main strategic motives of the foreign partners are to overcome government-mandated barriers, risk and cost sharing and to facilitate international expansion. The study finds government policy towards foreign investors, political stability and market size as the main location factors. Exploratory factor analysis is employed to identify the underlying dimensions of strategic motives and host country location factors for the JVs. Hypotheses are then tested (using t-test or Anova) by considering strategic motives and host country factors in terms of the characteristics of the sample. Second, the manner in which JVs are financed, the relative importance of barriers to JV investment finance and the determinants of the financial structure of JVs in Ghana and Nigeria are examined. Hypotheses are tested using contingency table analysis and t-test on the relative effects of the barriers and the factors influencing the capital structure of JVs. Finally, measures and determinants of performance are examined. A multiple regression analysis is conducted to identify the main predictors of successful performance for JVs in Ghana and Nigeria. The study identifies capital adequacy, partners’ capabilities and congruity of motives and goals of the partners as important determinants of performance. A paired sample t-test was also conducted to compare the performance of JVs with host government partners and those with private sector partners, the results indicate that JVs with private sector partners are perceived to perform better. ...|$|E

There are variation of price that can be offered by the contractor and sub-contractor. The price are different based on factors such as skill, types <b>of</b> <b>project,</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>project,</b> demand and supply of labour, level of life, citizen, gender and races. For that reason, this study was carrying out to identify and compare the labour price in range and average aspect according to location and tred and also the factors which are influence it.
