40|$|A general {{expression}} {{for the expansion}} coefficients connecting the Stark (parabolic coordinates) and field-free (spherical coordinates) wave functions for hydrogen is obtained. Numerical tables of these coefficients through principal quantum number n = 10 are given. In {{the course of the}} derivation several new identities involving generalized hypergeometric functions are deduced. Applications to radiative attenuation, particularly in connection with the ALICE experiment, are discussed. It is concluded that previous calculations have considerably underestimated the degree of radiative attenuation experienced by the ALICE beam, thus decreasing the amount of <b>Lorentz</b> <b>dissociation</b> expected in the plasma region.
