25|$|The {{decline in}} the {{fortunes}} of Dunfermline lasted until {{the introduction of a}} linen industry in the early 18th century. One reason for which the town became a centre for linen was there was enough water to power the mills and nearby ports along the Fife Coast. These ports also did trade with the Baltic and Low Countries. Another reason was through an act of industrial espionage in 1709 by a weaver known as James Blake who gained access to the workshops of a damask linen factory in Edinburgh by pretending to act like a simpleton in order to find out and memorise the formula. On his return to his home town in 1718, Blake established a damask linen industry in the town. The largest of these factories was St Leonard's Mill which was established by Erskine Beveridge in 1851. A warehouse and office block was later added around 1869. Other linen factories were built on land to both the north and south ends of the burgh. During the mid-19th century, powerloom weaving started to replace <b>linen</b> <b>damask.</b> The latter did not survive, going into decline straight after the end of First World War. In 1909 the Royal Navy established Scotland's only Royal Naval Dockyard at nearby Rosyth.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "damask" [...] first {{appeared}} in records in a Western European language in the mid-14th century in French. By the 14th century, damasks were being woven on draw looms in Italy. From the 14th to 16th century, most damasks were woven in one colour with a glossy warp-faced satin pattern against a duller ground. Two-colour damasks had contrasting colour warps and wefts, and polychrome damasks added gold and other metallic threads or additional colours as supplemental brocading wefts. Medieval damasks were usually woven in silk, but weavers also produced wool and <b>linen</b> <b>damasks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Artisan weaver and art {{instructor}} Dora Jung (1906-1980), {{a textile}} artist {{who specialized in}} <b>linen</b> and <b>damask,</b> designed the original altar cloths, which were woven by master weaver Marita Mattsson. The altarpiece features a cross and a mosaic wall.|$|R
50|$|The <b>linen</b> <b>damask</b> was {{specially}} woven with flowermotifs, hunting scenery, biblical representations {{and images}} from the classical literature. It was said that the total length of the linen reached almost three kilometers.|$|E
5000|$|The simplex ('simple', {{referring}} to the materials used) is made of undecorated white linen or silk and its white lappets traditionally end in red fringes. It is worn most notably at funerals, Lenten time, on Good Friday and by concelebrant bishops at a Mass. Cardinals {{in the presence of}} the Pope wear a mitre of white <b>linen</b> <b>damask.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another fertile {{source for}} {{clothing}} terms is place names, which usually reflect the origin (or supposed origin) of a fashion. Modern {{terms such as}} Bermuda shorts, Hawaiian shirts, and Fair Isle sweaters are {{the latest in a}} long line that stretches back to holland (<b>linen),</b> <b>damask</b> ("from Damascus"), polonaise ("in the fashion of Polish women"), basque, jersey (originally Jersey frock), Balaclava, Capri pants, mantua, and denim ("serge de Nîmes" [...] after the city).|$|E
40|$|<b>Damask</b> <b>linen</b> {{manufacture}} has a {{long and}} varied history. Appearing in Europe around the fifth century, <b>damask</b> <b>linens</b> quickly became desired by those possessing great wealth. Figured <b>damask</b> <b>linen</b> was especially prized and was often the only type of table cover {{to be used by}} royalty. Heraldic crests, hunting scenes, historical events, and other symbols or occasions of cultural importance were memorialized in figured <b>damask</b> <b>linen.</b> By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the use of figured <b>damask</b> <b>linens</b> was a symbol of royalty, luxury, and beauty. These attributes figured prominently in the appointment of George Washington Vanderbilt 2 ̆ 7 s home, Biltmore, at the tum of the century. A grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, George Vanderbilt purchased 125, 000 acres in western North Carolina on which to construct his 250 -room home. Architect Richard Morris Hunt drew inspiration for Biltmore 2 ̆ 7 s design from three French chateaux. While similar in extravagance to the Vanderbilt mansions built in Newport, Rhode Island, Biltmore represented a significant departure from the social mainstream. A luxurious but quiet retreat, Biltmore offered a venue in which Vanderbilt could study and enjoy the fruits of one of his greatest passions: travel. It was through his travels that George Vanderbilt managed to amass an impressive collection of <b>damask</b> table <b>linens.</b> Containing over 1300 napkins and tablecloths, the table linen collection at Biltmore House provides an excellent example of late nineteenth century damask. While cataloging this collection over the course of a year and a half, however, it became clear that many questions concerning the origin, design, and interpretation of this collection were unanswered. While attempting to describe and categorize the damask designs, it became obvious that the few published sources mainly contain illustrations of pre-nineteenth century damask designs, or of design styles not present in our collection. Digging deeper, we wondered if we could discover where these linens were manufactured and then somehow classify the designs through that avenue. No marks were found on any linens, however, and receipts in the Biltmore House archives were not helpful in determining origin. It became increasingly clear that further research on <b>damask</b> <b>linen</b> manufacture and marketing would be beneficial for cataloging and interpreting this collection...|$|R

5000|$|From {{an early}} period, {{he took an}} active {{interest}} in promoting manufactures and agriculture. In the parish of Deskford, he opened, in 1752, a large bleachfield, and in Cullen, Moray he established a manufacture for <b>linen</b> and <b>damask.</b> From 1754 to 1761, {{he was one of}} the commissioners of customs for Scotland, and in 1765 he was constituted one of the lords of police. He was also a trustee for the improvement of fisheries and manufactures, and for the management of the annexed estates in Scotland. By his example and encouragement he did much to promote advanced methods of agriculture in Banffshire. He introduced turnip husbandry, and granted long leases to his tenants on condition that within a certain period they should endorse their lands, and adopt certain improved methods of cropping. To prevent damage to young plantations on his estate, he agreed to give certain of his tenants, on the termination of their leases, every third tree, or its value in money.|$|R
50|$|Fergusons {{was first}} {{established}} in Banbridge, County Down, for the hand weaving of linen fabric.  In 1867 the firm introduced power driven jacquard looms for the weaving of <b>linen</b> <b>damask.</b> John England (Banbridge) Ltd, since 2015 a sister company of Fergusons, regularly supplies fabrics for major theatrical and film productions, including Game of Thrones.  Over its 170 year plus history Fergusons {{has not only}} woven fabrics, both plain and damask but supported a related industry in the decoration of linen handkerchiefs, bedlinens and table linens.|$|E
50|$|Weaving {{continues}} {{mainly of}} plain linens for niche, {{top of the}} range, apparel uses. <b>Linen</b> <b>damask</b> weaving in Ireland has less capacity, and it is confined at very much the top end {{of the market for}} luxury end uses. Companies including Thomas Ferguson & Co Ltd continue to weave in Ireland tend to concentrate on the quality end of the market, and Jacquard weaving is moving towards the weaving of specials and custom damask pieces, made to the customers' own individual requirements. Fabric which is woven outside Ireland and brought to Ireland to be bleached/dyed and finished cannot carry the Irish Linen Guild logo, which is the Guild trademark, and signifies the genuine Irish Linen brand.|$|E
50|$|Clifford Rainey (born 1948, Whitehead, County Antrim, Northern Ireland) is a Northern Irish glass sculptor. {{he began}} his career as a <b>linen</b> <b>damask</b> {{designer}} and worked in William Ewarts linen manufacturers from 1965 to 1968. He later studied at Hornsey College of Art, the North East London Polytechnic School of Sculpture, where he specialised in glass sculpture, and the Royal College of Art from where he received an MA. Between 1973 and 1975 he ran his own glass studio in London. In 1975 he won a commission for a small sculpture to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II and in 1976 was commissioned by Sun Life Assurance to make a large glass sculpture in Bristol. He was a lecturer at the Royal College of Art from 1977 until 1984. Rainey is the Chair of the Glass Program at the California College of the Arts in Oakland, California, where he has taught since 1991.|$|E

40|$|The custom, largely {{adopted in}} many {{manufacturing}} districts, {{particularly in the}} north of Ireland, of manufacturers in the <b>linen</b> and <b>damask</b> trade giving out to weavers the materials for webs to be woven by them in their own homes, has been the origin of a small code of laws. The fact that property, representing a very large amount of capital, is entrusted during a considerable time to men generally poor, and is left during that time under their complete control, in danger of being lost or injured, not only by their dishonesty but also by their want of care or of industry, or even by their misfortunes, {{as well as by the}} dishonesty, negligence, or misfortune of the other inmates of their houses, has been considered sufficient to justify the existence of special laws, containing provisions intended to protect the interests of the owners of such property. These provisions, with others regulating the sale of flax and linen, and intended to protect buyers of such against fraud, form the contents of the Acts which are the subject of this paper...|$|R
5000|$|Cartwright was a {{collector}} {{as well as}} an actor and bookseller. At his death he willed his collection to Dulwich College. The collection comprised 239 portraits, plus drawings, prints, books, and manuscripts; Cartwright also willed the College money (£400 of [...] "broad old gold") and even personal effects ("two silver tankards, <b>damask</b> <b>linen,</b> an Indian quilt, and a Turkey carpet"). The portrait collection included public figures like Sir Thomas Gresham, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Mary, Queen of Scots; Richard Burbage and Richard Perkins among other actors; and personal items [...] - [...] pictures of Cartwright, his father, and his first and third wives.|$|R
5000|$|In the 18th century, {{the city}} {{impressed}} Daniel Defoe as showing the [...] "full perfection of decay". The town would soon regained prosperity {{with the introduction}} of the weaving of <b>linen</b> <b>damask</b> [...] - which would eventually become recognised as the world's leading producer [...] - established by James Blake in 1718 after being inspired by having gained the experience of the special technique of one in Edinburgh as the way to take Dunfermline forward. [...] Dunfermline became one of four main centres of the industry alongside Kirkcaldy, Dysart and Leslie in 1810. Although the first power looms in operation brought greater demand for the town's linen industry by 1825 as Dunfermline began to acknowledge the coming of the industrial revolution. The undemining success of the linen in Dunfermline was prompted by a report by the Ordnance Gazette in 1894 who said: [...] "The damask manufacture of Dunfermline is probably unequalled in the world for design and beauty of finish". Among other industries that have largely contributed to the welfare of the town are dyeing, bleaching; soap (from the 1790s); rope-making (from the 1830s); iron founding textile milling; distillery and brewing.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{he started}} as a weaver working in Haarlem's famous white <b>linen</b> <b>damask</b> industry, van der Vinne quickly took to {{painting}}, and would take on any painting job no matter how small. According to Houbraken, this led to an oft-quoted comment by Job Adriaenszoon Berckheyde, who claimed that he was [...] "the Raffael of sign-boards". When he spoke of his own work, van der Vinne often repeated {{the advice of his}} teacher Frans Hals, saying that [...] "one must boldly smear the paint on; when you become confident in the art, then neatness will follow". What survives today from his hand are mostly still lifes and genre scenes, often with a similar arrangement of a vanitas items, and many include a trompe l'oeil portrait sketch on a paper hanging off a desk. In one of these, he has copied a crumpled drawing of himself by Leendert van der Cooghen. His style was copied by Evert Collier, Pieter van Eisen, and Barent van Eisen.Helmer J. Helmers devotes some pages to discussion of Van de Vinne's vanitas still-life paintings incorporating images of the executed Charles I of England ...|$|E

Additional provisions were made for electricity, water and sewage systems. Council housing was focused towards Abbeyview, on a 240 acre site on Aberdour Road; Touch, to the south of Garvock Hill; Bellyeoman and Baldridgeburn. Private housing became focused to the north of Garvock Hill and on the site of West Pitcorthie Farm.|$|E

60|$|The {{luxury of}} the house, the wainscoted and tapestried walls, the {{polished}} furniture, the lamps and candles, the <b>damask</b> <b>linen,</b> the rich array of silver, pewter, and brightly-coloured glass, {{were a great}} contrast to the bare walls and scant necessaries of Schloss Adlerstein; but Ebbo was resolved not to expose himself by admiration, and {{did his best to}} stifle Friedel's exclamations of surprise and delight. Were not these citizens to suppose that everything was tenfold more costly at the baronial castle? And truly the boy deserved credit for the consideration for his mother, which made him merely reserved, while he felt like a wild eagle in a poultry-yard. It was no small proof of his affection to forbear more interference with his mother's happiness than was the inevitable effect of that intuition which made her aware that he was chafing and ill at ease. For his sake, she allowed herself to be placed in the seat of honour, though she longed, as of old, to nestle at her uncle's feet, and be again his child; but, even while she felt each acceptance of a token of respect as almost an injury to them, every look and tone was showing how much the same Christina she had returned.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via [URL] on the account book of the MP and antiquary Sir Edward Dering (1598 - 1644), which covers the decade {{of his life in}} which he came of age, was knighted, and embarked on an ambitious political and courtly career, this article argues that his account book was a space in which Dering recorded momentous life events and mediated upon his purchases. Dering revelled in his attire, spending {{a great deal of money}} on it, as well as taking the time to record each element of construction and decorative design in minute detail. Purchasing luxury goods – particularly clothing – was an important way for an ambitious politician to express his social, emotional and political links to patrons, and to show his suitability for promotion. While he begins the account book in 1619 by chastising himself for a spending too much in a ‘prodigal year’, by the end of the account book in 1628, Dering seems content to buy expensive goods, including a costly <b>linen</b> <b>damask</b> napkin depicting the story of the prodigal son. This article traces Dering’s acquisition of luxury goods at home in Kent, in London and overseas, and places him in relation to contemporary discourses of luxury and prodigality. It argues that Dering’s consumption of luxury goods was part of a wider project of self-definition, which included having his portrait painted, and even forging his family history.
