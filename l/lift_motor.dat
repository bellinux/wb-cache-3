40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how an algorithm {{is transferred from}} a digital signal processor to an embedded microprocessor in an FPGA using C to hardware program from Altera. Saab Avitronics develops the secondary high lift control system for the Boeing 787 aircraft. The high lift system consists of electric motors controlling the trailing edge wing flaps and the leading edge wing slats. The high <b>lift</b> <b>motors</b> manage to control the Boeing 787 aircraft with full power even if half of each motor’s stators are damaged. The motor is a PMDC brushless motor which is controlled by an advanced algorithm. The algorithm needs to be calculated by a fast special digital signal processor. In this thesis I have tested if the algorithm can be transferred to an FPGA and still manage the time and safety demands. This was done by transferring an already working algorithm from the digital signal processor to an FPGA. The idea was to put the algorithm in an embedded NIOS II microprocessor and speed up the bottlenecks with Altera’s C to hardware program. The study shows that the C-code needs to be optimized for C to hardware to manage the up speeding part, as the tests showed that the calculation time for the algorithm actually became longer with C to hardware. This thesis also shows that it is highly probable to use an FPGA equipped with Altera’s NIOS II safety critical microprocessor instead of a digital signal processor to control the electrical high <b>lift</b> <b>motors</b> in the Boeing 787 aircraft...|$|R

50|$|On {{the site}} of the Fairfield Building of Croydon College, a mixed-use {{development}} named the Croydon Vocational Tower has begun construction. The architecture and design of the building has similarities with the Trump International Hotel and Tower currently under construction in Chicago. If the building is finished before the Croydon Gateway Landmark Tower, it will officially become Croydon's tallest tower and one of London's tallest 20 buildings. Planning permission was approved by Croydon Council in February 2007, but building work has been slow ever since. It will be used for both educational purposes on the lower 10 floors by the college and private use as a residential tower {{on the rest of the}} 29 floors. There will also be a floor of leisure use which will be used by students of the college and residents of the tower.

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Mantenimiento Industrial) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electromecánica, 2015. This {{report was}} {{produced}} at AZMONTS. A {{to develop the}} mechanical design of an elevator car frame and its components, in a more productive manner, so the company can decrease costs and improve its sales. The project stems from the need to bring to market an elevator lift with affordable production costs and with special conditions {{to comply with the}} provisions of the 7600 Law on Equal Opportunities and international regulations concerning the manufacture and installation of electric lifts per UNE EN 81 - 1 and ASME 17. 1. The lack of national production of elevator components requires the company AZMONT S. A. to import the elevator components from Spain. However, this report proves that the company’s production of elevator components in this country can benefit the company, making it more competitive in the elevator market in Costa Rica, as well as in {{other countries in the region}} where the company operates. The project variables are defined as: Cabin size, elevator speed, drive system and elevator path. During the practice, different types of elevator car frames were used and it was determined that the most appropriate model is the backpacks type. Three possible models were analyzed, but it was found one in particular met the minimum safety factors established by UNE EN 81 - 1 and ASME 17. 1. The model was based on appropriate and duly verified calculations. The project includes the selection of the suspension rope, gearless <b>lift</b> <b>motor,</b> car and counterweight guide rails and speed governor. The elevator car frame design proposal includes the cost benefit of developing its approach compared to products imported by the company AZMONT S. A. study. Once the project was finished the design of the elevator car frame plans were delivered to the Engineering Department of the company.

50|$|Lotus used {{a variety}} of parts from other cars to reduce {{development}} costs. Esprits built before 1993 used many British Leyland parts while those built after 1993 had many GM (Vauxhall, Opel) parts. Door handles from the Morris Marina/Austin Allegro were used until the S4 model in 1994 when GM Calibra door handles were used. Early cars used a Momo steering wheel, while later ones had the same wheel as the Pontiac Trans Am. Headlight <b>lift</b> <b>motors</b> came from the Pontiac Fiero. The aerial mount and whip on the S4 and V8 was the same as the GM Calibra and Tigra. The side mirrors were from the Citroën CX. Non-SE fog lamps from about 1989 were GM Astra MK1. The fan motors came from the Ford Fiesta Mk2. The alternator on the V8 models was a standard GM unit also found in the V6 Opel Omega B and the earlier Lotus Carlton/Omega, which also provided interior plastic fittings such as door handles and steering column covering. The clutch master and slave cylinders on 1998 and newer models were Girling parts shared with the series 2A Land Rover. The S1 and S2 shared some front suspension components with the Opel Ascona. The GT3's Brembo front brake pads were the same as on a Fiat Coupé Turbo or a Peugeot 406 3.0 V6. The SE's fuel pump was from the Renault Fuego.|$|R
