5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Stewie and Olivia {{begin to}} bond shortly afterward, {{and the two}} spend their time bonding by sitting in a park while eating ice cream. [...] As they sit and eat their ice cream, they mock various people, such as a man smelling his own hand, a Jewish cowboy, a man who cuts his own hair, and an uptight and hardworking Asian man who is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] They also go to a {{birthday}} party for one of Olivia's friends. [...] Olivia introduces Stewie to her old friend, a child actor named Victor, and she obliges Stewie to get both of them punch, but a jealous Stewie only wishes Victor to go away. The couple begin to argue constantly, and their latest argument ends with them getting married. After the marriage, which Rupert officiates, their relationship does not get any better. Later, the couple decide to accompany Brian on a double-date with his girlfriend, Jillian. During the date, the pair continue to bicker throughout, leading to Stewie starting an argument with {{a person in the}} restaurant who asks him to be quiet. He feels the relationship is failing, but Brian encourages him to reconsider and Stewie agrees to return to Olivia. Returning to his playhouse to apologize and makeup with her, Stewie discovers Olivia [...] "cheating" [...] on him with her friend Victor (although the two are just playing with silly putty). With the relationship over, a seemingly distraught Stewie leaves the playhouse, which he then sets on fire with both Olivia and Victor inside.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

2500|$|The {{guard of}} the train, Mr GE Evans, {{was sitting in}} the rear carriage, looking out of the left window. [...] The force of the crash threw him into the corner of his compartment. [...] He picked himself up after the train stopped, rushed {{to the top of the}} cutting beside the line as a vantage point to see what had happened, then {{returned}} to the carriage and applied the handbrake. [...] He deemed that the time of the accident was 9:48am, after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> displaying 9:50am and allowing two minutes since the time of impact.|$|E
