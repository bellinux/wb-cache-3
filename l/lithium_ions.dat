25|$|One {{problem with}} the lithium–sulfur design {{is that when the}} sulfur in the cathode absorbs lithium, volume {{expansion}} of the LixS compositions happens, and predicted volume expansion of Li2S is nearly 80% of the volume of the original sulfur.

An increase in temperature causes the microspheres to melt, blocking transmission of the <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> and causing the battery to shut down. Microspheres of both polyethylene and paraffin wax were tested with CR2032 Li-ion batteries and demonstrated both successful operation of the battery at normal temperatures and shutdown of the battery at temperatures below those at which the battery's separator would become damaged.|$|E

This battery had high energy density and the diffusion of <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> into the titanium disulfide cathode was reversible, making the battery rechargeable.
