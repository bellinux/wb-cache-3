5|$|A medical {{program was}} {{established}} at Los Alamos under Captain James F. Nolan of the United States Army Medical Corps. Initially, a small five-bed infirmary was established for civilians, and a three-bed infirmary for military personnel. More serious cases were {{handled by the}} Army's Bruns General Hospital in Santa Fe, but this was soon regarded as unsatisfactory due {{to the loss of}} time due to the <b>long</b> <b>trip,</b> and security risks. Nolan recommended that the infirmaries be consolidated and expanded into a 60-bed hospital. A 54-bed hospital was opened in 1944, staffed by Army personnel. A dentist arrived in March 1944. A Veterinary Corps officer, Captain J. Stevenson, had already been assigned to look after the guard dogs.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{telemetry}} {{was used}} to identify the foraging distributions of three congeneric species of albatrosses that nest in the tropics/subtropics. Breeding waved albatrosses Phoebastria irrorata from the GalaÂpagos Islands travelled to the productive upwelling near the Peruvian coast and nearby areas during the rearing period in 1996. Black-footed albatrosses P. nigripes and Laysan albatrosses P. immutabilis nesting in the Hawaiian Islands and tracked during the 1997 ± 98 and 1998 ± 99 breeding seasons also performed <b>long</b> foraging <b>trips,</b> to continental shelf areas of North America. In both years, breeding black-footed albatrosses made <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> {{to the west coast}} of North America (British Columbia to California). In 1997 ± 98, breeding Laysan albatrosses travelled primarily {{to the north of the}} Hawaiian Islands and reached the waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Gulf of Alaska. In 1998 ± 99, Laysan albatrosses had a complete breeding failure, and no <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> by breeders were tracked as a result. These three species mixed short and <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> during the chick-rearing period, but not the brooding period nor incubation period. Waved albatrosses made only <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> during the incubation period. Analysis of movement patterns showed that the core feeding areas during <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> were located over the continental shelves of North and South America. The data on foraging biology of these species have implications for assessing bycatch risk in commercial ®sheries. Key words: albatross, Phoebastria, foraging, bycatc...|$|R

5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} {{at which it}} is applied, asphalt is categorized as hot mix, warm mix, or cold mix. Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free floating screed. Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBreeding sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus cycle between long (11 to 14 d) {{and short}} (1 to 2 d) {{foraging}} bouts at sea, but no information exists on bird behavior during these trips. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} shearwaters use these <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> to travel to distant Antarctic waters compared to remaining in local waters. Patterns of habitat use of 28 breeding sooty shearwaters were studied using 6 g archival data loggers that recorded location, environmental temperature, and diving behavior. Dive activity was compared to remotely-sensed environmental data to characterize the habitats visited by shearwaters on <b>long</b> and short <b>trips.</b> Sooty shearwaters traveled predominantly (70 % of all <b>long</b> <b>trips)</b> to cold oceanic waters along the Polar Front (mean ± SD, 1970 ± 930 km from colony) on <b>long</b> <b>trips</b> or remained within warmer neritic waters of the New Zealand shelf (515 ± 248 km from colony) on short trips. Diving depths (mean depth 15. 9 ± 10. 8 m, max depth 69. 9 m, n = 2007 dives) {{were not significantly different}} between excursion types. Activity patterns suggest that shearwaters commuted between distant foraging grounds (e. g. Polar Front) and the breeding colony and that more than 95 % of diving activity occurred during daylight hours. Although shearwaters traveled primarily to Antarctic waters on <b>long</b> <b>trips,</b> occasional trips around New Zealand waters were observed; all but 2 birds were from the northern-most study colony. Oceanic habitats in Antarctic waters were substantially different from neritic habitats around New Zealand, indicating that shearwaters experience dramatically different environmental conditions associated with each excursion type. The ability of sooty shearwaters to use 2 vastly different habitats provides greater flexibility for maximizing resource acquisition during breeding and reduces competition near the colony...|$|R
