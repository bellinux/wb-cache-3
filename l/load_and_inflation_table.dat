40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of motorcycle and scooter tyres {{have a large}} influence on the handling and stability of these vehicles. When a two-wheeled vehicle moves along a curvilinear path, there are large camber angles (up to 50 ◦); hence, tyres have a curved cross-section and the contact patch moves and changes its shape when the roll and steer angles are modified by the rider. This paper describes experimental research aimed at studying {{the influence of the}} camber angle, vertical <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure on the shape of the contact patch and the forces and moments of the tyres. The experimental tests were carried out by means of a rotating-disc machine. The contact patches were measured by making use of a pressure-indicating film. The camber force and twisting torque were related to the vertical <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure through the dimensions of the contact patch.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{characteristics of the}} rubber tire and the interaction between a tire and a rigid surface were investigated by a two-dimensional (2 D) finite element (FE) model. The FE model consists of a rigid rim and a rigid contact surface which interact with the elastic tire. Four distinct sets of elastic parameters are used to represent beads, sidewall, tread and lugs. Several sets of tire <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures were applied to the FE model as boundary conditions, together with various displacements and friction conditions. The deformation of the tire profile, the tire displacements in the vertical and lateral directions, the normal contact pressures, the frictional forces and the stress distribution of the tire components were investigated by the 2 D FE model under the above boundary conditions. The calculated tire deflections were compared with the measured data. The results show a good fit between calculated and measured data, especially at high <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure. The comparison shows that the FE analysis is suitable to predict aspects of the tire performance like its deflection and interactions with the contact surface.

The highest values of contact length and width and tire deflection occurred at the highest wheel <b>load</b> <b>and</b> lowest tire <b>inflation</b> pressure. Contact patch width is a polynomial (order 2) function of wheel load while there is a linear relationship between tire contact length <b>and</b> wheel <b>load</b> as well as between tire deflection <b>and</b> wheel <b>load.</b> Correlations were developed for the evaluation of contact patch length-rolling resistance, contact patch width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance.

40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly radial <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure. The radial load is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four tires to balance the weight of a car. The radial load is applied to the rim at the bead seats with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the rim flange. This project studied the influence of the radial <b>load</b> <b>and</b> the tire <b>inflation</b> pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim.

Heavy equipment and tillage implements can cause damage to the soil structure. The soil structure is important, because it determines the ability of a soil to hold and conduct water, nutrients, and air. These properties are necessary for plant root activity.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that tires play an {{important}} role in the generation of rolling noise. For low frequencies, the circular ring model can describe in a simple way the tire dynamic behaviour. This model is based on the Euler Bernoulli beam theory and takes into account the prestress generated by the internal air pressure but is otherwise linear.

In particular, vehicle load generates contact forces and a non-circular geometry in stationary rolling conditions.

40|$|Heavy {{sugarbeet}} harvesters may compact subsoil. But it is {{very difficult}} to study this by field experiments that resemble agricultural practice. Therefore, an analysis was made by a finite element method (FEM) for a relevant calcaric fluvial soil profile, the mechanical properties of which were largely known. Measuring data of this Lobith loam soil includes preconsolidation stress, compression index and swelling index, all as a function of depth. Using these three types of soil parameters calculations have been done for tyre sizes, <b>inflation</b> pressures <b>and</b> wheel <b>loads</b> that occur with heaviest sugarbeet harvesters available on the European market in 1999. Because no values on soil cohesion were available, the calculations were done for several cohesion levels. The results include the detection of regions with Mohr-Coulomb plasticity and regions with cap plasticity (compaction hardening). For the soil studied-a typical soil strength profile for arable land with ploughpan in the Netherlands in the autumn of 1977 -all studied combinations of wheel <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure did not induce compaction in and below the ploughpan. The size of the region with Mohr-Coulomb plasticity decreased with increasing cohesion. It appeared from a sensitivity analysis that, although soil modelling may use a great number of soil parameters, the most important parameters seem to be: preconsolidation stress and cohesion. There is an urgent need for data of these parameters that are measured on a great range of subsoils and subsoil conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Subsoil {{compaction}} affects {{all aspects}} of soil quality, and contrary to topsoil compaction it is persistent. Natural alleviation processes such as wetting/drying, freezing/thawing and biological activity including root growth decrease rapidly with depth. In compacted soil, these alleviation processes are moreover diminished because root growth and biological activity are reduced and soil water contents remain higher in compacted than in well-structured soil. Wheel loads are still increasing and, in consequence, the extent and severity of subsoil compaction. Sustainable soil management requires the uncompromising criterion that no subsoil compaction can be accepted. Consequently, only field traffic with wheel loads lower than the carrying capacity of the subsoil is allowed. This implies that subsoil stress caused by wheel load should not exceed {{the strength of the}} subsoil. Therefore, this chapter emphasises the importance of soil strength and the calculation of soil stresses in the subsoil. One of the main constraints in using the carrying capacity concept proves to be the lack of data on soil strength. Existing recommended limits for wheel <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures are not adequate and can result in over or underestimating of allowable wheel <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> subsequent uneconomical solutions or subsoil compaction. Adequate drainage of soils is a prerequisite for reduced subsoil compaction. Mouldboard ploughing with all tractor wheels on the non-ploughed ‘land’ and umbilical systems for applying manure slurry are realistic options to reduce compaction. Controlled traffic systems that limit the wheeled area may be implemented by the use of wide span vehicles and by steering tractors along traffic lanes. Although we support such provisions, our chapter will advocate and focus primarily on adjusting wheel loads to the carrying capacity of the subsoils. ...|$|R
40|$|In general, when a tyre {{is running}} on a {{deformable}} soil, the soil compaction will occur not only on surface layers, but also on soil profile, in deeper layers. This leads {{to a series of}} negative effects not only on physical and mechanical properties of soil, but also influences the crops growth and the crop yield. For these reasons, currently are needed solutions to reduce soil compaction, caused mainly by agricultural implements passing on the soil surface in order to aply the specific crop production technologies. From our simulation we can draw the following conclusions: the soil stresses decreased with depth; the soil displacements magnitude increased with soil water content due to lower friction forces between soil particles (water acts like a lubricant between soil particles); decreasing rate for soil displacement is influenced by <b>load</b> magnitude <b>and</b> tyre <b>inflation</b> pressure; the soil particles moved in vertical plain from the top to the bottom, but also in horizontal direction, from the center to the edge in cross section and in longitudinal direction; the dimensions of the geometric shape of the mentioned soil volume is influenced by <b>load</b> <b>and</b> tyre <b>inflation</b> pressure.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of factors. One of the most important factors is soil response to pressures imposed by wheels and soil engaging tools. This research investigated the effect of tyre <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure on soil compaction-related factors. These factors include rut width, rut depth, cone index and horizontal force in different layers of soil profile. In this research a stiff carcass tyre has been used and a soil compaction profile sensor in controlled soil bin laboratory conditions. This sensor consisted of eight flaps, each equipped with strain gauges, installed on a subsoiler leg face with working depth of 45 cm. Studies were conducted using a factorial experiment at two levels of axle load of 6. 3 kN and 23. 9 kN and three levels of inflation pressure of 324 kPa, 524 kPa and 724 kPa with three replications in a randomized complete design. Duncan test and F test were applied to compare the means of pressure <b>and</b> axle <b>load,</b> respectively. The soil compaction profile sensor measured soil compaction at different layers from soil surface to 45 cm depth at 5 cm interval. The results of experiments indicated that vertical load significantly affected the horizontal force at different tyre inflation pressures on the soil profile. The tyre inflation pressure exhibited greater effects on shallow depths than those of higher depths. The amount of rut width, rut depth and cone index increased with an increase in vertical load. Increasing of the inflation pressure decreased rut width and increased rut depth and cone index...|$|R
40|$|Tires are of {{paramount}} importance in vehicle dynamics. They are the only vehicle’s components {{in contact with the}} road and hence transmitting necessary forces and moments for the vehicle to accelerate, brake and turn. So far, temperature influence on tire behavior has not hold car manufacturers’ interest so much. Tire models were usually limited to be mathematical models taking into account tire and axle geometry mechanical properties, normal <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure. However, some differences appeared when comparing forces and moments estimated by tire models and measured test data. Part of these differences is now believed to be due to variation in tire thermal properties when the tire is subject to different stress types (slip and camber angles, normal load, inflation pressure, vehicle speed…). The aim {{of this study is to}} perform a thermal analysis of the tire. How its surface temperature varies depending on various conditions and how these variations influence the tire behavior will be of prior concern. Hence, some indoor tests will be performed by positioning the tire on the MTS Flat-Trac® III tire test system and using infrared sensors to measure the tire surface temperature. Experiments will be based on an experimental design where all the parameters believed to have an influence on the tire temperature will vary. Results will allow understanding which parameters are of primary importance for the temperature and will also be used to build up an empirical tire thermal effects model. This latter will be used in parallel with the currently used Pacejka model and take into account the variation of tire performance in terms of lateral forces. Eventually, the validation of the model will be done performing full vehicle tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a road vehicle {{is directly related to}} the static and dynamic properties of tires, which provide support and control for vehicles and which must possess good durability under various tire-road interactions <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. The tire characteristics are inherently dependent on various structural and geometric parameters, the material properties of the individual layers of a tire <b>and</b> the <b>loading</b> conditions. In view of the simulation and analysis of tire response, in terms of deformation and stress fields, and vibration properties, extensive analytical studies had been conducted in the past based on the linear analysis of the multi-layered tire structure, assuming negligible shear interactions between the layers. In this dissertation, a nonlinear finite element model of a radial truck tire is developed based on its composite structural elements to analyze the various stress fields, with focus on the inter-ply shear stresses between the belt and carcass layers as functions of normal <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures. The model is validated through a comparison of the normal force-deflection characteristics and the contact patch geometry derived from the model with the laboratory-measured data in a qualitative sense. The tire model is used to conduct a parametric study on the shear interactions in the multiple layers under a wide range of loading conditions, to derive a more desirable set of structural parameters that can lead to lower values of maximum shear stresses within the loaded multi-layered tire structure. A polynomial function has been derived to estimate the two-dimensional tire-road contact pressure distribution as a function of the <b>inflation</b> pressure <b>and</b> the normal <b>load.</b> The tire model is further used to study the free-vibration behavior of the inflated tire structure. The influences of the individual structural parameters on the <b>load</b> <b>and</b> pressure-dependent natural frequencies of a radial truck tire are also investigated. The results show that the proposed finite element tire model based on adequately measured geometric and material properties of a tire structure can yield considerable benefits in the tire design and heavy vehicle performance...|$|R

A Space Shuttle nose-gear tire is modeled using a two-dimensional laminated anisotropic shell theory which includes the effects of variations in material and geometric parameters, transverse-shear deformation, and geometric nonlinearities. Contact conditions are incorporated into the formulation by using a perturbed Lagrangian approach with the fundamental unknowns consisting of the stress resultants, the generalized displacements, and the Lagrange multipliers associated with both contact and friction conditions. The contact-friction algorithm {{is based on a}} modified Coulomb friction law. A modified two-field, mixed-variational principle is used to obtain elemental arrays. This modification consists of augmenting the functional of that principle by two terms: the Lagrange multiplier vector associated with normal and tangential node contact-load intensities and a regularization term that is quadratic in the Lagrange multiplier vector. These capabilities and computational features are incorporated into an in-house computer code.

40|$|AbstractIn {{pavement}} engineering a crude uniform {{contact pressure}} over a circular contact area {{is used to}} generate key strains for an analytical design method. The use of a more advanced tyre contact pressure measurement device {{has led to a}} situation where there is more information that is available to generate a more accurate uniform representation of contact pressure. This measurement device also offers the ability to measure non-uniform 3 -D tyre contact pressure. That is to say the vertical, transverse and longitudinal components of pressure generated by a tyre in contact with a pavement. A comparison of the key strains generated by this improved uniform contact pressure representation and the measured 3 -D contact pressure is of great interest. Of course a tyre does not display the same contact pressure for different combinations of axle <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure. The combination of these two factors greatly affects the nature of the contact pressure observed. A finite element mesh of a 3 -layer thin pavement structure was created in CAPA- 3 D. This was used to model the uniform and 3 -D contact pressure representations of a wide based tyre. This was done for 3 <b>inflation</b> pressures <b>and</b> 3 tyre <b>loads.</b> The inflation pressures were for a recommended <b>inflation</b> pressure <b>and</b> then plus and minus 200 kPa. The tyre loading was for a maximum European axle <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> then greater and lower than this value. This gave a good spread of conditions that are relevant to the tyre operating conditions. The key strains at different locations in the pavement relevant to the major distresses of a pavement were assessed. The main distress mechanisms being top down cracking, asphalt cracking/rutting, traditional bottom up cracking and subgrade rutting. These gave a good spread of possible distresses that tyre contact pressure can contribute to. The results showed that there was a large effect on surface strains caused by 3 -D contact pressure in comparison to uniform contact pressure for all combinations of <b>inflation</b> pressure <b>and</b> tyre <b>loading.</b> The difference between the two contact pressure representations diminished with depth in the pavement. Therefore, it was clear that 3 -D contact pressure has an effect on the distress of a pavement surface. This means to accurately understand the deterioration of a pavement surface, 3 -D contact pressure must be considered. In the case of the other distresses the uniform contact pressure generated greater strains and would give a conservative pavement design. Both methods generated greatly different key strains depending on the combination of <b>inflation</b> pressure <b>and</b> tyre <b>loading.</b> If a complex highly accurate analysis is required, then a fully 3 -D representation in combination with finite element analysis is the best option. However, if a more routine analysis is required then the improved uniform contact pressure representation could be used with a simple modelling tool (e. g. BISAR) to get good results for a traditional analytical design...|$|R

The bench incorporates a computerized <b>load</b> <b>and</b> control system of the tire operation parameters, an image acquisition module and a data acquisition system that allow monitoring and acting on the experimental variables of interest in the tests such as load on the tire and environmental conditions. A supporting mechanical system incorporated to the bench allows providing the tire with variable toe and camber angles. From the images obtained with this system, the maximum normal pressure points, total force, size and shape of the patch can be determined, which are related to the tire-use conditions. As an application example, results that show the patch size and shape under different <b>load</b> <b>and</b> tire <b>inflation</b> pressures are presented. A further application, which is the use of the system for the detection and study of defective tires is also presented...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] this study, a numerical model of a deformable tyre interacting with a deformable road has been developed {{with the use of the}} finite element code ABAQUS (v. 6. 13). Two tyre models with different widths, not necessarily identical to any real industry tyres, have been created purely for research use. The behaviour of these tyres under various vertical <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> different <b>inflation</b> pressures is studied, initially in contact with a rigid surface and then with a deformable terrain. After ensuring that the tyre model gives realistic results in terms of the interaction with a rigid surface, the rolling process of the tyre on a deformable road was studied. The effects of friction coefficient, inflation pressure, rebar orientation <b>and</b> vertical <b>load</b> on the overall performance are reported. Regarding the modelling procedure, a sequence of models were analysed, using the coupling implicit – explicit method. The numerical results reveal that not only there is significant dependence of the final tyre response on the various initial driving parameters, but also special conditions emerge, where the desired response of the tyre results from specific optimum combination of these parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} dynamic rolling radius and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel <b>load</b> <b>and</b> to tire <b>inflation</b> pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of three tractor wheel drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the dynamic rolling radius for low-profile radial tires tested on rigid road surfaces. On this basis, the classical slip calculation method was modified. This phenomenon appears only on hard roads and soil surfaces with high adhesion coefficients and only within the low drawbar pull range...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, a {{group of}} vehicle {{dynamics}} simulation tools is developed with two primary goals: to accurately represent vehicle behavior and to provide insight that improves the understanding of vehicle performance. Three tools are developed that focus on tire modeling, vehicle modeling and lap time simulation. Tire modeling is based on Nondimensional Tire Theory, which is extended to provide a flexible model structure that allows arbitrary inputs to be included. For example, rim width is incorporated as a continuous variable in addition to vertical <b>load,</b> inclination angle <b>and</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure. Model order is determined statistically and only significant effects are included. The fitting process is shown to provide satisfactory fits while fit parameters clearly demonstrate characteristic behavior of the tire. To represent {{the behavior of a}} complete vehicle, a Nondimensional Tire Model is used, along with a three degree of freedom vehicle model, to create Milliken Moment Diagrams (MMD) at different speeds, longitudinal accelerations, and under various yaw rate conditions. In addition to the normal utility of MMDs for understanding vehicle performance, they are used to develop Limit Acceleration Surfaces that represent the longitudinal, lateral and yaw acceleration limits o...|$|R
