5|$|According to the city's {{metropolitan}} bishop, Symeon (in office 1416/17–1429), {{both he and}} the Despot Andronikos sent repeated {{pleas for}} aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short of resources and preoccupied with its own problems. At <b>long</b> <b>last,</b> a single unnamed commander {{was sent to the}} city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at <b>long</b> <b>last</b> meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} Manuel I Comnenus in 1180 {{did not end}} the Komnenoi dynasty, but Manuel's son proved to be {{incapable}} of holding together an empire burdened with heavy expenditure thanks to his father's extensive campaigning. In 1183, Alexius II Comnenus was deposed and replaced by Andronikos I Komnenos. His attempts to continue the militarization of the empire led to his torture, blinding, 3 days of public humiliation and finally death in 1185. Even the Komnenoi proved fallible – Sozopolis, Ankara and Heraclea all fell to Kilij Arslan II, reaping the benefits of Myriokephalon at <b>long</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E

25|$|New Japan's {{dominance}} in the feud injured the marketability of the UWFi promotion, which had pressed the perception that their athletes boasted legitimate skill in catch wrestling and kickboxing. In a bid to regain credibility, Yoji Anjoh travelled to California to challenge Rickson Gracie in the latter's own dojo, only to be swiftly and brutally defeated before the assembled Japanese press that had followed him there. With the UWFi's formerly fearsome reputation in tatters, its attendance numbers swiftly decreased, with the federation closing its doors {{once and for all}} in December 1996.

The Maniots {{remained}} passive at first, {{and for a}} time the position of the besieging Christian troops was threatened by the troops led by the governor of Nauplia, Halil Pasha, and the fresh reinforcements disembarked by the Ottoman fleet under the Kapudan Pasha, both at Nauplia and at Kalamata. The Ottoman efforts to break the siege were defeated, however, and on 11 August, the fortress surrendered. Despite a pledge of safe passage, the garrison was massacred due to suspicion of treachery.|$|E

25|$|On 31 August Senyavin's {{squadron}} embarked from Portugal for Portsmouth. On 27 September the Admiralty {{was informed}} that enemy vessels cast anchor in the British harbour, with their flags streaming, as if in times of peace. The Lord Mayor of London declared the convention disreputable for Britain's prestige and many in the Admiralty shared his opinion. The Russian fleet was therefore detained in Portsmouth under various pretexts until winter weather made their return to the Baltic impossible. The British insisted that Senyavin's squadron should sail to Arkhangelsk, else they would be intercepted by the Swedish men-of-war. In 1809, the departure was further delayed by the disastrous British expedition to Flushing. At <b>long</b> <b>last,</b> on 5 August, the nearly-starved Russian fleet was allowed to leave Portsmouth for Riga, where they arrived on 9 September 1809.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the failure}} of the revolt, the {{position}} of the prōtosebastos was weakened: on the one hand, his readiness to use force against fellow citizens even in the most hallowed of all churches in the Empire increased popular hostility, while the amnesty offered to Maria and her supporters strengthened the perception of the regime's weakness. The situation was exacerbated when Alexios turned against Patriarch Theodosios for the aid and shelter he had given the rebels. The Patriarch was confined in the Pantepoptes Monastery, and was saved from being dismissed only through the intervention of the Empress-regent {{and other members of the}} imperial family. At <b>long</b> <b>last,</b> the prōtosebastos was forced to consent to the reinstatement of the Patriarch. His triumphal return, with jubilant crowds lining the procession that led him back to the patriarchal palace near the Hagia Sophia, was another blow to the regime's authority.|$|E

25|$|In early June 1940, when Mussolini {{informed}} Hitler that he at <b>long</b> <b>last</b> {{would enter}} the war on 10 June 1940, Hitler was most dismissive, in private calling Mussolini a cowardly opportunist who broke {{the terms of the}} Pact of Steel in September 1939 when the going looked rough, and was only entering the war in June 1940 after it was clear that France was beaten and it appeared that Britain would soon make peace. Ribbentrop, though he shared Hitler's assessment of the Italians, nonetheless welcomed Italy coming into war. In part, this seemed to affirm the importance of the Pact of Steel, which Ribbentrop had negotiated, and in addition, with Italy now an ally, the Foreign Office had more to do. Ribbentrop championed the so-called Madagascar Plan in June 1940 to deport all of Europe's Jews to Madagascar after the presumed imminent defeat of Britain.|$|E
25|$|At <b>long</b> <b>last,</b> on October 28, {{a killing}} frost struck. The city sent out word to Memphians {{scattered}} {{all over the country to}} come home. Though yellow fever cases were recorded in the pages of Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, the epidemic seemed quieted. The Board of Health declared the epidemic, which caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million, at an end. On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve and die. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result of this crisis, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878–1893. Although Memphis lost its charter and 75% of its population, a new era of sanitation was developed in Memphis. A new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.|$|E

Eventually, the plotters gained control over the La Paz garrisons, although not without considerable bloodshed. The combined levels of United States and Brazilian involvement for the coup d'état have been debated but {{it is apparent that}} significant clandestine financial & advisory assistance existed at a critical level within the Nixon administration for Banzer. With such backing secured, General Banzer emerged as the strong man of the new regime, and, on August 22, was given full power as president. Conversely, President Juan José Torres was forced to take refuge in Buenos Aires, Argentina where five years later he was kidnapped and assassinated by right-wing death squads associated with the Videla government and with the acquiescence of Hugo Banzer. His murder was part of Operation Condor. Interestingly, he received the political support of the center-right Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) of former president Víctor Paz Estenssoro and the conservative Falange Socialista Boliviana of Mario Gutiérrez, considered to be the two largest parties in the country. For the next seven years, and with the rank of Army General, Banzer ruled Bolivia as dictator.|$|E

500|$|... "At <b>Long</b> <b>Last</b> Leave", {{which is}} the 500th episode of The Simpsons, was written by Michael Price. The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean has {{described}} it as [...] "a tribute to people who love the show." [...] Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode {{in reference to the}} Cole Porter song [...] "At <b>Long</b> <b>Last</b> Love". Price did not write [...] "At <b>Long</b> <b>Last</b> Leave" [...] with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look-back at the history of the Simpson family. He {{said in an interview with}} the magazine Channel Guide that he was [...] "deeply honored" [...] when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that [...] "I think it's different from the movie in that it sort of does reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis-a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing". He further noted that despite the similarities [...] "we [...] liked it enough to go with it anyway." [...] The plot was first announced to the press at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California on July 23, 2011, during a panel with the cast and crew of The Simpsons.|$|E
