5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and <b>leachate,</b> a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The <b>leachate</b> is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E
40|$|The {{first stage}} of leaf litter {{decomposition}} of two eucalyptus hybrids and #Acacia auriculiformis$ was studied in laboratory experiments where the decaying leaves were leached with water. Although the litter of both the species were characterized by a high content of soluble compounds, little soluble organic matter of acacia litter was recovered in litter <b>leachates.</b> By contrast, soluble organic matter of eucalyptus litter was more resistant to degradation and was, therefore, recovered in <b>leachates,</b> where soluble carbon amounts and coloration varied with the age of decomposing litter. The pH of eucalyptus litter <b>leachates</b> decreased {{at the beginning of}} the experiment whereas the pH of acacia litter <b>leachates</b> increased. When added to savanna soil, litter <b>leachates</b> mobilized iron into soil solution, with greater effects observed from eucalyptus than from acacia. In bioassy, litter <b>leachates</b> were added to sand in which test plant seedlings were grown, and a strong allelopathic activity was observed with lechates from the first days of eucalyptus litter decomposition. <b>Leachates</b> from older litter did not show any effect.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of UV {{absorption}} and fluorescence spectroscopy to assess the early development of recalcitrant organic compounds in <b>leachates</b> formed during the anaerobic biodegradation of municipal solid waste. Biochemical methane potential tests were carried out on fresh waste (FW) and composted waste (CW) {{over a period of}} 150 days and <b>leachates</b> produced from the degradation of two wastes were analysed for humic-like (H-L) and fulvic-like (F-L) structures by UV spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation–emission-matrix analyses. During anaerobic biodegradation, the synthesis and utilization of H-L and F-L structures in the <b>leachates</b> over time was indicative of the generation of the recalcitrant organic compounds. The results obtained from UV absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that CW <b>leachates</b> resulted in a higher concentration and more condensed form of recalcitrant H-L and F-L molecules than FW <b>leachates.</b> These findings demonstrate how fluorescence and UV absorption spectroscopy can be used as an indicator for monitoring the evolution of recalcitrant organic compounds (H-L and F-L substances) in <b>leachates</b> formed at different stages of waste biodegradation...|$|R

40|$|Landfill <b>leachates</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} as significant secondary sources of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). This study presents data on the occurrence and concentration of 11 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and 5 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) in <b>leachates</b> from 4 municipal solid waste landfill sites located across northern Spain. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of PFASs in Spanish landfill <b>leachates.</b> Two of the landfill sites applied on-site treatment using membrane bioreactors (MBR), and its effect on PFASs occurrence is also reported. Total PFASs (∑PFASs) in raw <b>leachates</b> reached 1378. 9 ng/L, while in treated samples ∑PFASs was approximately two-fold (3162. 3 ng/L). PFCAs accounted {{for the majority of the}} detected PFASs and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant compound in raw <b>leachates</b> (42. 6 %), followed by shorter chain PFHxA (30. 1 %), PFPeA and PFBA. The age of the sites might explain the PFASs pattern found in raw <b>leachates</b> as all of them were stabilized <b>leachates.</b> However, PFASs profile was different in treated samples where the most abundant compound was PFHxA (26. 5 %), followed by linear perfluorobutane sulfonate (L-PFBS) (18. 7 %) and PFOA (17. 7 %). The overall increase of the PFASs content as well as the change in the PFASs profile after the MBR treatment, could be explained by the possible degradation of PFASs precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols or fluorotelomer sulfonates. Using the volume of <b>leachates</b> generated in the landfill sites, that served 1. 8 million people, the discharge of 16 ∑PFASs contained in the landfill <b>leachates</b> was estimated as 1209 g/year.

The effect of Synedrella nodiflora leaf <b>leachates</b> was more pronounced than that of Cassia uniflora. The mortality was observed to increase with increasing exposure and the concentrations of leaf <b>leachates</b> of both the weeds.

40|$|Forest {{floor in}} acid forest soils {{is a major}} source of {{dissolved}} organic carbon (DOC), nutrients and metals. We studied the release of DOC, nutrients and metals from two forest floors under beech stands (a moder from a Cambisol and a mor from a Podzol). We analyzed the composition of the solid phase, and we monitored the chemical properties of forest floor <b>leachates</b> through incubation-leaching experiments at 4 and 20 degrees C. Our data show that the release of DOC, nutrients and metals strongly differed between both forest floors. Whatever the temperature, the release of DOC, DIN, divalent cations and heavy metals, as compared to initial stocks of corresponding elements, were the largest in moder <b>leachates.</b> Instead, the release of K+, Na+, Si, Al and Fe were the largest in mor <b>leachates</b> at 20 degrees C, and were generally similar for both forest floors at 4 degrees C. The ionic signature of the <b>leachates</b> was strongly affected by DOC release and nitrogen mineralization, which was mostly directed towards the production of ammonium in mor, and of nitrate in moder. In moder <b>leachates</b> at 20 degrees C, Ca 2 + was the dominant cation, and nitrate the major anion. Instead, in mor <b>leachates,</b> NH 4 + was the major cation, and organic anions dominated the anionic charge. Despite the dominance of organic anions in mor <b>leachates,</b> the concentrations of cations and Si were strongly correlated to the concentrations of inorganic anions in <b>leachates</b> from both forest floors. The concentration of Al, Fe, Cu and Pb were strongly correlated to the concentration of organic anions, whereas Zn concentration was poorly correlated with either organic or inorganic anions.

30|$|The major {{minerals}} {{present in}} coal are quartz, kaolinite, illite, calcite, carbonate, dolomite and sulfide mineral like pyrite (Ward 2002). From the XRD and FTIR analyses {{it was revealed}} that quartz, kaolinite and pyrite are the major minerals in the Ledo coal. Other Indian coals like Bokaro coal samples contain mostly kaolinite and quartz, but other minerals such as siderite and analcine are found as intermediate phases. In Neyeveli coal, dolomite and kaolinite are the major constituents with trace amounts of hematite and bassanite (Equeenuddin 2015). From analytical data {{it was found that the}} aqueous <b>leachates</b> of the Ledo coal are highly acidic (pH range 1.99 – 3.09). But the <b>leachates</b> of other Indian coals have the normal pH range (6.8 – 7.4) (Equeenuddin 2015). The strong acidic nature of the <b>leachates</b> of Ledo coal is due to the leaching of pyrite which is present in high amounts in the Ledo coal. The high concentration of iron (1670  ppm) in the <b>leachates</b> is attributed to maximum leaching of pyrite. Low pH of aqueous <b>leachates</b> of Ledo coal leads to leach out most of the heavy metal from the coal.|$|R

In this paper, a mesoscale study aimed at evaluating the vertical transport of common VAs-namely, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and lincosamides in agricultural soil subjected to drip irrigation-was performed under greenhouse conditions. Accordingly, <b>leachates</b> of cropped and uncropped soil, amended with swine-slurry leading to 19 - 38 mu g kg(- 1) (dry mass) antibiotics in the soil, were analyzed {{over the course of}} the productive cycle of a lettuce (42 days) with three sampling campaigns (N= 24). High lincomycin (LCM) concentrations (30 - 39 mu g L- 1) were detected in the <b>leachates</b> collected from the swine-slurry-amended soil.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of phenols in the soils environment and their fate was studied {{as a function}} of five different soil types, six different monohydroxyphenols, and three different municipal landfill <b>leachates</b> media. Concentrations of naturally occurring phenols were also followed for a period of one year in young and old <b>leachates.</b> Methods for analysis of phenols were reviewed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of phenols in landfill <b>leachates.</b> To determine the adsorptive capabilities of the soils used in this study, the isotherm approach was used after the equilibration time of phenols in soils was determined to be five days. Concentrations of phenols varying from 5 ppm to 100 ppm were used to construct isotherm graphs. The soil-phenol isotherm curves conformed very well to the Freundlich equation, indicating multiple adsorption mechanisms and slow equilibration times in the soilsphenols reactions. A statistical analysis of the isotherm data showed %-free iron oxides {{to be the most important}} soil characteristic for the adsorption of phenols by all soils; followed by soil pH and % clay in order of significance. High solubility and moderate polarity of phenols also were found to be favorable factors in the adsorption of phenols by soils. Naturally occurring phenols such as cresols disappeared fastèr from soil solutions than synthetic phenols. The reactivities of phenols with MSW <b>leachates</b> increased with the age of the <b>leachates.</b> Very young <b>leachates,</b> having low pH and high TOC levels favored synthetic phenols over naturally occurring phenols to react with. All <b>leachates</b> studied demonstrated an ability to remove from solution one or more of the six phenols used in large quantities over a period of 15 days or less. The overall performance of the <b>leachates</b> used in this study seemed to be a function of the humic acid levels found in them. Levels of naturally occurring phenols in <b>leachates</b> varied from several ppbs to more than 9000 ppbs for a year's period. The highest phenol levels were found in the young phenols and the lowest levels in the old phenols; indicating that pH and TOC concentration determine the amounts of phenols in solution. In column studies of perfusion of <b>leachates</b> through 10 cm of soil materials packed at field densities, no soil was able to stop the migration of phenols for more than 5 to 10 pore volume displacements. Low pH and high TOC levels seemed to play a much larger role in the migration of phenols through soils than the levels of phenols found in the <b>leachates</b> used. The use of phenol enriched deionized water passed through soil columns showed the fact that there is a clear dependency of adsorption of phenol on the flow rate. Slow rates favored adsorption of phenol by all soils studied. The TOC analysis of the effluents from the phenol enriched water-soil columns studies indicated that some mechanisms for the disappearance of phenol from soil solution may have been transformation reactions as well as adsorption reactions. Varying TOC levels with flux seemed to indicate that these reactions are much slower than the adsorption reactions. The use of Cu⁺² saturated soils in an attempt to correlate transformation reactions of phenol with transition metal catalytic properties failed to increase the adsorption and/or transformation of phenol in the soil media. The 4 -aminoantipyrine colorimetric method performed well in the analysis of phenols in air unstable <b>leachates.</b> Gas-liquid chromatography using NPGSB+H₃PO₄ on Anakrom A 90 / 100 mesh was used for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of phenols in <b>leachates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose Wastes from {{a former}} Portuguese steel plant were {{deposited}} between 1961 and 2001 on the riverbank of {{a tributary of the}} Tagus River creating a landfill connected to the river, posing a potential contamination risk to the Tagus estuary ecosystem. This study aims to assess the transfer of chemical elements from contaminated sediments to the estuarine water from cycles of sediment leaching so as to evaluate the ecotoxicity of the <b>leachates,</b> and to analyze the solid phases crystallized from those <b>leachates.</b> Materials and methods Landfill sediment and estuarine water samples were collected during low tide. Sediment samples were analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), C-org, NPK, and iron oxides. Leaching assays (four replicates) were done using estuarine water (200 cm(3) /replicate) and 1. 5 kg of sediment per reactor. Each reactor was submitted to four leaching processes (0, 28, 49, and 77 days). The sediment was kept moist between leaching processes. Sediment (total (acid digestion) and available fraction (diluted organic acid extraction- Rhizo)) elemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-instrumental neutron activation analysis (ICP/INAA). <b>Leachates,</b> and estuarine and sediment pore waters were analyzed for metals/metalloids by ICP/mass spectrometry (MS) and carbonates/sulfate/chloride by standard methodologies. Ecotoxicity assays were performed in <b>leachates</b> and estuarine and pore waters using Artemia franciscana and Brachionus plicatillis. Aliquots of the <b>leachates</b> were evaporated to complete dryness (23 - 25 degrees C) and crystals analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Results and discussion Sediment with pH= 8 and high EC and Corg was contaminated with As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. The element concentrations in the available fraction of the sediment were low compared to the sediment total concentrations (< 1 % for Rhizo extraction). The concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in the estuarine water were relatively low, except for Cd. Concentrations of hazardous elements in the <b>leachates</b> were very low. Calcium, K, Mg, Na, and chloride concentrations were high but did not vary significantly among the four leaching experiments. Total concentrations of carbonate were much higher in <b>leachates</b> than in estuarine water. Both estuarine water and <b>leachates</b> showed negligible toxicity. Crystals identified in the solids obtained from the <b>leachates</b> by evaporation were halite, anhydrite, epsomite, dolomite, and polyhalite. Conclusions The sediment showed the capacity to retain the majority of the potentially hazardous chemical elements. Remobilization of chemical elements from sediment by leaching was essentially negligible. The variation of total concentrations of Ca, carbonate, and sulfate in <b>leachates</b> indicates that the sediment contained reactive sulfides.
