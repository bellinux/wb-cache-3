25|$|Also {{associated}} with the granite batholith {{was the creation of}} mineral veins in parts of the Lake District. The richest known lead vein of all was found crossing the south-east shoulder of Green Side. This, the Greenside Lead Vein runs in a north-south direction and dips steeply to the east at 70°. It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (<b>lead</b> <b>sulphide)</b> is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value. Very small amounts of blende (zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) were found in the deeper levels, but never in recoverable quantities.|$|E

2500|$|The argentiferous galena (<b>lead</b> <b>sulphide,</b> {{containing}} {{small amounts}} of silver), which the miners sought, occurred as ribs, strings and dispersed pockets throughout the vein. Many strings of galena, varying in thickness between 1/8 of an inch (2mm) and about , were interspersed through the vein, and sometimes spread into the rock {{on the east side}} of the vein (the hanging wall of the fault). The mineralised parts of the vein were mostly found in four areas, known as [...] "ore shoots." [...] Their position was determined by the steepness of the fault plane. In general, areas where the fault dipped at more than 70°, were mineralised, but where the dip was less than 70° the vein was barren, filled with the light coloured soft fault breccia which the miners called [...] "chunk."

40|$|The Boulder Conglomerate is the Lower Carboniferous {{sedimentary}} allochthon {{deposited in}} the second order half graben created by major listric normal faults in the Navan area. The base of the Boulder Conglomerate comprises erosive-based, highly immature rock avalanches which are interbedded with hemipelagic limestone. Sulphide mineralisation in the autochthon, the Pale Beds Ore, is truncated by the fault-generated unconformity and is reworked as clasts and matrix into the basal Boulder Conglomerate. Matrix-deficient breccia beds deposited on the unconformity possess mineralisation as cement to interclast porosity. This cement is contiguous with replacement and fracture-cementing mineralisation in limestone strata beneath the unconformity. Mineralisation associated within the interbeds to the Boulder Conglomerate occurs as early diagenetic concretions and as stratiform replacement. The 34 S of these sulphides ranges from - 21 ‰ to + 1 ‰. The rock avalanches are overlain by clast-bearing carbonate mud strata. The carbonate mud is replaced by pyrite and paragenetically later sphalerite and galena. The isotopic range of 34 S for pyrite (- 32 ‰ to - 35 ‰) is distinct {{from that of the}} zinc and <b>lead</b> <b>sulphides</b> (- 18 ‰ to + 6 ‰). The uppermost Boulder Conglomerate is characterised by slumped and brecciated mineralisation which is dominated by pyrite. The 34 S values of the in situ and reworked mineralisation range from - 40 ‰ to - 23 ‰. The Thinly Bedded Unit overlies the Boulder Conglomerate and comprises interlayered shales and calcarenite and laterally impersistent, erosive-based, graded bioclastic and oolitic microbeccias. Mineralisation occurs as selective replacement to the microbreccia and as stratiform sphalerite and pyrite mud. The latter occur in-situ as laminae and as channelised debris flows. The reworked sulphide mud supports plant fragments which exhibit exceptional preservation by pyrite, sphalerite and galena.

The identification of mosaic gold residues in a burnished golden mirror decoration on a XIIIth Century Spanish polychrome statue is important in that the first reference {{to the use of}} mosaic gold in the European literature dates from the XIVth Century, although the use of this material in China had been recorded some time before. In this paper, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and SEM are used in the analysis of the conditions required for the formation of golden mirrors using tin (IV) sulphide in admixture with dilead (II) lead (IV) tetroxide and mercury (II) sulphide.

40|$|International audienceThe mantle and {{continental}} crust [...] Earth's main silicate reservoirs [...] have a lead isotope composition {{that is too}} radiogenic to {{have evolved}} from primitive Solar System material over 4. 57 [*]billion years 1. To account for this imbalance, {{it has been suggested}} that unradiogenic lead may have partitioned into the metallic core 2, 3, 4 or lower continental crust 5. Alternatively, radiogenic lead could have been added to Earth later by meteorite impacts 6. Unradiogenic lead was discovered in fragments of mantle rocks exhumed in the Horoman massif, Japan, implying that the mantle itself may provide a complementary reservoir of unradiogenic lead 7. However, it is unclear why this unradiogenic component is not sampled by the melting that generates oceanic basalts 8. Here we present double-spike lead isotope data for abyssal peridotite rocks, considered to represent suboceanic mantle, exposed on the Atlantic Ocean floor. We find that sulphides dated at about 1. 83 [*]billion years old and trapped as inclusions in silicate minerals preserve extremely unradiogenic lead isotope compositions. This unradiogenic lead could have been prevented from adding significantly to oceanic basalts if either the silicates shield the sulphide inclusions or if the sulphides reside in refractory mantle rocks that are rarely sampled during melting. We conclude that the lead isotope composition of the silicate Earth could be largely balanced by unradiogenic <b>lead</b> in <b>sulphide</b> in the mantle...|$|R
