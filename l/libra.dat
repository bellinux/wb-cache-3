5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard <b>libra</b> medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE To {{validate}} a video containing image {{representations of}} clinical {{signs and symptoms}} of sexually transmitted infections expressed in <b>Libras.</b> METHOD Methodology development study conducted in an audio communication school. Thirty-six deaf people were selected. A video containing image representations of clinical {{signs and symptoms of}} sexually transmitted infections expressed in <b>Libras</b> was produced. Semantic validation was performed by deaf students and content validation by three judges who are <b>Libras</b> experts. The validation results were subjected to the Content Validity Index, where an index score > 0. 80 / 80 % was considered as agreement among judges. RESULTS Seven signs and symptoms related to sexually transmitted infections were validated and obtained satisfactory Content Validity Indexes, most of them with 100 % representativeness and agreement. CONCLUSION The validation process made the expressions of signs and symptoms related to sexually transmitted infections represented in <b>Libras</b> valid for establishing effective communication {{in the area of the}} study, turning it into a care tool that facilitates and standardizes communication with deaf people through <b>Libras...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes {{the soul of a}} dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person of the next generation dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of <b>Libra</b> (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E
40|$|<b>Libras</b> is a visual-spatial {{language}} {{used by the}} Brazilian deaf community. Following the principles of spatiality and vision, the user of the sign language resorts more easily to stimuli from the environment than the user of the oral language. Thus, the hypothesis {{of this research is}} that the affordances (environmental properties that enable psychologically possible actions) would be a facilitator element in the process of <b>Libras</b> acquisition. In this paper we use the narrative and interpretive-qualitative research to discuss the role of affordances in the listener perception, interpretation and action cycle in <b>Libras</b> acquisition as second language. Results show that the Libras’ iconic signs can be considered important affordances {{in the early stages of}} the acquisition. It is also observed the importance of the permanence in the niche where <b>Libras</b> is used for the sign language development. ...|$|R

Residence hall style suites {{are available in}} the <b>Libra,</b> Apollo, Hercules, Nike, and Neptune communities. All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms. Apartment-style housing is available in the Academic Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, the Towers at Knights Plaza, the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community, and NorthView. UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus. The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though The Towers at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students. Residents of the Towers Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other standard housing communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time. Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well {{before the start of the}} Fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.|$|E
