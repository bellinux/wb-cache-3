5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} {{was able to}} summon {{a large amount of}} public support, including the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such communities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely as a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work. However, when they tried to make a living <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else, they did not find work outside the settlement because of public prejudice and ostracisation. The situation has continued to this day.|$|E

She {{is a big}} fan of Star Wars, Clint Eastwood, and movies in general. She has a best friend, Tyler, on whom she develops a crush as she got older, though he is unaware of her feelings. Molly is the one who has probably warmed the most towards Zoey, aside from her mom, and is trying to be the best big sister to her.|$|E

25|$|Maggie is a {{character}} that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, After the Fall. She is both {{one of his most}} criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This {{is one of the reasons}} that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than just an object, <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else. Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.|$|E
500|$|... "We were {{listening}} to Nirvana and Pearl Jam just <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else," [...] remarked Def Leppard's Vivian Campbell, [...] "and especially to Soundgarden – the Superunknown record.

500|$|In an {{interview}} for YouTube posted on December 24, 2009, Carey elaborated on the lyrical meaning, saying that it [...] "really hits people in their hearts because it's <b>like...</b> <b>everybody</b> has experienced when you love somebody, and they let you go, but you can't let them go. So 'I can't wait to hate you' is a strong statement". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club compared the seagull chirp [...] "vocal acrobatic" [...] sung by Carey during the track's climax to the whistle notes she sings on her 1991 single [...] "Emotions".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Cynthy'll go," [...] laughed Mr. Merrill, [...] "and you'll go, and Ephraim'll go." [...] Although he by {{no means}} <b>liked</b> <b>everybody,</b> as would appear at first glance, Mr. Merrill {{had a way of}} calling people by their first names when he did fancy them.|$|R

500|$|In 2009, {{producer}} Chuck Harmony and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo convened {{together to}} conceptualize {{a song that}} would take Rihanna's music to a further level. According to Harmony, they didn't wanted to re-work the previous efforts by Rihanna—something that according to him the fans expected. The producer told MTV News {{that they wanted to}} give Rihanna a film, not just a song with a length of three minutes, [...] "I felt musically <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> was gonna give like that 'Disturbia,' 'SOS,' kind of pop, uptempo stuff, and I really wanted the song that me and Ne-Yo did to stand out." ...|$|E

[...] He {{said that he}} felt a personal connection with the recording process as he had [...] " [...] own soundtrack to [...] life that [...] play everyday". During an interview, he also described the single as a part of his experimentation with music.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Smith {{finished}} {{the game with}} a single sack and eight tackles, and cited his poor performance on the time spent away from practice and in court. Other Virginia Tech players cited the court battle as a distraction during game preparations, and it was also thought that many Air Force players were inspired by the increased media coverage given Virginia Tech. Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry said he thought the storm of pre-game publicity about Smith helped his team. [...] "It seemed <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> forgot the Air Force was in town," [...] he said. [...] "The thing that motivated the team was the challenge of playing against them with him in the lineup." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Bob Rusch awarded the album 4.5 stars stating [...] "This {{was the first}} of three {{recordings}} soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy made for Prestige and this 11/1/57 session was his first as a leader...There was a controlled tension to this date, <b>like</b> <b>everybody's</b> trying to play, carefully, to a common goal. It's almost as if someone were present to make sure everybody stayed within obvious perimeters.".|$|R

60|$|Sir John {{showed a}} startled face, but swore readily {{enough that he}} had not so much as seen Sir Oliver for days. He was gentle with Lionel, whom he <b>liked,</b> as <b>everybody</b> <b>liked</b> him. The lad was so mild and kindly in his ways, so vastly {{different}} from his arrogant overbearing brother, that his virtues shone the more brightly by that contrast.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{had already}} raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, {{there is no}} way this [...] be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. He was like 'Really, you think so?'

We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>everybody.</b> It's just that I want to feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E
500|$|... "Illuminati" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} brittle hits, blips and a buzz-saw break as its main instrumentation. Its sound was {{compared}} to that of [...] West's album Yeezus (2013). The song's lyrics discuss Illuminati conspiracy theories; it names celebrities who had also been accused of being part of the group, and religious imagery. Madonna sings, [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> in this party's, shining like Illuminati". The song received favorable reviews from music critics, who commended West involvement with the track, and its ambitious sound and lyrics, while some chose it as one of the album's highlights. It charted in some European territories and on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Songs. [...] Madonna performed the song with dancers strapped to tall, flexible poles as part of her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16); it was considered one of the show's main highlights.|$|E

6000|$|... "How unkind!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Still, {{since it}} is better to tell you, Sir John is very much in earnest, but his respectability is {{something}} altogether too overpowering. Of course I knew all about him years ago, and he is exactly <b>like</b> <b>everybody's</b> description of him. I am afraid, Anna, just a little afraid, that in Paris I and my friends here might seem a trifle advanced. Besides, he might hear things. That is why I called myself Anna." ...|$|R
60|$|Birkin and Gerald {{were the}} last {{to come down to}} breakfast. Hermione <b>liked</b> <b>everybody</b> to be early. She {{suffered}} when she felt her day was diminished, she felt she had missed her life. She seemed to grip the hours by the throat, to force her life from them. She was rather pale and ghastly, as if left behind, in the morning. Yet she had her power, her will was strangely pervasive. With the entrance of the two young men a sudden tension was felt.|$|R
500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Dallas, {{who plays}} Prince Charming, was pleased the writers took [...] "some {{dramatic}} license" [...] with his character, believing the prince {{had become more}} real. He explained, [...] "Prince Charming {{just happens to be}} a name. He's still a man with the same emotions as any other man. He's a Prince, but he's a Prince of the people. He gets his hands dirty. He's got a kingdom to run. He has a family to protect. He has an epic, epic love for Snow White. He's <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else. He's human." [...] Jennifer Morrison was hired for the part of Emma Swan. The actress explained her character as someone who [...] "help this kid who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional," [...] but noted that Emma does not yet believe there is a fairytale universe. Ten-year-old Jared Gilmore, known for his work on Mad Men, took the role of her son, Henry.|$|E
500|$|On November 8, 2011, a {{demo version}} of the song, named [...] "Give Me All Your Love", was leaked. According to Keith Caulfield from Billboard, [...] "Within a few hours, [...] was among {{one of the top}} 10 {{trending}} topics worldwide on Twitter." [...] Madonna's manager, Guy Oseary, addressed the leak on Twitter adding the singer's statement on the situation: [...] "My true fans wouldn't do this". Oseary also clarified that their initial plan was for new music to come out in 2012 itself. He was happy with the positive reaction to the demo, but asked fans to help him police any more leaks. The leaked demo lacked vocals from both Minaj and M.I.A. which Madonna reflected upon, [...] "It's really disappointing because you don't want things to come out till you're done with them, till you're ready. It's <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> looking at your unfinished painting. It's like, 'Wait a minute. I didn't finish that. That's not fair." ...|$|E

60|$|WHEN I {{got there}} it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies {{in the air that}} makes it seem so lonesome and <b>like</b> <b>everybody's</b> dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you always think they're talking about YOU. As a general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead, too, and done with it all.|$|R
5000|$|University of Texas {{football}} {{historian and}} media relations director Bill Little later wrote of Jordan's {{contributions in the}} early years of Longhorns football:"One of the most popular students at The University of Texas from 1911 through 1915 was a young man of German heritage from Fredericksburg, Texas, named L.J. 'Louis' Jordan. Jordan was <b>like</b> <b>everybody's</b> big brother. He was a round-faced blond who stood over 6 feet tall and weighed 205 pounds -- that was big for the time ... Jordan, in fact, was so gentle by nature he had to be coaxed to play football. But when he did, he became the greatest lineman, both offensively and defensively, of his era." ...|$|R

500|$|During the journey, Brittan {{performed}} {{the duties of}} the ship's surgeon. He and the ship's chaplain produced a play, The Merchant of Venice, and his contribution was to invite women to act the female roles, which was unusual for the time and a hot topic of conversation causing great amusement. Arriving in Lyttelton on 5 February 1852, most of the immigrants had to find somewhere to live and many slept in tents or under the open sky. The Brittans were among the fortunate few, as a house on Christchurch's Hereford Street had been arranged for them by Guise Brittan. [...] <b>Like</b> <b>everybody</b> else who was heading for Christchurch, upon disembarking from the ship they had to make their way over the Port Hills then follow the steep Bridle Path to reach the city. They carried as many of their possessions as possible, but following months at sea, their fitness was rather poor. [...] The remainder of their possessions was shipped by whaleboat around the coast and up the Avon River, which was a dangerous undertaking due to the Sumner sand bar located {{at the entrance to the}} Avon Heathcote Estuary.|$|E
500|$|Ross favorably {{compared}} the recording sessions to his past in school. He mused, [...] "it's <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> is a student: You {{walk into a}} session, and it's all about the subject at hand." [...] The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo, composed by producer Bink!. Bink! is most famous for his contributions to Jay-Z's album, The Blueprint, which has been described a [...] "pioneering album" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal and was West's big break as a producer. West and Bink! originally became friends while producing another Jay-Z album, [...] in the late 1990s. Bink! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual respect for each other. Bink! commented on {{the first time he}} showed the composition to West, saying [...] "the reaction I got from him after I played the beat for the first time was real intense." [...] Immediately Bink! knew that West was going to use the production. Initially, he wasn't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album, and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album's release.|$|E
