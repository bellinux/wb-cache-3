5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E

25|$|Some Jewish historians {{suggest a}} {{different}} {{explanation for the}} rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome’s grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, like the AD 135 experience.|$|E

Some eyewitnesses believed that the Air Wisconsin Twin Otter began a turn seconds before the collision, but the NTSB did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the Air Wisconsin crew took evasive action. The rate of closure during the final five seconds before the collision was 688 feet (210 m) per second, i.e., 469mph (755km/hr).|$|E

It was a short lived return though as Zohar only managed three games before announcing on February 14, 2005 that he was hanging up his boots for good.|$|E

25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E
500|$|As Interior Secretary, Lane was {{responsible}} for the territories, and advocated the development of the Alaska Territory. While private railroads had been established there, they were not successful, and he pushed for a government-built railroad, which he believed would lead to large-scale population movement into Alaska. In 1914, Congress passed a bill authorizing construction of the Alaska Railroad, which passed the Senate following a two-day speech in support by Walsh. [...] Lane was the first Interior Secretary to appoint an Alaska resident, John Franklin Alexander Strong, as territorial governor. [...] Secretary Lane's vision for the territory was, [...] "Alaska should not, in my judgment, be regarded as a mere storehouse of materials on which the people of the States may draw. [...] She has the potentialities of a State. And whatever policies may be adopted should <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> an Alaska of homes, of industries, and of an extended commerce." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1840s, Lincoln {{subscribed to}} the Doctrine of Necessity, {{a belief that}} {{asserted}} the human mind was controlled by some higher power. In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in [...] "providence" [...] in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered {{the death of his}} son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God [...] "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." [...] On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.|$|E

The energetic leadership within Macedon began in 359 BC when Philip of Macedon was made regent for his nephew, Amyntas. Within a short time, Philip was acclaimed king as Philip II of Macedonia in his own right, with succession of the throne established on his own heirs. [...] During his lifetime, Philip II consolidated his rule over Macedonia. This was done by 359 BC and Philip began to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> expanding Macedonia's influence abroad.

2500|$|However, in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the March 8, 2014 disappearance, information regarding JORN's status was not released. This led to months of speculation. On March 18, 2014, sources cited by The Australian said that JORN was not tasked to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> the Indian Ocean on the night of the disappearance of MH370 as there was no reason for it to be searching there at that time. On March 20, 2014, it was reported that Malaysian Defence Minister (also Acting Transport Minister) Hishammuddin Hussein requested the US to give any information from the Pine Gap base near Alice Springs, possibly alluding to JORN as well. On March 19, 2014, it was reported that an Australian Defence Department spokesman said it [...] "won't be providing comment" [...] regarding specific information on tracking MH370 by JORN.

2500|$|... "Music" [...] had {{the longest}} {{production}} time to date for a Sakanaction single, as Yamaguchi had difficulty finalizing the song's lyrics. Yamaguchi challenged himself {{to write the}} lyrics unconsciously, creating a story out of the lyrics that spontaneously occurred to him while listening to the song's melody. The first draft had a strong story to it, but Yamaguchi felt that because the story needed too much explanation to understand abandoned these plans. Yamaguchi {{wanted to write a}} song describing how Sakanaction as a band <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> music, and expressed musically what type of band Sakanaction were in that moment. While Yamaguchi was struggling with the song's lyrics, Sakanaction's manager gave them the news that one of their songs would be used for the theme song of the drama Dinner. As he was struggling to find a lyrical theme for the song, Yamaguchi read the screenplays for the first three episodes of the drama; finding professionalism to be an overarching theme to the work. Instead of relating the song to the drama's cooking-focused theme, Yamaguchi decided to write the song about his own professionalism, from his perspective as a musician.|$|E

2500|$|The second tale, {{related by}} the travel writer Will R. Bird, occurs {{at a time}} when men from the north shore of the Minas Basin used to cross the water to buy horses from farmers in the Annapolis Valley. During his summer travels in the late 1950s, Bird {{encountered}} an oldtimer on a farm near the Parrsboro golf course across the harbour from Partridge Island. [...] "You ever hear of our sea horse?" [...] the oldtimer asked. [...] "There ain't nothing to match it in Nova Scotia." [...] The story begins when Tom Smith crosses over to buy a mare from a man in Canning. The mare then had a black foal that [...] "was one of the finest ever seen on this shore." [...] After about seven years, the farmer from Canning showed up at Smith's farm and, obviously regretting that he had sold the mare, he offered Smith [...] "more'n twice the going price" [...] for his fast, black horse. [...] "Tom was a man who watched the dollars and he just couldn't resist," [...] the oldtimer said. The farmer from Canning took the boat back while Smith drove the horse around the Basin to deliver it. [...] "He was no more'n back home," [...] the old man said, [...] "when he happened to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> the pasture and there was the black horse. Tom couldn't believe his eyes." [...] When he went down to the beach, he saw hoof marks showing where the animal had come ashore. Apparently, the horse had known to wait for low tide before attempting the crossing, but, it [...] "made a mighty long swim just the same." [...] The story ends with Smith returning to Canning to give the money back. [...] "He told the man he couldn't sell a horse that wanted to be with him that much, and the stranger agreed." ...|$|E
