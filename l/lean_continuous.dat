40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to assess}} the needs for a <b>lean</b> <b>continuous</b> {{improvement}} professional certificate and/or lean leadership cognate for a Doctorate of Education in leadership focused in three main research questions: “What do organizational leaders need from a Lean graduate programming?”; “What are the preferable methods of delivery for Lean teaching/learning?” and “What are the main learner outcomes and do how these impact organizational and continuous improvement outcomes?” Design/methodology/approach – A survey to 37 organizational leaders in a North-American state was conducted via telephone and email that were returned to the researcher. The survey was designed to target a solid cross-section of organizational decision makers {{in regard to the}} need for and type of lean training desired, if at all, for employees. Using a mixed methods approach, the survey was designed to collect both qualitative and quantitative information. Findings – Respondents indicated that <b>lean</b> <b>continuous</b> improvement thinking and lean processproject management were most the desirable content options. The method of delivery was not as clear with on-ground and online relying on job-embedded, project-based methods as most desirable approaches. Learner outcomes of mastery of lean content along with the ability to impact organizational and continuous improvement outcomes were favored. Originality/value – Lean leadership education is valued learning by organizational leaders. As so, higher education institutions must be aware of matching better organizational needs with learning experiences. This paper presents a survey that intended to do this in an original way.

40|$|To stay {{competitive}} on today’s {{market and}} satisfy the constantly increasing customer requirements, working with continuous and cost-effective improvement is a requirement. The {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} model to continuously and cost-effectively improve the quality of a management system within trading business, taking the environmental aspect and impact of organizational changes up on personnel in consideration. The model has been developed based on theoretical management strategies and improvement methodologies: Process management, Change management, TQM, <b>Lean,</b> <b>Continuous</b> and cost-effective improvement, PDCA and Kaizen. The developed model should result in a high-qualitative management system that continuously should be improved and maintained, to streamline the supply chain and in turn be profitable.

40|$|Organisations must {{constantly}} monitor, measure, evaluate {{and improve their}} processes {{in order to remain}} competitive. Construction organisations are no different in this aspect and are increasingly realising the need for process improvement due to external and internal pressures. The construction industry is working towards improving its efficiency by implementing process improvement techniques such as Lean Construction along with information and communication systems. Business processes and information technology are closely associated and better results can be achieved by addressing them in an integrated manner. This paper provides details of a case study where an extensive business process improvement exercise was carried out over a period of five years alongside a major Enterprise Information System implementation. All major organisational units were assessed and its processes were modelled and evaluated with a view to improvement within the lean framework. Finally a continuous process improvement framework was put in place to avoid the risk of stagnation. The <b>lean</b> <b>continuous</b> improvement framework resulted in each organisational unit taking responsibility for their own processes ultimately leading to higher profitability and smoother supply chain processes.

The organization started their lean journey in 2007, {{which has led}} to increased revenue throughout the years to follow. Today the organization is {{recognized as one of the}} leading organization within lean. Fibo-Trespo has gone through extensive changes since 2007, and our research seeks to determine if these changes has anchored into the organization’s workforce. More specifically, our research takes a closer look at the organizations approach to <b>lean</b> <b>continuous</b> improvement, and the effect it has on the workforce. Through interviews and a survey, our purpose is to measure and increase engagement levels within the workforce at Fibo-Trespo with respect to <b>lean</b> <b>continuous</b> improvement. Engagement is a complex term, and several factors can affect employee’s engagement level. When determining what theory to build this thesis upon, we consider the context, and emphasizes the factors that we have reason to believe are more relevant to the case studied. Furthermore, we look into what theory similar studies draw upon. It can be argued that a lean production system is a more fragile production system. The reduction of inventory and buffers makes problems surface, and as we move in the direction of 1 x 1 flow, the organization is relying on the knowledge within the workforce to tackle a variety of challenges (MacDuffie, 1995). Continuous improvement in the lean methodology can be compared to stepwise innovation, eventually generating new knowledge and value for the organization. To remain competitive in the international market, Norwegian companies need to specialize and rapidly adapt to changes. This leads to an increased focus on being innovative. Learning and establishing knowledge among employees is a focus in lean, but theory describing how the actual learning process takes place is missing (Kalsaas, 2012). The Nordic Model promotes the opportunity to make decisions, learn at work, and broad involvement from employees as factors for characterizing the working environment (Gustavsen, 2011). This thesis therefor includes and emphasizes learning in working life, a theory developed by Illeris (2012), which accounts for the missing perspective on learning within lean. Illeris points out that the most significant learning takes place where individuals meet the fellowship and shapes it, and vice versa. Motivation also plays an important role in developing exceptional people and teams that follow the company’s philosophy. The internal motivation theories point to intrinsic factors as important, where the external theories emphasize extrinsic factors (Liker, 2004). Arguably, there is a motivational balance between rewards and recognition, and conducting the improvements itself. The research utilizes the constructive research approach and is conducted as a theoretically informed case study. Our research process starts with an exploratory phase showing that the organization has succeeded with their initiatives, and has developed knowledge and a culture for improvement work among employees. However, findings also suggest that changes had not necessarily become transcendent. Through second hand sources and several meetings with our IV informant and members of management, we were able to narrow down to a precise research question: “How to increase employee engagement in <b>lean</b> <b>continuous</b> improvement at Fibo-Trespo?” As we move into the main part of our research process, we develop semi-structured interviews that seek to get a more detailed perspective on employees’ approach to improvement work as well as employees’ level of engagement. Furthermore, we want to measure the level of employee engagement within the organization though an organizational-wide survey. The survey bases on a concretization of relevant theory. Every question links to one or several models retrieved from our theory chapter. The concretization of theory makes it possible to determine areas to focus, as results from questions will point to a theory. With great help from the organization, we received a response rate of 87 %, thus providing a holistic view of employees’ engagement towards continuous improvement. The questions in the survey is concretized upon the following concepts:  The Nordic Model.  The Technical Organizational Learning Environment.  The Social & Cultural Learning Environment.  Motivational theory The overall results from the survey is considered consistent and positive for the organization, as high levels of engagement are proven. In combination with other collected data, the survey results forms the basis to make several assumptions regarding this success. However, parts of the survey also provides data which points to variation and work pace, as factors that can affect engagement levels negatively. When analyzing these results, we have taken into consideration that running production can result in less room for variation, due to operators being bound to operate machines.

40|$|Lean, {{with its}} origins at the Toyota Motor Company, {{is a concept}} that is known to {{increase}} effectiveness in manufacturing. The Lean concept is now argued to be relevant not only in manufacturing but in service and health-care delivery as well. The reported results of Lean implementation efforts are divided. There are reports that most of the Lean implementation efforts are not reaching the goal; on the other hand, there are reports of promising results. The divided results from Lean implementation efforts show {{how important it is to}} research and identify factors that are barriers to successful implementation of Lean. This thesis aims to contribute knowledge about barriers to Lean implementation by collecting empirical findings from manufacturing and health care and structuring the perceived barriers and difficulties to Lean implementation. My first study aimed to compare similarities and divergences in barriers to Lean described by key informants in manufacturing and health care. The data was collected via semi-structured interviews. Findings showed that the perceived difficulties and barriers are much the same in manufacturing and health care. The second study was a case study at a manufacturing firm, researching how the views on Lean of the managers implementing Lean influence its implementation. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with 20 individuals and covered all hierarchical management levels in the company. Findings showed that managers' views on Lean influence the implementation but also that learning during the implementation process can alter managers' views of Lean. The third study aimed to research how management of Lean is described in the literature. This was done through a literature review. The findings showed that Lean management is a matter of dualism, consisting of two complementary systems of action, management and leadership, which are related to the two basic principles of <b>Lean,</b> <b>continuous</b> improvement and respect for the people.

Additionally, the influence of the noble metals present in the catalysts was investigated regarding sulphur sensitivity and it was found that a combination of platinum and rhodium seems to be preferable to retain high performance of the catalyst under SO 2 exposure and subsequent regeneration. Finally, the behaviour of micro-fabricated model NOx storage catalysts was studied as a function of temperature and gas composition with area-resolved XPS. These model catalysts consisted of a thin film of Pt deposited on one-half of a BaCO 3 pellet. It was found that the combination of SO 2 and O- 2 resulted in migration of Pt on the BaCO 3 support up to one mm away from the Pt/BaCO 3 interface...|$|R
40|$|Since {{at least}} the Tavistock studies, {{the need to improve}} {{communication}} and coordination in the construction process has been stressed. This paper reports from a study of 25 construction projects where QA and a number of procedures were in use which might have been expected to bring such improvement. The finding was, however, that coordination was poor. The purpose of the paper is to consider how this finding is to be explained. With reference to the markets/hierarchy theoretical framework, it is proposed that the use of this and other similar frameworks in fact obscures the empirical reality which they are intended to explain. It is accepted that the meta-language which such frameworks supply may enable researchers and those practitioners who choose to use this language to share their interests and concerns. However, the relationship between the abstract and global concepts which feature in such talk and the reality to which they refer needs closer enquiry. This paper proposes that our knowledge of the impact of QA has been compromised by the lack of such attention. The paper then inspects the global proposition that QA has been {{a step in the right}} direction towards TQM. With the aim of giving this proposition a stronger empirical referent, six key principles of TQM are used as a benchmark against which to assess the significance of the empirical data drawn from the study. It is proposed that greater attention to such data is necessary to provide a sounder basis for establishing what needs to be done to stimulate change. <b>Lean</b> Construction, <b>Continuous</b> Improvement, Concurrent Engineering, Process Re-engineering, Markets-hierarchies, Contractual Controls, Subcontracting,...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce CO 2 {{emissions}} there is a trend towards an increased use of more fuel-efficient lean burn combustion engines and thus an increased need for deNOx catalysts for such engines. In this study a mechanical mixture of CoFER and HZSM- 5 zeolites was studied as a dual pore system catalyst for the <b>continuous</b> <b>lean</b> reduction of NOx with isobutane as reducing agent. The degree of NOx conversion {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the oxygen concentration in the gas mixture, and the highest degree of reduction was achieved with 10 % O 2. This optimum is explained by the need for NO 2 as an intermediate for the catalyst to work efficiently, and that above a certain oxygen concentration O 2 oxidises the hydrocarbon resulting in a lower reduction potential for NOx. At an operating temperature of 350 °C the conversion of NOx to N 2 was 52 % under steady-state conditions, but the efficiency can be improved further by optimisation of the oxidising zeolite and of the mixing ratio of the two zeolites...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lean</b> {{logistics}} and <b>continuous</b> improvement methodologies, such as Six Sigma, are key {{subjects to}} reduce non added value activities and improve intrinsic {{processes in the}} supply chain of an organisation. The aim of this work is to identify the variables influencing the quality and performance of raw material supply process throughout a case study to propose improvements {{to reduce the number}} of process defects. To obtain better results and due to the problem complexity, a Six Sigma project was selected because of its organised structure for problem analysis and resolution. Using Six Sigma together with quality tools and lean principles helped the identification of the variables that influence the raw material supply process and the definition of the improvement actions for a more efficient and effective defect reduction. The implemented actions reduced the defects in 80 %, improving the customer service and increasing productivity in supermarket and repacking areas.

This project aims to {{optimize}} the use of financial, human, material and financial resources {{in the construction of}} Zona Centro Mall made by EDIFICAR company, applying the LEAN philosophy. A review of information pertaining to the company on planning and productivity aspects was performed. Also, the tools used by the company for control of these aspects were applied during the execution of this construction project. Last Planner tool is used for planning control and Activities Information System, work sampling and five minutes rating are used for productivity measurement and then a comparison between the results obtained through these techniques application is made. Also, an interview was done and it was focused on workers productivity during job time, in order to identify improvements in this aspect. Applying the techniques and tools mentioned in this work, in result, improvement opportunities were identified on construction processes. This paper concludes that using techniques of productivity measuring and tools for planning control is possible to build projects based on <b>LEAN</b> philosophy of <b>continuous</b> process improvement and resources optimization.
