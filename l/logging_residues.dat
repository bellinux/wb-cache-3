40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of bark- and wood-boring beetle pests, the {{extensive}} removal of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> is conducted in forests; however, this practice can lead to a loss of saproxylic insect diversity. Thus, finding a better pest management strategy is needed and requires additional information on the actual effects of various, differently treated <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> for pest multiplication. In the present study, a total of 2, 160 fragments of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> generated during final felling in a single stand in the Drahanská Highlands in the Czech Republic were examined for bark- and wood-boring beetles. The felling occurred on four dates in 2006 (in February, May, August and November). The <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> from each felling were left scattered on the clear-cut area or were gathered into piles. The fauna inhabiting the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> were investigated by peeling off the bark during {{the first six months of}} the vegetative period following the felling. The <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> hosted species-rich assemblages of bark- and wood-boring beetles (25 species were identified). Beetle occurrence was significantly affected by felling date, logging residue type (trunk fragment or branch and branch thinner or thicker than 1 cm), diameter and the manner in which the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> were deposited (freely scattered, top pile layer, or bottom pile layer). The Scots pine <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> were a substrate for the significant multiplication of several potentially significant pests (particularly, Pityogenes chalcographus [Linnaeus], Ips acuminatus [Gyllenhal] and Pityophthorus pityographus [Ratzeburg]).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how seasonal variations affect the quality of <b>logging</b> <b>residues.</b> The study was hosted by VIDA Energy. <b>Logging</b> <b>residues</b> can be processed and transported within different systems. Today the dominant systems are chipping at landing and bulk transportation of <b>logging</b> <b>residues.</b> In these systems the handling of the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> are carried out in the same manner up to the landings. Moisture content at the time of chipping is the primary quality parameter. Fine fractions of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> are strongly dependent on moisture content in storage. Another quality parameter is the natural ash content. What constitutes good fuel quality has no simple answers. Costumer’s requirements are often a determining factor. The heating stations have different prerequisites because the boilers and the systems of the heating stations are different. The quality of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> at the time for piling storage seems to determine the quality at chipping. Low moisture at the piling results in low moisture content at chipping.

The feedstock can however be variable depending on plant species and plant part component.

Although {{it is challenging to}} control compositional variability of a batch of feedstock, it is feasible to monitor this heterogeneity and make the necessary changes in process parameters. Such a system will be a first step towards optimization, quality assurance and cost-effectiveness of processes in the emerging biofuel/chemical industry. The objective of this study was therefore to qualitatively classify forest <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> made up of different plant parts using both near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) together with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Forest <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> harvested from several Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) plantations in Alabama, USA, were classified into three plant part components: clean wood, wood and bark and slash (i. e., limbs and foliage). Five-fold cross-validated linear discriminant functions had classification accuracies of over 96 % for both NIRS and FTIRS based models. An extra factor/principal component (PC) was however needed to achieve this in FTIRS modeling. Analysis of factor loadings of both NIR and FTIR spectra showed that, the statistically different amount of cellulose in the three plant part components of <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> contributed to their initial separation.

In this study, we collected and analyzed 10 years of corn stover data (2001 – 2010) and three years of forest <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> data (1995, 1999, and 2002) in each county in Mississippi to determine the potential of these feed stocks for sustainable CHP energy production.

40|$|Pressure {{to replace}} fossil fuels {{in order to}} reduce CO 2 {{emissions}} as well as the increased demand for energy have resulted in more intensive harvesting of forests. The current harvesting practice is to heap the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> rather than spread them on skid trails. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of modern harvesting techniques on soil fertility and site productivity. The decomposition of and nutrient release from <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> after clear-cutting has recently been investigated in Finland, but the nutrient dynamics of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> after thinning and especially in the residue heaps is less known. In this study the mass loss of and nutrient release from <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> were explored for three successive years after first thinning of a Scots pine stand in western Finland. The main objective was to identify the effects of heap structure on decomposition and nutrient dynamics. More specifically, the objectives were: 1) To examine how the position within the heaps affects the decomposition rate and nutrient dynamics of residue fractions. It was hypothesised that the decomposition and the release of nutrients are greater under the residue heaps than on top of the heaps and on the ground. 2) To identify temporal changes in decomposition and nutrient release over a 3 -year period. 3) To determine how much N, P, K, Ca and Mg are released from <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> during the first three years after first thinning. 4) To assess whether it is more beneficial for nutrient cycling to concentrate the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> in heaps or to spread them out from the standpoint of site fertility. 5) To assess the timing of harvest of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> in terms of their role in nutrient cycling of a stand. The decomposition of Scots pine needles, twigs and branches was determined by measuring the mass loss with the litterbag method. The experimental design was randomized blocks with nine treatments and six replicates. The treatments included three logging residue fractions and three locations of logging residue. The influence of logging residue type and locations of residue on mass and contents of nutrients remaining in litter bags over the entire 3 -year period were tested by repeated measures ANOVA. In total, 25 % of N, 53 % of P, 87 % of K, 42 % of Ca and 49 % of Mg were released from <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> in three years. The treatments in this study had no clear effects on the mass loss of <b>logging</b> <b>residues.</b> The hypothesis was confirmed only with needles, for which the mass loss and nutrient release was significantly faster under the heaps than on the ground and on top of the heaps. Treatments did not have a significant effect on the decomposition of twigs and branches. In the short-term, the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> were a minor source of N but a significant source of K. The results indicate that in the short-term <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> are insignificant for site productivity on sites where the availability of N limits productivity. On peatland sites, where the availability of K limits productivity, <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> may be significant on site productivity. However, in the long-term <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> may be an important source of organic matter and nutrients. Great proportion of nutrients was released from needles within the first year of decomposition. The rate of nutrient release from needles was slightly faster from the heaps than on the ground over the first year. If residues are collected for energy, heaping and removal after one year would result in more released nutrients than if they were spread on the ground throughout the harvested stand. In order to avoid possible soil nutrient depletion and negative effects on the growth of remaining trees, it can be preferable to leave residues in the stand after harvest and remove branches after the needles have been shed...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} systems for recovering, refining, and transporting <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> {{for use as}} fuel. Here we analyse costs, primary energy and CO 2 benefits of various systems for using <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> locally, nationally or internationally. The recovery systems we consider are a bundle system and a traditional chip system in a Nordic context. We also consider various transport modes and distances, refining the residues into pellets, and replacing different fossil fuels. Compressing of bundles entails costs, {{but the cost of}} chipping is greatly reduced if chipping is done on a large scale, providing an overall cost-effective system. The bundle system entails greater primary energy use, but its lower dry-matter losses mean that more biomass per hectare can be extracted from the harvest site. Thus, the potential replacement of fossil fuels per hectare of harvest area is greater with the bundle system than with the chip system. The fuel-cycle reduction of CO 2 emissions per harvest area when <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> replace fossil fuels depends more on the type of fossil fuel replaced, the <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> recovery system used and the refining of the residues, than on whether the residues are transported to local, national or international end-users.

A sensitivity analysis showed that the time was strongly dependent on the assumptions for extraction and combustion of natural gas. The LCA showed that from a single-stand perspective, harvesting <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> for bioenergy in the south of Sweden would give the highest temperature change mitigation potential per energy unit. However, the differences between the three climate zones studied per energy unit were relatively small.

For the chemical composition, constructed models generally did a better job of predicting the extractives and lignin content than the carbohydrates. In predicting the thermochemical properties, models for volatile matter and fixed carbon performed very well (i. e., R 2 > 0. 80, RPD > 2. 0).

Clear-cutting (<b>logging</b> <b>residue)</b> caused a decline in lichen biomass for some few years, but otherwise the age of the stand had no effect upon lichen biomass. Instead, a positive correlation was found between litter/logging residue and the mean height of lichens; in Kuusamo, <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> decreased significantly with the age of the stand. Grazing pressure in terms of fecal group density increased with the age of the stand. The preference of old forests came visible also as a lower mean height of lichens, which eliminates the possibility that the preference of old forests is associated only to the use of arboreal lichens. In Inari, grazing pressure sharply increased after the stand had reached the age of 100 years despite scarce litter/logging residue and fair lichen ranges in younger forests; there prevailed a negative correlation between stand density and grazing pressure. It has been suggested that there might be three main reasons for reindeers preferring old forests: 1) hardening of the snow (because of winds) on clear-cut areas, 2) <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> preventing digging for the food beneath the snow, and 3) poor visibility in young pine stands (Inari) which might increase predation risk...|$|R

40|$|During {{mechanised}} forest harvesting, extraction routes may be armoured with a dense {{carpet of}} <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> (slash roads) to reduce soil disturbance associated with heavy machinery. However, guidelines regarding {{the design of}} slash roads remain largely qualitative, and their efficacy {{as a means of}} ground protection uncertain. Trials were undertaken in north-east England and south-west Scotland to identify the main causes of slash road failure during repeated trafficking. Failure of the slash roads was defined as (a) deflection of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> and exposure of the ground surface to harvesting machinery or (b) mixing of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> with surface soils. The frequency of slash road failure was directly linked to terrain factors (soil water content, the presence of rocks, tree stumps, furrows and drain channels, or slope). In addition, failure was linked to the design of the slash roads where large diameter <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> were readily deflected, or at junctions and turning points where 'shearing' of the slash road took place. A simple means of assessing the potential for slash road failure is presented based on terrain characteristics.

We asked whether <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> and forest edges can protect ground-dwelling forest bryophytes from fatal microclimate events following clear-cutting. Location: Boreal forests of central Sweden. Methods: Using transplants of eight forest floor bryophyte species we experimentally analysed the sheltering effect (less solar radiation and less wind) of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> and forest edges in seven clear-cut areas. Transplants were placed in two contrasting positions in each area; near a north-facing forest edge and in {{the centre of the}} clear-cut area. In each position, half of the transplants were covered by a layer of spruce branches and the other half was left uncovered. We estimated proportion of apparently living shoots (apparent vitality) and measured radial growth of transplants during one growing season. Results: Position in the clear-cut area, but not cover of spruce branches, clearly influenced radial growth. Vitality scores were higher among transplants covered with branches and the lowest apparent vitality was observed in uncovered transplants in the middle of clear-cut areas. The change in area of apparently liv¬ing shoots {{during the course of the}} experiment (growth minus mortality) was unaffected by branch cover close to the edge but positively affected in the centre of the clear-cut area. In general, the effect of branch cover on bryophytes was higher in the centre of clear-cut areas. Here, climatic measurements showed that branch cover buffers during periods of extreme microclimates. Conclusions: Extraction of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> after clear-felling may reduce the survival of some ground-dwelling forest organisms. The additional sheltering provided by branches was unimportant close to forest edges. We suggest smaller clear-cut areas, green-tree retention and other ways to make logged areas shadier and less windy to mitigate the reduced shelter caused by harvest of <b>logging</b> <b>residues...</b>|$|E
40|$|Although using <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> for {{bioenergy}} {{is not a}} {{new issue}} for countries such as Sweden, Finland, Austria, Germany, etc. that are developed in terms of forestry, it is a new issue that requires studying for countries such as Turkey. This study investigates the views of forest engineers working in forest enterprises, researchers working in forestry research institutes and academicians working at universities concerning the use of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> for bioenergy that are not currently used in energy production. Within the framework of the study, a questionnaire was sent out to 181 forest engineers, 77 academic staff members and 29 research institute employees, a total of 287 respondents. According to the results of the study, <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> that are either left in the forest floor or collected by forest villagers for the purpose of fire wood have a favorable potential for energy and forestry if they are used in bioenergy production. Thus, the issue is substantial and of primary importance for Turkey. On the other hand, there are barriers in developing bioenergy sector and using <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> for this purpose. In order to remove these barriers, first of all, forestry administration should clarify its strategies and policies related to the issue...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of line intersect sampling in forestry is reviewed. Topics include {{the motivation for}} the method as originally conceived {{for the assessment of}} <b>logging</b> <b>residue,</b> the modifications that have been suggested and employed by various workers, the evaluation of performance including the determination of the variance of estimates so obtained, the handling of non-random orientation of pieces and the relationship of the method to other sampling techniques, in particular, angle-count (horizontal-point) sampling. The paper concludes with some general thoughts on the place and role of line intersect sampling. The Origin of Line Intersect Sampling Line intersect sampling has its roots in Buffon's (1777) needle problem. Although Canfield's (1941) extension of line transect sampling and Mate&quot;rn's (1964) method for estimating the total length of roads by means of a line survey contain something of the essence of line intersect sampling, the method as currently applied in forestry stems, primarily, from Warren and Olsen's (1964) development for the assessment of <b>logging</b> <b>residue.</b> As far as is known, it was these authors who first used the term &quot;line intersect sampling&quot;. Similar approaches have been used in other areas, for example the estimation o...|$|R
30|$|This {{obviously}} presents {{that the}} promotion of wood chip for effective utilization of <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> and sawmill waste is expected to create about 447.7 million JPY of total economic impact in Maniwa. It is nearly 1.7 times more than 269.5 million JPY of direct impact. These total economic impacts make up 0.2  % of 294, 916 million JPY of gross domestic products (GDP) in Maniwa. Moreover, 4, 381 JPY per employee of rising income can be expected through these economic impacts.|$|R
30|$|Recently, many Japanese {{local governments}} have started a new local project to promote biomass utilization. These {{projects}} aim to develop production and supply of biomass feedstock, and to build renewable energy system of their own region. Especially, woody biomass is produced from two specific sources: waste wood from sawmills, and <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> left in forest land. As a resource of renewable energy, woody biomass {{has the potential to}} reduce the region’s wood-related waste and to promote its utilization toward realizing a sound material cycle society.|$|R

The cost of recovering <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> was determined for skidding, yearding, loading, chipping and transporting the residues. Supply curves were developed for ten candidate conversion sites in the Pacific Northwest Region. Agricultural field residues were also quantified at the county level using five-year average crop yields. Agronomic constraints were applied {{to arrive at the}} volumes available for energy use. Collection costs and transportation costs were determined and supply curves generated for thirteen candidate conversion sites...|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{specific}} {{character and the}} significant biomass potential of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> (Hall and Jack 2009), few of these studies have concerned radiata pine. Hall (2000) described the rate of drying {{as well as the}} effect of storage on piled and comminuted <b>logging</b> <b>residues.</b> Exposed stem residue and branches dried quickly, but comminuted material dried little over the seven-month test period. A study by the New Zealand Clean Energy Centre (2009) used bins to collect <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> and dried them through three seasons. The residues were placed in a pile on bearers to encourage airflow, and treatments included unprocessed and processed, indoor and outdoor, as well as uncovered and covered. An important result was that summer drying could reduce moisture to 25 % (wet basis) and that the subsequent delivered cost of the dried residue at $ 3 /GJ, which includes the cost of drying, is lower than the delivered cost of raw material at $ 3.20 /GJ.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on the {{economic}} aspects of using dendromass (<b>logging</b> <b>residues)</b> for energy purposes {{in the production of}} energy chips. In defining economic factors, the paper employs as a basis actual manufacturing and sales data from 247 business cases in 2011 - 2012 at nine forest properties. The data reflect 44, 971 m 3 of harvested wood, 6671 tons of energy chips with a total energy content of 63. 92 TJ. The initial objective of the paper is to derive average and proportional variables using data from actual business cases and then use these to discover the limiting production values, particularly those of the purchase price and energy chips, as well as <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> and the limiting transport distance. The relationships derived are shown both mathematically and graphically. Results found in the paper are primarily designated for preproduction calculation by economic entities, the valuation of <b>logging</b> <b>residues</b> and as a basis for national policy regarding both forests and energy...|$|E
40|$|The biomass {{of forests}} {{is one of}} the oldest and most popular sources of {{renewable}} energy. Aside from round wood, <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> is also being used with increasing frequency to produce energy. Under European conditions, the most frequently implemented technology of using <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> is chipping, either directly at the cutting site or at the forest roadside. However, for over a dozen years now, with more and more success, solutions have been implemented which make it possible to compress the biomass into bundles. The aim of this study was to estimate the work efficiency of a John Deere 1490 bundler working in clear cuts with various degrees of material preparation. The structure of a working day, work productivity rates, as well as cost and energy consumption were determined for each of three variants. The effectiveness of using a bundler, expressed by the productivity achieved, depends largely on the extent the wood slash is prepared. When the slash is concentrated in rows or piles, the machine does not have to travel over the entire work area to gather scattered material, which increases work efficiency by about 25 to 30 %. The obtained values relevantly affected costs and the amounts of energy consumed...|$|R

The components of timber products and removals, obtained by application of these factors to the 1992 Utah timber harvest, are included. Additional findings, presented in table form, are the diameter distribution of trees removed from growing stock per thousand cubic ft of products and the volume of <b>logging</b> <b>residue</b> in pieces 6 ft and longer {{as a proportion of}} product volume.

40|$|Many {{analysis}} algorithms for high-dimensional {{remote sensing}} data {{require that the}} remotely sensed radiance spectra be transformed to approximate reflectance to allow comparison with a library of laboratory reflectance spectra. In maximum likelihood classification, however, the remotely sensed spectra are compared to training samples, thus a transformation to reflectance {{may or may not}} be helpful. The effect of several radiance-to-reflectance transformations on maximum likelihood classification accuracy is investigated in this paper. We show that the empirical line approach, LOWTRAN 7, flat-field correction, single spectrum method, and internal average reflectance are all non-singular affine transformations, and that non-singular affine transformations have no effect on discriminant analysis feature extraction and maximum likelihood classification accuracy. (An affine transformation is a linear transformation with an optional offset.) Since the Atmosphere Removal Program (ATREM) and the <b>log</b> <b>residue</b> method are not affine transformations, experiments with Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data were conducted to determine the effect of these transformations on maximum likelihood classification accuracy. The average classification accuracy of the data transformed by ATREM and the <b>log</b> <b>residue</b> method was slightly less than the accuracy of the original radiance data. Since the radiance-to-reflectance transformations allow direct comparison of remotely sensed spectra with laboratory reflectance spectra, they can be quite useful in labeling the training samples required by maximum likelihood classification, but these transformations have only a slight effect or no effect at all on discriminant analysis and maximum likelihood classification accuracy...|$|R
