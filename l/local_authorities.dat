5|$|Governance of {{the states}} is divided between the federal and the state governments, with {{different}} powers reserved for each, and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. Lower-level administration is carried out by <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by {{the federal and state}} governments to deal with certain tasks. The federal constitution puts <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government, although in practice the federal government has intervened in the affairs of state local governments. There are 144 <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> consisting of 11 city councils, 33 municipal councils, and 97 district councils.|$|E

Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E

5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> was {{invested}} in Icelandic banks.

Of all the <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. <b>Local</b> <b>authorities</b> were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
