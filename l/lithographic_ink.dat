50|$|At this time, high-contrast negatives {{were made}} using the wet plate {{collodion}} method (a solution of nitrocellulose in ether or acetone on glass). Once the negative had been made, {{a sheet of}} thin tracing paper was coated {{in a mixture of}} saturated potassium bichromate solution and gum water, and dried. This was then placed under the photographic negative and exposed to light for 2-3 minutes. The bichromate/gum mixture remained soluble on the parts of the tracing paper that were shielded from light by the opaque areas of the negative, allowing it to be removed, leaving an insoluble ‘positive’ image. This bichromate positive was then placed on a sheet of zinc covered in <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink,</b> and put through a printing press three or four times. After removal of the paper, the zinc plate was washed in a tray of hot water (containing a small amount of gum), using a camel-hair brush to remove all the soluble bichromate combined with ink. What remained on the zinc plate was a perfect representation in ink of the original composition, by virtue of the ink binding to the insoluble potassium bichromate.|$|E

Two (2) methods were chosen to test variables. The first was considered a traditional, practical method of binding book blocks which included selected test units that were later pulled from the block. The second method sought to simulate the adhesive bind condition through lamination of a test unit, hotmelt and an internally strong base paper. Although a quick test of this sort would be valuable from a production quality control viewpoint, further experimentation and analysis indentified this configuration as not being a valid predictor for the pagepull test, at this time. Based upon the results gathered from this investigation using a pagepull technique, the statement tying a quicksetting type <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink</b> to a loss of adhesion at the spine of an adhesive bound product can not be supported...|$|E
30|$|It bears special {{emphasis}} {{that all the}} novel colorants introduced into Japanese prints in the later nineteenth century were commonly used as inks in chromolithography [32, 36]. Chromolithography blossomed in the West in the later nineteenth century, abetted by the increased variety of color shades enabled by the early synthetic colorants [39]. While in {{the early history of}} chromolithography printers were accustomed to preparing their own inks, from 1860 on, factories specialized in the production of <b>lithographic</b> <b>inks</b> were established; by 1890 they were providing printers with ready-to-use inks both in Europe and USA [39].|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that among the various {{commercial}} names used for these three naphthol compounds, many contain the term ‘scarlet’, as reported in the Colour Index [11]. Sukaretto, the Japanese transliteration of ‘scarlet’, has been attested in an article published in 1890 on the newspaper Yomiuri shinbun, in which the author laments the drop in the quality of woodblock printing caused by the introduction of the new synthetic colorants [34]. In 1894 the same word is recorded by Koizumi Eijirō, who describes it as “a red dye made of naphthol (nafusōru), with truly many varieties, of which here are a few with their names and chemical formulas” [35]. Naphthol reds were also very common inks in the early phases of chromolithography (ca. 1890 – 1920) [36 – 38]. In <b>lithographic</b> <b>inks</b> the colorant is usually mixed with a ‘varnish’ and several additives to improve the overall quality of the material. The strong fluorescent background which characterizes the Raman spectra of the naphthol reds collected from the prints, {{as can be seen in}} Fig.  5 A-a and B-a, could be ascribed to the intrinsic complexity of the ink mixture [32, 36, 37]. Furthermore, the consistent detection of Ba in the XRF analysis in the area where naphthol red was detected by micro-Raman points to the use of barium white (BaSO 4), a common ingredient of <b>lithographic</b> <b>inks</b> as an extender or as a substrate of the lake pigment, as attested in the past [37]. Barium is most likely to be present as BaSO 4, used as extender, since the high sensitivity to water of the red areas points toward the use of the material as a free colorant instead of the lake pigment. The presence of the Raman peak of barite, at around 987  cm− 1, in some prints seems to confirm this hypothesis. Since barium white is an inexpensive pigment and produces inferior extenders, it was sometime used in cheaper grades of ink. It was also used in gloss white, a 25 % alumina hydrate— 75 % BaSO 4 mixture, which produces a semi-opaque extender [36].|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{emulsification}} process of <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink</b> and water was conducted to investigate methods for determining the water content of <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink</b> and water emulsions. Experiments using infra-red spectroscopy {{and analysis of the}} hydroxyl and carbonyl absorption bands revealed several variables which must be considered when attempting to use infra-red spectroscopic methods for the determination of the water content of ink emulsions. These factors include the choice of pigment, (either transparent or opaque), the type of cell medium, and methods for dispersing added water into an ink. The initial problem encountered was a lack of reproducibility when attempting to construct a calibration system. The carbonyl absorption band at 1745 cm^- 1 was shown to vary with each sample of emulsion. The intensity of the hydroxyl absorption band at 1645 cm^- 1 was discovered to be erratic between differing samples of ink and water emulsions. This resulted in hydroxyl contents which appeared to be inconsistent with known concentrations of water. The simulation of 2 ̆ 2 on-press 2 ̆ 2 emulsification, as it occurs in the lithographic process on an offset press, is a very important factor. The importance of added water attaining the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion is the prime criterion for valid and reproducible data obtained from infra-red spectroscopic analysis. This is accomplished by applying sufficient forces to generate an adequate rate of shear on the ink as added water is introduced into the emulsification process. The two modes of vibration of a water molecule were studied utilizing data obtained from infra-red spectra. The O-H stretching mode exhibited at 3400 cm^- 1 proved to be more sensitive to changes in water content of an ink than the bending mode exhibited at 1645 cm^- 1. Valid data used to construct a calibration system for water content determination of lithographic emulsions relies on the elimination of any moisture contamination of the cell medium used in the optics system of an infra-red spectrophotometer. Likewise, use of a transparent pigmented ink yields a continuous spectra. An opaque pigmented ink causes excessive light scattering resulting in off-scale deflections of absorption bands. Present methods of laboratory simulation of the emulsification of water into an ink were investigated to determine the optimum system which would yield stable ink and water emulsions in which the added water would assume the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion. Factors such as the rate of shear and time of dispersion were studied and found to significantly influence the formation of stable lithographic emulsions. Finally, the behavior of added water on the tack of an ink was also investigated. The tack values of a 2 ̆ 2 dry 2 ̆ 2 ink were closely monitored for extended periods of time. Immediate changes in tack were noted and recorded upon the addition of water. The addition of water to an ink in which the tack had apparently stabilized, effectively lowered the tack to the point where a homogeneous, stable emulsion was possible...|$|E
40|$|The Walker and Fetsko ink {{transfer}} {{equation is}} the most used ink transfer equation to predict the ink and paper behavior on the ink transfer step in the printing process. All previous {{studies have shown that}} this equation is mostly applicable in the three major printing processes, letterpress, lithography and gravure. A study by Schaeffer, Fisch and Zettlemoyer reported extensive measurements for several oil-base ink and paper combination over a range of proof-press printing conditions. Yuri Bery did a series of studies for modifying the Walker and Fetsko equation in gravure inks for Weyerhaeuser Company. All the studies showed that although generally the Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation can be applied to all three major printing processes, there are always some modifications needed for different rheological characteristics and printing conditions. The trends for the lithographic process is toward Web Offset printing. The components of Web Offset ink is quite different from conventional sheetfed <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink</b> in the pigment and vehicle used. This paper is {{to find out if the}} Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation can be also applied to the Web Offset ink. By investigating the effect of viscosity - one of the most important characteristics in rheology of ink - on the transfer parameters, the ink transfer mechanism model can be examined to see whether it is the same for oil base ink as for the heat-set Web Offset ink. The result of this experiment showed there is a significant different absorption behavior between coated paper and uncoated paper. This difference is effecting the applicability of the Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation in this particular type of ink and paper combination...|$|E
40|$|In offset lithography, ink {{has been}} shown to pickup {{significant}} quantities of fountain solution as emulsified droplets. Good printability of lithographic inks is dependent on the balance between the flow of ink and water (fountain solution). Water pickup of ink is directly related to emulsification capacity. Emulsification must be controlled by using the correct fountain solution and proper surface tension value of fountain solution. If inks do not properly emulsify, ink tack may vary on the press during printing. Ink tack is expected to strongly influence printability and runnability of offset lithographic inks. Tack measurement is used as a production control testing and for the assessment of paper surface strength. The purpose of this thesis was to determine the relationship between emulsification and tack of offset lithographic inks. This research studied the water pickup characteristics of ink using different fountain solution surface tension values and different fountain solution. To observe any differences due to ink vehicle, three different oil-based inks: conventional, soybean, and vegetable were used and studied [...] For increased understanding of the relationship between emulsification and tack, an inkometer was used to study the ink tack response of different emulsified inks and the inks before emulsify fountain solution into their bodies. The effect of added water on the rheological properties (tack response) of unemulsified <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink</b> was also studied. This study indicates a change in water pickup characteristics due to surface tension value of fountain solution and the various fountain solutions tested. There is a significant effect due to the various oil-based inks on water pickup of the ink. Tack response is considerably affected by the capacity of the ink to pickup water. Adding water into the ink greatly affects the tack value response. The tack of the ink will fall in value as water is emulsified into the ink...|$|E

40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{outstanding}} properties, epoxy resins {{are widely used}} in different industries and recently used in novel applications such as semiconductors and <b>lithographic</b> <b>inks.</b> Due to their low fracture toughness, Toughening of epoxy is widely discussed in literature during last decades. Many toughening agents including organic and inorganic materials are used to accomplish this purpose. The objectives of this research are to synthesize and use different toughening agents and study the influence of these modifiers on the mechanical and thermal properties {{in general and the}} fracture toughness in particular of the UV-cured cycloaliphatic epoxy resins. Particularly, we desired to improve the fracture toughness of modified epoxies cured via UV light without sacrificing their thermal and other mechanical properties. Polymeric molecules or ceramic nanoparticles have been introduced; (1) Hyperstar polymers based on hyperbranched polyester core with or without hydroxyl reactive groups in their arms (2) reactive core/shell polymeric nanoparticles prepared by seeded emulsion polymerization (3) reactive or nonreactive diblock copolymer prepared via ATRP and based on polyethylene oxide and (4) commercial alumina nanoparticles as inorganic particles. The effect of the addition of these toughening agents on the rate of UV-curing process and glass transition temperature, Tg, have been investigated. Subsequently, the morphology of the facture surfaces has been studied carefully using FE-SEM. The stress intensity factor, KIC, measurements which is an indicator for fracture toughness was evaluated in terms of single-edge-notch three-point-bending (SENB). Cationic UV-curing technique was utilized for the preparation of the modified epoxy composites. Specifically, the cationic photopolymerization of cycloaliphatic epoxy is known to proceed through nucleophilic attack of neutral monomer to oxonium cation, which is active chain end of the polymerization. The UV induced polymerization technique is a solvent free method occurring at room temperature which is eco-friendly. It is indeed a polymerization process used for industrial applications because of the high production rate and the low energy consumption compared to thermal processes. The rapid UV-curing process helps to maintain good dispersion of modified particles avoiding further aggregation that could occur during longer thermal treatmen...|$|R

40|$|Product end use {{dictates}} {{the materials}} used to produce a printed piece. If flexographic printers are purchasing ink for a packaging carton job, they don 2 ̆ 7 t choose a scuff prone ink. The same should be true for printers producing letterheads for subsequent use in electrophotographic equipment. Electrophotography is an image transfer process that uses the principles of electrostatics. An Ektaprint 200 copier/duplicator charges {{the surface of a}} sheet exposing an image area, develops that image, affixes toner to that image and then mechanically traps the toner {{to the surface of the}} substrate using heat and/or pressure. When a litho graphically printed letterhead is subject to the heat of a fuser roller, it can cause the ink to resoften and subsequently transfer to the next sheets passing through the copier, an undesirable effect. This experiment tested various ink/paper/drying combinations to determine whether or not specific print conditions affect the transfer of <b>lithographic</b> <b>ink</b> during electrophotographic imprinting. A test form was designed to include all the images typically printed on a letterhead. Each test sample was first printed under controlled conditions and then run through an Ektaprint 200 copier/duplicator. Visual assessment was used to evaluate test samples. The presence 2 or absence of image transfer determined whether or not the null 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis was rejected. A Wilcoxon sign test was used to determine whether or not a test sample could be evaluated. A level of. 05 significance was obtained in two cases. These samples were excluded from the results. Densitometric readings were taken to determine the severity of the lithographic image transfer. Various ink and paper characteristics were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Twenty-one print conditions exhibited no visual image transfer when processed in the Ektaprint 200.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the linear viscoelastic properties of copper phthalocyanine (CuPCN) dispersions {{that are used in}} the manufacturing of offset <b>lithographic</b> printing <b>inks.</b> Transmission electron microscopy shows that the primary pigment particles are rod-like and have sizes in the range of 10 to 300 nm. Steady shear measurements show that the dispersions are Newtonian at a pigment volume fraction of 0. 073 and become increasingly shear thinning as the pigment volume fraction is increased. The strong shear-thinning nature of these dispersions {{can be attributed to the}} highly flocculated nature of the dispersions, which is due to interparticle attractions. The structural complexity of the dispersions also results in an unexpected linear viscoelastic response. While at low frequencies (0. 1 and 1. 0 Hz) the ex tent of the linear region decreases with increasing pigment concentration, at a higher frequency (10 Hz) the extent of the linear region increases with increasing pigment concentration. This increase in the linear region with increasing pigment concentration suggests that at higher frequencies the dispersion is less brittle, and that the rheological behavior is dominated by intra-aggregate associations. In addition, frequency sweeps show that the dispersions behave like a viscoelastic liquid at low pigment concentrations. However, at higher pigment concentrations (yet significantly lower than the maximum packing fraction) the dispersions behave like a cross-linking polymer at its gel point...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the Walker and Fetsko ink {{transfer}} equation {{was used as}} an analytic tool to determine how the physical properties of the transfer surface change from printing on unprinted paper to overprinting on another wet ink film. The equation has three parameters, b, k, and f, which indicate {{what is happening in the}} nip of the press during the moment of impression. Parameter b represents the maximum absorptive capacity of the paper, parameter k is highly reflective of printing smoothness, and parameter f represents the fraction of free ink film which splits to the paper surface. The I. G. T. Printability Tester was used to simulate the wet-on-wet trapping which occurs on a <b>lithographic</b> press. Heatset <b>inks</b> and uncoated paper were used to conduct the testing. Application of the equation to the experimental data showed that the surface in wet-on-wet trapping is less absorbent, smoother, and increases the fraction of free ink film which splits to the paper in comparison to the surface of the unprinted paper. The first two observations are explained simply by considering that in wet-on-wet trapping the paper porosity and the low spots on the paper surface are filled by the first-down ink film. The third observation regarding parameter f is explained by considering a model in which the ink film cavities expand and the ink film ruptures more readily in areas of high vehicle concentration and low viscosity. In printing to the unprinted paper the vehicle drains more quickly into the paper than the pigment particles due to its lower viscosity and lower molecular weight. Thus there is a higher concentration of vehicle nearer the paper surface, causing the split to occur here. On the other hand, the surface in wet-on-wet trapping at the moment the second ink film is transferred is not very absorbent. Therefore, the vehicle does not drain that quickly into the surface, causing the viscosity of the ink film to be the same throughout, which tends to create a fifty percent split...|$|R
40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the <b>lithographic</b> printing process, <b>ink</b> is in direct contact with fountain solution, which can be acidic or alkaline. Fountain solution is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the non-image areas of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of ink with fountain solution creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of fountain solution droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, ink and acidic fountain solution, and ink and alkaline fountain solution. Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and tearing resistance. On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline fountain solution to the ink. The results of folding endurance and tearing resistance tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in tearing resistance was associated with alkaline fountain solution...|$|R
