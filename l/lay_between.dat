5|$|Barry Sound <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> {{the island}} and the mainland, {{sheltered}} from storms by {{the island and}} by Friar's point.|$|E
5|$|Females <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> {{three and}} seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay {{with their parents}} for another six months after fledging.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of an impending Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one hundred miles to the south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month, was also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city.|$|E

50|$|Residential {{properties}} are about evenly {{split between the}} North and South harbours, with the Waterfront (restaurants, bars, and shops) <b>laying</b> <b>between</b> them.|$|R
5|$|By the 7th century, England {{was almost}} entirely divided into kingdoms {{ruled by the}} Anglo-Saxons, {{who had come to}} Britain two hundred years earlier. The kingdom of Mercia {{occupied}} what is now the English Midlands. Neighbouring kingdoms included Northumbria to the north, East Anglia to the east, and Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south. Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, included London and <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> East Anglia and the kingdom of Kent. The earliest Mercian king for whom there is definite historical information is Penda of Mercia, Coenred's paternal grandfather.|$|E
5|$|During March {{and early}} April, the Marquess of Newcastle fought several delaying actions {{as he tried}} to prevent the Scots from {{crossing}} the River Tyne and surrounding the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Meanwhile, a Parliamentarian cavalry force under Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had been campaigning in Cheshire and Lancashire during the winter, crossed the Pennines and entered the West Riding of Yorkshire. To prevent Sir Thomas rejoining Lord Fairfax in Hull, Belasyse occupied the town of Selby which <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> them. On 11 April, Sir Thomas Fairfax's force, reinforced by infantry under Sir John Meldrum, stormed Selby, capturing Belasyse and most of his force.|$|E
5|$|During early December 1944, the American's {{defensive}} {{line in the}} Ardennes had a gap south of Losheimergraben. General Leonard T. Gerow, in command of V Corps, recognized this area as a possible avenue of attack by the Germans. This area, which <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> V Corps and Troy H. Middleton's VIII Corps, was undefended; just patrolled by jeep. The patrols {{in the northern part}} of the area were conducted by the 99th Infantry Division's 394th Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, whereas those in the south were conducted by the 18th Cavalry Squadron, 14th Cavalry Group, which was attached to the 106th Infantry Division.|$|E
50|$|This is an oviparous species, <b>laying</b> <b>between</b> 8 and 33 eggs {{in early}} summer. The young average 22 to 34 cm in length.|$|R
50|$|During reproduction, {{the female}} B. stumpffi <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> three and five eggs, which hatch between 60 and 70 days later, {{provided}} {{they are at}} a temperature of 23 C.|$|R
50|$|Like other cobras it is oviparous, <b>laying</b> <b>between</b> 47 and 60 eggs {{in early}} summer. Hatchlings average between 220 to 340 mm {{in length and}} are {{completely}} independent at birth.|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|F. Nelson Blount {{was killed}} when his private {{airplane}} hit a tree during an emergency landing, in Marlboro, New Hampshire, on August 31, 1967. By that time {{a good deal of}} Blount's collection was controlled by the Steamtown Foundation and had been relocated to Bellows Falls. Blount owned several corporations and one, the Green Mountain Railroad (GMRC), controlled the tracks that <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> Walpole, Bellows Falls and Chester, Vermont, which Steamtown was to use for its excursions. When Blount died most of the controlling stock of the GMRC was transferred {{to the president of the}} railroad, Robert Adams.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and to protect it from relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it <b>lay.</b> <b>Between</b> 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E
50|$|Thayer's kingsnakes are oviparous {{typically}} <b>laying</b> <b>between</b> 6-14 eggs up {{to twice}} per year. Like many other colubrids Thayer's kingsnakes usually mate {{in early spring}} following a winter cooling period.|$|R
50|$|Western Siberia or West Siberia (Западная Сибирь) {{is a part}} of {{the greater}} Siberia. It <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> the region of Ural and Yenisei River which conditionally divides Siberia into two halves.|$|R
50|$|The female spider <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> 600 to 800 eggs in {{her life}} span of 2 to 3 months. The eggs of A. catenulata are {{contained}} in a light brown cocoon which hangs on the web.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November 1757 the Prussian camp <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> Rossbach {{on the left and}} the village of Bedra on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, {{commanding}} the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire's forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank near the town of Branderoda and their left at Mücheln. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.|$|E
5|$|Once {{males and}} females are both sexually mature, mating is spread over a few weeks. Insects are active when {{temperature}} reaches 20°C; temperatures above 25°C are very favorable to their activity in the field whereas colder temperatures below 15°C and wet weather limit insect mobility. Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of faba beans. Rain, wind and temperatures below 20°C put on hold the oviposition process. Eggs are laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. Eggs are small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.|$|E
5|$|Several {{villages of}} Christian Delawares <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> the combatants on the Sandusky River and the Americans at Fort Pitt. The villages were {{administered}} by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although pacifists, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept American officials at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In September 1781, to prevent further communication between the missionaries and the American military, hostile Wyandots and Delawares from Sandusky forcibly removed the missionaries and their converts to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.|$|E
50|$|The nest is a bare scrape on taiga, meadow, {{and similar}} habitats. Each curlew <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> 3 and 6 eggs in April or May and incubates them {{for about a}} month until they begin to hatch.|$|R
50|$|The Oriental stork is {{a solitary}} bird except during the {{breeding}} season. Its diet consists mainly of fish, frogs, insects, small birds and reptiles, {{as well as}} rodents. The female usually <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> two and six eggs.|$|R
50|$|This species breeds in {{colonies in}} marshes and islands from {{southern}} Russia to Mongolia. It is migratory, wintering {{in the eastern}} Mediterranean, Arabia and India. This gull nests on the ground, <b>laying</b> <b>between</b> two and four eggs.|$|R
5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset of the wet season; in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of the wet season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> November and April, birds in western Cameroon <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May. In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough now {{requested}} Eugene {{to release}} Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating {{the high degree}} of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals. Although the Nebel stream <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry. Fugger's cuirassiers charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder. With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.|$|E
50|$|Indian cobras are oviparous and <b>lay</b> {{their eggs}} <b>between</b> {{the months of}} April and July. The female snake usually <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> 10 and 30 eggs in rat holes or termite mounds and the eggs hatch 48 to 69 days later. The {{hatchlings}} measure between 20 and 30 cm in length. The hatchlings are independent from birth and have fully functional venom glands.|$|R
50|$|The {{mating season}} of the Great Plains skink is in April or May. The female <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> 5 and 32 eggs (on the average about 12) in early summer, which she guards until they hatch in late summer.|$|R
50|$|Brown falcons breed from June to November, {{usually in}} an old nest of another hawk species; they {{occasionally}} nest in hollow limbs of trees. The brown falcon <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> two and five eggs that have red and brown spots and blotches.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} {{all-time record}} at Lerkendal {{is the final}} game of the 1985 season, when Rosenborg won the league in the last game against Lillestrøm in a league final which attracted 28,569. Starting with Rosenborg's success in the late 1980s, attendance rose and <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> eleven and thirteen thousand until 2001. After the opening of the new stadium in 2002, attendance again rose, peaking at an average 19,903 in 2007, although it has fallen somewhat since. The high of most seasons is the 16 May game held every year: the 1994 edition against Tromsø saw 27,661 spectators, and in 1985 as many as 30,000 may have seen the game, as the gates were opened. Since the opening of the current stadium, the attendance record is 22,330, set in the 2006 edition against Odd Grenland. Between 1995 and 2007, Rosenborg played 11 seasons and 37 home matches in UEFA Champions League. The venue has been used for numerous concerts, including A-ha, Iron Maiden and Kiss.|$|E
5|$|A broad swathe {{of western}} Chiapas {{was held by}} the Zoques, {{covering}} the Depresión Central, the middle Grijalva basin, the Chimalapas {{and parts of the}} Pacific coastline. The main Zoque settlements in the Depresión Central were Copainalá, Mezcalapa, Quechula and Tecapatán. Their settlements on the western side of the Grijalva River included Citalapa, Jiquipilas, Ocozocuautla and the Corzos valley. Coyatocmó was a small Zoque settlement that grew into the modern state capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The Aztecs exacted tribute from the Zoques, and dominated trade routes running through their territory. In pre-Columbian times, the Depresión Central featured two of the largest cities in the region, Chiapa and Copanaguastla. The area around Chiapa de Corzo was occupied by the Chiapanecas, whose ethnicity and language are unknown. The Chiapanecas were militarily powerful before the Spanish conquest; they had forced a number of important Zoque settlements to pay them tribute, and had successfully resisted being incorporated into the Aztec Empire. The Chiapaneca territory <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> the territories of the Zoques and the Tzotzil Maya, in the upper and middle Grijalva basin; their main settlements were Acala, Chiapa, Ostuta, Pochutla and Suchiapa.|$|E
5|$|Aoki {{ultimately}} produced Chrono Trigger, while director credits were {{attributed to}} Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era. Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs. Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development. The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style. Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi {{was responsible for the}} game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas. Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists. Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game's lighting. Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice <b>lay</b> <b>between</b> that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series. Features originally intended to be used in Secret of Mana or Final Fantasy IV, also under development at the same time, were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team.|$|E
50|$|It feeds {{largely on}} soft figs. The broadbill's feeding habits helps to {{distribute}} {{the seeds of the}} fig around the forest floor. The female usually <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> two and three whitish eggs, and the young fledge after twenty-two to twenty-three days.|$|R
50|$|Monteiro's {{storm petrel}} {{is known to}} breed on only two islets in the Azores. Like in all Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid and is {{incubated}} by both parents. <b>Laying</b> occurs <b>between</b> late April and early July (in contrast to the band-rumped storm petrel, which on these islands <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> October and December). The earliest chicks hatch in June and the last chicks fledge by October. The young {{will return to the}} colony from 2 years old onwards.|$|R
30|$|The actuarially neutral size of IUAs depends only on F, the {{percentage}} {{increase in the}} job finding rate during the self-financeable stage of the unemployment spell. It is not a function of job creation or termination rates, and therefore, {{it is not a}} function of average duration of employment or unemployment, nor is it a function of the level of benefits, and therefore, it is not a function of the risk-pooling UI actuarially fair contribution rate. Simply, if F <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> 20 and 40 %, the actuarially neutral X <b>lays</b> <b>between</b> 17 and 29 %. If F goes to infinity, i.e., everybody finds a job immediately after losing a job, the actuarially neutral X is 100 %.|$|R
