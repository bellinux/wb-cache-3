40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of the properties of wood fibres leather shavings composite board by using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate data analysis. In this study fibreboards were manufactured with different leather amounts by using spruce fibres, as well as vegetable and mineral tanned leather shavings (wet white and wet blue). The NIR spectroscopy was used to analyse the raw materials {{as well as the}} wood <b>leather</b> <b>fibreboards.</b> Moreover, the physical and mechanical features of the wood <b>leather</b> composite <b>fibreboards</b> were determined to characterize their properties for the further data analysis. The NIR spectra were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. These results demonstrate the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy to estimate the physical and mechanical properties (e. g., bending strength). This phenomenon provides a possibility for quality assurance systems by using the NIRS...|$|R

40|$|The rate of {{production}} of oil and turpentine in the effluent from the plug screw feeder {{at the exit from}} the presteamer of a fibreboard pilot plant was determined after a steady state of operation had been reached. From these data, the recovery of turpentine from the plug screw feeder effluent, as a proportion of that available in the wood chips, was shown to be 27 %. Turpentine levels in wood of Pinus radiata D. Don were determined and compared with previous data, along with causes of variations in these data. The presteamer plug screw feeder effluent from a medium-density <b>fibreboard</b> <b>production</b> line appears to be a useful source of turpentine...|$|R
40|$|Wood, a {{material}} with high value and useful, {{is used in}} many areas. Therefore, wood based waste has a high ratio in total waste in terms of quantity and variety. Increasing demand on the raw material parallel {{to the rise of}} wood usage area has cause to decrease in the forest area of the world. Therefore, raw material for wood panel industries is being more serious problem. When the contribution in environment is taken into consideration, recycling researches of wood wastes among the raw materials alternatives for particleboard and <b>fibreboard</b> <b>production</b> is attracted attention. It is generally agreed that the landfill of wood waste materials is not the best option both from a socio-political and environmental viewpoint. This is the primary reasoning behind countries introducing a landfill tax to discourage this option. This study was focused on the studies related to the recycling methods towards the usage of wood based waste materials in panel production sector to resolve environmental and raw material problems...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technology}} and pilot plant for production and preparation of hemp fibre has been developed, {{along with its}} application in <b>fibreboard</b> <b>production.</b> The raw material is obtained through anaerobic storage of wet harvested and chopped whole hemp plants. Similar to wood fibre processing, the raw material goes through an extruder mill, refiner and dryer. Further steps are binder application, fleece forming and hot pressing into the final shape. A new production line offers an income alternative for agricultural producers and ecological diversification of crops. Fibreboard as well as three-dimensional pressed parts could be applied in the furniture, automotive and construction industries. The end products are competitive to conventional ones qualitatively, economically and ecologically. They are high quality due to the great strength of the plant fibre compared to conventional wood fibre. Also the other included plant parts such as leaves, flowers etc. contain their own natural juices, materials and bonding properties, which contribute to higher strength and water resistance. The mixing of the fibrous material with binder is optimized, so that binder quantity is reduced and its distribution improved. Natural binders such as starch, sugar, cellulose, plant oils and proteins wer...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fibreboard</b> <b>production</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} industrial activities in Galicia (Spain). Great amounts of wastewater are generated, with properties depending on the type of wood, treatment process, final product and water reusing, among others. These effluents are characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand, low pH and nutrients limitation. Although anaerobic digestion {{is one of the}} most suitable processes for the treatment, lately bioplastics production (mainly polyhydroxyalkanoates) from wastewaters with mixed cultures is being evaluated. Substrate requirements for these processes consist of high organic matter content and low nutrient concentration. Therefore, wood mill effluents could be a suitable feedstock. In this work, the possibility of producing bioplastics from to wood mill effluents is evaluated. First, wood mill effluent was converted to volatile fatty acids in an acidogenic reactor operated at two different hydraulic retention times of 1 and 1. 5 d. The acidification percentage obtained was 37 % and 42 %, respectively. Then, aerobic batch assays were performed using fermented wood mill effluents obtained at different hydraulic retention times. Assays were developed using different cultures as inoculums. The maximum storage yield of 0. 57 Cmmol/Cmmol was obtained when when the culture was enriched on a synthetic media...|$|R
30|$|Carbon dioxide is {{the main}} {{contributor}} to GWP, with 27.61  kg CO 2 for MHM and 78.93  kg CO 2 for the brick wall. The main sources of non-biotic carbon are fossil fuel combustion in industrial processes and in electricity production. Compared to fossil carbon, biogenic carbon is emitted in minor quantity. Biogenic carbon dioxide emitted from brick wall production is lower (1.85  kg CO 2) than that of MHM wall since no wood biomass is involved in its production, while MHM biogenic CO 2 (4.95  kg CO 2) is mainly related to the <b>fibreboards</b> <b>production.</b> The method of evaluation of the biogenic emissions is still object of discussion at international level. Based on international standards and guidelines, the biogenic carbon dioxide is not accounted in LCA studies (carbon neutrality assumption) or is reported separately [45]. In this work the second option has been chosen. Methane has a GWP of 28 for a time horizon of 100  years [46] and is indeed the third highest greenhouse gas that is produced from both MHM (1.99  kg) and brick wall building systems (4.64  kg). Methane emissions for the brick wall are mainly caused by brick and polystyrene slabs production, while for MHM the main methane emitting processes are electricity from non-renewable sources and aluminium manufacturing. The amount of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) emissions contributing to GWP derive from industrial activities and combustion and are comparable between the two processes. On the other hand, halogenated gases [chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs)] emissions are higher for MHM because of the aluminium manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|At the end {{of their}} service life, wood-based panels become {{eventually}} waste wood. Deploying in landfills is no longer considered as an acceptable solution for their handling due to the high organic load included. The recycling of this waste to be employed as raw material for the wood panel industry, which traditionally makes use of wood processing residues, has hence gained more importance and been examined from earlier times. Technical problems and the lack of enforcing legislative regulations have delayed, however, the industrial implementation of the new technologies proposed. Recent research efforts enabled {{the development of a new}} process for the recycling of end-use wood panels into new marketable fibreboards. This patent pending process is based on the refiner technique and allows the use of mixtures of fresh wood and waste panel chips as a raw material for dry-process <b>fibreboard</b> <b>production.</b> The process is applicable in existing fibreboard plants with only minor operation modifications and therefore, there is no need of major capital investment in additional equipment to effect the recycling. At the refining stage, chemical agents are employed and the process enables the use of significant amounts of waste material replacing over 20 % of the wood feed and providing significant savings. The aim of the present work was to validate the industrial applicability of the new process in the recycling of waste medium-density fibreboards. The new fibreboards obtained during the industrial scale tests were of acceptable quality, and the testing results revealed that under conventional gluing and pressing conditions, the process effectively recycles the waste boards into new ones at least at 25 % wood substitution level. Further validation and optimisation work is underway in the direction of using other waste panel types and also increasing the level of waste in the feed material...|$|R
30|$|To {{further reduce}} the {{environmental}} impact of MHM, the main areas of improvement can be identified in the log processing, fibreboards manufacturing, and aluminium nails manufacturing for GWP and POCP. The energy production for the final assembling of the wall also caused a remarkable share of emissions. ODP was influenced by the emissions from the sawmill and from <b>fibreboard</b> and electricity <b>production.</b> Interventions on the aluminium nails production would also be critical in the reduction of the impact on HTP.|$|R

40|$|Composite wood {{products}} based on Pinus radiata D. Don fibre {{have been made}} in New Zealand since the 1940 s when a wet-process fibreboard plant was established in Auckland. Medium-density <b>fibreboard</b> (MDF) <b>production</b> began in New Zealand in 1976 and the total capacity of the New Zealand MDF industry is now 465, 000 m 3 per annum or about 6 % of worldwide capacity. In 1987 production began of a totally new type of board in which MDF surface layers are combined with a strandboard core in a steam-pressing operation. Two areas of research in progress at the New Zealand Forest Research Institute (FRI) are aimed at adding value to composites such as MDF. Firstly, research on dimensional stabilisation of MDF focuses on in-line chemical treatments of fibre. Secondly, the vapour boron treatment developed jointly by FRI and Imperial College of the University of London has the potential to improve the fungal, insect, and fire resistance properties of fibre-based composites...|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy was {{combined with}} multivariate data analysis {{to investigate the}} chemical changes in wood during particle- and medium density <b>fibreboard</b> (MDF) <b>production</b> of grand fir (Abies grandis [Douglas ex D. Don] Lindl.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The mechanical and technological properties of the novel particle- and fibreboards from beech or grand fir wood {{were similar to those}} of conventional panels from pine and spruce. This indicates that these timbers can be used as resources for wood-based panel production. Principal component analysis of FTIR spectra differentiated wood, fibres, particles, MDF, and particleboards of both species in the whole production process. Modifications in the spectra of fibres and particles suggested that cellulose properties of wood were changed during mechanical pulping. Wet chemical analysis confirmed that the furfural content was lower in fibres and higher MDF boards than in wood. Different binders and hydrophobic additives were clearly traceable and discernable in wood composites. Samples from the same production step were clustered together, indicating high homogeneity of the raw materials, and intermediate and final products, respectively. This suggests that FTIR spectroscopy in combination with cluster analysis is a useful tool to assess product quality and can be further developed to control and optimize production processes for innovative wood-based panels...|$|R
40|$|The flow of wood fibres {{suspended}} in gas {{plays a major}} role in the MDF (Medium Density <b>Fibreboard)</b> <b>production</b> process. Development of machinery in this industry has traditionally been based on experience. Only recently has the use of numerical methods such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) become an important part of the development process. The ratio between fibre and gas density is large in fibre-gas suspensions. There are large separation effects, which make it necessary to treat the flow of fibre-gas suspensions as multiphase flows. The measurement of concentration is important in multiphase flow. For single phase flows, measurements of pressure and velocity generally provide sufficient information about the flow field but, for multiphase flows, the volume fraction is also an important part of the flow field. In the present work, a method for simultaneous measurement of the concentration and velocity of wood fibres {{suspended in}} air was developed. The velocity was measured using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) and the images obtained with the PIV equipment were used as input data for the concentration measurement. The concentration was evaluated using an image processing procedure, where the area fraction of fibres in each image was evaluated. The area fraction was subsequently converted to volume fraction using a mathematical relationship based on the assumption of isotropic fibre orientation. Good results were obtained for low concentrations of wood fibres; for higher concentrations, however, the measured volume fraction was too low. The use of a standard two-fluid model to describe the flow of fibres suspended in gas was evaluated. The drag force acting on the fibres was modelled using a drag model capable of predicting the drag on fine filaments orientated at different angles to the air stream. Turbulent dispersion of the fibres was modelled using a dispersion force. There were large discrepancies between simulations and experiments, especially for volume fraction. The discrepancies were attributed to real physical effects not included in the two-fluid model that was used. It is argued that the lift forces acting on the individual fibres due to their orientation and shape have a significant effect on the dispersion of the fibres in the air flow. When a dispersion force approach, based on gradient diffusion, was used to model the effect of lift forces on fibre dispersion, the agreement between model and measurement data improved significantly. Fibres in flows have a tendency to flocculate. The mathematical models used in this work to describe the flow of wood fibres suspended in gas are only valid when the fibres are free to move relative to each other. In order to establish the limiting conditions for the models to be valid, the flow regimes of air-wood suspensions were mapped for a variety of concentrations and Reynolds numbers...|$|R
50|$|The wood is soft, white {{when first}} cut, turning to pale red; the knots are attractively mottled. The timber {{is not used}} where {{strength}} is required in the construction industry, but is used for paper-making, the manufacture of <b>fibreboard</b> and the <b>production</b> of energy. Under water the wood is very durable and is used for deep foundations of buildings. The piles beneath the Rialto in Venice, and the foundations of several medieval cathedrals are made of alder. The Roman architect Vitruvius mentioned that the timber {{was used in the}} construction of the causeways across the Ravenna marshes. The wood is used in joinery, both as solid timber and as veneer, where its grain and colour are appreciated, and it takes dye well. As the wood is soft, flexible and somewhat light, it can be easily worked as well as split. It is valued in turnery and carving, in making furniture, window frames, clogs, toys, blocks, pencils and bowls.|$|R
