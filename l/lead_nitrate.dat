40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} done to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>lead</b> <b>nitrate</b> and mercury chloride in testis tissues of Wistar rats. <b>Lead</b> <b>nitrate</b> and mercury chloride are widely used heavy metals in industry. Oral lead and mercury administrations to adult male rats at doses 45 mg/kg bw and 0. 02 mg/kg bw, respectively for 4 weeks caused a significant increasing in MDA levels and antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx and GST). The MDA levels and acivities of antioxidant enzymes was lower in rats that were administrated by <b>lead</b> <b>nitrate</b> than mercury chloride treated group. Light microscopic analyses revealed that <b>lead</b> <b>nitrate</b> and mercury chloride induced numerous histopathological changes in testis tissues of rats. Histopathological observations of the testis tissues showed that mercury chloride caused more harmful effects than <b>lead</b> <b>nitrate,</b> too. The results indicate that <b>lead</b> <b>nitrate</b> and mercury chloride have reproductive toxicity, in male rats at the tested doses. The effect which we observed applying the <b>lead</b> <b>nitrate</b> and mercury chloride together, was more greater than when we used them alone...|$|E
40|$|Interdiffusion {{coefficients}} of <b>lead</b> (II) <b>nitrate</b> {{in water and}} in nitric acid (10 - 5 - 10 - 2 M) mixtures at 298. 15 K, and at concentrations from 0. 001 to 0. 1 M, have been measured using a conductimetric cell and an automatic apparatus to follow diffusion. The cell uses an open-ended capillary method and a conductimetric technique is used to follow the diffusion process by measuring the resistance of a solution inside the capillaries, at recorded times. The diffusion of <b>lead</b> (II) <b>nitrate</b> is clearly affected {{by the presence of}} HNO 3 {{as well as by the}} lead (II) hydrolysis. At the highest HNO 3 concentration (0. 01 M) the effect of the hydrogen ions on the whole diffusion process has an important and main role, whilst at the highest Pb(II) concentration the presence of HNO 3 as well as the hydrolysis can be neglected. These values are supported by UV-spectroscopy as well as by pH measurements. The experimental interdiffusion coefficients are discussed on the basis of the Onsager-Fuoss model. [URL]...|$|R
