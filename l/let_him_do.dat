25|$|Howard and Harold are {{the adoptive}} fathers of Clyde McBride, {{who is a}} main {{character}} and the best friend of protagonist Lincoln Loud. They shower Clyde with attention and rarely <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> anything unsupervised. Howard is sensitive and neurotic, often getting over-emotional while watching Clyde grow up. Harold's parenting style contrasts with Howard's; he is calm, collected, and concerned with Clyde's safety and health above everything else. The McBrides serve as foils to Lincoln's less worrisome parents.|$|E

25|$|In {{one scene}} Hassan is {{attacked}} {{and it is}} suggested that he is raped. The filmmakers wanted Ahmad to take off his pants for the shooting, but his father refused to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> that. The boy has said that he would never have taken the role had he known Hassan would be raped. Reports vary on whether he and his family were properly informed in advance. The scene has now been depicted in a less harrowing manner than originally planned, and there is no nudity in it. Nevertheless, a body double was used to show the boy's pants being tugged slightly down.|$|E

He starts seeing Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), but the relationship stalls when Kathy returns briefly in 1999 and sleeps with Grant. Before Kathy returns to South Africa, she asks Phil {{to go with her}} but he declines as Grant has planned an armed robbery and Phil refuses to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> the job alone. Infuriated by Phil's loyalty to Grant, Kathy reveals their recent tryst, leading to Phil confronting Grant and Grant's confession that he slept with Kathy as revenge for Phil's affair with Sharon. While trying to escape, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots at the dashboard, causing Grant to crash into the River Thames. Phil is rescued and Grant escapes to Brazil. When Grant sends Phil the deeds for his half of The Queen Victoria, he sells it to Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5 to spite Peggy due to her favouritism towards Grant.|$|E

25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I {{think it might be}} barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really see what he can do as an actor, and this is a character that would <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, West sparked {{controversy}} by {{criticizing the}} slow pace of the recently completed series between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, which he called [...] "pathetic and embarrassing." [...] Red Sox manager Terry Francona referred to the remarks as [...] "troubling", while Yankees closer Mariano Rivera remarked, [...] "If he has places to go, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> something else." [...] Columnist Wallace Matthews defended West, saying the umpire was simply expressing what people had been thinking for a long time. West was not fined by MLB for his comments, but was [...] "admonished firmly," [...] according to press reports. On May 26, 2010, West made two controversial balk calls on Mark Buehrle and consequently ejected White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén for arguing and Buehrle for throwing his glove. On August 26, 2010, West was the plate umpire for Albert Pujols’ 400th career home run.|$|E

500|$|Israel {{attempted}} to assassinate Arafat {{on a number}} of occasions, but has never used its own agents, preferring instead to [...] "turn" [...] Palestinians close to the intended target, usually using blackmail. According to Alan Hart, the Mossad's specialty is poison. According to Abu Iyad, two attempts were made on Arafat's life by the Israeli Mossad and the Military Directorate in 1970. In 1976, Abu Sa'ed, a Palestinian agent working for the Mossad, was enlisted in a plot to put poison pellets that looked like grains of rice in Arafat's food. Abu Iyad explains that Abu Sa'ed confessed after he received the order to go ahead, explaining that he was unable to go through with the plot because, [...] "He was first of all a Palestinian and his conscience wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Arafat claimed in a 1988 interview with Time that because of his fear of assassination by the Israelis, he never slept in the same place two nights in a row.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his fight}} with Vargas, Trinidad moved up in weight – {{this time to}} {{participate}} in Don King's middleweight unification tournament featuring IBF champion Bernard Hopkins, WBA champion William Joppy, and WBC champion Keith Holmes. Trinidad was matched with Joppy, whom he defeated by technical knockout in the fifth round of a contest that took place on May 12, 2001. Joppy opened the first round on the offensive, but late in the round Trinidad scored a knockdown {{with a combination of}} punches that came close to throwing Joppy underneath the ropes. Trinidad subsequently scored a knockdown in the fourth round, during this stage of the competition he was using combinations of left hooks and right punches to the head. In the fifth round Trinidad scored another knockdown, Joppy attempted to continue the fight, but while he was using the ropes to help him stand, the referee stopped the fight. When the contest was over, Trinidad explained his strategy by stating: [...] "I knew he wanted to impose his will, his weight, and I wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> it".|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do,</b> I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeff Pinkner {{decided he}} wanted fellow executive producer David H. Goodman and supervising producer J. R. Orci to collaborate in writing the episode; Goodman wrote the first half, while Orci wrote {{the rest of the}} episode. The two later worked together on only one other episode, [...] "The Equation". Frederick E. O. Toye directed the episode, as he had worked previously with the writers on Alias. The writers had the idea {{for a couple of weeks}} of Olivia walking into an apartment and discovering walls covered with drawings of events that [...] "no man could possibly have known about". They wanted to take [...] "urban myths or legends of strange events" [...] and come up with a fringe science equivalent; this led them to creating the story of Roy, a man with seemingly [...] "psychic" [...] abilities, which they then expanded by offering a real scientific explanation in the form of Walter's past research. In the show's early development, the producers were also unsure about how other aspects should be developed, such as Joshua Jackson's character Peter. For instance, in [...] "The Ghost Network", they debated whether or not Peter would break into his childhood home before finally [...] "stalling and just <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> it"; Orci came up with Peter's explanation to Olivia, that he used to live there so it wasn't really breaking in.|$|E
500|$|When Andy Schatz {{pitched the}} game to Microsoft Game Studios, it was turned down. Schatz responded saying [...] "they were crazy" [...] {{and asked if he}} could repitch the game; they agreed to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> so. He {{continued}} to work on Monaco for roughly a year in order [...] "to make it something really marketable". When he pitched it to Microsoft Game Studios for the second time, it was turned down. After these events, Schatz got the impression that the game {{was not going to be}} released on the Xbox 360. [...] "That really bummed me out", Schatz said in an interview with Mike Rose from Gamasutra, [...] "because I felt like the Xbox was the ideal platform for this particular game, because of the prevalence of headsets, the marketplace being strong, and the Xbox being the easiest console to work with. And of course the game was written in XNA, so it was a no-brainer". [...] Empty Clip Studios was brought onto the project in order to port {{the game to}} the RapidFire engine, so that the game could be release on the PlayStation 3, but the port was never finished. In order to publish the game on Xbox Live, Schatz partnered with video game publishing company Majesco Entertainment. As a result, the game had to be ported from Empty Clip to the RapidFire engine. Valve Corporation approached Schatz and offered to get the game on the Steam store distribution platform.|$|E
