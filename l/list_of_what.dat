500|$|Ibn Hazm, an Andalusian Muslim scholar, {{explicitly}} accused Ezra {{of being}} a liar and a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text.

In response to attacks on the personality of Ezra, the Byzantine Emperor Leo III defended Ezra as a pious, reliable person. The Jewish convert to Islam al-Samaw'al (d. 1175) accused Ezra of interpolating stories such as Gen. 19:30-8 in the Bible in order to sully David’s origins and to prevent {{the rule of the}} Davidic dynasty during the second Temple.|$|E

Kirkpatrick arranged for everything to be shipped direct to Tinian rather than via Guam, as was usual.|$|E

[...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E

Vogue credits the actress for her [...] "sophisticated, perfectly put-together looks", writing that [...] "her charisma, both on-screen and off-, has charmed many." [...] In 2009, she featured in AskMen's Top 99 Women, FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World, and Maxim magazine's Hot 100; the latter also placed her on the list on three other occasions2010, 2011, and 2014.

500|$|All of {{the stories}} within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first-person {{narrative}} {{from the point of}} view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices, such as [...] "a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent." [...] It suggests that, in contrast, [...] Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of [...] "official incompetence and aristocratic privilege". The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were [...] "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" [...] (as his favourite), [...] "The Red-Headed League" [...] (second), [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia" [...] (fifth) and [...] "The Five Orange Pips" [...] (seventh). The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged [...] "occultism", but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{argued that}} the album was their most {{consistent}} and strongest album to date. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone felt that the album was [...] "experimental and expansive". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt that the album lacked [...] "freshness or spontaneity" [...] that {{was found in the}} band's debut album, calling only two songs on the album [...] "very visionary". Jim Farber of the Daily News criticized Williams, saying [...] "Even aided by studio correction, the guy can't sing", calling it [...] "bad singing at its engaging best". Cohen of Pitchfork Media bashed the lyrics, saying that the writing was [...] "far down the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> N.E.R.D. is actually good at". Hoard of Rolling Stone felt he learned nothing from the lyrics except that Williams was sexually aroused. Henriques of PopMatters noted that Williams is not a [...] "technically gifted rapper", he [...] "does not have a beautiful voice" [...] and his lyrics are [...] "typically inconsequential in a 'saying shit just to sound cool' sort of way", but found strengths in his choruses, which he pointed out [...] "typically use a catchy phrase or recognizable melody as an anchor for his nonsensical verses". Dan Charnas of The Washington Post commended N.E.R.D for their songwriting, writing that Seeing Sounds [...] "combines the adolescent and clever". The Times writer Priya Elan gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that band is [...] "pushing the boundaries of the popular song". [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention (...) and stated, [...] "Beats of course, songs usually, singing barely--especially sincere-type singing"; he also picked out two songs from the album: [...] "Anti-Matter" [...] and [...] "Everyone Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)".|$|E
2500|$|British {{journalist}} Bryan Appleyard, in {{a review}} for The Times, was critical of the book, describing it as a [...] "very, very dull read, a dogged march through social policies with boring <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> nudges should be imposed and how" [...] and that [...] "what the book needs is not more examples but more elaboration of the central idea".|$|R

500|$|Very {{soon after}} its initial release {{in the spring}} of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. Robin Wood wrote that [...] "Witchfinder General is {{certainly}} [...] most successfully achieved work ... what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of what is on the screen... the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris’ theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men." [...] David Pirie, who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book A Heritage of Horror, reviewed the film in 1971 for Time Out, commenting: [...] "...one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema... The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way." [...] Danny Peary noted, [...] "The Conqueror Worm is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves's greatest achievement is {{that he was able to}} maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming." [...] In 2000, Derek Malcolm included Witchfinder General as part of his series The Century of Films, a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he considered to be the one hundred most [...] "artistically or culturally important" [...] movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film [...] "is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain" [...] and [...] "transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making." [...] In 2005, J. Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film [...] "...has long been a cult item– in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before [...] the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil... Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance... it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception." ...|$|E
