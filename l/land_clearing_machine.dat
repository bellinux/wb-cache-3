Mechanically raking the plant material into long piles and letting them rot over time, is expensive and slow, and could harbour pests. <b>Clearing</b> <b>land</b> with <b>machines</b> and chemicals can cost up to US$200 per hectare while using fire costs US$5 per hectare.|$|R
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> is a {{significant}} environmental issue in Australia and an area of active legislative reform. Despite evidence of the harm that <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> causes to individual animals, such harm is either ignored or considered only indirectly in environmental decision-making. We argue that the harm that <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> causes to animals ought to be identified and evaluated in decision-making relating to <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and consider the following three propositions in support: (1) <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> causes deaths that are physically painful and psychologically distressing because of their traumatic and debilitating nature; (2) <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> causes physical injuries, other pathological conditions, pain and psychological distress over a prolonged period as animals attempt {{to survive in the}} cleared environment or in the environments they are displaced to; and (3) on the basis of current clearing rates, more than 50 million mammals, birds and reptiles are likely to be killed annually because of <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> in Queensland and New South Wales. The scientific consensus about the harm caused by <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> means that decisions to allow <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> are decisions to allow most of the animals present to be killed and, as such, frameworks for decision-making ought to include proper evaluation of the harm to be imposed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> threatens biodiversity, impairs the {{functioning}} of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, and is a key contributor to human-induced climate change. The rates of <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> in the State of Queensland, Australia, are at globally significant levels, and {{have been the subject}} of intense and polarised political debate. In 2016, a legislative bill that aimed to restore stronger controls over <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> failed to pass in the Queensland Parliament, despite the clear scientific basis for policy reform. Here, we provide a short history of the recent policy debate over <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> in Queensland, in the context of its global and national ecological significance. <b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> affects regional climates, leading to hotter, drier climates that will impact on the Queensland economy and local communities. Loss of habitat from <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> is a key threatening process for many endangered animals and plants. Runoff from <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> results in sediment and nutrient enrichment, which threatens the health of the Great Barrier Reef. Australia has made national and international commitments to conserve biodiversity and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but current <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> policies are not consistent with these commitments. Stronger regulation is needed to reduce vegetation loss, such as target-based regulation, which sets a cap on <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and could effectively halt vegetation loss over the long term. Lasting policy reform is required, and we recommend an effective policy mix that restricts clearing, provides economic opportunities for vegetation retention, and informs the Australian community about the value of native vegetation...|$|R
50|$|In the {{prehistory}} of Australia the Indigenous Australians used fire-stick farming {{which was}} an early form of <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> which caused long term changes to the ecology. With European colonisation <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> continued {{on a larger scale}} for agriculture - particularly for cattle, cotton and wheat production. Since European settlement a total of 13% of native vegetation cover has been lost. The extinction of 20 different mammals, 9 bird and 97 plant species have been partially attributed to <b>land</b> <b>clearing.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> is a major source of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, and contributed to approximately 12 percent of Australia’s total emissions in 1998.|$|R
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> debris {{is defined}} as growing stock and other timber sources cut or {{otherwise}} destroyed {{in the process of}} converting forest land to non-forest uses. 1 Growing stock that is removed in silvicultural operations such as pre-commercial thinning is also included in this definition. <b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> debris is typically in the form of tree tops and branches, trees cut or knocked down and left on site, and stumps. In non-forested areas, such as grasslands and desert, <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> debris may include soil, rocks, and shrubs, although fuel is primarily derived from previously forested areas...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{deforestation}} and <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> {{can be measured}} by the temperature changes. A slight elevation of average temperature from 2.0 to 2.2  °C in Cameron Highlands has been determined for the past 33  years {{to be associated with}} deforestation and <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> (Barrow et al. 2009; Gasim et al. 2010). The accumulation of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide associated with the high use of motor vehicles also had caused the local temperature increment (Rozimah and Khairulmaini 2016). Apart from deforestation, the construction of hydroelectric dam in Cameron Highlands has diverged and manipulated the natural river flows which consequently have changed the energy flow and matter in rivers. However, the hydroelectric power system only causes nominal change compared to large-scale <b>land</b> <b>clearing,</b> agriculture and development (Khairulmaini and Fauza 2010).|$|R
