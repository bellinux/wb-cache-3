The focus is on using the Standardised Approach and the Internal Rating-Based Approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements. Different approaches to managing the risk and evaluating the capital adequacy. Criticism of rating agencies as well as the complexity of Internal Rating-Based Approach is taken into account. Furthermore, the thesis discusses the issue of responsibility of external rating agencies for their evaluations, and together {{with the issue of}} lacking competition. Various alternatives to external rating are discussed. The internal rating process is discussed in more detail along with the factors which affect rating evaluations of exposures to various entities. Subsequently, the thesis focuses on determining the rate of provision for impairment expected <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>receivables,</b> and a possible impact of accepting IFRS 9 on capital adequacy...|$|E
40|$|Most {{corporate}} {{risk management}} {{research focuses on}} particular risk exposures {{to the exclusion of}} other interrelated exposures. By contrast, this study models corporate risk exposures using a multivariate approach integrating the distinct exposures of interest to finance and strategy researchers. The paper addresses the implications of multivariate modeling for corporate risk management, some key methodological issues arising in empirical estimation of corporate economic exposures, and directions for research on integrated risk management. Funding from Krannert's Center for International Business Education and Research is gratefully acknowledged. 2 Exposure refers {{to the extent to which}} external environmental contingencies have an impact on a company's perfonnance. In the past, scholarly interest in corporate risk exposure has come almost exclusively from the accounting and finance fields. Interest in corporate foreign exchange exposure arose from the practical need to consolidate the financial statements of foreign operations to local currencies (translation exposure) and the possibility of incurring accounting gains or <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>receivables</b> and payables denominated in foreign currencies (transaction exposure). While much attention has been give...|$|E

40|$|In many OECD countries, {{a seller}} {{has a right}} to {{reimbursement}} of VAT (RVAT) she has paid on goods sold, but for which she has not yet received payment. Such reimbursement of VAT <b>on</b> <b>receivables</b> is economically inefficient. It leads to: * Distortion of credit markets, by subsidizing direct credit at the cost of financial intermediaries. * Price discrimination, by subsidizing buyers with low creditworthiness. * A less efficient collection of bad debts, as trade with bad debts is made extremely expensive. The finance literature presents several "good" arguments in favor of trade credits, e. g. transaction costs and asymmetric information. In contrast RVAT is an economically "bad" argument for trade credit. It is a subsidy that leads to inefficiently high use of trade credit...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused <b>on</b> <b>receivables</b> {{management}} and possibilities {{how to use}} available information technologies. The use of information technologies should make <b>receivables</b> management easier <b>on</b> one hand {{and on the other}} hand it makes the processes more efficient. Finally it decreases additional costs and losses connected with enforcing receivables when defaulting debts occur. The situation of use of information technologies is different if the subject is financial or non-financial institution. In the case of financial institution loans providing is core business and the processes and their technical support are more sophisticated than in the case of non-financial institutions whose loan providing as invoices is just a supplement to their core business activities. The paper shows use of information technologies in individual cases but it also emphasizes the use of general results for further decision making process. Results of receivables management are illustrated on the data of the Czech Republic...|$|R
