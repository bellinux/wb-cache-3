500|$|According {{to initial}} police statements, {{at this point}} {{one or more of}} the {{suspects}} began firing with semiautomatic handguns and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli's trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started [...] "seconds" [...] after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out and held up a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said [...] "Jim, <b>look</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> found", while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. At this point, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ordered to put their hands on their laps and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur then reached down to the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was felled by bullets from Harper's gun. Harper testified that Acoli shot Foerster with a [...]38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and then used Foerster's own gun to [...] "execute him". According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster's body.|$|E

This was followed by <b>Look</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Almost Stepped In..., their final album under their contract with Nitro. Because of other musical commitments Freese was unavailable {{to play on the}} album, so substitute Brooks Wackerman filled in as drummer for the album's recording and some accompanying tours. At {{the end of the year}} Kung Fu re-released Oi to the World!, making it much more widely available than it had been in previous years. Escalante also launched the Kung Fu imprint Kung Fu Films in 2000 with the release of the film That Darn Punk, in which he starred and the other band members also appeared. The Vandals also contributed new songs to the film's soundtrack.|$|E

40|$|It’s often {{natural to}} compare two events by {{describing}} one as ‘more of a cause’ of some effect than the other. But what do such comparisons amount to, exactly? This paper aims {{to provide a}} guided tour of the recent literature on ‘degrees of causation’. Section 2 <b>looks</b> at <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call ‘dependence measures’, which arise from thinking of causes as difference-makers. Section 3 <b>looks</b> at <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call ‘production measures’, which arise from thinking of causes as jointly sufficient for their effects. Finally, section 4 examines the important question of whether there is any sense in which an agent is more responsible for an outcome in virtue of her action being more of a cause of it. I describe a puzzle that emerges from this question, first discussed by Bernstein (2017) and Sartorio (2015), and explore various strategies for resolving it. </p...|$|R
