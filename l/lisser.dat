5000|$|In 1944, the Harry Stone Gallery in New York City mounted an {{exhibition}} of sixty-seven [...] "American Primitive" [...] paintings that featured twenty of Willson's surviving watercolors. Willson's exhibited paintings included landscapes, still lifes, narrative scenes, portraits, mythological themes and genre subjects and demonstrated not only the range of her subject matter but also her ability, as noted by curator Jean Lipman, [...] "to exploit pure color and design." [...] According to Lipman, Willson [...] "was simply endowed with a teeming imagination, a bold taste for primary color and geometric design, and a total lack of inhibition, a combination which {{adds up to a}} style close indeed to that of modern abstract art." [...] Significantly, as Karlins has noted, there was speculation {{at the time of the}} exhibition that the watercolors were forgeries and the supporting documentation [...] "concocted ... in order to benefit from the growing market for folk art." [...] Karlins ultimately concluded, however, that because Willson's career is documented in De <b>Lisser's</b> 1894 publication and works attributed to the artist are recorded in the collection of Theodore Cole, the exhibited watercolors were authentic. He writes that although [...] "there are many questions still to be answered about the origins of and influences on Mary Ann Willson's works ... one thing is certain—paintings are not twentieth-century fakes. They are the product of one of the most original early nineteenth-century folk watercolorists yet discovered." ...|$|R

60|$|From Andermatt, {{through its}} high, cold, sunny valley, we passed into rugged little Hospenthal, {{and then up}} the last stages of the ascent. From here the road was all new to me. Among the summits of the various Alpine passes {{there is little to}} choose. You wind and double slowly into keener cold and deeper stillness; you put on your {{overcoat}} and turn up the collar; you count the nestling snow-patches and then you cease to count them; you pause, as you trudge before the lumbering coach, and listen to the last-heard cow-bell tinkling away below you in kindlier herbage. The sky was tremendously blue, and the little stunted bushes on the snow- streaked slopes were all dyed with autumnal purples and crimsons. It was a great display of colour. Purple and crimson too, though not so fine, were the faces thrust out at us from the greasy little double casements of a barrack beside the road, where the horses paused before the last pull. There was one little girl in particular, beginning to <b>lisser</b> her hair, as civilisation approached, in a manner not to be described, with her poor little blue-black hands. At the summit are the two usual grim little stone taverns, the steel-blue tarn, the snow-white peaks, the pause in the cold sunshine. Then we begin to rattle down with two horses. In five minutes we are swinging along the famous zigzags. Engineer, driver, horses--it's very handsomely done by all of them. The road curves and curls and twists and plunges like the tail of a kite; sitting perched in the banquette, you see it making below you and in mid-air certain bold gyrations which bring you as near as possible, short of the actual experience, to the philosophy of that immortal Irishman who wished that his fall from the house-top would only last. But the zigzags last no more than Paddy's fall, and in due time we were all coming to our senses over cafe au lait in the little inn at Faido. After Faido the valley, plunging deeper, began to take thick afternoon shadows from the hills, and at Airolo we were fairly in the twilight. But the pink and yellow houses shimmered through the gentle gloom, and Italy began in broken syllables to whisper that she was at hand. For {{the rest of the way}} to Bellinzona her voice was muffled in the grey of evening, and I was half vexed to lose the charming sight of the changing vegetation. But only half vexed, for the moon was climbing all the while nearer the edge of the crags that overshadowed us, and a thin magical light came trickling down into the winding, murmuring gorges. It was a most enchanting business. The chestnut-trees loomed up with double their daylight stature; the vines began to swing their low festoons like nets to trip up the fairies. At last the ruined towers of Bellinzona stood gleaming in the moonshine, and we rattled into the great post-yard. It was eleven o'clock and I had risen at four; moonshine apart I wasn't sorry.|$|E

5000|$|About Beit Naqquba, Morris writes (p. 263): [...] "It is {{possible}} that the inhabitants of Beit Naqquba had received both an order to evacuate from Arab military commanders in Ein Karim and [...] "strong advice" [...] to the same effect from <b>Lisser</b> and Navon. But {{it is likely that the}} [...] "advice" [...] given in the name of the Harel Brigade, which physically controlled the area, was more potent of the two factors in precipitating the evacuation." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{collected}} {{an impressive}} number of Old Master Drawings, and Paintings since 1935 on loan at the Boijmans Museum. The collection {{was known as}} the F. Koenigs collection. Especially the quality of his Old Masters, caused high ranking on Hitlers desiderata list. On April 2, 1940, the Jewish owned bank <b>Lisser</b> & Rosenkranz liquidated in order to be insolvent before the Nazi invasion. Due to the thread of an acute invasion the Jewish owned bank sold the collection for a fraction of its worth to one of the patrons of the museum Boijmans.|$|E
50|$|The castle was {{a typical}} stronghold that was at one time {{situated}} {{on the edge of}} a lake called the <b>Lisser</b> Poel (since poldered in) that itself was in connection to the Haarlemmermeer (itself a polder since in 1853). In 1630 a stately home was built on to the tower and became a summer residence, but after the Haarlem Lake was poldered in the 19th century it fell into disuse and became a ruin. In 1973 restoration began and the roof was built in the manner of 16th century carpentry.|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} of the legend in 2007 by Benjamin Radford concluded that the story was fictionalized, modeled on the title character in a famous Jamaican novel, The White Witch of Rosehall by Herbert G. de <b>Lisser,</b> published in 1929. An Annie Palmer unrelated to Rose Hall did exist, and by all accounts had no tendencies toward sadism or lechery. Rough Guide To Jamaica author Polly Thomas writes that the name of Annie Palmer may have become confused with Rosa Palmer, the original mistress of Rose Hall who did have four husbands but {{was said to be}} unwaveringly virtuous.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Henry MacDermot {{was born}} in Clarendon Parish, Jamaica, of Irish ancestry, and {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} in Trelawny.

He worked to promote Jamaican literature through all of his writing, starting a weekly short story contest in the Jamaica Times in 1899. Notable among the young writers he helped and encouraged are Claude McKay and H. G. de <b>Lisser.</b>|$|E
