It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E

50|$|Extensive farming most {{commonly}} refers to sheep and cattle farming {{in areas with}} low agricultural productivity, but can also refer to <b>large-scale</b> <b>growing</b> of wheat, barley, cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labour are high. Nomadic herding is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.|$|E

He was suspected of (but never charged with) the smuggling of {{large amounts of}} marijuana into the United States from Mexico (1967-1971) and the wholesale manufacture of chemically pure methamphetamine (1977-1979). Charges of simple assault (2001), theft (2003) and sexual offenses (2009) were subsequently dismissed or nol prossed. He served three Federal prison sentences: 1975-1976, 1984-1989 and 2009-2013.

50|$|Cacao, sisal, {{essential}} oils, {{and cotton}} were other significant cash crops. Cacao trees covered an estimated 10,400 hectares in 1987, and they yielded 4,000 tons of cocoa a year. Mennonite missionaries played a growing {{role in the}} cocoa industry, mostly around southern departments, especially Grand'Anse. Sisal, exported as a twine since 1927, peaked in the 1950s, as the Korean War demanded much of the nation's 40,000-ton output. By the 1980s, however, Haiti exported an average of only 6,500 tons a year, mainly to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The substitution of synthetic fibers for sisal reduced most <b>large-scale</b> <b>growing</b> of the plant, but many peasants continued to harvest the natural fiber for its use in hats, shoes, carpets, and handbags. The export of essential oils, derived from vetiver, lime, amyris, and bitter orange, peaked in 1976 at 395 tons. Exports leveled off at {{a little more than}} 200 tons during the 1980s, generating an average of US$5 million in foreign exchange. Cotton cultivation peaked in the 1930s, before boll weevils ravaged the crop. Growers introduced a higher quality of cotton, in the 1960s, which was processed in local cotton gins and then exported to Europe. Cotton prices fell in the 1980s, however, and cotton plantings shrank from 12,400 hectares in 1979 to under 8,000 hectares by 1986. Exports ceased. Government policies in the 1980s emphasized diversification into nontraditional export crops that would benefit {{under the terms of the}} CBI; the poor performance of traditional cash crops enhanced the importance of these efforts for the Haitian economy.|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{influential}} nodes in networks is {{a significant}} and challenging task. Among many centrality indices, the k-shell index performs very well in finding out influential spreaders. However, the traditional method for calculating the k-shell indices of nodes needs the global topological information, which limits its applications in large-scale dynamically growing networks. Recently, Lüet al. [Nature Communications 7 (2016) 10168] proposed a novel asynchronous algorithm to calculate the k-shell indices, which is suitable to deal with <b>large-scale</b> <b>growing</b> networks. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to select nodes and update their intermediate values towards the k-shell indices, which can help in accelerating the convergence of the calculation of k-shell indices. The former algorithm {{takes into account the}} degrees of nodes while the latter algorithm prefers to choose the node whose neighbors' values have been changed recently. We test these two methods on four real networks and three artificial networks. The results suggest that the two algorithms can respectively reduce the convergence time up to 75. 4 % and 92. 9 % in average, compared with the original asynchronous updating algorithm.

40|$|The EU {{regulation}} on {{organic farming}} {{does not allow}} the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which are subject to Directive 2001 / 18 /EC. Mutagenesis using irradiation or chemicals is genetic modification, but the organisms obtained through these techniques {{are not subject to}} the provisions of the GMO directive. Such mutants can therefore be used in organic agriculture. Derived from its basic principles, organic farming can only use natural substances to control disease and crops should be resilient, which, in the case of disease resistance, means that durable (horizontal) resistance is preferred to vertical (single gene) resistance. Cisgenesis can achieve such a durable resistance by introducing multiple resistance genes in one step. These multiple-resistant plants only contain natural genes that can also be introduced by breeding. In case cisgenic plants are not subject to the provisions of the GMO legislation, they can even be legally used in organic agriculture. In case they are not exempted from the GMO regulation, the question is: why obstruct a cisgenic potato crop that can hardly be distinguished from a potato crop that is the result of conventional breeding? Among the reasons why organic agriculture does not allow the use of GMOs it is mentioned that genetic engineering is unpredictable, it causes genome disruption and it is unnatural. However, our knowledge of plant genome evolution and breeding has increased dramatically. We now know that breeding is more unpredictable and causes more genome disruption than genetic engineering. Recent field trials have shown the efficacy of cisgenic late blight–resistant potatoes carrying multiple resistance genes. <b>Large-scale</b> <b>growing</b> of such durably resistant potatoes would not only be environmentally beneficial by it would strongly reducing the need for fungicide sprays in conventional potato cultivation and it would also reduce the disease pressure in organic potato cultivation...|$|E
