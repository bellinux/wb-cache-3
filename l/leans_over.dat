5|$|Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men, {{the first}} three being a customs officer, an ocularist and a {{jewellery}} dealer. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts {{his way into the}} third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E
5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on the floor. When he <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E
25|$|After the interview, Frost and Caroline pay a {{farewell}} visit to Nixon at his villa. Frost thanks Nixon for the interviews and Nixon, graciously admitting defeat, thanks Frost in return and wishes him well, privately {{adding that he}} has no recollection of calling Frost while drunk. He also for the first time addresses Frost by his first name. Nixon watches Frost and Caroline Cushing leave and then <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> a railing of his villa, looking out at the sunset.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards, Homura captures Kyubey and rewrites reality {{so he and}} {{his kind}} take Madoka's place in taking the misery of magical girls in history while she can return to a normal life. But Homura realizes that Madoka will {{eventually}} remember the truth and regain her divinity, accepting that they might become enemies should that time come. A post-credits scene shows Homura seated in a chair while watching over Mitakihara City and a badly-beaten Kyubey in the vicinity. After staring into the horizon, Homura <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> and falls off a cliff.|$|E
500|$|Cooper retires {{to bed at}} {{his hotel}} room, and {{experiences}} a strange dream featuring the one-armed man, who identifies himself as MIKE, and BOB, who vows to [...] "kill again". Cooper then dreams {{he is in a}} room hung with red curtains. The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) and Laura Palmer speak to him in a jarring and disjointed manner, before Laura <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> to whisper in his ear. Cooper wakes up, telephones Harry, and declares that he knows who the murderer is.|$|E
500|$|One of Sunny's most {{high-profile}} storylines was a kiss between {{herself and}} female character, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> and kisses her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said [...] "For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is {{what it would be}} like to kiss Zeke. Now Donna's gone and stolen the moment – and Sunny's not happy, to say the least..." ...|$|E

500|$|The clip {{begins with}} shots of San Miguel de Allende {{and a couple}} {{standing}} close to each other. Subsequently, a man is seen transporting balloons in front of Inna, who <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> a Volkswagen Beetle car sporting a yellow wool suit from Max Mara, worth circa 6350 lei. The man in the vehicle was predicted by Celebmix from a teaser video to be her love interest. Next, the singer walks through the city, encountering a banana stand, an old woman in traditional clothing and a piñata, which she eventually breaks. She wears a black skirt designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. Subsequently, the singer and two fellow females with hand fans perform to the track {{in front of the}} entrance of a building; Inna has a top with ruffles on designed by Johanna Oritz, worth $850, along with Samurai Earrings from Dsquared24, worth $142. In the last scene of the video, the singer and a crowd of people are shown partying [...] "satisfied" [...] and [...] " [...] loose" [...] at night. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray her and background dancers (one of which is Nadd Hu) performing to the song in front of red and blue backdrops, and the singer standing in front of an old door or a ventilator. Some scenes are replayed or played backwards throughout the clip.|$|E
500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
2500|$|... 20. Finale. The {{final section}} {{begins with a}} soft woodwind chord {{followed}} by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment à bouches fermées (similar to the [...] "Humming Chorus" [...] from Puccini's later opera, Madama Butterfly) which repeats the theme from Pâle et blonde. Ophélie sings: Le voilà! Je crois l'entendre! – [...] "There he is! I think I hear him!". As she <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the water, holding onto {{the branches of a}} willow [...] with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody (Theme of Hamlet's Love) from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Ophélie: Doute de la lumière – [...] "Doubt that the light illumines"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.) ...|$|E

60|$|On the {{way home}} this urchin's sole delight was to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the bow and watch the fish and coral-groves over which they skimmed. In this he was imitated by Nigel who, ungallantly {{permitting}} his companion to row, also <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side and gazed down into the clear crystal depths with unwearying delight.|$|R

2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Évelyne Brochu as Dr. Delphine Cormier, Cosima's monitor, girlfriend, {{and fellow}} scientist. She is torn between {{her job at}} Dyad and her love for Cosima. After finding out about Cosima's illness she works {{with her in the}} Dyad {{to try to find a}} cure. She is {{promoted}} to the public leader of Dyad after Leekie's death and unintentionally helps Rachel kidnap Kira. Rachel then bans her from working with clones and tries to send her away to Frankfurt. However, Marion promotes Delphine to take over Rachel's position and Delphine enacts her revenge on Rachel. Delphine returns to Dyad, supposedly after learning that Sarah was kidnapped and has been missing for five days, but it is later revealed that her jealousy has led her to spy on Cosima and Shay's relationship, photographing and videotaping the two on their various dates. Delphine interrogates Shay, believing her to be the Castor mole. She is about to begin cutting Shay when Cosima calls to inform her that Gracie admitted to being the Castor mole. Delphine finds out that Dr. Nealon replaced Rachel with an induced Krystal and sent her to Vienna. She confronts him in an enclosed room, and he reveals that Rachel now belongs to Neolution, the group that he has been working for all along, attempting to procure the Leda and Castor original genomes for scientific advancement. Delphine calls for the guards to take Nealon away, but she receives no responses, and Dr. Nealon suddenly attacks her as he bleeds from the mouth. He <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> her, spilling blood onto her face, as a regurgitated worm spills from his mouth. Delphine shoots Nealon before the worm can reach her. As he dies, he proclaims that Delphine will be dead before morning. Delphine confronts Shay to apologize and tells her that she is giving Cosima permission to reveal everything to Shay, stating that the two are right for each other. She then visits Cosima at Bubbles, discreetly saying goodbye to Cosima and the other Leda clones. Delphine parks her car in a parking garage and is followed by unseen pursuer. Delphine asks [...] "what will happen to ?" [...] and receives no response; instead, the pursuer shoots Delphine, whose death is implied but not seen. Krystal confirms in season 4 that Delphine was picked up, alive, by after being shot. She has been on the Island in the north this whole time after being spared by PT Westmoreland, she reunites with a hypothermic Cosima. (recurring seasons 1 & 4–5; regular seasons 2–3) ...|$|E
