5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|While the Australian Government offered MacArthur ICorps {{for service}} in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several {{proposals}} to utilise {{it in the}} liberation of these islands. The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if {{it could not be}} used for offensive operations. This was politically embarrassing for the government, and helped motivate it to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> areas where the military could be employed.|$|E
5|$|Mad Maxs {{landscape}} {{consists of}} canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world {{is divided into}} several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys {{can be found in}} each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different benefits such as helping Max to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. Max can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. Max is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines. Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.|$|E

25|$|However, as Modernist {{architecture}} {{fell out}} of favour in the 1980s, proposals for the redevelopment {{of many of the}} buildings constructed in Birmingham from the 1960s and 1970s were aired including redevelopment proposals for the Post and Mail Tower (most including the total demolition of the tower). In 2005, demolition work began on the tower and a replacement office block has been constructed in its place. A building of similar architecture, the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce on the Hagley Road, still remains, however is under threat from demolition as the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> premises. Also set to be demolished is NatWest House. The proposed demolition of the tower was resisted by conservation groups calling for the building to be listed, however, English Heritage concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for the tower to be listed. Many of Machin's other buildings in Birmingham have been replaced.|$|E
25|$|By 1906 it {{had become}} clear that Port Victoria would not develop into a major {{continental}} sea port and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) began to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> opportunities to bring in revenue. In July of that year seven wooden halts were constructed: Milton Road, Milton Range, Denton, Uralite, Beluncle, Middle Stoke and Grain Crossing. Uralite halt was named after the nearby British Uralite plc complex which had opened in 1899 and manufactured drainage pipes from wet asbestos paste. On 1 May 1915, the little-used Milton Road Halt was closed. The branch line to Allhallows-on-sea was opened on 16 May 1932 followed on 17 July 1932 by opening of another halt at Stoke Junction. A new station opened at Grain on 3 September 1951, replacing Grain Crossing Halt, which closed to rail traffic on 11 July 1951 and passengers on 3 September 1951 - a bus service being provided between those dates.|$|E

25|$|With India gaining independence, the American {{diplomatic}} post in Madras was officially raised to a Consulate General on 15 August 1947, marking {{a milestone in}} the bilateral {{relationship between the two}} countries. On the same day, Roy E. B. Bower became the last consul and the first consul general in Madras in independent India. With Parry's Company wanting the whole building in 1952, the Consulate had to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> premises. Five years later, in the 1950s, the Consulate General moved to a building on Mount Road (the present day Anna Salai), currently occupied by the Bank of America. With the expansion of the Indo-U.S. relations after Independence, the Consulate General required a purpose-built structure to accommodate a diversity of activities such as library services, cultural programming, educational exchange, visas, American citizen services and development assistance, along with the ancient standby, trade promotion. For this purpose, the Consulate General leased out a parcel of land on the Gemini Circle from the Church of South India to build its own building. On 3 January 1969, the Consulate General moved to its present location on the Gemini Circle, which was inaugurated by Ambassador Chester Bowles.|$|E
25|$|In May 1719, The 1st Duke of Newcastle, the Lord Chamberlain, ordered Handel to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> singers. Handel {{travelled}} to Dresden {{to attend}} the newly built opera. He saw Teofane by Antonio Lotti, and engaged members of the cast for the Royal Academy of Music, founded {{by a group of}} aristocrats to assure themselves a constant supply of baroque opera or opera seria. Handel may have invited John Smith, his fellow student in Halle, and his son Johann Christoph Schmidt, to become his secretary and amanuensis. By 1723 he had moved into a Georgian house at 25 Brook Street, which he rented {{for the rest of his}} life. This house, where he rehearsed, copied music and sold tickets, is now the Handel House Museum. During twelve months between 1724 and 1725, Handel wrote three outstanding and successful operas, Giulio Cesare, Tamerlano and Rodelinda. Handel's operas are filled with da capo arias, such as Svegliatevi nel core. After composing Silete venti, he concentrated on opera and stopped writing cantatas. Scipio, from which the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards is derived, was performed as a stopgap, waiting for the arrival of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E

A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> mates. Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground.

500|$|In late 2009, the Conservatives' {{plunging}} [...] popularity at {{the polls}} and the surge in support for the right-wing Wildrose Alliance led to speculation that Stelmach would receive lukewarm support at his mandatory leadership review, {{to be held at}} the November 2009 Progressive Conservative convention. Klein's resignation came {{in the wake of his}} receiving only 55% support at such a review, and Klein suggested that Stelmach should resign if he received less than 70%. The question was whether party leaders would blame Stelmach for the party's decline and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> leadership in the face of Stelmach's own weakening poll numbers. [...] Instead, Stelmach met the criterion set up by his critics and won 77.4% support, a strong endorsement.|$|E

Central Bank of Iceland governor Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated. According to R√öV, prime minister Geir Haarde had been investigating the possibility of a Russian loan since the mid-summer.

He appears to be unharmed and Barber explained [...] "Rhys survives and comes to and manages to free himself from the wreckage. He seems relatively okay and unscathed." [...] Rhys goes to the hospital as a precaution but, despite being told not to by Karl, discharges himself.
