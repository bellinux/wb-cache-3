5|$|In September 1943, the Kriegsmarine {{dispatched}} two battleships, Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, {{and nine}} destroyers to bombard <b>Longyearbyen,</b> Barentsburg and Grumant. Only four buildings in <b>Longyearbyen</b> survived: the hospital, the power station, {{an office building}} and a residential building, in addition to Sverdrupbyen. <b>Longyearbyen</b> remained unsettled {{until the end of}} the war, with the first ship from the mainland leaving on 27 June 1945.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> is {{the centre}} of tourism on the archipelago, {{although}} most tourism is generated based on natural experiences rather than visiting the town itself. However, <b>Longyearbyen</b> does provide supplies, accommodation and several museums. In 2008, <b>Longyearbyen</b> experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew into <b>Longyearbyen.</b> Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK291 million and produced 200 man-years.|$|E
5|$|No care or nursing {{services}} and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The University Hospital of North Norway operates a clinic, <b>Longyearbyen</b> Hospital. Other public offices with presence on <b>Longyearbyen</b> are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. <b>Longyearbyen</b> is subordinate Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard {{remained}} {{unaffected by}} the German occupation of Norway in 1940. However, from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers, {{as well as a}} source of badly needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet–British occupation; instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-Ålesund was evacuated to <b>Longyearbyen,</b> and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from <b>Longyearbyen</b> to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated. With <b>Longyearbyen</b> depopulated, a small German garrison and air strip was established in Adventdalen, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left <b>Longyearbyen</b> without combat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> Community Council {{has many}} of the same {{responsibilities}} of a municipality. It is organised with a 15-member council that since 2011 has been led by Mayor Christin Kristoffersen of the Labour Party. The council's main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-grade <b>Longyearbyen</b> School.|$|E

The council's main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-grade <b>Longyearbyen</b> School. However, unlike mainland municipalities, the healthcare services are provided by the state through <b>Longyearbyen</b> Hospital, a clinic operated by the University Hospital of North Norway. No care or nursing services and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> School serves ages 6-18. It is {{the primary}} and {{secondary}} school in the northernmost location on Earth. Once pupils reach ages 16 or 17 most families move to mainland Norway. There is a non-degree offering tertiary educational institution in <b>Longyearbyen,</b> University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS), the tertiary school in the northernmost location on Earth, co-located with the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Svalbard Museum, and the Svalbard Science Forum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> {{remained}} {{purely a}} company town until 1989 when utilities, culture and education was separated into Svalbard Samfunnsdrift. In 1993 {{it was sold}} to the national government and the University Centre was established. Through the 1990s, tourism increased and the town developed an economy independent of Store Norske and the mining. <b>Longyearbyen</b> was incorporated on 1 January 2002, receiving a community council.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, YouTuber Tom Scott {{visited the}} island {{as part of}} his Amazing Places video series, {{producing}} videos on subjects such as the island's gun regulations, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and the <b>Longyearbyen</b> Sundial.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> {{experiences}} {{a very high}} turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) {{moved away from the}} town. The average person lived in <b>Longyearbyen</b> for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, {{about a quarter of the}} population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> is {{the largest}} {{settlement}} on the archipelago, {{the seat of the}} governor and the only town to be incorporated. The town features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports center with a swimming pool, library, culture center, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly. Only {{a small fraction of the}} mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a dormitory town, with workers commuting from <b>Longyearbyen</b> weekly.|$|E
5|$|Research on Svalbard {{centers on}} <b>Longyearbyen</b> and Ny-Ålesund, the most {{accessible}} {{areas in the}} high Arctic. The treaty grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg. The University Centre in Svalbard in <b>Longyearbyen</b> offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various arctic sciences, particularly biology, geology and geophysics. Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the items}} from the expedition, {{including}} the balloon-silk boat and the tent, are {{on display at the}} Andréeexpeditionen Polar Centre at Grenna Museum, Sweden. The expedition is also featured in the Spitsbergen Airship Museum in <b>Longyearbyen,</b> Svalbard.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from <b>Longyearbyen,</b> either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of <b>Longyearbyen.</b> Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Svalbard had an {{estimated}} population of 2,642, of whom 439 were Russians and Ukrainian, 10 were Polish and 322 were other non-Norwegians living in Norwegian settlements. The largest non-Norwegian groups in <b>Longyearbyen</b> in 2005 were from Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Iran and Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a ten-part reality {{series was}} {{broadcast}} on BBC Earth (called Ice Town: Life on the Edge) and BBC Nordic (called Svalbard: Life on the Edge). Filmed in 2015–2016, it {{focused on the}} lives of eleven <b>Longyearbyen</b> residents through the passing seasons.|$|E
5|$|KSAT {{operates}} two polar ground stations {{optimized for}} low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the other being SvalSat at <b>Longyearbyen</b> in Svalbard, Norway. These {{are the only}} two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. By using both stations, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> has a {{road network}} {{stretching}} , but the network {{does not extend}} to any other communities. In 2008 there were 1,481 registered road vehicles and 49 percent of all households had a car. Cars are registered with ZN on the registration plates. There is a single workshop, Svalbard Auto, {{which is also a}} Toyota dealer.|$|E
5|$|Other public offices with {{presence}} on <b>Longyearbyen</b> are the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Svalbard is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø. Russia maintains a consulate in Barentsburg, led by Consule General Alexander Antipov.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{resettlement}} of Svalbard in {{the early}} 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in <b>Longyearbyen.</b> The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to <b>Longyearbyen</b> Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks. In 2011, a 20-year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.|$|E
5|$|The first {{air strip}} on Svalbard was {{constructed}} in Adventdalen, near <b>Longyearbyen,</b> by the Luftwaffe during World War II. This was not used after the war; during the summer the archipelago was served by ships, but was completely isolated from November to May. In the early 1950s, the Norwegian Air Force started postal flights using a Catalina aircraft that departed from Tromsø and dropped postal parcels at Bear Island and at <b>Longyearbyen.</b> However, these aircraft never landed until 9 February 1959, when a resident had become seriously ill, {{and needed to be}} flown to mainland Norway for treatment. The mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani cleared the runway at Adventsdalen and the 14-hour flight and landing was successful. A second landing, this time for delivery of post, was made on 11 March.|$|E
5|$|There are 200 free outdoor {{parking spaces}} at the airport. There are taxis, rental cars and airport coaches {{available}} at the airport (a shuttle bus operates to hotels and guesthouses in <b>Longyearbyen</b> and Nybyen). Scandinavian Airlines provides handling services through SAS Ground Services.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, Svalbard {{had become}} a {{destination}} for Arctic tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were {{being used as a}} base for Arctic exploration. The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all-year operations. Production in <b>Longyearbyen,</b> by American interests, started in 1908; and Store Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part by buying American interests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> School serves ages 6-18. It is the primary/secondary {{school in}} the northernmost {{location}} on Earth. Once pupils reach ages 16 or 17 most families move to mainland Norway. Barentsburg has its own school serving the Russian community; by 2014 it had three teachers, and its welfare funds had declined. A primary school served the community of Pyramiden in the pre-1998 period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Longyearbyen</b> {{is divided}} into several neighbourhoods. On {{the west side of}} the river, along the bay, lies the port and {{affiliated}} utility and industrial services. The western part of this area is called Bykaia and the eastern part Sjøområdet. Above lies Skjæringa, the site of the Governor's offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lies Gamle <b>Longyearbyen</b> ("Old Longyearbyen") and the church. Even further up lies the graveyard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commercial and cultural institutions are located on the east side of the river. Along the bay the area is called Sjøskrenten. Further up lies the university centre and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as the town hall. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and Nybyen, which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen, to the east of town.|$|E
5|$|Lufttransport {{has been}} at the airport since 1976. In 1984, two Bell 212 {{helicopters}} were stationed at the airport on contract with the Governor of Svalbard. The company signed an agreement with the Norwegian Coast Guard to have a Partenavia Spartacus planes stationed at <b>Longyearbyen</b> for fishery surveillance. Since 1994, the company has had a Dornier Do 228 stationed at the airport, and two since 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 1987, Braathens SAFE re-entered the market, {{flying in}} {{parallel}} with SAS to Tromsø and Oslo. For the first time, the scheduled flights to Oslo were offered as day flights instead of the night flights offered by SAS. In 2002, after SAS bought Braathens, the subsidiary took over all flights to <b>Longyearbyen</b> for the group. From May 2004, they merged to SAS Braathens, that again became SAS from 1 June 2007. From 1 April to 1 November 2004, Norwegian Air Shuttle introduced three weekly services to <b>Longyearbyen</b> to Tromsø and Oslo, using Boeing 737-300 aircraft, but the service was terminated due to low loads. A new service was started on 27 March 2008, with two direct services to Oslo, using larger Boeing 737-800 aircraft. but again the route was terminated later the same year. , Norwegian is again flying to Svalbard from Oslo. Finnair announced plans to begin flights from Helsinki in summer 2016, but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route as {{it was not in}} bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway.|$|E
5|$|Since Svalbard {{is located}} {{north of the}} Arctic Circle it {{experiences}} midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter. At 74° north, the midnight sun lasts 99 days and polar night 84 days, while the respective figures at 81° are 141 and 128 days. In <b>Longyearbyen,</b> midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February. In winter, the combination of full moon and reflective snow can give additional light.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the closing}} of the mines in 1963, the mining company Kings Bay had been working to {{establish}} Ny-Ålesund as a research town. The telemetry station acted as an important stepping stone for research activity, and the plans for development of Ny-Ålesund as a permanent research community continued past 1974. In 1997, Svalbard Satellite Station opened in <b>Longyearbyen,</b> which is among other stations used by ESTRACK.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Norway {{appointed}} Thorleif Østenstad as Svalbard's first vicar {{and teacher}} in 1920. A school was {{established as a}} cooperation between the church and SNSK and had an inaugural eight pupils. The first Svalbard Church opened on 28 August 1921, and the church's reading room was from then used as a school. Longyear City was renamed <b>Longyearbyen</b> in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioner of Mining for Svalbard {{is part of}} the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, but {{retains its}} own offices in <b>Longyearbyen.</b> The {{commissioner}} is responsible for administrating mineral rights, both for mining and petroleum. Other public agencies which have supervisory roles, but are not stationed on Svalbard, are the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the Norwegian Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention and the Norwegian Directorate for Product and Electrical Safety.|$|E
5|$|The European Space Research Organization (ESRO) {{established}} Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund {{as one of}} {{its four}} initial European Space Tracking Network stations. The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974, but was closed as it was not suitable for ESRO's second generation of satellites. During the planning of the station, <b>Longyearbyen</b> had been proposed as a location, and it was largely political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-Ålesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.|$|E
5|$|The only airline {{to provide}} service to and from Hamnerabben is Lufttransport, which {{operates}} 16-seat Dornier Do 228 aircraft to Svalbard Airport, Longyear. The airline provides two flights per week during the winter and four flights per week during the summer. All departures are charter flights organized by Kings Bay and tickets are only available through the company. Occasional ad hoc charter flights are also sometimes operated. At <b>Longyearbyen,</b> connections are provided onwards to Tromsø Airport and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|E
5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. Some customers have direct access to their installations in <b>Longyearbyen</b> without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, NSC {{operated}} Tromsø Satellite Station (TSS), {{which was}} used as a ground station for a limited number of satellites. After Rolf Skår was appointed director of NSC, plans were launched to try to win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at <b>Longyearbyen.</b>|$|E
