40|$|The high global {{penetration}} of mobile telephony provides a strong {{basis for the}} development and diffusion of mobile business applications. Especially for <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services, i. e. mobile services that consider the user’s current location to add value to the service provided, a high potential to become a major market success is seen. Nevertheless the development of mobile business and <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services {{has so far been}} lagging behind expert expecations. One of the reasons for this disappointing development is the failure of application developers to center their efforts on potential users and their needs and demands. The following paper therefore reviews the existing literature on user requirements in mobile business and <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services. A definition and characterization of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services is given and a framework to categorize existing <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services is developed. Additionally, usefulness and usability are put in concrete terms as they are identified as the main determinants of end-user acceptance of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services. Security concerns of potential users of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services are analyzed and further limitations of the diffusion of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Outdoor {{navigation}} services have become ubiquitously available due to small handheld {{devices such as}} GPS enabled mobile phones or dedicated mobile navigation systems. Two main drivers were {{necessary in order to}} provide widespread <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services: Acquiring positioning information with a certain degree of precision and widespread (mobile) access to computer networks to use the position information with a large information basis such as the Internet. Envisioned is a future, where indoor navigation and <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services are used as naturally as outdoor <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services are now. To achieve this long term vision where users seamlessly navigate for example from work desk to departure gate at the airport and use <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services on the way, various challenges have to be solved. In this paper, these challenges and open issues are discussed. The paper proposes an architecture which abstracts from different mobile devices and localization technologies. Additionally, it sketches the use of indoor topology information to increase the accuracy of indoor localization. These two presented concepts form a basis for a transition period until standards for ubiquitous indoor <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services have emerged.

In this paper, we reveal the importance of location information in saliency detection. We analyze the largest public image dataset for saliency detection THUS 10000, and find the relationship between content location and saliency distribution. To further validate the effect of location information, we propose two <b>location</b> <b>based</b> saliency detection approaches, <b>location</b> <b>based</b> Gaussian distribution and <b>location</b> <b>based</b> saliency propagation, which make use of no or weak assistance of image content. Experimental results show that <b>location</b> <b>based</b> saliency detection can obtain much better performance than random selection, even better than most state-of-the-art saliency detection methods...|$|R

40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>based</b> {{services}} are very useful to human beings. The vehicle navigation service {{that is used}} by almost all drivers in the world is an example <b>location</b> <b>based</b> service. As the man made constructions are getting bigger and bigger, indoor <b>location</b> <b>based</b> {{services are}} demanded. Matter of fact, researches for indoor <b>location</b> <b>based</b> service started in the early 1990 s and developing techniques with which universally available efficient indoor <b>location</b> <b>based</b> service systems can be built is one of the hottest current research issues. Considering the features of smart phones, its computing power and the sensor devices equipped on it, moreover {{it is one of the}} most popular personal belongings, we conclude that a smart phone is the most ideal device on which indoor <b>location</b> <b>based</b> service systems should be executed. Therefore, we propose a method of indoor positioning that determines the user's current position with the smart phone's sensor values. Referring to the accelerometer values, our method counts steps. With the orientation values, our method estimates the direction. With the step count and the direction, our method determines the current location of the user. Referring to the floor map, our method adjusts the user's current location from time to time. We have implemented the proposed method on Android smart phones and our test results are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>based</b> {{services}} are nowadays embedded in most services and devices that individuals use throughout their day. Those <b>location</b> <b>based</b> {{services are}} used to get directions, information for their location or even get informed about events. A lot of {{studies have been conducted}} focusing on the adaptation of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services or the experience the users have while using those services. During this research the understanding of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services and if the users understand the possible trade-offs that exist was researched. Since those services are embedded in modern technology by studying and analysing the beliefs and understanding the users have around those services can assist in better understanding the real user needs and assist in bettering those services. In order to achieve the goals of the study, fieldwork was conducted in the form of interviews. A total of twelve participants were recruited {{to participate in the study}} and scenario driven interviews were conducted in order to collect the appropriate data for analysis. The analysis of the data resulted in four main themes that best describe the user beliefs. Those four themes are "Positive View of <b>Location</b> <b>Based</b> Services", "Accepting and expecting no Privacy", "Having difficulties accessing information about the <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services" and "Wanting to change how the services work" with the majority of the participants having a positive view of <b>location</b> <b>based</b> services. Those themes are analysed and discussed and the impact they can have in means of design and user acceptance levels is also presented later during this study.
