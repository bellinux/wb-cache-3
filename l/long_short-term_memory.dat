For {{estimating}} the Interaction Quality (IQ) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), the dialogue history is of significant importance. Previous works included this information manually {{in the form}} of precomputed temporal features into the classification process. Here, we employ a deep learning architecture based on <b>Long</b> <b>Short-Term</b> <b>Memories</b> (LSTM) to extract this information automatically from the data, thus estimating IQ solely by using current exchange features.

In this contribution, we exploit a larger context window for TAD and compare the performance of FNNs and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with an explicit focus on small network topologies as desirable for embedded acoustic signal processing systems. More specifically, the investigations include a comparison between three different types of RNNs, namely plain RNNs, <b>Long</b> <b>Short-Term</b> <b>Memories,</b> and Gated Recurrent Units. The results indicate that all versions of RNNs outperform FNNs for the task of TAD...|$|R

40|$|Company {{disclosures}} greatly aid in {{the process}} of financial decision-making; therefore, they are consulted by financial investors and automated traders before exercising ownership in stocks. While humans are usually able to correctly interpret the content, the same is rarely true of computerized decision support systems, which struggle with the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For instance, recurrent neural networks, such as <b>long</b> <b>short-term</b> <b>memories,</b> employ hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However, deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep neural networks for financial decision support. We additionally experiment with transfer learning, in which we pre-train the network on a different corpus with a length of 139. 1 million words. Our results reveal a higher directional accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning when predicting stock price movements in response to financial disclosures. Our work thereby helps to highlight the business value of deep learning and provides recommendations to practitioners and executives...|$|R

We conducted structural analysis of gray matter density, cortical thickness, local gyrification, and white matter structure, relative to matched controls. We found massive gray matter density and cortical thickness increases in Pandit brains in language, memory and visual systems, including i) bilateral lateral temporal cortices and ii) the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, regions associated with <b>long</b> and <b>short-term</b> <b>memory.</b> Differences in hippocampal morphometry matched those previously documented for expert spatial navigators and individuals with good verbal working memory.

40|$|Associative {{learning}} {{is one of}} the key mechanisms displayed by living organisms in order to adapt to their changing environments. It was early recognized to be a general trait of complex multicellular organisms but also found in "simpler" ones. It has also been explored within synthetic biology using molecular circuits that are directly inspired in neural network models of conditioning. These designs involve complex wiring diagrams to be implemented within one single cell and the presence of diverse molecular wires become a challenge that might be very difficult to overcome. Here we present three alternative circuit designs based on two-cell microbial consortia able to properly display associative learning responses to two classes of stimuli and displaying <b>long</b> and <b>short-term</b> <b>memory</b> (i. e. the association can be lost with time). These designs might be a helpful approach for engineering the human gut microbiome or even synthetic organoids, defining a new class of decision-making biological circuits capable of memory and adaptation to changing conditions.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} if the memory bias for negative faces that has been demonstrated in depression and dysphoria generalises from <b>long</b> to <b>short-term</b> <b>memory.</b> 29 dysphoric (DP) and 22 non-dysphoric (ND) participants were presented with a series of 64 faces, each featuring one of four emotional expressions (happiness, sadness, anger or neutral affect), and were asked to identify the emotion portrayed.

Half the arrays featured the same individual with four different expressions (facial expression memory) and half featured four different individuals with the same expression (facial identity memory). At encoding, no group differences were apparent. At memory testing, DP exhibited impaired memory for all types of facial emotion and for facial identity when the faces featured happiness, anger or neutral affect, but not when the faces featured sadness. DP exhibited enhanced memory for faces with sad & angry expressions, and impaired memory for happy faces, relative to neutral. ND exhibited enhanced memory for facial identity when faces were angry, relative to sad or neutral.

40|$|Scholars do {{not usually}} {{test for the}} {{duration}} of the effects of mass communication, but when they do, they typically find rapid decay. Persuasive impact may end almost as soon as communication ends. Why so much decay? Does mass communication produce any long-term effects? How should this decay color our understanding of the effects of mass communication? We examine these questions with data from the effects of advertising in the 2000 presidential election and 2006 subnational elections, but argue that our model and results are broadly applicable within the field of political communication. We find that the bulk of the persuasive impact of advertising decays quickly, but that some effect in the presidential campaign endures for at least 6 weeks. These results, which are similar in rolling cross-section survey data and county-level data on actual presidential vote, appear to reflect a mix of memory-based processing (whose effects last only as <b>long</b> as <b>short-term</b> <b>memory</b> lasts) and online processing (whose effects are more durable). Finally, we find that immediate effects of advertising are larger in subnational than presidential elections, but decay more quickly and more completely.
