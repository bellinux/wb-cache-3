40|$|We use {{numerical}} simulations {{to examine}} the structure of merger remnants resulting from collisions of gas-rich spiral galaxies. When the gas fraction of the progenitors is small, the remnants structurally and kinematically resemble elliptical galaxies, in agreement with earlier work. However, if the progenitor disks are gas-dominated, new types of outcomes are possible. In fact, we show that a prominent disk may survive in certain cases. To illustrate this scenario, we analyze an extreme example with progenitor galaxies consisting of dark matter halos, pure gas disks, and no bulges, as might be appropriate for mergers at high redshifts. While rapid star formation triggered by tidal torques during the merger forms a central, rotating bulge in the remnant, not all the gas is consumed in the burst. The remaining gas cools very quickly and settles into an extended star-forming disk, yielding an object similar to a spiral galaxy, and not a <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy.</b> This {{is contrary to the}} usual view that major mergers invariably destroy disks. The morphological evolution of galaxies can therefore be more complicated than often assumed, and in particular, theoretical constraints based on the fragility of spiral disks need to be reevaluated...|$|E

This peculiar class of galaxies is the result of a near head-on collision between typically, a late type and an early type galaxy. Subsequent GMOS-N long-slit spectroscopy has confirmed both the relative proximity of the components of this interacting pair and shown it to have a redshift of 0. 111. Analysis of the spectroscopy reveals that the <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy</b> is a LINER class Active Galactic Nuclei while the early type galaxy is also potentially an AGN candidate, this is very uncommon amongst known collision ring galaxies. Preliminary modeling of the ring finds an expansion velocity of ~ 200 kms^- 1 consistent with our observations, making the collision about 50 Myr old. The ring currently has a radius of about 10 kpc and a bridge of stars and gas is also visible connecting the two galaxies. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables.

Here we study the properties of a distant compact LIRGs galaxy. Given the photometric and spectro photometric accuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them for reddening. The galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by UDF imagery. The disk radius is half that of the Milky Way and the galaxy have a SFR= 20 Mo/yr. Morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiral inwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. A combined system of a bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion, induces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes the angular momentum (AM). The detailed physical properties resemble to the expectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies, 0. 5 Gyr after the merger.

In the three bands, the observations show extended emission from the four images of the source in a ring-like configuration that surrounds the two, resolved, lensing galaxies. B 1608 + 656 was discovered as a double-lobed radio source, and later identified as a post-starburst galaxy in the optical. Based on photometry and optical spectroscopy we estimate that the stellar population of the source has an age of ∼ 500 Myr. This provides {{a model for the}} spectrum of the source that extends over spectral regions where no observations are available, and is used to generate Tiny Tim PSFs for the filters. Deconvolutions performed with the Lucy-Richardson method are presented, and the limitations of these restorations is discussed. V-I and I-H color maps show evidence of extinction by dust associated with one of the lensing galaxies, a <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy</b> presumably disrupted after its close encounter with the other lens, an elliptical galaxy.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the molecular gas distributions in the 29 barred and 15 unbarred spirals in BIMA SONG. For CO-bright galaxies, we confirm the conclusion by Sakamoto et al. (1999 b) that barred spirals have higher molecular gas concentrations in the central kiloparsec. The SONG sample also includes 27 galaxies below the CO brightness limit used by Sakamoto et al. Even in these CO-faint galaxies we show that high central gas concentrations are more common in barred galaxies, consistent with radial inflow driven by the bar. However, there is a significant population of early-type (Sa [...] Sbc) barred spirals (6 of 19) that have little or no molecular gas detected in the nuclear region and out to the bar co-rotation radius. In these galaxies, the bar has already driven most of the gas within the bar to the nuclear region, where it has been consumed by star formation. The median nuclear gas mass is over four times higher in early type bars; since the gas consumption rate is an order of magnitude higher in early type bars, early types must have significantly higher bar-driven inflows. The lower inflow rates in late type bars can be attributed to differences in bar structure between early and late types. Despite bar-driven inflows, the data indicate that it is highly unlikely for a <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy</b> to evolve into an early type via bar-induced gas inflow. Nonetheless, secular evolutionary processes are undoubtedly present, and pseudo-bulges are inevitable; evidence for pseudo-bulges is likely to be clearest in early-type galaxies because of their high gas inflow rates and higher star formation activity (abridged) ...|$|E

Testing undirectly orbital self-consistency, we search for the main periodic orbits and studied the density response. For pitch angles up to approximately ∼ 20, the response supports closely the potential permitting readily the presence of long lasting spiral structures. The density response tends to "avoid" larger pitch angles in the potential, by keeping smaller pitch angles in the corresponding response. Spiral arms with pitch angles larger than ∼ 20, would not be long-lasting structures but rather transient. On the other hand, from an extensive orbital study in phase space, we also find that for <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> with pitch angles larger than ∼ 50, chaos becomes pervasive destroying the ordered phase space surrounding the main stable periodic and quasi-periodic orbits and even destroying them.

40|$|We use Bayesian {{statistics}} and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to construct dynamical {{models for the}} spiral galaxy NGC 6503. The constraints include surface brightness profiles which display a Freeman Type II structure; HI and ionized gas rotation curves; the stellar rotation, which is nearly coincident with the ionized gas curve; and the line of sight stellar dispersion, with a sigma-drop at the centre. The galaxy models consist of a Sersic bulge, an exponential disc with an optional inner truncation and a cosmologically motivated dark halo. The Bayesian/MCMC technique yields the joint posterior probability distribution function for the input parameters. We examine several interpretations of the data: the Type II surface brightness profile {{may be due to}} dust extinction, to an inner truncated disc or to a ring of bright stars; and we test separate fits to the gas and stellar rotation curves to determine if the gas traces the gravitational potential. We test each of these scenarios for bar stability, ruling out dust extinction. We also find that the gas likely does not trace the gravitational potential, since the predicted stellar rotation curve is then inconsistent with the observed stellar rotation curve. The disc is well fit by an inner-truncated profile, but the possibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the Type II profile is also a realistic model. We further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with gamma > 1; the bulge has a lower M/L than the disc, suggesting a star forming component in the centre of the galaxy; and the bulge, as expected for this <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy,</b> has a low Sersic index with n_b~ 1 - 2, suggesting a formation history dominated by secular evolution.

40|$|Context. The {{evolution}} of quasar host galaxies is still hardly studied at high redshifts (z> 2), {{although this is}} a very interesting redshift range as both the quasar activity and the star formation rate density have their peak at z≈ 2 – 3. This makes is especially interesting to study properties of quasar host galaxies, such as the star formation rate or the black hole mass at this redshift. A proper classification of quasar host galaxies at high redshift would help to answer the question which role quasars play in galaxy evolution. Aims. In this paper we study different properties of quasars and their host galaxies at high redshifts up to z≈ 3. 4. We compare our results to those of other authors and discuss the correlation between galaxy evolution and quasar activity. Methods. We analysed broad-band images in eight filters (from U to K) of eight quasars in the FORS Deep Field with redshifts between z= 0. 87 and z= 3. 37. A fully 2 -dimensional decomposition was carried out to detect and resolve the host galaxies. Using the magnitudes in different filters, we investigated the presumed galaxy type, galaxy age, star formation rate and the mass of the central black hole of the host galaxies. In addition, the masses of the central black hole for the whole sample were derived using the corresponding quasar spectra. Results. We were able to resolve the host galaxies of two out of eight quasars between z= 0. 87 and z= 2. 75. Additionally, two host galaxies were possibly resolved. Conclusions.

The distance to NGC 55 is again similar to the distance of NGC 300, adding support to the suggestion that these galaxies form a bound pair. 1 NGC 55 NGC 55 is a highly inclined (i= 85 ± 5 ◦) <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy</b> (SB(s) m) in the Sculptor Group. Its Holmberg radius is 20. ′ 2 and blue magnitude mB= 8. 42. Sculptor is a very loosely concentrated and almost freely expanding aggregate of galaxies of prolate shape which we view pole-on. It stretches from the outskirts of the Local Group at 1. 5 Mpc out to 5 Mpc. Besides the 5 main spiral galaxies, the Sculptor Group contains several dwarf galaxies (Jerjen et al. [1998]). NGC 55 is one of the 5 bright spiral galaxies of the Sculptor Group, which could be the one nearest to the Milky Way. Distance estimates for NGC 55 range from 1. 34 Mpc based on carbon stars (Pritchet et al. [1987]) to 1. 8 Mpc based on the Tully-Fisher relation (Karachentsev et al. [2003]).

Results: Galaxy properties and luminosity functions are estimated up to z˜ 1 for radio-loud and radio-quiet early and <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Radio-loud <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> show significantly redder colors than radio-quiet objects of the same class and this is related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies. We estimate the optical luminosity functions, stellar masses and star formation rate distributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a well defined control sample, finding that the probability of a galaxy to be a radio emitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. Radio-loud early <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> exhibit luminosity evolution in their bivariate radio-optical luminosity function, due to evolution in the radio-optical ratio.

Using spectra taken with the AAOmega spectrograph, I measure the radial velocities of over 100 stars, many of which are intermediate age carbon stars, {{in the direction of the}} dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. Kinematic analysis suggests that the carbon stars in the sample are associated with NGC 6822, and estimates of its radial velocity and galactic rotation are made from a star-by-star analysis of its carbon star population. I calculate a heliocentric radial velocity for NGC 6822 of - 51 _ 3 km s?? 1 and show that the population rotates with a mean rotation speed of 11 : 3 _ 2 : 1 km s?? 1 at a mean distance of 1. 1 kpc from the galactic centre, about a rotation axis with a position angle of 25 _ _ 14 _, as projected on the sky. This is close to the rotation axis of the HI gas disk and suggests that NGC 6822 is not a polar ring galaxy, but is dynamically closer to a <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxy.</b> However, the rotation axis is not aligned with the minor axis of the AGB isodensity profiles and this remains a mystery. Finally, further work is suggested which would examine stars in the galaxy outside the central sample for which I had data, to confirm my findings and to attempt to understand the misalignment of the rotation axis and isophotes. In addition, I suggest further work to constrain the dynamical mass of the galaxy, which up to now is not well determined...|$|E
40|$|We compute optical galaxy {{luminosity}} functions (GLFs) in the B, V, R, and I rest-frame bands {{for one of}} {{the largest}} medium-to-high-redshift (0. 4 < z < 0. 9) cluster samples to date in order to probe the abundance of faint galaxies in clusters. We also study how the GLFs depend on cluster redshift, mass, and substructure, and compare the GLFs of clusters with those of the field. We separately investigate the GLFs of blue and red-sequence (RS) galaxies to understand the evolution of different cluster populations. We find that the shapes of our GLFs are similar for the B, V, R, and I bands with a drop at the red GLF faint end that is more pronounced at high-redshift: alpha(red) ~ - 0. 5 at 0. 40 0. 1 at 0. 65 < z < 0. 90. The blue GLFs have a steeper faint end (alpha(blue) ~ - 1. 6) than the red GLFs, that appears to be independent of redshift. For the full cluster sample, blue and red GLFs intersect at M(V) = - 20, M(R) = - 20. 5, and M(I) = - 20. 3. A study of how <b>galaxy</b> <b>types</b> evolve with redshift shows that <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> appear to become early types between z ~ 0. 9 and today. Finally, the faint ends of the red GLFs of more massive clusters appear to be richer than less massive clusters, which is more typical of the lower redshift behaviour. Our results indicate that our clusters form at redshifts higher than z = 0. 9 from galaxy structures that already have an established red sequence. <b>Late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> then appear to evolve into early types, enriching the red-sequence between this redshift and today. This effect is consistent with the evolution of the faint end slope of the red-sequence and the <b>galaxy</b> <b>type</b> evolution that we find. Finally, faint galaxies accreted from the field environment at all redshifts might have replaced the blue <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> that converted into early types, explaining the lack of evolution in the faint end slopes of the blue GLFs.

40|$|We present {{clustering}} {{measurements for}} samples of galaxies selected by morphological type and luminosity from the recently completed Stromlo-APM Redshift Survey. Early <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> are clustered more strongly {{by a factor}} 3. 5 [...] 5. 5, than <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Low-luminosity galaxies are clustered more weakly {{by a factor of}} ∼ 2 than L^* and brighter galaxies on scales 1. Also the slope of the correlation function is steeper for low-luminosity galaxies, so that the amplitude is a factor 4 lower at 10. No difference, however, is seen between the clustering of L^* and more luminous galaxies, an observation which may be hard to reconcile with some theories of biased galaxy formation. Both redshift-space and real-space clustering estimates show a similar dependence on luminosity.

40|$|International audienceContext: Models {{of large}} scale {{structure}} formation predict {{the existence of}} preferential orientations for galaxies in clusters. Aims: We have searched for preferential orientations of very faint galaxies in the Coma cluster (down I_Vega ˜- 11. 5). Methods: By applying a deconvolution method to deep u* and I band images of the Coma cluster, {{we were able to}} recover orientations down to very faint magnitudes, close to the faintest dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster. Results: No preferential orientations are found in more than 95 % of the cluster area, and the brighter the galaxies, the fewer preferential orientations we detect. The minor axes of <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> are radially oriented along a northeast-southwest direction and are oriented in a north-south direction in the western X-ray substructures. For early <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> in the western regions showing significant preferential orientations, galaxy major axes tend to be oriented perpendicularly to the north-south direction. In the eastern significant region and close to NGC 4889, galaxy major axes also tend to point toward the two cluster dominant galaxies. In the southern significant regions, galaxy planes tend to be tangential with respect to the clustercentric direction, except close to (α= 194. 8, δ= 27. 65) where the orientation is close to - 15 deg. Early and <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{do not have the same}} behaviour regarding orientation. Conclusions: Considering various models, we give an interpretation which can account for the existence of preferential orientations for galaxies (e. g. the tidal torque model or interactions with the intra cluster medium). Part of the orientations of the minor axes of <b>late</b> <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> and of the major axes of early <b>type</b> <b>galaxies</b> can be explained by the tidal torque model applied both to cosmological filaments and local merging directions. Another part (close to NGC 4889) can be accounted for by collimated infalls. For early <b>type</b> <b>galaxies,</b> an additional region (α = 194. 8, δ = 27. 65) shows orientations that probably result from local processes involving induced star formation.
