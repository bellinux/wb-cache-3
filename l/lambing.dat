5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of <b>lambing</b> with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at <b>lambing</b> may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} {{period of about}} five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small <b>lambing</b> jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.|$|E

40|$|Three key {{questions}} regarding <b>lamb</b> promotion are addressed: (1) Have industry {{efforts to promote}} <b>lamb</b> shifted out the total demand for <b>lamb?</b> (2) Have any returns to producers achieved been greater {{than the cost of}} the promotion? (3) What has been the effect of <b>lamb</b> promotion on the <b>lamb</b> import share? The first question is addressed through an econometric analysis of the U. S. retail demand for <b>lamb</b> which takes into account the effects of <b>lamb</b> advertising and promotion expenditures. The results then are used to calculate a benefit-cost ratio for <b>lamb</b> promotion in answer to the second question. An econometric analysis of the import share of U.

5|$|After {{shearing}} ewes {{are typically}} placed in well sheltered paddocks that have good feed and water. Attention to ewes that are <b>lambing</b> {{varies according to}} the breed, size and locations of properties. Unless they are stud ewes it unlikely that they will receive intensive care. On stations with large paddocks there is a policy of non-interference. On other properties the mobs are inspected by stockmen at varying intervals to stand cast ewes and deal with dystocia. Producers also sometimes quietly drift pregnant ewes away from ewes that have already lambed, {{in order to prevent}} mis-mothering.|$|E
5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised <b>lambing</b> to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty <b>lambing.</b> However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of <b>lambing</b> with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and <b>lambing</b> indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy <b>lambing.</b>|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before <b>lambing,</b> to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after <b>lambing.</b> Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{identify}} physical and physiological differences between <b>lambs</b> of different birth ranks at birth, and to use this information to identify practical on-farm management strategies which could improve triplet-born <b>lamb</b> survival. Triplet-born <b>lambs,</b> especially the lightest-triplet-born <b>lambs,</b> not only had a greater capacity to lose heat but also had a reduced capacity to produce heat when compared to twin-born <b>lambs.</b> Due to their lighter birth weights, triplet-born <b>lambs</b> had lower plasma thyroxine (T 4) concentrations within the first 24 hours of life than twin-born <b>lambs,</b> and within twin- and triplet-born litters, the lightest- and medium-triplet-born <b>lambs</b> had greater plasma lactate concentrations than all twin-born <b>lambs</b> and the heaviest-triplet-born <b>lambs.</b> Independent of <b>lamb</b> birth weight, triplet-born <b>lambs</b> had lower plasma tri-iodothyronine (T 3) concentrations within five minutes of birth, and within twin- and triplet-born litters, the lightest- and medium-triplet-born <b>lambs</b> had lower plasma T 4 and T 3 concentrations within five minutes of birth than all twin-born <b>lambs</b> and the heaviest-triplet-born <b>lambs.</b> It was hypothesised that because triplet-born <b>lambs</b> had a lighter birth weight and lower plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, they would have inadequate thermoregulatory capabilities when compared to twin-born <b>lambs.</b> The lower rectal temperatures of triplet-born <b>lambs</b> within the first hour {{of life and the}} lower heat production on a per <b>lamb</b> basis at 24 to 36 hours of age, and the lack of difference in maximum heat production on a per kg of birth weight basis at 24 to 36 hours of age support this hypothesis. Two practical on-farm management strategies trialled in this thesis to improve triplet-born <b>lamb</b> thermoregulation were offering concentrate supplement during late pregnancy to improve <b>lamb</b> birth weights, and maternal iodine supplementation to improve <b>lamb</b> plasma thyroid hormone concentrations. While offering concentrate showed positive effects such as increasing <b>lamb</b> birth weights, colostrum uptake and triplet-born <b>lamb</b> heat production on a per kg of birth weight basis, the results were either inconsistent across experiments or between birth ranks suggesting additional work is required to determine the repeatability and cost effectiveness of these findings. Maternal iodine supplementation offered no iv | P a g e benefits in terms of <b>lamb</b> birth weights, plasma thyroid hormone concentrations or <b>lamb</b> heat production. Further investigations identified that <b>lamb</b> birth weights, thyroid hormone concentrations, glucose and NEFA concentrations are positively associated with maximum heat production at 24 to 36 hours of age. Practical on-farm management strategies which could target these physical and physiological factors may improve triplet-born <b>lamb</b> heat production, and therefore the survival rates of triplet-born <b>lambs...</b>|$|R
5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, <b>lambing</b> losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of <b>lambing</b> and strong mothering instincts.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, Vermont rams were {{imported}} into Australia from the U.S.; since many Australian stud men believed these sheep would improve wool cuts, their use spread rapidly.

25|$|Like many breeds of island sheep, Santa Cruz sheep are {{relatively}} small and extremely hardy: they are good foragers and need no assistance with <b>lambing.</b> However, because of the fine–wooled breeds that they are derived from, Santa Cruz sheep are unique among formerly feral island breeds in their medium to fine wool with a soft feel.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} {{the use of}} multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to <b>lambing.</b> Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.|$|E

40|$|All {{research}} {{was done at}} Oregon State University Sheep Center to help understand the effects of behavior on bottle fed <b>lambs.</b> In this study, we compared the behavior of bottle fed <b>lambs</b> verses mother fed <b>lambs</b> in three testing scenarios; the sociability test, the paired attachment test, and the mismatch attachment test. The tests sought {{to determine if a}} familiar human can serve as a secure base for <b>lambs</b> in a strange situation and, if given the choice. The tests were performed in an isolated area where the <b>lamb</b> was separated from its herd and could not see others. For the first test on sociability, there were 30 <b>lambs</b> used. We compared ten bottle fed Polypay <b>lambs</b> to ten mother fed Polpay <b>lambs.</b> We matched each bottle fed <b>lamb</b> up to a mother fed <b>lamb</b> similar in age, gender, and breed. When possible, paired individuals were siblings. In addition to the sociability tests, we also compared ten mother fed Suffolk <b>lambs</b> to the mother fed Polypay <b>lambs</b> to determine if different breeds behaved in similar ways. In the second test, the paired attachment, we gave the 20 Polypay <b>lambs</b> a choice to approach a human or their mother. The third test, mismatch attachment, the <b>lambs</b> choose between their own mother and a randomly selected ewe from the same heard.
