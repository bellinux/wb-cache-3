These differences lead persons to adapt the <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> by taking into account the learners profiles and their objectives. It is indispensable to annotate the <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> using additional information about the learner and the <b>learning</b> <b>content.</b> Therefore, we develop a cooperative system, where several authors work in acooperative manner, to create and edit educational content using multi-agent system.

Learning Content Management Systems (LCMSs) usually provide convenient authoring tools to help instructors to construct their <b>learning</b> <b>contents,</b> which may include static document such as powerpoint, word, pdf document and dynamic multimedia document such as video and audio files, and then integrate these <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> to provide learners with proper contents rendering through access devices. However, most of LCMSs are based on desktop computer environments, rather than mobile devices. Context-Sensitivity is an application of software system’s ability to sense and analyze context from various sources.

However, the creation of this <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> is usually done in specialized publishing platforms, that may lock in the content. This prevents the <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> from being discovered automatically, and hinders its uptake. A more general approach for authoring discover-able <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> is needed. We built a user-friendly authoring en-vironment for creating digital publications, enriched with multimedia and interactivity features. This authoring environment outputs the cre-ated content in open formats, independent of any publishing platform. We adjusted our authoring environment to create semantically enriched <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> using the RDFa syntax, without the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we show how well-structured and well-annotated digital <b>learning</b> <b>content</b> can be created and validated using our authoring en-vironment. The result is a discoverable publication in an open format, ready to be distributed as is, or ready to be imported in existing pub-lishing platforms...|$|R

40|$|Current {{teaching}} strategies mainly follow instructional or constructive pedagogical models. In instructional model <b>learning,</b> <b>contents</b> are authored {{for teaching and}} evaluation of a concept. Whilst in constructive model, a student is exposed to the learning environment {{that allows him to}} learn new concepts, and his actions provide an evaluation of his under-standing of the concept. Manual authoring of such <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> not only requires spe-cialized skills, thinking and dedication, but they also take large amount of time. Similarly within instructional environment, authoring any new content that supports the current teaching activity is very difficult. This paper presents an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that facilitates the authoring of <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> for both instructional and constructive {{teaching strategies}}. Proposed ITS uses semantic web formalism, namely ontology, for knowledge representation. This work shows that ontologies correctly and consistently mod-els the domain knowledge that supports pedagogical activities, software development activi-ties, ITS user friendly interface and provides robust reasoning facility for creation of dy-namic contents. The proposed ITS provides authoring facility explicitly for teaching cogni-tive skills such as classification, relatedness, comparison (sequencing, discrimination, size etc) and reasoning. With the use of ontologies, cognitive skills are translated into con-cepts/classes and properties/roles with restrictions. Reasoning and inference provided by on-tologies are used for dynamic authoring of <b>learning</b> <b>contents.</b> Finally evaluation of proposed ITS is conducted for its correctness and consistency of domain knowledge, usability and ef-ficiency & effectiveness of contents authoring...|$|E
