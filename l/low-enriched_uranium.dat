25|$|In 1987–88, Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Iran to help in converting the reactor from highly enriched uranium fuel to 19.75% <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium,</b> and to supply the <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> to Iran. According to a report by the Argentine justice in 2006, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the US pressured Argentina to terminate its nuclear cooperation with Iran, and from early 1992 to 1994 negotiations between Argentina and Iran took place with the aim of re-establishing the three agreements made in 1987–88. Some have linked attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the AMIA bombing as part of an Iranian campaign to pressure Argentina into honoring the agreements. The uranium was delivered in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the IAEA report, several {{news reports}} {{suggested}} that Iran {{had failed to}} properly report the amount of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> it possessed because Iranian estimates did not match the IAEA inspector's findings, and that Iran now had enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The reporting was widely criticized as unjustifiably provocative and hyped. In response to the controversy, IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming asserted that the IAEA had {{no reason at all}} to believe that the estimates of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> produced by Iran were an intentional error, and that no nuclear material could be removed from the facility for further enrichment to make nuclear weapons without the agency's knowledge since the facility is subject to video surveillance and the nuclear material is kept under seal.|$|E
25|$|The {{parent nuclide}} of Tc-99m, Mo-99, is mainly {{extracted}} for medical purposes from the fission products created in neutron-irradiated U-235 targets, {{the majority of}} which is produced in five nuclear research reactors around the world using highly enriched uranium (HEU) targets. Smaller amounts of 99Mo are produced from <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> {{in at least three}} reactors.|$|E
50|$|The Megatons to Megawatts {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 1993 and completed on schedule in December 2013. A total of 500 tonnes of Russian warhead grade HEU (equivalent to 20,008 nuclear warheads) were converted in Russia to nearly 15,000 tonnes tons of LEU (low enriched uranium) {{and sold to}} the US for use as fuel in American nuclear power plants. The program was {{the largest and most}} successful nuclear non-proliferation program to date. The first nuclear power plant to receive <b>low-enriched</b> fuel containing <b>uranium</b> under this program was the Cooper Nuclear Station in 1998. During the 20-year Megatons to Megawatts program, as much as 10 percent of the electricity produced in the United States was generated by fuel fabricated using LEU from Russian HEU.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} the work done by the Nuclear Technology Programs of the Chemical Technology Division, Argonne National Laboratory, in the period October 1988 [...] March 1989. These programs involve R&D in three areas: applied physical chemistry, separation science and technology, and nuclear waste management. The work in applied physical chemistry includes investigations into the processes that control the release and transport of fission products under accident-like conditions, the thermophysical properties of metal fuel and blanket materials of the Integral Fast Reactor, and the properties of selected materials in environments simulating those of fusion energy systems. In the area of separation science and technology, {{the bulk of the}} effort is concerned with developing and implementing processes for the removal and concentration of actinides from waste streams contaminated by transuranic elements. Another effort is concerned with examining the feasibility of substituting <b>low-enriched</b> for high-enriched <b>uranium</b> in the production of fission product {sup 99 }Mo. In the area of waste management, investigations are underway on the performance of materials in projected nuclear repository conditions to provide input to the licensing of the nation`s high-level waste repositories. 127 refs., 76 figs., 103 tabs...|$|R
5000|$|Low power pool-type {{reactors}} {{such as the}} SLOWPOKE and TRIGA {{have been}} licensed for unattended operation in research environments because as {{the temperature of the}} <b>low-enriched</b> (19.75% U-235) <b>uranium</b> alloy hydride fuel rises, the molecular bound hydrogen in the fuel cause the heat to be transferred to the fission neutrons as they are ejected. [...] This Doppler shifting or spectrum hardening dissipates heat from the fuel more rapidly throughout the pool the higher the fuel temperature increases ensuring rapid cooling of fuel whilst maintaining a much lower water temperature than the fuel. Prompt, self-dispersing, high efficiency hydrogen-neutron heat transfer rather than inefficient radionuclide-water heat transfer ensures the fuel cannot melt through accident alone. In uranium-zirconium alloy hydride variants, the fuel itself is also chemically corrosion resistant ensuring a sustainable safety performance of the fuel molecules throughout their lifetime. A large expanse of water and the concrete surround provided by the pool for high energy neutrons to penetrate ensures the process has a high degree of intrinsic safety. The core is visible through the pool and verification measurements can be made directly on the core fuel elements facilitating total surveillance and providing nuclear non-proliferation safety. Both the fuel molecules themselves and the open expanse of the pool are passive safety components. Quality implementations of these designs are arguably the safest nuclear reactors.|$|R
25|$|<b>Low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) has a {{lower than}} 20% {{concentration}} of 235U; for instance, in commercial light water reactors (LWR), the most prevalent power reactors in the world, uranium is enriched to 3 to 5% 235U. Fresh LEU used in research reactors is usually enriched 12% to 19.75% U-235, the latter concentration being used to replace HEU fuels when converting to LEU.|$|E
25|$|The United States Enrichment Corporation {{has been}} {{involved}} in the disposition of a portion of the 174.3 tonnes of highly enriched uranium (HEU) that the U.S. government declared as surplus military material in 1996. Through the U.S. HEU Downblending Program, this HEU material, taken primarily from dismantled U.S. nuclear warheads, was recycled into <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) fuel, used by nuclear power plants to generate electricity.|$|E
25|$|Depleted uranium has an {{even higher}} {{concentration}} of the 238U isotope, and even <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU), while having {{a higher proportion of}} the uranium-235 isotope (in comparison to depleted uranium), is still mostly 238U. Reprocessed uranium is also mainly 238U, with about as much uranium-235 as natural uranium, a comparable proportion of uranium-236, and much smaller amounts of other isotopes of uranium such as uranium-234, uranium-233, and uranium-232.|$|E
40|$|With the {{shutdown}} of the Hanford PUREX (Plutonium-Uranium Extraction Plant) reprocessing {{plant in the}} 1970 s, adequate storage capacity for spent Hanford N Reactor fuel elements in the K and N Reactor pools became a concern. To maximize space utilization in the pools, accounting for fuel burnup was considered. Fuel that had experienced a neutron environment in a reactor is known as spent, exposed, or irradiated fuel. In contrast fuel {{that has not yet}} been placed in a reactor is known as green, unexposed, or unirradiated fuel. Calculations indicated that at typical fuel exposures for N Reactor, the spent-fuel critical mass would be twice the critical mass for green fuel. A decision was reached to test the calculational result with a definitive experiment. If the results proved positive, storage capacity could be increased and N Reactor operation could be prolonged. An experiment to be conducted in the N Reactor spent-fuel storage pool was designed and assembled (References 1 and 2) and the services of the Battelle Northwest Laboratories (BNWL) (now Pacific Northwest National Laboratory [PNNL]) critical mass laboratory were procured for the measurements (Reference 3). The experiments were performed in April 1975 in the Hanford N Reactor fuel storage pool. The fuel elements were MKIA fuel assemblies, comprised of two concentric tubes of <b>low-enriched</b> metallic <b>uranium.</b> Two separate sets of measurements were performed: one with unirradiated fuel and one with irradiated fuel. Both the unirradiated and irradiated fuel, were measured in the same geometry. The spent-fuel MKIA assemblies had an average burnup of 2865 MWd (megawatt days) /t. A constraint was imposed restricting the measurements to a subcritical limit of k{sub eff} = 0. 97. Subcritical count rate data was obtained with pulsed-neutron and approach-to-critical measurements. Ten (10) configurations with green fuel and nine (9) configurations with spent fuel are described and evaluated. Of these, three (3) green fuel and four (4) spent fuel loading configurations were considered to serve as benchmark models. However, shortcomings in experimental data, such as the uncertainty in fuel exposure impact on reactivity and the pulse neutron data evaluation methodology, failed to meet the high standards for a benchmark problem. Nevertheless, the data provided by these subcritical measurements supply useful information to analysts evaluating spent fuel subcriticality. The original purpose of the subcritical measurements was to validate computer model predictions that spent N Reactor fuel of a particular, typical exposure (2740 MWd/t) had a critical mass equal to twice that of unexposed fuel of the same type. The motivation for performing this work was driven by the need to increase spent fuel storage limits. These subcritical measurements confirmed the computer model predictions...|$|R
40|$|The REIMEP- 22 inter-laboratory {{comparison}} {{aimed at}} determining the production date of a uranium certified test sample (i. e. the last chemical separation {{date of the}} material). Participants in REIMEP- 22 on "U Age Dating - Determination of the production date of a uranium certified test sample" received one <b>low-enriched</b> 20 mg <b>uranium</b> sample for mass spectrometry measurements and/or one 50 mg uranium sample for D-spectrometry measurements, with an undisclosed value for the production date. They were asked to report the isotope amount ratios n(230 Th) /n(234 U) for the 20 mg uranium sample and/or the activity ratios A(230 Th) /A(234 U) for the 50 mg uranium sample {{in addition to the}} calculated production date of the certified test samples with its uncertainty. Reporting of the 231 Pa/ 235 U ratio and the respective calculated production date was optional. Eleven laboratories reported results in REIMEP- 22. Two of them reported results for both the 20 mg and 50 mg uranium certified test samples. The measurement capability of the participants was assessed against the independent REIMEP- 22 reference value by means of z- and zeta-scores in compliance with ISO 13528 : 2005. Furthermore a performance assessment criterion for acceptable uncertainty was applied to evaluate the participants' results. In general, the REIMEP- 22 participants' results were satisfactory. This confirms the analytical capabilities of laboratories to determine accurately the age of uranium materials with low amount of ingrown thorium (young certified test sample). The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC- JRC) organised REIMEP- 22 in parallel to the preparation and certification of a uranium reference material certified for the production date (IRMM- 1000 a and IRMM- 1000 b).

40|$|Systematic {{procedures}} {{have been devised}} and applied to evaluate core design and fuel management strategies for improving uranium utilization in Pressurized Water Reactors operated on a once-through fuel cycle. A principal objective has been the evaluation of suggested improvements on a self-consistent basis, allowing for concurrent changes in dependent variables such as core leakage and batch power histories, which might otherwise obscure the sometimes subtle effects of interest. Two levels of evaluation have been devised: a simple but accurate analytic model based on the observed linear variations in assembly reactivity {{as a function of}} burnup; and a numerical approach, embodied in a computer program, which relaxes this assumption and combines it with empirical prescriptions for assembly (or batch) power as a function of reactivity, and core leakage as a function of peripheral assembly power. State-of-the-art physics methods, such as PDQ- 7, were used ! to verify and supplement these techniques. These methods have been applied to evaluate several suggested improvements: (1) axial blankets of <b>low-enriched</b> or depleted <b>uranium,</b> and of beryllium metal, (2) radial natural uranium blankets, (3) low-leakage radial fuel management, (4) high burnup fuels, (5) optimized H/U atom ratio, (6) annular fuel, and (7) mechanical spectral shift (i. e. variable fuel-to-moderator ratio) concepts such as those involving pin pulling and bundle reconstitution. The potential savings in uranium requirements compared to current practice were found to be as follows: (1) O 0 - 3 %, (2) negative, (3) 2 - 3 %; possibly 5 %, (4) " 15 %, (5) 0 - 2. 5 %, (6) no inherent advantage, (7) 10 %. Total savings should not be assumed to be additive; and thermal/hydraulic or mechanical design restrictions may preclude full realization of some of the potential improvements.

Their comments countered ones made earlier by an Israeli general and Maples said the United States was arriving at different conclusions from the same facts.|$|E
25|$|After {{one year}} of {{operations}} in the Canal Zone, the MH-1A reactor had to be refueled, a process which took one week (17–25 October 1969), according to a 1969 Corps of Engineers report. According to a 2001 report by the Federation of American Scientists, the MH-1A reactor had {{a total of five}} cores during its operational life. It used <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) in the range of 4 to 7 %, with a total amount of uranium-235 supplied being 541.4kilograms (for the five cores).|$|E
25|$|RBMK reactor fuel {{was used}} in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> oxide fuel. The fuel {{elements}} in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit back-to-back on each fuel channel, pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for control rod modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E
25|$|All {{reactors}} {{continue to}} use <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> as the nuclear fuel; however, there have been plans drafted by TEPCO to use MOX fuel {{in some of the}} reactors by the permission of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC). A public referendum in the Kariwa village in 2001 voted 53% against use of the new fuel. After the 2002 TEPCO data fabrication scandals, the president at the time, Nobuya Minami, announced that plans to use the MOX fuel at the KK plant would be suspended indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{initiative}} {{failed to win}} support of the five permanent members (P-5) of the United Nations Security Council. One reason cited was that the agreed-upon quantity of 1,200 kilograms was considered too low {{because it did not}} take into account Iran’s accumulation of a larger amount of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> in the time since the IAEA first proposed the agreement, in late 2009. Additionally, the Tehran Declaration did not address Iran’s production of 20%-enriched uranium. Thus, the United States and other Western powers worried that this agreement did not require Iran to curtail its enrichment program or even resolve outstanding questions about the possible military purposes of its nuclear activities. Shortly after the deal was announced, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the P-5 had agreed on a draft text for a new set of sanctions on Iran.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{reactors}} (the {{most common}} type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or thermal neutrons to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain neutron moderator materials that slow neutrons until their neutron temperature is thermalized, that is, until their kinetic energy approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher cross-section (probability) of fissioning the fissile nuclei uranium-235, plutonium-239, and plutonium-241, and a relatively lower probability of neutron capture by uranium-238 (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> or even natural uranium fuel. The moderator is often also the coolant, usually water under high pressure to increase the boiling point. These are surrounded by a reactor vessel, instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, radiation shielding, and a containment building.|$|E
500|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} plant {{was the most}} complicated of all from an engineering point of view. Uranium hexafluoride gas was pumped into a cascade, becoming richer in uranium-235 at each stage as it passed {{through a series of}} membranes. Procuring the nickel powder used by the Manhattan Project was not a problem, as it came from a British firm. Once again, a Royal Ordnance Factory was chosen as the site, in this case ROF Capenhurst at Capenhurst, near Chester, which had the advantage of being only [...] from Risley. One decision was that instead of producing uranium hexafluoride using elemental fluorine, which was difficult and hazardous to transport, it was produced at Springfields from chlorine trifluoride. This process was untried and did not work properly, and when production commenced in February 1952, the hexafluoride plant did not perform adequately. It had to be redesigned at a cost of £250,000. The {{gaseous diffusion}} plant at Capenhurst, which cost £14 million, started production in 1953, but only produced <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium,</b> and did not produce highly enriched uranium until 1954. By 1957 it was capable of producing 125kg of highly enriched uranium per annum. British designs at this time used large amounts of enriched uranium; 87kg for Green Bamboo, 117kg for Orange Herald. At the end of 1961, having produced between 3.8 and 4.9 tonnes of highly enriched uranium, it was switched over to <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> production for civil nuclear power.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, the IAEA {{issued a}} report that Iran had {{declared}} production of over 2.5 metric tons of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium,</b> which would be enough if further enriched to make two nuclear weapons, and that Iran has refused to answer inspectors’ questions {{on a variety of}} activities, including what the agency called the [...] "possible military dimensions" [...] of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{according}} to Harvard professor Matthew Bunn: [...] "The Russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond 2013. We've managed {{to set it}} up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> for reactors from scratch. But there are other ways {{to set it up}} that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iran had {{installed}} several new centrifuges, including more advanced models, and environmental samples showed the centrifuges [...] "continued {{to operate as}} declared", making <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium.</b> The report also noted that other elements of Iran's nuclear program continued {{to be subject to}} IAEA monitoring and safeguards as well, including the construction of the heavy water facility in Arak, the construction and use of hot cells associated with the Tehran Research Reactor, the uranium conversion efforts, and the Russian nuclear fuel delivered for the Bushehr reactor.|$|E
2500|$|Terrestrial Energy Inc. (TEI), a Canadian-based company, is {{developing}} a DMSR design called the Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR). The IMSR {{is designed to be}} deployable as a small modular reactor (SMR) and will be constructed in three configurations ranging from 80 to 600 MW. With high operating temperatures, the IMSR has applications in industrial heat markets as well as traditional power markets. The main design features include neutron moderation from graphite, fueling with <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> and a compact and replaceable Core-unit. [...] The latter feature permits the operational simplicity necessary for industrial deployment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the {{engineering}} technology division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory published a paper entitled [...] "Conceptual Design Characteristics of a Denatured Molten-Salt Reactor with Once-Through Fueling." [...] In it, the authors [...] "examine the conceptual feasibility of a molten-salt power reactor fueled with denatured uranium-235 (i.e. with <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium)</b> and operated {{with a minimum}} of chemical processing." [...] The main priority behind the design characteristics is proliferation resistance. Lessons learned from past projects and research at ORNL were considered. Although the DMSR can theoretically be fueled partially by thorium or plutonium, fueling solely with low enriched uranium (LEU) helps maximize proliferation resistance.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, the IAEA {{reported}} that Iran had increased its {{rate of production}} of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> enriched to 3.5% and to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched to 19.75%, but was having difficulty with more advanced centrifuges. [...] The IAEA also reported detecting particles of uranium enriched to 27% at the Fordu enrichment facility. However, a diplomat in Vienna cautioned that the spike in uranium purity found by inspectors {{could turn out to}} be accidental. This change drastically moved Iran's uranium toward bomb-grade material. Until now, the highest level of purity that had been found in Iran was 20 percent.|$|E
2500|$|The TRIGA reactor uses UZrH fuel, {{which has}} a prompt {{negative}} fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, meaning that as {{the temperature of the}} core increases, the reactivity decreases—so it is highly unlikely for a meltdown to occur. Most cores that use this fuel are [...] "high leakage" [...] cores where the excess leaked neutrons can be utilized for research. TRIGA fuel was originally designed to use highly enriched uranium, however in 1978 the U.S. Department of Energy launched its Reduced Enrichment for Research Test Reactors program, which promoted reactor conversion to <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> fuel. A total of 35 TRIGA reactors have been installed at locations across the USA. A further 35 reactors have been installed in other countries.|$|E
2500|$|In {{exchange}} for suspending its enrichment program, Iran {{has been offered}} [...] "a long-term comprehensive arrangement which would allow {{for the development of}} relations and cooperation with Iran based on mutual respect and the establishment of international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program." [...] However, Iran has consistently refused to give up its enrichment program, arguing that the program is necessary for its energy security, that such [...] "long term arrangements" [...] are inherently unreliable, and would deprive it of its inalienable right to peaceful nuclear technology. In June 2009, in the immediate wake of the disputed [...] Iranian presidential election, Iran initially agreed to a deal to relinquish its stockpile of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> in return for fuel for a medical research reactor, but then backed out of the deal. [...] Currently, thirteen states possess operational enrichment or reprocessing facilities, and several others have expressed an interest in developing indigenous enrichment programs. Iran's position was endorsed by the Non-Aligned Movement, which expressed concern about the potential monopolization of nuclear fuel production.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 May 2010 Iran, Brazil, and Turkey {{issued a}} joint {{declaration}} [...] "in which Iran agreed to send <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> to Turkey {{in return for}} enriched fuel for a research reactor." [...] Iran reported the joint declaration to the IAEA on 24 May 2010, asking it to inform the [...] "Vienna Group" [...] (the United States, Russia, France, and the IAEA), in order to conclude a written agreement and make contingent arrangements between Iran and the Vienna Group. The proposal was welcomed by Arab leaders and China. France's Prime Minister called the agreement a [...] "positive step" [...] toward resolving the Iran nuclear program dispute, if Iran were to cease uranium enrichment altogether. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton played down the agreement, saying it was {{a step in the}} right direction but did not go far enough and left questions unanswered. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the proposal had [...] "a number of deficiencies," [...] including Iran's intention to continue enriching uranium to high levels.|$|E
2500|$|Estimating when Iran might {{possibly}} achieve nuclear [...] "breakout" [...] capability, defined as having produced a sufficient quantity of {{highly enriched uranium}} to fuel a weapon – if a working design for one existed and the political decision to assemble it was made – is uncertain. [...] A detailed analysis by physicists at the Federation of American Scientists concludes that such an estimate {{would depend on the}} total number and overall efficiency of the centrifuges Iran has in operation, and the amount of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> it has stockpiled to serve as [...] "feedstock" [...] for a possible high-enrichment program. A 23 March 2012 U.S. Congressional Research Service report quotes 24 February 2012 IAEA report saying that Iran has stockpiled 240 pounds of 20-percent-enriched uranium – an enrichment level necessary for medical applications – as an indication of their capacity to enrich to higher levels. The authoritarian political culture of Iran may pose additional challenges to a scientific program requiring cooperation among many technical specialists. Some experts argue that the intense focus on Iran's nuclear program detracts from a need for broader diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic. U.S. intelligence agency officials interviewed by The New York Times in March 2012 said they continued to assess that Iran had not restarted its weaponization program, which the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate said Iran had discontinued in 2003, although they have found evidence that some weaponization-related activities have continued. The Israeli Mossad reportedly shared this belief.|$|E
2500|$|In December, the ISIS {{said that}} Iran had {{produced}} 425 kilograms of uranium, and that Iran had [...] "not yet achieved a break-out capability", but that Iran may {{be close to}} a break-out capability. In response to statements that Iran had enough material to make a weapon, the Arms Control Association urged the U.S. and the media to exhibit greater care when making claims about Iran's nuclear program. Ivan Oelrich and Ivanka Barzashka, from the Federation of American Scientists, said that the [...] "simplistic calculations" [...] contained in the ISIS article were wrong because [...] "just taking the quantity of LEU and multiplying by the U-235 concentration does not work because {{not all of the}} U-235 is recovered". Cheryl Rofer, a retired 35 year researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and former president of the Los Alamos Committee on Arms Control and International Security, has argued that for Iran to make a bomb from this material it would need to kick all the inspectors out of the country, reconfigure thousands of closely watched centrifuges, and then engage in years of enrichment. According to the American Institute of Physics, the most difficult step in building a nuclear weapon is the production of fissile material. Iran has enriched uranium to [...] "less than 5%", consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and well below the purity of WEU (around 90%) typically used in a weapons program. HEU with a purity of 20% or more is usable in a weapon, but this route is less desirable because far more material is required to obtain critical mass. [...] "Our production of a nuclear energy program is completely within the framework or structure of international laws," [...] said Ali Akbar Javanfekr, media adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. David Albright, president of the group which published the report, maintained that Iran's enriched uranium meant that Israel was losing control over the timing of Iran's nuclear activities and that even Iran pretending to have a bomb would be a threat. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its inspectors have not found evidence to suggest that Iran is attempting to process <b>low-enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> into weapons-grade uranium, but expressed concern that Iran was still refusing to comply with the United Nation's requirement of ending its uranium enrichment activity.|$|E
50|$|After the Iranian Revolution the United States cut off {{the supply}} of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel for the TRR, which forced the reactor {{to be shut down}} for a number of years.
