Thus, birds inhabiting different environments may experience divergent selection for nest structure and composition that results in intraspecific geographic variation in nest architecture. We describe interpopulation differences in nest architecture among Thorn-tailed Rayaditos (Aphrastura spinicauda) in 2 contrasting environments near the species’ distribution limits: a temperate and very humid environment in north-central Chile (the forest relicts of Fray Jorge National Park; 308380 S, 718400 W) and a cold and windy sub-Antarctic environment {{in the south of}} Chile (Isla Navarino; 55840 S, 678400 W). We collected a total of 62 nests from Fray Jorge and 61 nests from Navarino in 2013 and 2014, measured their dimensions, and quantified their constitutive materials. We tested the nests’ thermal properties (simulating heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> and conduction) and hygroscopic features (water absorption and water loss capacity) and used general linear models to (1) compare these properties between populations and (2) test for a relationship between nest morphology and function. Nests from the northern population exhibited lower rates of heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> because they were larger and had a lower ratio of surface area to volume; these nests also absorbed less water, probably because of their greater content of plant-derived materials. In the southern population, nests were more compact and better insulated with feathers and hairs, with lower rates of heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> conduction. By separately analyzing the roles of convection, conduction, and humidity, our results suggest that potential trade-offs (insulation–humidity) could be differently affecting the nest building behavior of these populations.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the thermal influence of the heat transfer by convection and radiation during GTA (gas tungsten arc) welding process. The authors’ in-house C++ previously-developed code was modified to calculate the amount of heat transfer by convection and radiation. In this software, an iterative Broydon-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) inverse method was applied to estimate the amount of heat delivered to the plate when the appropriate sensitivity criteria were defined. The methodology was validated by accomplishing lab-controlled experiments on stainless steel AISI 304 L and aluminum 6065 T 5 plates. Due to some experimental singularities, the forced thermal convection induced by the electromagnetic field and thermal-capillary force were disregarded. Significant examples of these singularities are the relatively small weld bead when compared to the sample size and the reduced time of the welding process. In order to evaluate the local Nusselt number, empirical correlations for flat plates were used. The thermal emission was a dominant cooling effect on the aluminum cooling. However, it did not present the same behavior as the stainless steel samples. The study found that the heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> and radiation of the weld pool do not affect the cooling process significantly...|$|E

The different quasi-analytical methods, which used an iterative method {{such as the}} Newton–Raphson {{for the evaluation of}} an undetermined parameter, are applied mostly for nonlinear problems.

The contribution of the present work is to present close-form series solution of the homogeneous extended surface heat diffusion equation using the differential transform method. This can be a useful strategy in developing an analytical solution when designing practical extended surfaces with suitable geometry for temperature response. The proposed differential transform solution uses a set of mathematical operations to transform the heat conduction equation together with the fin profile in order to yield a close-form series of homogeneous extended surface heat diffusion equation which avoid using an iterative method. The homogeneous extended surfaces in the forms of longitudinal fins of rectangular and triangular profiles and pins of cylindrical and conical profiles are attached to a primary surface at constant temperature heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> to the surrounding medium and where the heat loss from the tip of the extended surfaces is assumed to be negligible.

40|$|In {{order to}} asses a priori {{the outcome of}} a laser {{machining}} process using either simplistic ad hoc or sophisticated models, knowledge is needed of the energy required to remove a unit mass of material. Since laser-material interactions involve vaporization, decomposition, ejection of fragments, plasma initiation and expansion, etc., extrapolating enthalpy data from JANAF tables will result in significant uncertainty. In this paper, an experimental setup to measure this “heat of removal ” is described. The apparatus mainly consists of an integrating sphere for the sample and a second integrating sphere for reference. The specimen is mounted {{at the center of the}} sample sphere, and is heated by a CO 2 or Nd:YAG laser, whose beam is split, with a part of the beam going into the reference sphere, to monitor the temporal laser power. The energy reflected by the specimen inside the sample sphere is recorded by a second detector. Combining these data, the total absorbed energy may be deduced. For this type of measurement,energy <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> and radiation are generally negligible,while conduction losses may be substantial. In order to minimize conduction losses, the specimens are manufactured to a thickness of less than 500 m. Still, conduction losses may account for up to 10 - 20 percent of the total laser energy for CW and conventionally pulsed lasers even for such thin samples. Thus, a numerical model is also employed to estimate the conduction losses and to correct the measured value of the “heat of removal. ” Experimental data have been obtained for CO 2 and Nd:YAG laser irradiation on graphite, hot-pressed silicon nitride and sintered -silicon carbide...|$|E

The temperature distribution in a PV module will also give rise to thermal stresses within the module. Hence {{it is important to}} determine the operating temperature of solar cells accurately. This paper describes the finite element thermal analysis of a typical PV module whereby the temperature distribution in each of the layers of the module is determined. The layers consist of a top glass cover, solar cells and bus bars, ethylvinylacetate (EVA) and Tedlar backsheet. To simulate the actual situation, the frame of the PV module is also modelled. Optical parameters for the reflectivity, transmissivity and absorptivity for the relevant layers are taken into account to determine the actual heat dissipation in the areas exposed directly to sunlight. Heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> and radiation are also included in the simulation. Temperature contour plots show that there is a temperature gradient across each layer, with the regions near the frame being significantly cooler. The temperature distribution across the cells in the centre of the module is found to be quite uniform, but that for the cells nearest to the frame encounters a 5 °C difference across each cell. The temperatures of the different layers are also compared and it is found that the difference is not more than 1 °C across the thickness of the PV module. As convection heat loss can be highly variable during operation, the effect of varying values of the convective heat loss coefficients at the surfaces of the module is also determined. This analysis provides an understanding of how the convection heat loss coefficient at the module surfaces affect the temperature of the solar cells and their efficiency...|$|E

Numerical simulations are performed on the upper region of a thin plate 316 stainless steel part, where experimental data indicates that a uniform temperature can be assumed {{at the base of}} this region. The time evolutions of the isotherms are calculated as the laser beam travels across the top surface of the part. The model dynamically updates the thermal boundary conditions with laser position, so it is able to calculate temperature profiles both far of and near the side edges of the plate. The effective laser power is determined by matching predicted with previously measured maximum temperature in the molten pool. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated and the measured temperature profiles. The model is then used to investigate the relative importance of different mechanisms of heat transfer (conduction, convection, and radiation) during the process.

In this study, three similar y-scale model buildings were constructed and surrounded with different landscapes: turf, rock mulch with a foundation planting of shrubs, and rock mulch with no plants. Irrigation water use and electricity required to power the three room-sized air conditioners and interior lights were measured for two approximately week-long periods. Electrical energy consumed for air-conditioning by the rock model was 20 - 30 % more than for the turf and shade models. Factors accounting for these differences in energy performance include dense shade that substantially reduced solar heat gain for the shaded model, a 16 % difference in longwave radiation flux between the rock and turf treatments, and a maximum drybulb depression of 4 °C over the turf compared with the rock. Air-conditioning savings exceeded water costs for shade treatments that were simulated to receive moderate and low amounts of irrigation water.

HWA consists of a wire sensor, a very fine element exposed to the fluid flow and of an electronic system, which performs the transformation of the sensor output into a useful electric signal. HWA is based on convective heat transfer from a heated wire which is placed into a fluid flow. The heat is generated inside the very fine wire owing to wire resistance when electrical current passes through it. Then, the wire will be subjected to heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection,</b> conduction and radiation depending on the flow condition. To examine the theory of operation for the heated wire and plot the temperature distribution along it, energy balance for HWA is investigated by taking differential element of dx length of the filament. In order to understand static and dynamic characteristics of hot-wire, all kinds of heat transfer such as convection, conduction and radiation are taken into consideration. In present thesis, the static study starts to investigate influence of the sensor parameters on general behavior of the constant temperature hot-wire anemometer analytically and numerically at varying conditions. Most important part {{of this study is that}} the time dependent differential equation for the heated wire is solved to determine sensitivity of hot-wire by a perturbation method in the event of a harmonically changing heat transfer coefficient. Moreover, the influence of thin supporting wires, or copper plated wire ends, is evaluated to see the effects of them on sensitivity and heat dissipation to the prongs. Another important parameter for wire sensor is the aspect ratio (L/d). Aspect ratio affects the time constant, sensitivity and temperature distribution of heated wire; hence it needs to be examined. Also, effect of the various velocities on the temperature distribution and sensitivity along the hot-wire has been studied...|$|E

Ten one day old pullets {{were randomly selected from}} hatching area of a commercial hatchery. Infrared images were used to calculate bird surface temperature. Exposure areas for the two conditions were quantified, and both air temperature and wind speed was recorded. Total sensible heat loss was calculated as heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> radiation plus heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection.</b> It was found that heat transfer occurs in different ways at different bird body parts.

However, when compounds with a very low molecular weight need to be separated, very dense PI membranes are required that generally have very low fluxes. It was previously shown for cellulose acetate membranes containing gold nanoparticles that the membrane permeance increased by photothermal heating of the membrane during filtrations. In this work, PI membranes were prepared containing different amounts of gold nanoparticles and the membranes were locally heated during filtrations by irradiation with continuous green laser light. The gold nanoparticles and the membrane structure were thoroughly characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy and diffuse reflection spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The photothermal heating effect on the temperature and the permeance behavior of the membrane depended on the concentration of gold nanoparticles in the membrane, their aggregation and on the laser intensity.

40|$|Alternate {{repetition}} of short fore- and backfiltrations reduces convective albumin loss. An effective therapeutic means to remove relatively large polypeptide uremic toxins {{seems to be}} a hemofiltration (HF) or hemodiafiltration (HDF) employing a larger-pore membrane, that is, a protein-permeable membrane. With either method, however, a significant amount of albumin will be lost into the ultrafiltrate or dialysate. Now, {{repetition of}} alternate short fore- and backfiltrations may prevent the development of the ultrafiltration-induced higher albumin concentration on the membrane surface (protein concentration polarization), where a single forefiltration time is shorter than the time needed for completion of protein concentration polarization. Since the albumin concentration on the protein-permeable membrane surface {{will be one of the}} determinants of albumin <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection,</b> such HDF treatment may reduce protein loss into the dialysate. To examine this assumption, we alternately repeated short and rapid fore- and backfiltrations (push/pull HDF) through a protein-permeable membrane, each less than 1 second in duration and at each filtration volume of 15 ml, where a pyrogen-free dialysate was supplied.

While some modifications {{are necessary to}} improve versatility, the facility proved to be most useful. Both an electron beam furnace and an electromagnetic levitation furnace can be used. The electron beam furnace is used with vacuum environments (0. 00001 torr), whereas the levitation furnace is presently used only in inert gas environments (above 100 torr).

Processing of lower melting point metals and alloys simply cannot be recorded.

In principle, the heat to electricity {{conversion efficiency}} of thermoelectric element {{has been defined as}} the electrical output power of the element divided by its thermal input power. Due to the heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> and radiation heat transfer the test result of the heat to electricity conversion efficiency has a large errors. The authors present a test method for heat to electricity conversion efficiency of thermoelectric unicouple. The thermal input power of thermoelectric unicouple has been divided into the electrical output power plus thermal output power out of the cold end of the unicouple. The later has been determined by a thermoelectric thermal power meter. The method avoids the difficulties to measure the input thermal power into the hot side of the unicouple, so that the convection and radiation heat lose out of the unicouple side can be ignored. Owing to Seebeck Coefficient of the thermoelectric semiconductor materials could be many times of the metals, the thermoelectric thermal power meter has high sensitivity, so that high test precision could be gained in test for conversion efficiency of thermoelectric unicouple.

That creates a heterogeneous temperature field around the crack tip. A thermo-mechanical model is proposed in this paper for evaluating the consequence of this temperature field on the Mode I stress intensity factor. Two cases are studied: (i) the theoretical problem of an infinite plate with a semi-infinite through crack under Mode I cyclic loading, and (ii) a finite specimen with a central through crack. In the first case, the main hypothesis and results are presented from the literature but no heat loss is taken into account. In second case, heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>convection</b> is taken into account with a finite element analysis, while an analytical solution exists in the literature for the first case.

The heat source within the reverse cyclic plastic zone is quantified by experiments on a mild steel under R= 0. 1. It is shown that the crack tip is under compression due to thermal stresses coming from the heterogeneous temperature field around the crack tip. The effect of this stress field on the stress intensity factor (its maximum, minimum and its range) is calculated.

Highest voltages are obtained at very high pressures and low current intensities. Theoretical model indicates that pressure increment causes an arc diameter reduction. This is due to the augmentation of radial heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> natural <b>convection</b> at arc fringes and by conduction due to a better energy transfer by neutral- electrons collisions. Surprisingly, the very high-pressure conditions seems having a stabilizing effect on the arc discharge...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{two phases}} model of air heating in {{bubbling}} fluidized bed of sand particles with concentrated solar radiation as {{source of energy}} is developed. This model {{is based on the}} Kato and Wen's model (1969) for the hydrodynamic aspect which was modified to take account the thermic aspect. Nine algebraic equations were established in permanent regime for different heat and mass balances as well as heat losses against surrounding media. The Newton Raphson's method was used to solve this system of equations. Results have shown that the model developed is able to predict the temperature profiles of gas and particles in the bubble and emulsion phases, the wall temperature along the reactor, the heat flux transferred to the bed and heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> forced <b>convection</b> and radiation to surrounding air. The effects of the fluidizing air velocity, total mass of particles and the wind velocity on the thermal behaviours were examined. Model predictions seem reasonable looking for its comparison agreement with bibliographical data...|$|R
