40|$|Weak axial {{variations}} in B(z) or φ(z) in “axisym-metric ” plasma traps cause {{a fraction of}} the particles to be trapped axially, with a velocity-space separatrix between trapped and passing populations. The trapped and passing particles experience different dynamics in response to a variety of θ-asymmetries in the E × B rotating plasma, so a discontinuity in the velocity-space distribution f(v) tends to form at the separatrix. Colli-sional scatterings thus cause large fluxes as they smooth the distribution in a boundary layer near the separatrix. In essence, this separatrix dissipation damps the AC or DC <b>longitudinal</b> <b>currents</b> induced by plasma waves or confinement field asymmetries. This trapped-particle-mediated damping and “neoclassical ” particle transport often dominates in cylindrical pure electron plasmas, and may be important in other nominally symmetric open systems.

It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular momentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is surrounded by plasma, and there is no <b>longitudinal</b> <b>current</b> in its magnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin, Gurevich & Istomin 1993, Mestel, Panagi & Shibata 1999).
