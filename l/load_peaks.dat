30|$|At the analyze tab, {{users are}} able to create charts to study data and to {{identify}} <b>load</b> <b>peaks.</b> Comparisons of different measurements and devices are possible. For example, one chart shows the amount of available data at database, in which the available data were put {{in relation to the}} amount of expected data. Different types of load peak charts are supported, which make it possible to identify <b>load</b> <b>peaks</b> from single devices or compare <b>load</b> <b>peaks</b> of several devices in one chart. In addition, there are charts simplifying the identification of regularities in the timing of load peak events. Devices are installed at the power grid, are viewed in a tree structure, which is constructed as the network plan. Charts were generated by selecting devices on the tree structure and choosing a chart type. The charts a user generated during his session were saved at database and loaded automatically at the next login.

30|$|Electrical {{power supply}} is demand-oriented {{to date and}} not {{flexible}} enough for the challenges described above. In the future, {{it will be necessary}} to change the energy demand according to power generation of renewable energy sources, which means that the regulation will be moved from electricity suppliers to the consumer’s side. Through suitable concepts of demand regulation and distribution, the power grid will be stabilized and optimized [8]. Possible concepts are demand side management and demand response, which are described in [9 – 11]. Demand side management techniques like load shifting and peak clipping are the most known approaches. At load shifting, the load is shifted from a peak period to an off-peak period without changing the total energy consumption of both periods, whereas at peak clipping, the load is reduced by reducing the power consumption [12]. To use these techniques, it is necessary to identify <b>load</b> <b>peaks</b> through analyzing power data from the grid. Based on analysis, an algorithm for shifting <b>load</b> <b>peaks</b> could be developed [13].|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{a method of}} calculation for modifying tooth profiles {{in order to reduce}} <b>load</b> <b>peaks</b> due to the increasing stiffness of pinion tooth caused by projections. The tooth stiffness of the pinion is increased by forming the tooth as a projection from the pinion, i. e. the wheel width is less than that of the pinion. The computer program is based on the finite element method. A study of the most important geometric parameters of gear teeth has been carried out and covers the range of usual spur gears. The study provided starting data from which approximate equations were derived. Favourable simple tooth edge modifications were determined for a number of different spur gears such as round flank modifications or bevelled modifications, which reduce <b>load</b> <b>peaks</b> {{as a result of the}} projections. Test stands have verified the calculation program. This thesis enables the 'FVA-Ritzelkorrekturprogramm' to consider the influence of projections on the load distribution at the line of contact.

40|$|The {{stick-slip}} {{effect is}} a quasi-static effect that can occur with every mass-spring system that is subjected to significant amount of friction forces. It {{is based on the}} difference between the static and kinetic friction coefficient. If the relative velocity between two objects is zero, the sliding object will normally encounter a larger friction force (static) than when the relative velocity is bigger than zero (kinetic). Under certain conditions this friction force can alternate between static and kinetic, which can cause jerky motions between the two sliding objects and finally high spring <b>load</b> <b>peaks.</b> In this study the stick-slip effects on a moored vessel in head-on ice conditions are studied.

In this context, different control strategies are introduced. To investigate indirect control via electricity tariffs, an electricity market analysis is conducted of a system with a high share of generation from renewable electricity sources. The analysis uses driving data collected from battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in a research project which means that real charging and driving behavior can be considered. The results show {{that it is difficult}} to implement smart charging based on economic arguments because the incentives from day-ahead electricity markets are relatively small. In addition, a novel, autonomous control approach is discussed for plug-in electric vehicles.
