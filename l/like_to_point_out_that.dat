She said differences of speech distinguish the members of one social class in England from another. The daughter of a Baron, she was therefore an [...] "Hon" [...] − honourable. Deborah Mitford Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire, the youngest of the famously (and sometimes infamously) unconventional Mitford sisters, wrote a letter to Encounter about the article saying: [...] "... as the co-founder, with my sister Jessica, of the Hons Club, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> ... the word Hon meant Hen in Honnish... We were very fond of chickens and on the whole preferred their company to that of human beings ...".|$|E

6000|$|Lister {{gazed at}} him almost incredulously. [...] "Of course, I'll have to go if you really mean it. Still, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in some respects you're not exactly a model yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "there was a {{time when}} I laughed rather more {{frequently}} than I do now. I should, however, <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the stick had not been in quite long enough." ...|$|E
30|$|We would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{the results}} of Theorems 3.1 – 3.4 remain true for the special {{resonant}} equation u'=f(t,u(t- τ (t))), where a(·)≡ 0.|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} we would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the equivalence of solutions and weak {{solutions for the}} generalized Navier-Stokes equations; this <b>point</b> is similar <b>to</b> {{the case of the}} Stokes equations.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} step inside for a moment, Mr. Pratt," [...] she went on, [...] "there are {{one or two}} little things I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you. The {{cupboard}} in Sybil's room--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{discussed}} those estimates at length already," [...] he said. [...] "I should, however, <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I consider them absurdly high. In fact, I'd undertake {{to do the}} work at not {{more than two-thirds of the}} cost." ...|$|E

"I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} be very slow work beating back up this inlet, and if we did so there isn't a stage across the island for several days.

60|$|And the {{essential}} thing I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> these authorities upon African questions {{is that not}} one of them even hints at any other formula which covers the broad essentials of the African riddle.|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{is a fact}} {{which we}} should not presume to dispute," [...] the lawyer admitted, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> on the next {{occasion}} {{when we had a}} little money in hand, your household steward, Mr. Harrison, was here in urgent need of a thousand pounds for the payment of domestic bills connected with the establishment in Grosvenor Square." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{case you}} felt {{justified}} in taking a skin or two," [...] continued Harry thoughtfully, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> as a rule, the Customs fellows don't trouble about a sloop {{the size of}} ours. We just run up to our moorings {{when we come back}} from a yachting trip, and there's a nice little nook forward which would just hold a bundle of those peltries.

50|$|An historian, {{as well as}} a linguist, Geraint Morgan <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> when he knew {{he would}} be the last MP for Denbigh, that the first MP for Denbigh had {{occupied}} the adjacent (literal) seat in Parliament in Westminster to the very last MP in Westminster for Calais.|$|R
30|$|We would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{here that}} Gillet et al. (2013) {{provided}} a global field model {{which includes a}} full error covariance of the Gauss coefficients. This model and any future model with specified error statistic knowledge are more appropriate for GDAS. However, we conjecture that (40) is sufficient for our current objectives.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} {{did not appear to}} notice the jibe. [...] "The fact is, we had a little dispute among ourselves," [...] he said. [...] "The views of the Committee didn't quite {{coincide}} with those of the rest, but since the Committee is not here I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Hoddam people have passed through the Dene without hindrance for at least twenty years, and as that gives them a legal right of way they mean to continue doing it. Now, if you will make no opposition we will promise that no damage whatever will be done to your property." ...|$|E
60|$|I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> this venture is one {{of great}} and almost of {{national}} importance, because if it fails {{then it will be}} practically proved {{that it is impossible to}} establish small holders on the land by artificial means, at any rate, in England, and at the present prices of agricultural produce. It is not often that a sum of £40,000 will be available for such a purpose, and with it the direction of a charitable Organization that seeks no profit, the oversight of an Officer as skilled and experienced as Lieut.-Colonel Hiffe, and, in addition, a trained Superintendent who will afford advice as to all agricultural matters, a co-operative society ready to hire out implements, horses and carts at cost price, and, if so desired, to undertake the distribution or marketing of produce. Still, notwithstanding all these advantages, I have my misgivings as to the ultimate result.|$|E
6000|$|... {250a} Here I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Mr. M'Lennan's {{theory was}} not so hard and fast as his manner (that of a very assured believer in his own ideas) may lead some inquirers to suppose. Sir Henry Maine writes, that both Mr. Morgan and Mr. M'Lennan 'seem to {{me to think that}} human society went {{everywhere}} through the same series of changes, and Mr. M'Lennan, at any rate, expresses himself as if all those stages could be clearly discriminated from one another, and the close of one and the commencement of another announced with the distinctness of the clock-bell telling the end of the hour.' On the other hand, I remember Mr. M'Lennan's saying that, in his opinion, 'all manner of arrangements probably went on simultaneously in different places.' In Studies in Ancient History, p. 127, he expressly guards against the tendency 'to assume that the progress of the various races of men from savagery has been a uniform progress: that all the stages which any of them has gone through have been passed in their order by all.' Still more to the point is his remark on polyandry among the very early Greeks and other Aryans; 'it is quite consistent with my view that in all these quarters (Persia, Sparta, Troy, Lycia, Attica, Crete, &c.) monandry, and even the patria potestas, may have prevailed at points.' ...|$|E

[...] said a new voice, with a transatlantic intonation, [...] "though I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> {{here and}} now, {{that things are}} getting a mite difficult. There's not the sympathy there was, and a growing {{disposition}} to let the Irish settle their own affairs without interference from America." ...|$|R

"We {{will let}} it go at that," [...] Francis commented, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you that the {{antagonism}} between us {{is in no way}} personal.
