50|$|Cornstarch was {{discovered}} in 1840 by Thomas Kingsford, superintendent of a wheat starch factory in Jersey City, New Jersey. Until 1851, corn starch was used primarily for <b>starching</b> <b>laundry</b> and other industrial uses.|$|R
50|$|Benson and Aspden {{purchased}} land {{beside the}} St. Lawrence River along the old Galop Canal in Cardinal in 1858 {{and built the}} first factory within the year. The village of Cardinal was chosen due to the canal, which provided a waterway, {{as well as the}} St. Lawrence River’s rapids which provided a power source; the Grand Trunk Railway line was also in close proximity. The first factory was located where Building 17 of the modern plant currently sits. The original factory consisted of a main building, where the starch was produced, as well as numerous outbuildings including a boiler house, office, and employee store. The first factory had a capacity of 200 bushels per day. Early products manufactured by the company included Benson’s Prepared Corn, Silver Gloss Starch, and Crystal <b>Laundry</b> <b>Starch</b> - No. 1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Laundry</b> <b>starch</b> {{is used in}} the {{laundering}} of clothes. Starch {{was widely}} used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and ruffs of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men'sshirts and the ruffles of girls' petticoats by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being ironed. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. Dirt and sweat from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in aerosol cans for home use.|$|E
50|$|Clothing or <b>laundry</b> <b>starch</b> is {{a liquid}} {{prepared}} by mixing a vegetable starch in water (earlier preparations {{also had to}} be boiled), and {{is used in the}} laundering of clothes.

40|$|Pica is {{an eating}} {{disorder}} that affects an individual who experiences a craving that is satisfied by ingestion of either unusually large amounts of selected food items (e. g., baking soda) or repeated ingestion of nonfood items (e. g., clay, <b>laundry</b> <b>starch).</b> Pica {{is more than an}} anomaly of human behavior; it is {{an eating disorder}} that carries all the risks that are inherent to impaired nutrition, including death. Pica can be dated to antiquity, yet there is little question that it continues as a current practice. As an eating disorder, pica has implications for persons who are in positions to influence human behavior, those in education and social service as well as those in clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|Nothing is more delicious than fresh-picked, Kentucky-grown corn, {{which we}} can enjoy from July through August. If you don’t have a garden of your own, farmers ’ markets offer, along with other {{seasonal}} fruits and vegetables, sweet corn picked {{at the peak of}} ripeness. Everything on the corn plant can be used: the husks for tamales, the silk for medicinal tea, the kernels for food, and the stalks for fodder. Not only is corn popular as food in itself, but its many by-products contribute to Kentucky’s agricultural economy, including bour-bon, corn flour, cornmeal, corn oil, cornstarch, corn syrup, and <b>laundry</b> <b>starch.</b> What a wonderful and versatile gift the American Indians gave the world...|$|E
40|$|PICA" means perverted {{appetite}} for substances not fit as food or of no nutritional value such as, bricks, clay, soil, ice, <b>laundry</b> <b>starch,</b> etc. The word ′′PICA′′ {{is derived from}} Latin word for Magpie, a species of bird that feeds on whatever it encounters. ′′PICA′′ has been observed in ethnic groups worldwide in primitive and modern cultures, in both sexes and in all age groups. The case presented here reports a 30 year old female patient who had craving for ingestion of gravel and brick fragments {{since the age of}} 13 years. Iron deficiency anemia was found after complete blood count and iron studies. The diagnosis of "PICA" requires that the patient is persistently eating non-food substances for at least 1 month and such behavior is appropriate for the child′s stage of development...|$|E
40|$|Pregnant African American {{women are}} {{at higher risk}} of having a preterm {{delivery}} and/or a low birthweight infant. Many factors are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes but a food habit that deserves further study in the causal process is pica, a craving for, and ingestion of, nonnutritive substances such as <b>laundry</b> <b>starch,</b> clay, dirt, or ice. This food habit {{is more common in}} the African American population but has not been adequately studied in relation to preterm and/or low birth weight infants. ^ Mothers (n = 281) with infants less than one year of age who participated in the Special Supplementary Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) at clinics in Houston and Prairie View, Texas were interviewed regarding pica practices during pregnancy, dietary practices, and some demographic indices. Hospital records were abstracted for health information on the mothers and infants, including birthweight and gestational age at birth of the infant. ^ The subjects were 88. 6 % African American, 6. 8 % Hispanic, and 4. 6 % Caucasian. Overall prevalence of pica was 76. 5 %. Pica prevalence by substance(s) was as follows: ice 53. 7 %; ice and freezer frost 14. 6 %; other substances such as baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, <b>laundry</b> <b>starch,</b> and clay or dirt 8. 2 %; and 23. 5 % reported no pica. The women who reported ice/freezer frost pica had a higher percentage of illegal drug use and alcohol use during pregnancy. The women who reported other pica substances had the lowest mean educational level, highest gravidity, and a higher percentage smoked during pregnancy. ^ There {{were no significant differences in}} nutrient intakes measured by the mean 24 -hour dietary recalls between women who reported ice pica (n = 103) and women who denied pica (n = 50). The women who reported ice/freezer frost pica or other pica substances had more food cravings and food dislikes during pregnancy than those who reported ice pica or no pica. ^ There were no differences in mean birthweight or mean gestational age at birth of infants born to mothers from the three pica groups and the no pica group but regression analyses revealed a possible relationship between pica, low maternal hemoglobin at delivery, and preterm birth. ...|$|E
40|$|PubMed ID: 26684056 Steel plants {{generate}} {{significant amounts}} of wastes such as sludge, slag, and dust. Blast furnace sludge is a fine-grained waste characterized as hazardous and affecting the environment negatively. Briquetting {{is one of the}} possible ways of recycling of this waste while the formed briquettes serve as a feed material to the blast furnace. Several binders, both organic and inorganic, had been assessed, however, only the solid product had been analysed. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the possibilities of briquetting using commonly available <b>laundry</b> <b>starch</b> as a binder while evaluating the possible utilization of the waste gas originating from the thermal treatment of the briquettes. Briquettes (100 g) were formed with the admixture of starch (UNIPRET) and their mechanical properties were analysed. Consequently, they were subjected to thermal treatment of 900, 1000 and 1100 °C with retention period of 40 min during which was the waste gas collected and its content analysed using gas chromatography. Dependency of the concentration of the compounds forming the waste gas on the temperature used was determined using Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation matrix. Starch was found to be a very good binder and reduction agent, it was confirmed that metallic iron was formed during the thermal treatment. Approximately 20 l of waste gas was obtained from the treatment of one briquette; main compounds were methane and hydrogen rendering the waste gas utilizable as a fuel while the greatest yield was during the lowest temperatures. Preparation of blast furnace sludge briquettes using starch as a binder and their thermal treatment represents a suitable method for recycling of this type of metallurgical waste. Moreover, the composition of the resulting gas is favourable for its use as a fuel. Web of Science 4847747...|$|E
