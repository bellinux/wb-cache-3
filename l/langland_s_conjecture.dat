Many modern areas of graph theory are unified {{in the study}} of graph homomorphisms; a homomorphism is a function from the vertices of a source graph to the vertices of a target graph such that the images of adjacent vertices being adjacent. Sidorenko 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Conjecture,</b> about the minimum number of homomorphisms from a bipartite graph to any graph with a fixed number of vertices and edges, is the core inspiration for our investigation. ^ We expand on the approach of Csikvari and Lin showing several classes of target graphs for which the lower bound of Sidorenko 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Conjecture</b> is met for any bipartite source graph. We then turn to the problem of Brown-Kramer et al. who began classifying the `friendly 2 ̆ 7 vertices in graphs, vertices whose images under a random homomorphism have high expected degree. We show that two new classes of vertices are friendly, and that the connected graphs with friendly vertices are trees. We highlight the unexpected relationship between these problems; having a friendly vertex can be seen as satisfying Sidorenko 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Conjecture</b> in a local sense. ^ We subsequently turn to a more modern, form of discrete model, cellular automata. Automata were first described by Von Neumann and Ulam and are frequently used as a model of computer computation, particle systems, and cellular biology. As discrete dynamical systems they are known to exhibit complex and even chaotic limit behavior even for certain simple rules of evolution. We first show that an average randomly constructed automaton has exponentially many possible cycles, in contrast to the suggestion of simulation data from Cantor et al. ^ Finally, we look at the evolution of one particular automaton model, bootstrap percolation. Bootstrap percolation is a monotone model of disease spread for which we study the behavior of fast acting, infecting sets of regions in a hexagonal tiling of the plane. We provide exact fastest infection times for certain `nice 2 ̆ 7 regions and develop an understanding of the infection process from minimum size infecting sets. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part, we give a simple geometric description of the set mathcal G(5, 5, 8) of toroidal triangulations, all of whose vertices have degree six, except for two of degree five and one of degree eight. The motivation for studying such family is provided by Gr"unbaum coloring application described below. Each such triangulation is described by a cut-and-glue construction starting from an infinite triangular grid. In particular, we show {{that the members of}} mathcal G(5, 5, 8) are obtained from a toroidal 6 -regular graph (three parameters) by cutting out a special disk, described with two parameters, and "stitching" along the cut. To achieve that, we develop some techniques and define some invariants to study the cycles of toroidal triangulations. We also introduce some special triangulated disks called "blocks" and show how to detect their presence in a triangulation. Then, we show the existence of a special path that identifies the "cut". Also, the graphs in mathcal G(5, 5, 8) are classified into several families, based on the existence of some special cycles, containing a vertex of degree eight. Each family is, further, described by a schema for gluing together a few blocks. The second part regards coloring. A Gr"unbaum coloring of a graph G which triangulates a surface is a 3 -edge-coloring of G in which every face is incident to three edges of different colors. In 1968 Gr"unbaum conjectured a generalization of the Four Color Theorem: every simple triangulation of every orientable surface has a Gr"unbaum coloring. In 2008 Kochol discovered counterexamples to Gr"unbaum 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>conjecture</b> on every orientable surface of genus at least five. Gr"unbaum 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>conjecture</b> is still believed to be true for the torus. We verify "weak" Gr"unbaum conjecture for three families of triangulations in higher surfaces that, to our knowledge, are the only known families of triangulations with unbounded facewidth that are not 4 -colorable. Also, as an application of our description, we propose a method by which to verify the Gr"unbaum 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>conjecture</b> for mathcal G(5, 5, 8) ...|$|R
