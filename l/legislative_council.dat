5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council,</b> which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E

In addition, the governors served as extraordinary members when the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> met in their provinces.

5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{elevation}} as premier Heffron, {{following an}} approved motion from the 1958 state conference, reanimated the longstanding Labor policy {{to abolish the}} <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> of New South Wales by announcing a statewide referendum on this question. Heffron had long supported this policy from his Langite days, seeing the council as an outdated bastion of conservative privilege, a position that was echoed by trade union official {{and member of the}} <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council,</b> Tom Dougherty, who had pushed through a rule at the 1952 state conference that banned MLCs from becoming members of the state party executive. However, Heffron's efforts found themselves up against significant opposition, not only from the Liberal and Country parties but also within the Labor party itself. Indeed, when the 'Constitution Amendment (<b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> Abolition) Bill' came before the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> on 2 December 1959, the council resolved 33 votes to 25 to send it back to the Legislative Assembly on the grounds that such a bill should have originated in the council. This was passed with the support of seven Labor councillors crossing the floor (including Cyril Cahill, Anne Press and Donald Cochrane), who were all subsequently expelled from the party and formed the Independent Labor Group.|$|E

When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E

In 2002, the government's motion of an anti-subversion bill pursuant to Article 23, was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Reform bills on universal suffrage, however, have made partial progress in expanding the Chief Executive election's committee (from 600 to 800 in 2007 and to 1,200 selected members in 2012) and the <b>Legislative</b> <b>Council</b> (from 60 to 70 seats).
