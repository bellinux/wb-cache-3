5|$|One of {{the first}} notable people to have lived in Chiswick was the artist William Hogarth, who lived in Chiswick from 1749, when he bought the house now known as Hogarth's House. Hogarth <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{until his death in}} 1764. He is buried in St Nicholas's churchyard. The house later belonged to the poet and {{translator}} of Dante, Henry Francis Cary, who lived there from 1814 to 1833.|$|E
5|$|The {{land and}} an earlier house were owned by Henry Bellamy in 1584. The Quilter family owned {{the land from}} 1736 to 1909; it {{consisted}} of 23 acres in 1778. A Major Hemery appears to have <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in or around 1881. Captain Thomas Hall Rokeby Plumer, the 2nd Viscount Plumer, lived there in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|After {{living in}} his new house for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> until after the Civil War. In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house {{as a result of}} additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could not recover.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the museum}} has a unique {{collection}} of various works by Ukrainian philologist P. Zhitetsky, Arabist and professor of the Kiev University T. Kezma, journalist and public figure A.Savenko, Ukrainian writer G.Tyutyunnyk, which have <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> No. 34 in the different periods of the twentieth century. Another {{important part of the}} collection in the museum is the memorabilia of professors of Kiev Theological Academy A. Bulgakov, S. Golubev, P. Kudryavtsev, F. Titov, A.Glagolev, famed doctors Th. Janovsky and D. Popov, and other prominent local figures.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|The core {{household}} {{consisted of}} Jane and Kingsley; Jane's mother, Katherine ("Kit"), a former ballerina, {{who died in}} the house in 1972; one of Jane's brothers, Colin ("Monkey"); and artists Sargy Mann and Terry Raybauld. The housekeeper, Lily Uniacke, lived in Gladsmuir Cottage. Kingsley's children, Philip, Martin and Sally <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> from time to time, mostly outside term time, or at weekends in the case of Philip and Martin; the children were 17, 16 and 12 when Kingsley and Jane married. Sally moved into Lemmons in 1970 when Martin was in his second year at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Without an {{acceptable}} {{home for the}} governor, the state purchased the house of Dr. John H. Sanders {{to serve as a}} residence for the Governor in 1837. The location, on the corner of Market and Illinois Streets in Indianapolis, proved to be damp and unhealthy because of the wetland conditions of the area during that time. Governor James Whitcomb blamed the conditions for his wife's death. The home was abandoned in 1861 during the term of Oliver Morton, who briefly <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> but refused to stay. The house was sold during his term and eventually destroyed.|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} Barcelona, Gaudí {{frequently}} changed his address: {{as a student}} he lived in residences, generally {{in the area of}} the Gothic Quarter; when he started his career he moved around several rented flats in the Eixample area. Finally, in 1906, he settled in a house in the Güell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since been transformed into the Gaudí Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaudí (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). He <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> until 1925, several months before his death, when he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|In 1574 {{the house}} was owned by George Perceval, the father of Richard Percivale {{who was born in}} the house and later deciphered Spanish {{documents}} for Queen Elizabeth about the Spanish Armada. Later owners in the 16th and 17th centuries included the local member of parliament Richard Cole and Nathaniel Wade who was condemned to death for his part in the Monmouth Rebellion. After 1795 a series of owners, who never <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> leased it for use as a farmhouse and it fell into disrepair. In 1906 it was bought by Charles Edward Evans who undertook a major restoration project including bringing in materials from surrounding Tudor manors. After World War II it was converted into flats and in the 1990s into five private dwellings.|$|E

5|$|The 1902 Education Act {{also made}} it a legal {{requirement}} for the County Council to provide an equal educational opportunity for girls. A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls' school, and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink. The house had been donated on a long-term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family. Harecroft House had been built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover, and his descendants <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903, after which it was left vacant. The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks, {{who was the first}} woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics. New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906, 1913, 1922 and 1936, when a mixed-use gymnasium and hall was constructed. This hall was, until recently, used as the school dining room and will from 2017 be the school's library. Originally, the High School was also able to take boarders, which continued until after World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre {{were told that the}} new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and {{sent a letter to the}} editor printed in The Times in October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, died at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Mazra'ih.|$|E
5|$|The {{freehold}} {{of much of}} {{the southern}} side of the Pall Mall is owned by the Crown Estate. In addition to St. James's Palace, Marlborough House, which was once a royal residence, is its neighbour to the east, opening off a courtyard just to the south of the street. It was built for Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who laid the foundation stone in 1709, with building complete by 1711. The house reverted to Crown ownership in 1817; the future King George V was born here in 1865 and briefly <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> as Prince of Wales during the reign of his father, Edward VII. It became government-owned in 1959 and houses now the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Foundation. The Prince Regent's Carlton House was built at the eastern end of Pall Mall in 1732 for Frederick, Prince of Wales and later inhabited by his widow, Princess Augusta. A ball was held at the house on 19 June 1811 to celebrate the start of the Prince's regency, but ultimately he did not decide to stay in the house upon ascending the throne, and it was demolished. John Nash built Carlton House Terrace on its site between 1827–32.|$|E

5|$|Out of {{one hundred}} peers summoned before the King in 1716, five lived in Great Marlborough Street. For a time, Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow owned No.11 while Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough at No.12. For {{a time in the}} 18th century, the street was the main London {{residence}} of Lord Nelson. No.13 was formed of two separate houses, both leased by John Richmond in 1710 and subsequently joined as a single property. It was bought by Lord Charles Cavendish in 1740 and later occupied by his son, the scientist Henry Cavendish. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet lived at No.14 from 1754–62. The Byron family were listed as ratepayers of No.15 during the early 18th century. William Byron, 4th Baron Byron lived here from 1727 until his death in 1736; his widow remained there until 1740. The Baron's son, William Byron, 5th Baron Byron lived here from 1745–74. The Scottish sculptor Thomas Campbell worked here from 1833–1843, also taking over the neighbouring No.16. Sir Lambert Blackwell, 1st Baronet bought No.16 in September 1709 and stayed there until his death in 1727. His son, Sir Charles Blackwell, 2nd Baronet subsequently <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> until he died in 1741. Mary Lepell, maid of honour to Caroline, Princess of Wales (and future wife of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey) lived in part of a house which is now part of No.34 from around 1716–1724. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet, Speaker of the House of Commons lives in No.41 (now No.46) from 1747–52. The first floor of the property was later occupied by the painter Benjamin Haydon from 1808–17; Gilbert Stuart Newton is believed to have taken over his lodgings.|$|E
