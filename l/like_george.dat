5|$|Major stars <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Raft and Jean-Paul Belmondo {{were given}} top billing in the film's {{promotion}} and screen trailers {{despite the fact}} that they only appeared for a few minutes in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1960, {{research}} and writings by international critics <b>like</b> <b>George</b> R. Collins, Nikolaus Pevsner and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaudí's work, while in his homeland it was admired and promoted by Alexandre Cirici, Juan Eduardo Cirlot and Oriol Bohigas. Gaudí's work has since gained widespread international appreciation, {{such as in}} Japan where notable studies have been published by Kenji Imai and Tokutoshi Torii. International recognition of Gaudí's contributions {{to the field of}} architecture and design culminated in the 1984 listing of Gaudí's key works as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Gaudí's style have subsequently influenced contemporary architects such as Santiago Calatrava and Norman Foster.|$|E

2500|$|He {{also studied}} Dutch {{landscape}} painter {{of the seventeenth}} century Jacob van Ruisdael, as well as [...] some of his contemporaries and friends <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> Gobo, Raoul André Ulmann, Albert Decaris, , Pierre-Louis Moreau.|$|R
5|$|The early 20th century {{also saw}} the growth of Broadway, a group of theatres specializing in musicals. Broadway {{became one of the}} preeminent {{locations}} for musical theater in the world, and produced a body of songs that led Donald Clarke to call the era, the golden age of songwriting. The need to adapt enjoyable songs to the constraints of a theater and a plot enabled and encouraged a growth in songwriting and the rise of composers <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Gershwin, Vincent Youmans, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern. These songwriters wrote songs that have remained popular and are today known as the Great American Songbook.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
25|$|Black {{academic}} Harold Cruse {{viewed the}} arts scene as a white-dominated misrepresentation of black culture, epitomized by works <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Gershwin's folk opera, Porgy and Bess.|$|E
50|$|Several {{members of}} the Neue Rechte also refer to theorists <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> Sorel, Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels, Julius Evola, and José Antonio Primo de Rivera seen as fascist pioneers. Some even base {{themselves}} on Marxist philosophers like Antonio Gramsci and his ideas of cultural hegemony.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} these authors owed much to the late 19th century decadent literature, with names <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> Eekhoud in Belgium and Jacob Israël de Haan in the Netherlands. After {{the second world war}} Gerard Reve, and later Gerrit Komrij and Tom Lanoye became the leading names.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} {{is known for}} wearing headbands, usually with a matching handbag, and <b>liking</b> singer <b>George</b> Michael. Fergison revealed that the headbands were her idea, saying [...] "I've given myself {{a bit of a}} headache ..., literally, wearing those things." [...] She also says that she <b>likes</b> <b>George</b> Michael and was extremely pleased when she found out her character was a fan. Heather is also a fan of karaoke, and Fergison cites her first scene where she is singing in front of her fellow cast as embarrassing and strange.|$|R
25|$|There are {{chapters}} of many varied academic {{groups at the}} university. The {{local chapter of the}} Society of Physics Students was at one time under the auspices of world-renowned scientists <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Gamow, Ralph Asher Alpher, Mario Schoenberg and Edward Teller, who have all taught at the university. The Enosinian Society, founded in 1822, is one of the university's oldest student organizations. Invited speakers included Daniel Webster.|$|E
25|$|The state {{put down}} the rebellion—but {{if it had been}} too weak to do so it would be no help to call on the {{ineffective}} federal government. The event led nationalists <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Washington to redouble efforts to strengthen the weak national government as necessary for survival in a dangerous world. Massachusetts, divided along class lines polarized by the rebellion, only narrowly ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.|$|E
25|$|Propositional logic was {{eventually}} refined using symbolic logic. The 17th/18th-century mathematician Gottfried Leibniz has {{been credited with}} being the founder of symbolic logic for his work with the calculus ratiocinator. Although his work {{was the first of}} its kind, it was unknown to the larger logical community. Consequently, many of the advances achieved by Leibniz were recreated by logicians <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Boole and Augustus De Morgan completely independent of Leibniz.|$|E
50|$|Also known are guitarists <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> Oyendze, La Rose Mbadou and Sylvain Avara, and {{the singer}} Oliver N'Goma. Imported rock and hip hop from the US and UK are popular in Gabon, as are rumba, makossa and soukous. Gabonese folk {{instruments}} include the obala, the ngombi, balafon and traditional drums.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Pascal Bastia {{continued}} {{his career with}} ups and downs, mostly in the provinces with Mademoiselle Star (1945) or Gardes françaises (Reims, 1962). This last play was closer to opéra comique, <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> van Parys's or Maurice Yvain's latest works. But he would never again find the success of Dix-neuf ans.|$|R
50|$|Known to Isabelle as Mama Jean, {{the wife}} of Georges Melies was trusted by him to keep the {{heart-shaped}} key that began the automaton - until it got stolen by her goddaughter Isabelle. She, in her defense, said that she {{just thought it was}} pretty. <b>Like</b> <b>Georges,</b> she is in her elder years.|$|R
25|$|The {{first half}} of Dalton McGuinty's 1999 {{campaign}} was widely criticized as disorganized and uninspired, and most journalists believe he gave a poor performance in the leaders' debate. However, McGuinty was able to rally his party {{in the last ten}} days. On election day, the Liberals won 40% of the vote, their second best showing in almost fifty years. Perhaps more importantly, nine new MPPs were elected, boosting the caucus from 30 to 36, including dynamic politicians <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Smitherman and Michael Bryant.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{might have}} helped on the musical {{arrangements}} {{based on the fact}} that (as it has been recalled by former bassists and the band themselves) they were in a more collaborative period in the pre-studio days and he was usually the one getting his way with structural ideas. While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), the bottom line is that even in that case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (<b>like</b> <b>George</b> Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E
25|$|It {{brought out}} the first {{separately}} published work of Samuel Beckett, a poem called Whoroscope (1930), Bob Brown's Words, and Pound's A Draft of XXX Cantos. Cunard published old friends <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Moore, Norman Douglas, Richard Aldington, Arthur Symons and Henry-Music, a book of poems from various authors with music by Henry Crowder, but also two books by Laura Riding, The Collected Poems of John Rodker, poems by Roy Campbell, Harold Acton, Brian Howard, Walter Lowenfels and Words by Bob (Robert Carlton) Brown. By 1931 Wyn Henderson had taken over day-to-day operation {{of the press and}} in the same year it published its last book, The Revaluation of Obscenity by sexologist Havelock Ellis.|$|E

50|$|His {{works are}} {{inspired}} by poets like Grace Schulman and Christian Bobin, spiritual authors like St. John of the Cross or Etty Hillesum, writers <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> Simenon or Hermann Hesse, painters like Henri Matisse or Jean-Michel Basquiat, or photographers like Nan Goldin or Diane Arbus. He collaborates with artists, dancers and poets and conceives interdisciplinary performances.|$|R
50|$|Midget George Wilson pulls strings {{to obtain}} {{a job in the}} circus for Mary, a Hungarian lady he's fallen madly in love with. Mary is happy to have the job, singing to the lions, but {{although}} she <b>likes</b> <b>George,</b> her feelings for circus owner Joe Harrop are stronger. The jealousy and tensions caused affect the running of the circus.|$|R
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>George</b> Stephenson, Ericsson {{understood}} {{that a large}} area was needed to extract heat from the hot gases. This he did in a long horizontal tube filled with water which ran under {{the full length of}} the engine. It {{can be seen in the}} illustration on top of this page, sticking out to the right, with the vertical chimney attached to it. Within the horizontal section was a tube carrying the hot gases, this formed an ‘S’ shape so the gases made three passes through the water. This ‘S’ shaped tube was also tapered causing the gases to speed up as they cooled down. In practice this tube is almost impossible to clean.|$|E
25|$|Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Seyyed Hossein Nasr {{have argued}} that, {{starting}} in the 10th century, some medieval Islamic madaris indeed became universities. However, scholars <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Makdisi, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel argue that the European medieval university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world. Darleen Pryds questions this view, pointing out that madaris and European universities in the Mediterranean region shared similar foundations by princely patrons and were intended to provide loyal administrators to further the rulers' agenda. A number of scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, however, the earliest universities were founded in Asia and Africa, predating the first European medieval universities.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, complex issue, critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Soros ritualistically applaud their own bravery and pretend they are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it {{is that people who}} viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers are supposed to do – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E
50|$|Gabonese {{music is}} lesser-known in {{comparison}} with regional giants like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. The country boasts an array of folk styles, as well as pop stars like Patience Dabany and Annie Flore Batchiellilys, a Gabonese singer and renowned live performer. Also known are guitarists <b>like</b> <b>Georges</b> Oyendze, La Rose Mbadou and Sylvain Avara, and the singer Oliver N'Goma.|$|R

25|$|The 1920s also {{spawned a}} new age of American playwright with the {{emergence}} of Eugene O'Neill, whose plays Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape, Strange Interlude and Mourning Becomes Electra proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway, and O'Neill's success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice, Maxwell Anderson, Robert E. Sherwood, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, as well as writers of comedy <b>like</b> <b>George</b> S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably John Barrymore in Hamlet and Richard III, John Gielgud in Hamlet, The Importance of Being Earnest and Much Ado About Nothing, Walter Hampden and José Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac, Paul Robeson and Ferrer in Othello, Maurice Evans in Richard II and the plays of George Bernard Shaw, and Katharine Cornell in such plays as Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, and Candida.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
25|$|After Romania {{signed a}} {{separate}} {{peace with the}} Central Powers, and following the demobilization of summer 1918, Steuerman returned to Iași. Back into civilian life, Rodion was, <b>like</b> <b>George</b> Topîrceanu, one of the combatants whom the war years had rendered even more critical of the Ententist option; from Moldavia, he sent his texts {{to be published in}} Stere's explicitly Germanophile review, Lumina, and, at the same time, began contributing to Scena, the daily owned by conscientious objector A. de Herz. Lumina hosted a second series of his Scrisori, beginning in June 1918. During the same month, Rodion was also a correspondent of the short-lived leftist tribune Umanitatea, launched in Iași by the Bessarabian Germanophile Alexis Nour, and noted for its advocacy of total Jewish emancipation. On July 27, Opinia published Steuerman's eulogistic commentary on the political essays of Stere's follower Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu; Pătrășcanu's text, grouped under the headline Vinovații ("The Guilty Ones"), constituted an indictment of both the Entente and the National Liberal Party, Romania's main Ententist group.|$|E
