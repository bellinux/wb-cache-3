5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} <b>laughed</b> during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode. It was reshot but the audience still <b>laughed.</b> Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, <b>laughed</b> heartily as Colbert teased them. This was {{in stark contrast to}} the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E

However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E

30|$|Further, {{three types}} of <b>laughs</b> (funny <b>laughs,</b> bitter <b>laughs,</b> forced <b>laughs)</b> were identified. Although all types were {{characterized}} by breathiness (aspiration), preliminary observations indicated that in funny <b>laughing</b> speech, breathiness (aspiration) appeared rhythmically over the whole {{or part of the}} utterance (as in Figure 8 (i)), while in bitter <b>laughing</b> speech, a strong breathiness (aspiration) tended to occur shortly, often at the end portion of the utterance (as in Figure 8 (j)). The discrimination between bitter <b>laughs</b> and forced (non-spontaneous or social) <b>laughs</b> was more ambiguous, so that the context might be influencing. Detailed analysis for discrimination of different types of <b>laugh</b> is subject for future work.|$|R

40|$|In dialogue, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for people to <b>laugh</b> together. This joint laughter often results in overlapping laughter, consisting of an initiating <b>laugh</b> (the first one), and a responding <b>laugh</b> (the second one). In previous studies, we found that overlapping <b>laughs</b> are acoustically different from non-overlapping ones. So far, we have considered overlapping <b>laughs</b> as one category. Consequently, it is unknown whether there are also acoustic differences between initiating <b>laughs</b> and responding <b>laughs.</b> In this paper, we make a distinction between initiating, responding, and non-overlapping <b>laughs</b> and compare their acoustic characteristics. In particular, we will investigate the prosodic relations between initiating and responding <b>laughs.</b> Do these relations point to a form of accommodation and mimicry? To what extent are initiating and responding <b>laughs</b> paired to each other? The analyses were performed on two speech corpora containing spontaneous conversations between two speakers. Results show indications that initiating and responding <b>laughs</b> share several similar acoustic features that point towards accommodation and mimicry mechanisms...|$|R
