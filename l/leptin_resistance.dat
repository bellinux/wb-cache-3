5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance,</b> leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial <b>Leptin</b> <b>resistance,</b> increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying neuronal <b>leptin</b> and insulin <b>resistance</b> in {{obesity and}} diabetes remain unclear.

We also demonstrate that constitutive expression of Xbp 1 s in Pomc neurons contributes to improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppression of endogenous glucose production. Notably, elevated Xbp 1 s levels in Pomc neurons also resulted in activation of the Xbp 1 s axis in the liver via a cell-nonautonomous mechanism.

50|$|When leptin binds {{with the}} leptin receptor, it {{activates}} {{a number of}} pathways. <b>Leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> {{may be caused by}} defects in one or more part of this process, particularly the JAK/STAT pathway. Mice with a mutation in the leptin receptor gene that prevents the activation of STAT3 are obese and exhibit hyperphagia. The PI3K pathway may also be involved in <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance,</b> as has been demonstrated in mice by artificial blocking of PI3K signalling. The PI3K pathway also is activated by the insulin receptor and is therefore an important area where leptin and insulin act together as part of energy homeostasis. The insulin-pI3K pathway can cause POMC neurons to become insensitive to leptin through hyperpolarization. The consumption of a high fructose diet from birth has been associated with a reduction in leptin levels and reduced expression of leptin receptor mRNA in rats. Long-term consumption of fructose in rats has been shown to increase levels of triglycerides and trigger leptin and insulin resistance, however, another study found that <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> only developed in the presence of both high fructose and high fat levels in the diet. A third study found that high fructose levels reversed <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> in rats given a high fat diet. The contradictory results mean that it is uncertain whether <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> is caused by high levels of carbohydrates or fats, or if an increase of both, is needed.|$|E
50|$|Yet another {{proposed}} mechanism {{involves the}} {{phenomenon known as}} <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance.</b> Leptin is a hormone that regulates long-term energy balance in many mammals. An important role of leptin is long-term inhibition of appetite in response to formation of body fat. This mechanism {{is known to be}} disrupted in many obese individuals: even though their leptin levels are commonly elevated, this does not result in reduction of appetite and caloric intake. <b>Leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> may be triggered in rats by ad libitum consumption of energy-dense, highly palatable foods {{over a period of several}} days. Chronic consumption of fructose in rats ultimately results in <b>leptin</b> <b>resistance</b> (however, this has only been demonstrated in a diet in which fructose provided 60% of calories; consumption by humans in a typical Western diet is much lower.) Once leptin signalling has been disrupted, the individual becomes prone to further overeating, weight gain, and insulin resistance.|$|E

40|$|Leptin-stimulated Stat 3 {{activation}} in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) -expressing neurons of the hypothalamus {{plays an}} important role in maintenance of energy homeostasis. While Stat 3 activation in POMC neurons is required for POMC expression, the role of elevated basal Stat 3 activation as present in the development of obesity has not been directly addressed. Here, we have generated and characterized mice expressing a constitutively active version of Stat 3 (Stat 3 -C) in POMC neurons (Stat 3 -C(POMC) mice). On normal chow diet, these animals develop obesity as a result of hyperphagia and decreased POMC expression accompanied by central <b>leptin</b> and insulin <b>resistance.</b> This unexpected finding coincides with POMC-cell-specific, Stat 3 -mediated upregulation of SOCS 3 expression inhibiting both leptin and insulin signaling as insulin-stimulated PIP(3) (phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 triphosphate) formation and protein kinase B (AKT) activation in POMC neurons as well as with the fact that insulin's ability to hyperpolarize POMC neurons is largely reduced in POMC cells of Stat 3 -C(POMC) mice. These data indicate that constitutive Stat 3 activation is not sufficient to promote POMC expression but requires simultaneous PI 3 K (phosphoinositide 3 -kinase) -dependent release of FOXO 1 repression. In contrast, upon exposure to a high-fat diet, food intake and body weight were unaltered in Stat 3 -C(POMC) mice compared with control mice. Taken together, these experiments directly demonstrate that enhanced basal Stat 3 activation in POMC neurons as present in control mice upon high-fat feeding contributes to the development of hypothalamic <b>leptin</b> and insulin <b>resistance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Moderate {{physical}} activity and snack intake suppress the appetite of obese and lean women acutely. The associations between circulating leptin and appetite-satiety ratings {{suggest that there is}} some physiological involvement of leptin in short-term appetite regulation in response to {{physical activity}}-induced factors but only in obese women. The exercise-related factors considered in this thesis as possible mediators of leptin action were catecholamines, fatty acids, glucose and insulin. Adrenaline is unlikely to be the exercise factor responsible for the coupling between leptin and satiety since adrenaline infusion stimulated an increase in subsequent energy intake in obese women. Labetalol decreased circulating FFA and increased glucose concentrations, which confirms at least b-adrenoceptor blockade. Any conclusion with respect to the a- adrenoceptor blockade should be drawn with caution since labetalol, an a/b blocker, has greater affinity for b- than a-adrenoceptors. No differences in appetite/satiety sensations were found following exercise with adrenoceptor blockade compared to exercise alone. This indicates that the observed anorexic effect of exercise on appetite in obese women was not mediated by b-adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline is another possible exercise factor that could mediate the coupling between leptin and appetite in obese women since it is known that leptin and noradrenaline (NA) have common hypothalamic targets (e. g. NPY) and their effects are mediated by a- 1 adrenoceptors. Labetalol probably was not a sufficiently strong a-adrenoceptor blocker to investigate such effects. A study of a more selective a 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist might be helpful in the investigation of the interaction between leptin and NA in the regulation of eating.

At baseline, all patients had normal insulin levels, C-peptide, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index, except for one female diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The glucose infusion rate was significantly lower with r-metHuLeptin (12. 03 ± 3. 27 vs. 8. 16 ± 2. 77 mg·kg− 1 ·min− 1, P = 0. 0016) but {{did not differ in}} the 4 th, 5 th, and 6 th years of treatment when all results were analyzed by a mixed model [F(1, 4) = 0. 57 and P = 0. 5951].

The OGTT suggested that two patients showed decreased insulin resistance while off treatment. During an off-leptin OGTT, one of the patients developed a moderate hypoglycemic reaction attributed to increased posthepatic insulin delivery and sensitivity.

Increased SNS activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and an increased cardiovascular risk. We have therefore investigated the relationship between <b>leptin,</b> insulin <b>resistance</b> and cardiac autonomic activity in healthy young adults. 130 healthy men and women age 20. 9 years were studied. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the IVGTT and minimal model with simultaneous measures of leptin. Cardiac autonomic activity was assessed using spectral analysis of heart rate variability. RESULTS: Women showed significantly higher fasting leptin, heart rate and cardiac sympathetic activity, and lower insulin sensitivity. Men showed inverse correlations between insulin resistance and heart rate, and between insulin resistance and cardiac sympatho-vagal ratio. Women, in contrast, showed no SNS relationship with insulin resistance, but rather an inverse correlation between leptin and the sympatho-vagal ratio, suggesting that leptin in women is associated with SNS activity. The correlation remained significant after adjustment for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (beta=- 0. 33 and p= 0. 008).

Objective: The objective was to evaluate relations between fat distribution, muscle lipid content, adipocytokines, and insulin resistance in older women {{and the effects of}} moderate weight loss. Design: In 35 healthy women aged 589 ̆ 683 y, body mass index, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), and body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were evaluated. A midthigh single computed tomography scan was performed to determine subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT), intermuscular AT (IAT), muscular tissue, and muscle lipid infiltration, evaluated as low-density lean tissue. Metabolic variables, insulin resistance measured by homeostasis model assessment, adiponectin, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured in all subjects and after weight loss in a subgroup of 15 obese women. Results: Waist circumference and SAD were positively correlated with <b>leptin</b> and insulin <b>resistance</b> and negatively correlated with adiponectin. Adiponectin was associated negatively with insulin resistance and positively with HDL cholesterol, whereas leptin was positively associated with insulin resistance and triacylglycerols. Midthigh subcutaneous AT was associated with insulin <b>resistance</b> and <b>leptin,</b> whereas IAT was associated with triacylglycerols. Stepwise regression with insulin resistance as the dependent variable and body mass index, SAD, triacylglycerols, HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and midthigh subcutaneous AT as independent variables showed that SAD entered the regression first (R 2 = 3 D 0. 492) followed by adiponectin (R 2 = 3 D 0. 63). After moderate weight loss, midthigh subcutaneous AT, IAT, low-density lean tissue, <b>leptin,</b> and insulin <b>resistance</b> decreased significantly; no significant changes in adiponectin were observed.
