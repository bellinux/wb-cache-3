50|$|In mathematics, the <b>limit</b> {{inferior}} and <b>limit</b> superior of {{a sequence}} {{can be thought}} of as <b>limiting</b> (i.e., eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence. They {{can be thought of}} in a similar fashion for a function (see <b>limit</b> of a function). For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's <b>limit</b> points, respectively. In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior <b>limits</b> extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme <b>limits</b> is invariant. <b>Limit</b> inferior is also called infimum <b>limit,</b> liminf, inferior <b>limit,</b> lower <b>limit,</b> or inner limit; <b>limit</b> superior is also known as supremum <b>limit,</b> <b>limit</b> supremum, limsup, superior <b>limit,</b> upper <b>limit,</b> or outer <b>limit.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper compares {{methods for}} {{converting}} system <b>limits</b> into market signals. One classification of methods is according to reliability driven (TLR and similar) versus market driven (LMP and similar) methods. A second classification is according to direct versus indirect methods. Direct methods deal with individual <b>limits</b> and constraints. Indirect methods include various ways of converting {{one type of}} <b>limit</b> to another, equivalent <b>limit</b> for purposes of making {{the handling of the}} <b>limit</b> more expeditious. An example of an indirect method is the conversion of a voltage <b>limit</b> to either a flow <b>limit</b> or an interface <b>limit.</b> Another example is the use of flow <b>limits</b> on interfaces as surrogates for stability <b>limits.</b> These transformed <b>limits</b> are often represented by nomograms. Conversion of one type of <b>limit</b> to another and the construction of nomograms has the advantage of reducing the problem of imposing system <b>limits</b> within a market context to a “previously solved ” market problem. If a market already has learned how to cope with an import <b>limit</b> into a load pocket, conversion of a voltage <b>limit</b> into a load pocket import <b>limit</b> makes it easy for a market to react and respond to the condition. However, any conversion from one type of <b>limit</b> to another entails an approximation. This paper discusses the nature of some of these approximations.

The business of Octopus Cards <b>Limited,</b> being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings <b>Limited</b> that are independent of Octopus Cards <b>Limited.</b> As of 2007, Octopus Holdings <b>Limited</b> was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus. Since the Government of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings <b>Limited,</b> and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards <b>Limited.</b>|$|E
