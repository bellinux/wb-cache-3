The Germans sighted the smoke stacks of two ships at 05:45, which triggered the alarm on Bismarck. Schneider initially reported them as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them as battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port were their precise identities revealed. The British ships started firing at the German force at 05:53. Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first, but due to the reversed battle order, Prince of Wales and Hood opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead. The commander of the Prince of Wales, Captain John Leach, detected this error and directed his guns to fire on Bismarck. The German task force was {{still waiting for the}} order to commence firing. The commander of the German task force, Admiral Lütjens, did not give this order immediately. Two minutes into the battle and after multiple inquiries by Schneider, [...] ""? (Question. Open fire?) an impatient Lindemann responded: [...] ""!. (I'm not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!). This Lindemann quotation is cited by Burkard Freiherr von Müllenheim-Rechberg who at the time was in the after gun director keeping a watch out for Suffolk and Norfolk and listening to Schneider's commands over the gunnery intercom. This conversation most likely was passed down by a surviving crew member who overheard the conversation between Schneider and Lindemann. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg, Lindemann's personnel adjutant, would become the highest-ranking officer to survive the Bismarcks last battle on 27 May 1941.

But the achievement of national and coordinated bargaining is an unrealistic goal in the foreseeable future in the United States. What American labor can do, however, is to become once again a social movement. In order for organized labor to play its critical role as a countervailing power within the American political system, there must be intensified organizing, internal democratization, increased electoral and lobbying clout, and social-movement unions willing to mobilize with others and, if necessary, on the streets.

Lottery gambling and addiction: An overview of European research This report is the first in a series of papers to concentrate on gambling in Europe. The focus of this first report is lottery gambling (including scratchcards and video lottery terminals) across Europe in relation to addiction and other social impacts. We are well aware that the picture we present in this first report is incomplete as there is very little in the established peer-reviewed research literature on the social impact of lottery gambling. It is hoped that this report will provide the starting basis for others in both the academic and gambling industry communities to "fill in the gaps". Compiling this report has not been easy for a number of reasons. These all have a bearing on the conclusions that we make at the end. The areas of concern that that we would like to raise at the outset include: The diverse quality and variety of sources used: This report has been compiled using the small amount of academic literature, academic conference papers, annual gaming reports, market research reports, lottery website information, and personal communications.
