500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most notable}} and talked-about feature of Baker Bowl {{was the right}} field wall, which was only some 280 feet (85 m) from home plate, with right-center only 300 feet (91.5 m) away, and with a wall-and-screen barrier that in its final form was 60 feet (18 m) high. By comparison, the Green Monster at Fenway Park is 37 feet (11 m) high and 310 feet (94 m) away. The Baker wall was a rather {{difficult}} task to surmount. The wall was an amalgam of different materials. It was originally a relatively normal-height masonry structure. When {{it became clear that}} it was too soft a home run touch, the barrier was extended upward using more masonry, wood, and a metal pipe-and-wire screen. The masonry in {{the lower part of the}} wall was extremely rough (writer Michael Benson termed it [...] "the sort of surface that efficiently removes an outfielder's skin upon contact") and eventually a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> was laid over the entire structure except for the upper part of the screen. The wall dominated the stadium in much the same way as the Green Monster does, only some 30 ft closer to the diamond; and because of its material, it made a distinctive sound when balls ricocheted off it, as happened frequently. The clubhouse was located above and behind the center field wall. No batter ever hit a ball over the clubhouse, but Rogers Hornsby once hit a ball through a window.|$|E
5000|$|The largest find of Iguanodon {{remains to}} that date {{occurred}} on 28 February 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium, {{at a depth}} of 322 m, when two mineworkers, Jules Créteur and Alphonse Blanchard, accidentally hit on a skeleton that they initially took for petrified wood. With the encouragement of Alphonse Briart, supervisor of mines at nearby Morlanwelz, Louis de Pauw on 15 May 1878 started to excavate the skeletons and in 1882 Louis Dollo reconstructed them. At least 38 Iguanodon individuals were uncovered, most of which were adults. In 1882, the holotype specimen of I. bernissartensis {{became one of the first}} ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display. It was put together in a chapel at the Palace of Charles of Lorraine using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process. This specimen, along with several others, first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in July 1883. In 1891 they were moved to the Royal Museum of Natural History, where they are still on display; nine are displayed as standing mounts, and nineteen more are still in the Museum's basement. The exhibit makes an impressive display in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, in Brussels. A replica of one of these is on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. Most of the remains were referred to a new species, I. bernissartensis, a larger and much more robust animal than the English remains had yet revealed, but one specimen was referred to the nebulous, gracile I. mantelli (now Dollodon bampingi). The skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known. Found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform Bernissartia.The science of conserving fossil remains was in its infancy, and new techniques had to be improvised to deal with what soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease".

Significant quantities of partially oxidized tin alloy are generated during typical processing operations. The scrap {{has generally been}} considered to be tin oxide and suitable for recovery using electrolysis or reduction with charcoal and fuel oil at temperatures above 1000 °C. This experimental work examines alternative processes for the recovery of metallic tin from this scrap. Microstructural and chemical characterisation of the scrap revealed that metallic tin was the predominant phase and {{was surrounded by a}} cover <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> oxide ranging in thickness from a few μm (micrometres) to 100 μm.

The removal of the tin oxide was attempted using mechanical attrition (grinding in a ball mill) and chemical dissolution of the tin oxide layer by means of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The results of attrition in a ball mill indicated that the tin oxide covering layer was effectively reduced from the material over 53 μm and the removed oxide was concentrated in particles less than this size. Furthermore, the remaining tin oxide layer can be almost completely removed by an acidic treatment with 2 M HCl at room temperature and agitation for 30 min.
