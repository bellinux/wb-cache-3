40|$|Spaceports have {{traditionally}} been characterized by performance measures associated with their site characteristics. Measures such as "Latitude" (proximity to the equator), "Azimuth" (range of available <b>launch</b> <b>azimuths)</b> and "Weather" (days of favorable weather) are commonly used to characterize a particular spaceport. However, other spaceport performance measures may now be of greater value. These measures can provide insight into areas of operational differences between competing spaceports and identify areas for improving the performance of spaceports. This paper suggests Figures of Merit (FOMs) for spaceport "Capacity" (number of potential launch opportunities per year and / or potential mass' to low earth orbit (LEO) per year); "Throughput" (actual mass to orbit per year compared to capacity); "Productivity" (labor effort hours per unit mass to orbit); "Energy Efficiency" (joules expended at spaceport per unit mass to orbit); "Carbon Footprint" tons CO 2 per unit mass to orbit). Additional FOMS are investigated with regards to those areas of special interest to commercial launch operators, such as "Assignment Schedule" (days required for a binding assignment of a launch site from the spaceport); "Approval Schedule" (days to complete a range safety assessment leading to an approval or disapproval of a launch vehicle); "Affordability" (cost for a spaceport to assess a new launch vehicle); "Launch Affordability" (fixed range costs per launch); "Reconfigure Time" (hours to reconfigure the range from one vehicle's launch ready configuration to another vehicle's configuration); "Turn,Around Time" (minimum range hours required between launches of an identical type launch vehicle).

50|$|The {{inclination}} of a GTO is {{the angle}} between the orbit plane and the Earth's equatorial plane. It {{is determined by}} the latitude of the launch site and the <b>launch</b> <b>azimuth</b> (direction). The inclination and eccentricity must both be reduced to zero to obtain a geostationary orbit. If only the eccentricity of the orbit is reduced to zero, the result may be a geosynchronous orbit but will not be geostationary. Because the V required for a plane change is proportional to the instantaneous velocity, the inclination and eccentricity are usually changed together in a single manoeuvre at apogee where velocity is lowest.|$|E

The cosmodrome's latitude, 51° north, means that rockets {{will be able to}} carry almost the same amount of payload as they can when launched from Baikonur at 46°N. Other arguments for choosing this location include the ability to use sparsely populated areas and bodies of water for the rocket launch routes; proximity to major transportation networks such as the Baikal-Amur Mainline, the Chita-Khabarovsk Highway; abundance of electricity production resources in the area; and the infrastructure supporting the former Svobodny Cosmodrome, on which the new spaceport will be based. The site's location in the Russian far eastern region allows for easier transport of materials to the site, and allows rockets to jettison their lower stages over the ocean. It was expanded as part of the plan of modernization of the supporting infrastructure. Putin said that among places offered was an area on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, near Vladivostok, but that experts recommended not to locate it there since the proximity to the ocean can create problems and delays in launches, and as a result the current place was chosen.|$|E

40|$|During Centaur launch {{operations}} the <b>launch</b> <b>azimuth</b> of the inertial platform's U-accelerometer {{input axis}} must be accurately established and maintained. This {{is accomplished by}} using an optically closed loop system with a long-range autotheodolite whose line of sight was established by a first-order survey. A collimated light beam from the autotheodolite intercepts a reflecting Porro prism mounted on the platform azimuth gimbal. Thus, any deviation of the Porro prism from its predetermined heading is optically detected by the autotheodolite. The error signal produced is used to torque the azimuth gimbal back to its required <b>launch</b> <b>azimuth.</b> The heading of the U-accelerometer input axis is therefore maintained automatically. Previously, the autotheodolite system could not distinguish between vehicle sway and rotational motion of the inertial platform unless at least three prisms were used. One prism was mounted on the inertial platform to maintain azimuth alignment, and two prisms were mounted externally on the vehicle to track sway. For example, the automatic azimuth-laying theodolite (AALT-SV-M 2) on the Saturn vehilce used three prisms.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an empirical investigation of earth-to-moon trajectories. The primary {{objective is to}} uncover relationships that result in the reduction of mission analysis or trajectory analysis problems to fundamentals. It is considered imperative that the results be accurate {{to the extent that}} any relationships that are uncovered are not brought about by simplifying or unrealistic assumptions. Consequently, the model used is as accurate as is presently available for use and the computations are performed under strict error controls. Procedures are reasonable from the engineering viewpoint. Some very helpful principles are uncovered. These may be briefly stated as follows: 1) Trajectories of constant flight time to the moon (in the 66 hour to 90 hour range), and arriving within a few minutes of the same time pass over a common point on the moon regardless of the arrival altitude and inclination, This common point of passage for such a family of trajectories is arbitrarily referred to as a VERTEX point; 2) These VERTEX points lie within a bounded region on the lunar surface as arrival time varies throughout the years, for a given flight time or flight time spread; 3) Increasing flight time results primarily in a longitude shift of the VERTEX point for a given arrival time; 4) <b>Launch</b> <b>azimuth</b> should be treated as a strong parameter regarding its influence on the vertex. <b>Launch</b> <b>azimuth</b> variations up to +/- 20 degrees about 90 degrees can shift the vertex as much as 3 degrees in latitude even when one is free to pick launch time, coast time, and S-IVB burn time appropriately with launch azimuth; and 5) The locus of periselenum, as arrival inclination takes on all possible values, is nearly circular about the vertex point for a given arrival altitude.

40|$|When {{launching}} a spacecraft from Earth parking orbit to deep space, {{it is highly}} desirable to have the hyperbolic excess velocity vector (v-infinity) contained in the parking orbit plane. Ground launches can force the parking orbit plane to contain the v-infinity vector by using <b>launch</b> <b>azimuth</b> and lift-off time as independent variables. When launching from the Space Station, {{a new set of}} variables comes into play. The Space Station orbit is of fixed inclination but precessing due to the Earth's oblateness. Its plane will seldom (and may never) contain the desired v-infinity vector. Consequently, the departure strategy will usually require multiple burns and include a plane change. Also, the concept of 'launch window' will be somewhat different from Earth surface launches. An analysis of the deployment of interplanetary spacecraft from the Space Station is described, with emphasis on the effect of the trajectory characteristics on station operations.

40|$|Navigation {{system and}} {{in-flight}} alignment requirements for a Navy Theater Wide (NTW) {{tactical ballistic missile}} interceptor are discussed. The missile navigation system is externally aided with both GPS and radar data for dynamic alignment and calibration of the missile's navigation system during flight. System alignment errors arise from missile in-canister initialization, ship navigation errors, and ship radar face misalignments. Reduction of these errors during flight is critical so that the rather small field-of-view of the Kinetic Warhead (KW) seeker can acquire and divert successfully to the target. The extent to which attitude errors are removed depends on {{the accuracy of the}} measurements, the kinematic activity in the trajectory, and the degree of observability associated with the state error dynamics. An observability metric is developed and used to quantify a measure of error state observability and evaluate the potential benefits afforded by intentional trajectory shaping. Several trajectory shaping techniques including nominal and aggressive <b>launch</b> <b>azimuth</b> biases, vertical plane shaping, and sinusoidal lateral plane maneuvers are investigated.
