I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of knew. My lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone." [...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Earlier in {{the inquiry}} the defence showed real chivalric ideality in admitting {{half of our}} story without further dispute. We should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> and imitate so eminently large-hearted a style by conceding also that the story told by Curate Percy about the canoe, the weir, and the young wife seems to be {{substantially}} true. Apparently Smith did marry a young woman he had nearly run down in a boat; it only remains to be considered whether {{it would not have}} been kinder of him to have murdered her instead of marrying her. In confirmation of this fact I can now con-cede to the defence an unquestionable record of such a marriage." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} {{extremely}} disagreeable to Mr. Mason. In {{the first place}} he did {{not at all like}} the tone of equality which the Hamworth attorney had adopted; he did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that his affairs were in any degree dependent on a man of whom he thought so badly as he did of Mr. Dockwrath; he did not like to be told that Round and Crook were rogues,--Round and Crook whom he had known all his life; but least of all did he like the feeling of suspicion with which, in spite of himself, this man had imbued him, or the fear that his victim might at last escape him. Excellent, therefore, as had been the evidence with which Bridget Bolster had declared herself ready to give in his favour, Mr. Mason was not a contented man when he sat down to his solitary beefsteak in Soho Square.|$|E

60|$|Janet did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> {{to herself}} her {{disappointment}} on learning that Ditmar {{had gone to}} Boston. She knew he had had no such intention the night before; an accumulated mail and many matters demanding decisions were awaiting him; and his sudden departure seemed an act directed personally against her, {{in the nature of}} a retaliation, since she had offended and repulsed him. Through Lise's degrading act she had arrived at the conclusion that all adventure and consequent suffering had to do with Man--a conviction peculiarly maddening to such temperaments as Janet's. Therefore she interpreted her suffering in terms of Ditmar, she had looked forward to tormenting him again, and by departing he had deliberately balked and cheated her. The rain fell ceaselessly out of black skies, night seemed ever ready to descend on the river, a darkness--according to young Mr. Caldwell--due not to the clouds alone, but to forest fires many hundreds of miles away, in Canada. As the day wore on, however, her anger gradually gave place to an extreme weariness and depression, and yet she dreaded going home, inventing things for herself to do; arranging and rearranging Ditmar's papers that he might have less trouble in sorting them, putting those uppermost which she thought he would deem the most important. Perhaps he would come in, late! In a world of impending chaos the brilliantly lighted office was a tiny refuge to which she clung. At last she put on her coat and rubbers, faring forth reluctantly into the wet.|$|E
6000|$|The {{prospect}} of the future, accordingly, is on the whole pleasant and encouraging. It is only the backward glance, the gaze up the long vista of the past, that reveals anything alarming. Here the lines converge as they recede into the geological ages, and point to conclusions which, upon the theory, are inevitable, but hardly welcome. The very first step backward makes the negro and the Hottentot our blood-relations--not that reason or Scripture objects to that, though pride may. The next suggests a closer association of our ancestors of the olden time with [...] "our poor relations" [...] of the quadrumanous family than we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge.</b> Fortunately, however--even if we must account for him scientifically --man with his two feet stands upon a foundation of his own. Intermediate links between the Bimana and the Quadrumana are lacking altogether; so that, put the genealogy of the brutes upon what footing you will, the four-handed races will not serve for our forerunners--at least, not until some monkey, live or fossil, is producible with great-toes, instead of thumbs, upon his nether extremities; or until some lucky geologist turns up the bones of his ancestor and prototype in France or England, who was so busy [...] "napping the chuckie-stanes" [...] and chipping out flint knives and arrow-heads {{in the time of}} the drift, very many ages ago--before the British Channel existed, says Lyell [III-1]--and until these men of the olden time are shown to have worn their great-toes in the divergent and thumblike fashion. That would be evidence indeed: but, until some testimony of the sort is produced, we must needs believe in the separate and special creation of man, however it may have been with the lower animals and with plants.|$|E
60|$|In {{the hotel}} service {{there was one}} of those men who are porters in this world, but will be angels in the next, unless the perfect {{goodness}} of their looks, the constant kindness of their acts, belies them. The Marches had known and loved the man in their brief stay, and he had been the fast friend of Burnamy from the moment they first saw each other at the station. He had tenderly taken possession of General Triscoe on his arrival, and had constituted himself the nurse and keeper of the irascible invalid, in the intervals of going to the trains, with a zeal that often relieved his daughter and Burnamy. The general in fact preferred him to either, and a tacit custom grew up by which when August knocked at his door, and offered himself in his few words of serviceable English, that one of them who happened to be sitting with the general gave way, and left him in charge. The retiring watcher was then apt to encounter the other watcher on the stairs, or in the reading-room, or in the tiny, white-pebbled door-yard at a little table {{in the shade of the}} wooden-tubbed evergreens. From the habit of doing this they one day suddenly formed the habit of going across the street to that gardened hollow before and below the Grand-Ducal Museum. There was here a bench in the shelter of some late-flowering bush which the few other frequenters of the place soon recognized as belonging to the young strangers, so that they would silently rise and leave it to them when they saw them coming. Apparently they yielded not only to their right, but to a certain authority which resides in lovers, and which all other men, and especially all other women, <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> and respect.|$|E
