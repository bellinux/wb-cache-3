5|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.|$|E
5|$|The mirror {{symmetry}} {{relationship is}} a particular example of what physicists call a duality. In general, the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical theories {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> another theory, the two are said to be dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities {{play an important role in}} modern physics, especially in string theory.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

5|$|Supersymmetry {{severely}} {{restricts the}} possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, Michael Duff, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity {{with one of}} the dimensions curled up into a circle. In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.|$|E

Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, {{one of the many}} vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

25|$|At {{around the}} same time, as many {{physicists}} were studying the properties of strings, {{a small group of}} physicists was examining the possible applications of higher dimensional objects. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime.

After being provoked by her, Arikawa starts {{a sexual relationship with}} Tomura, which she uses to steal plans from him. Arikawa attempts to assassinate the Prime Minister, but he had switched cars after the plan was leaked by Tomura in a story. Mizuno's firm needs an advance payment, so his client Kinbu introduces him to one of his employees, Shimiji, who <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Tomura, and the two eventually get married. Tomura and Arikawa travel to Seoul to obtain fake travel identification and Arikawa is killed by police called by Tomura. Because of her associations with Kabuto, Tomura is arrested, but she is let go in exchange for sex with Kiriro Kamaishi, a board member of a large steel company. Tomura vows revenge against him, provoking him using a newspaper piece and a story, and the two write a marriage contract.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule deprecated the Maine half dollar, but did {{not blame}} de Francisci, as the piece [...] "was modeled by the sculptor according to required specifications and is therefore not considered typical of his art, or indeed of any art." [...] Vermeule stated, [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a prize medal for a county fair or school athletic day." [...] Nonetheless, feeling that de Francisci could have insisted on a more artistic design, Vermeule found [...] "the Maine Centennial was not his shining moment".|$|E

500|$|Other {{thematic}} {{elements in}} this episode {{can be found}} throughout the series, as well. [...] "The Obsolete Man" [...] takes the episode's literary subtext—the notion that reading may eventually be considered [...] "obsolete"—to an extreme: The state has declared books obsolete and a librarian (also played by Meredith) finds himself on trial for his own obsolescence. This notion, akin to Ray Bradbury's short story [...] "The Pedestrian" [...] (1951), is also alluded to in the episode [...] "Number 12 <b>Looks</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> You", in which a perfect and equal world contradictorily considers works like those of Shakespeare [...] "smut".|$|E

He is very rich, but is unhappy not knowing who he is and where he comes from. He is overjoyed upon hearing of his half-brother and invites the entire Simpson family to stay at his mansion. Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are enthralled by Herb's wealthy lifestyle and kind personality, although Marge constantly worries about spoiling her children. Herb then decides that Homer, being an average American, is the perfect person to design a new car for his company.|$|E

The policemen then begin to dig graves for the corpses. Jean Noel then spots another specimen who <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> him and the two begin to run. They are soon joined by more specimens before arriving at the playground. By chanting at the policemen, the specimens appear to mind control them into dance. Jean Noel continues to run and stops {{when he sees the}} crashed spaceship. The video ends with the band's jackalope logo.|$|E

Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> {{the one in the}} picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box.

500|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around any given point, it <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics. One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which [...] "spacetime" [...] is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the [...] "spacetime" [...] for a quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to the gravitational theory on the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a [...] "dictionary" [...] for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that {{the people on the}} {{internet}} would [...] "give them grief", the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as [...] "A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, [...] "He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King – and he <b>looks</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> him, too!". King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought was a cool name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, {{at the time of the}} episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as [...] "The Southern Dandy" [...] as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames.|$|E
