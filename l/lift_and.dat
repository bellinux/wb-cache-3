5|$|In 2006, Schiff {{sponsored}} eliminating {{a cap on}} taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered {{some local}} taxi drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses would lead to greater competition in the local taxicab business. The City Council passed the cap <b>lift,</b> <b>and</b> the number of Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> complete the launch into the air.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. powerlifting team {{consisted}} of two competitors, Mary Stack and Andy Wise. All of Stack's lifts were declared invalid. She faltered and missed on her first two attempts to lift 110kg. On her third attempt, Stack managed to lift the weight but the judges did not accept the <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> she was disqualified. Wise completed two valid lifts, the maximum of which was 150kg, and finished in eleventh place.|$|E

5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{building}} land at North End to conservationists to form the Hampstead Heath extension in 1904, meant {{a reduction in the}} number of residents who might use the station there. Work continued below ground at a reduced pace, and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated, but North End station was abandoned in 1906 before the <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of {{locomotion}} is hopping, {{with both}} feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds may run when performing the rodent-run display. Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|E
5|$|When El Toro debuted, {{it broke}} records as the second-tallest and fastest with the second-longest {{drop of a}} wooden roller coaster in the United States. It also had the steepest drop on any wooden roller coaster in the world. , El Toro has the fourth fastest speed, the fourth-tallest <b>lift,</b> <b>and</b> the second longest drop.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the fire}} is quickly brought under control, Prescott is {{completely}} cut off. News of the events in Spoke City soon arrives on Tracy Island. Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1, while Virgil and Alan take off in Thunderbird 2 equipped with newly commissioned fire-fighting apparatus. Lowered into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers, Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> return to ground level, whereupon Prescott is arrested. Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations, including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|Eagles refit was {{completed}} on 9January 1942 {{and she was}} working up {{for the next five}} weeks. She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Hawker Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron. Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> remained on the flight deck at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23February and was assigned to Force H.|$|E

5|$|In human civilization, {{wind has}} {{inspired}} mythology, influenced {{the events of}} history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E
50|$|The {{ski area}} at Storlien has 9 <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> 23 slopes. However, the {{vertical}} drop is a comparatively low 191 m, and consequently the slopes are quite short.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was the {{conceptual}} design of a service lift driven by the rigid chain. The introduction part focuses on a general description of <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> existing issues. The following chapters contain the created lift design, construction of important design elements and functional calculations. In the conclusion, evaluation compared with hydraulic <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> evaluation of speed of the <b>lift,</b> starting <b>and</b> braking to exact stop are performed...|$|R

5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

5|$|The first bout {{was between}} Samoa Joe and Jushin Liger. It lasted 7 minutes and 27 seconds. Joe was {{accompanied}} by two Polynesian dancers during his entrance, who performed for the crowd. Liger gained a near-fall on Joe at 6 minutes. Afterwards, Joe slammed Liger in the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. He then followed by applying his Coquina Clutch submission hold. As the referee waited for Liger to submit, he became limp, causing the referee to <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> drop Liger's arm three times, resulting in the knock-out victory for Joe.|$|E

5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes {{may be the result}} of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} could <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
