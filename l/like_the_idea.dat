5|$|The first volume, Into the Wild, {{was written}} by Kate Cary under the {{pseudonym}} Erin Hunter, and completed in about three months. Holmes continued to act behind the scenes editing and supervising details. Afterwards, Holmes began to <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of using cats since she realized how thoughtful they can be leading private lives without any humans realizing.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to {{be a combination of}} those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; he did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives {{so much that they}} had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E

5|$|According to a podcast {{interview}} with Chris Jericho, Copeland {{said that he}} did not initially <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the Wrestlemania 21 card altogether. However, he was talked into competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs (Kane) who said the match had {{the potential to be a}} big success. At Backlash, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship, which lasted over a year. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance, when Edge lost to Kane. After trading several victories on Raw, the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of Raw that Edge won, but shortly after, Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1915, {{while making}} {{plans for an}} {{offensive}} to break the deadlock that had developed around the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landings in April, {{the commander of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, had determined that an attack at Lone Pine could be used to divert Ottoman attention away from a main attack that would be launched further north around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971. The Australian 1st Infantry Brigade was chosen to undertake the attack, and consisted of about 3,000 men, under the command of Colonel Nevill Smyth. Along with the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades, the 1st Infantry Brigade was part of the Australian 1st Division. The division's commander was Brigadier General Harold Walker, a British officer who had replaced Major General William Bridges as temporary commander after Bridges had been killed by a sniper in May. Walker did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of launching an attack at Lone Pine, let alone a mere diversion, but when General Sir Ian Hamilton, the British commander, insisted the attack proceed, through thorough planning, Walker endeavoured to give his troops the best chance of success possible on such an unfavourable battleground.|$|E
25|$|Arjuna {{attacked}} Bhishma {{trying to}} restore order. Arjuna and Bhishma again {{engaged in a}} fierce duel, however Arjuna's heart {{was not in the}} battle as he did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of attacking his grand-uncle. During the battle, Bhishma killed numerous soldiers of Arjuna's armies.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Siberian-based {{companies}} extended their businesses of various consumer products to meta-regional and an All-Russian level.

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934 Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor {{introduced}} him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of his daughter marrying {{the son of an}} Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would face more than once in his life. Lombardi and Marie wed, nonetheless, on August 31, 1940.|$|E

25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
25|$|Because of poor ratings, Kiley and Booms were {{canceled}} on November 13, 1998, which {{happened to be}} Friday. WTEM moved the highly rated The Tony Kornheiser Show to the 47 p.m. slot as a tape delay show to replace Kiley and Booms. Kornheiser did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> because he would lose the callers from the WTEM broadcasting area. WTEM moved The Doc and Al Show into the 14 p.m. slot and created a new show hosted by Rich Cook and Kris O'Donnell in the 10 a.m.1 p.m. slot.|$|E
25|$|Sampson and {{the other}} {{researchers}} interpreted the delay of ceratopsid horn and frill development to sexual maturity as further evidence for the hypothesis that these traits evolved primarily for competition over mates. They disagreed with more functional explanations for these structures, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the frills served as attachment points for enlarged jaw muscles. The researchers also marshalled support {{from the fact that}} the horns and frills of ceratopsids are the primary source of variation between species within the family and observations of modern animals, whose horns are also primarily used to acquire mates. Nevertheless, they argued that there was still no evidence for sexual dimorphism in ceratopsids.|$|E

25|$|Even in {{planning}} stages, various Florida-based animal rights groups and PETA did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Disney creating {{a theme park}} where animals were held in captivity. The groups protested, and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park. A {{few weeks before the}} park opened, a number of animals died due to accidents. The United States Department of Agriculture viewed most of the cases and found no violations of animal-welfare regulations. On opening day, the Orange County Sheriff's office sent about 150 deputies; about two dozen protesters showed up. The protest lasted two hours, and there were no arrests.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Japan in 2003, Tokumaru finished recording a 10 track demo album called Fragment. He gave this demo CD {{to a friend}} who was an acquaintance of Trevor Sias, owner of the US independent record label Music Related. The label was impressed with the CD, and wanted to release the demo album just as it was; however, Tokumaru did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> He created an entirely new album, which was released under the label in the United States on May 11, 2004. Night Piece originally planned to be just an American only release, but due to strong sales on internet sites, it was released in other countries. It was released in Japan in August 2004 through the independent label Compare Notes.|$|E
25|$|The more {{moderate}} {{members of the}} Volunteers' Provisional Committee did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> nor {{the way it was}} presented, but they were largely prepared {{to go along with it}} to prevent Redmond from forming a rival organisation, which would draw away most of their support. The IRB was completely opposed to Redmond's demands, as this would end any chance they had of controlling the Volunteers. Hobson, who simultaneously served in leadership roles in both the IRB and the Volunteers, was one of a few IRB members to reluctantly submit to Redmond's demands, leading to a falling out with the IRB leaders, notably Tom Clarke. In the end the Committee accepted Redmond's demands, by a vote of 18 to 9, most of the votes of dissent coming from members of the IRB.|$|E

25|$|Parkour is {{not widely}} practiced in {{dedicated}} public facilities. Although efforts {{are being made}} to create places for it, many traceurs do not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom. Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property, and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries. Many parkour organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit Parkour Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was an}} {{exchange}} between judges and academics in the United Kingdom and United States comparing the process of appeal used in both nations. Although the British judges found the emphasis on written arguments unattractive, they did <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of pre-reading; that the court should read the pleadings of counsel, the case being appealed and the judgment from the lower court before delivering their judgment. After a trial in the Court of Appeal, despite the success of this, the idea was quietly scrapped. The court which Lord Denning presided over from 1962 to 1982 was under no pressure and had no inclination to modernise, with liaisons and management handled by clerks with little knowledge. This changed in 1981 with {{the appointment of a}} Registrar, John Adams, an academic and lawyer, who significantly reformed the internal workings of the Court.|$|E
25|$|According {{to those}} who knew him, the war deeply {{depressed}} Dayan. He went into political eclipse for a time. In 1977, despite having been re-elected to the Knesset for the Alignment, he accepted the offer to become Foreign Minister in the new Likud government led by Menachem Begin. He was expelled from the Alignment, as a result and sat as an independent MK. As foreign minister in Begin's government, he was instrumental in drawing up the Camp David Accords, a peace agreement with Egypt. Dayan resigned his post in October 1979, because of a disagreement with Begin over whether the Palestinian territories were an internal Israeli matter (the Camp David treaty included provisions for future negotiations with the Palestinians; Begin, who did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> did not put Dayan {{in charge of the}} negotiating team). In 1981 he founded a new party, Telem.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> of Sussex Day {{came from}} Worthing {{resident}} Ian Steedman who in 2006 suggested <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to politician Henry Smith, {{at the time}} leader of West Sussex County Council.
