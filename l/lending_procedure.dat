40|$|Prospective borrowers from {{commercial}} banks are usually made {{to pass through}} stringent <b>lending</b> <b>procedure.</b> The screening procedure is intended to forestall likely default intents and reduce credit risks. Banks, through the analysis are able to predict the inherent risk level in the loans they administer and avoid risky borrowers. The recent rise in defaults rates {{and the size of}} non-performing loans among the Nigerian commercial banks therefore puts to question the efficiency of the banking system screening criteria. An efficient screening technique is expected to approximate the estimated and the ex post default risk outcome. Disparities between the two reflect the extent by which the assessment of risks by banks was inefficient. This paper provides evidence that bank screening criteria do not effectively foreclose total default risk, and affirm that perceived and ex-post default risks differ. Using data obtained from a survey of investment loans made to 210 borrowers between 2000 and 2012 among 15 commercial banks in Nigeria, this study observed that the banks’ screening criteria was limited by the presence of information asymmetry. Adverse selection and moral hazard were observed to persist in the loan markets irrespective of the stringency of the banks’ screening measures.

However access to finance remains to be a major problem hampering MSEs from playing their constructive role in the economy. The main objective of this study was to assess the major determinants of access to finance by using semi structured questionnaire administered to 134 randomly selected MSEs in Asella.

The lack of roads and {{easy access to}} ports hindered farmers from getting their produce to domestic markets and to the export markets that provided the most potential for the sector's growth. A lack of credit for farmers was another long-standing problem, caused by government policies, the use of credit for political ends, and the strict <b>lending</b> <b>procedures</b> of the commercial banking sector. Bolivia also suffered from the worst farming technology in South America and an insufficient network of research and extension institutions to reverse that trend. The combined lack of infrastructure and technology made farmers vulnerable to almost yearly droughts and floods. The traditional use of pricing policies ensuring lower food prices for urban residents also lessened incentives for farmers. In addition, farmers increasingly had to compete with contraband imports {{in a wide range}} of agricultural products.

2500|$|A large {{contribution}} to the recession {{is due to the}} closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. The causation of these failing financial institutions come from several reasons including unregulated <b>lending</b> <b>procedures,</b> confidence in the Gold standard, consumer confidence in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compacting issues the banking system struggled {{to keep up with the}} high demand of cash withdraws from the public. This impact overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to short sale (real estate) and liquidation of existing loans. In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis begun with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931; over 2100 banks will be suspended by October 1931, with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended. The economy in whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933.|$|R
40|$|Over the years, the <b>lending</b> <b>procedures</b> of {{microcredit}} has evolved. The original {{joint liability}} group lending with simultaneous financing (loans released at once) {{has been replaced}} by sequential financing (loans released one by one). Moreover, recent studies suggest individual liability lending in groups to be the optimal choice. While numerous theoretical studies provide thorough models of each of these approaches, none presents a comparative analysis. In this study, we model these three schemes using the framework by Van Tassel (1999) and compare them. Further, we add exogenous peer monitoring costs and within-group heterogeneity of loan sizes to our models. Our findings prove that, in the presence of information asymmetry, group lending with joint liability dominates individual liability lending in groups. Furthermore, the interest rate of the sequential model is more sensitive to changes of monitoring costs or opportunity costs of capital than in the sequential model. On the contrary, sequential approach allows for higher degree of within-group heterogeneity of loan sizes. It is ambiguous which model achieves higher profit and lower interest rate. Our results confirm that the choice of optimal financing approach is determined by the characteristics of borrowers. JEL Classificiation G 2 Keywords [...] ...|$|R
