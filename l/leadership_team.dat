5|$|The {{college and}} university-based {{chapters}} of the College Republicans operate in a dual capacity as student clubs associated with a particular campus and as members of their state federation and the College Republican National Committee. Like the state federations and national committee, the campus chapters are affiliated with their local Republican Party, but are not official arms of that organization. The chapter chairperson and <b>leadership</b> <b>team</b> are responsible for maintaining the campus club's credentials and constitution, and representing the College Republicans when dealing with university administration, other student groups, and in the surrounding community. The campus chapter <b>leadership</b> <b>team</b> might include many members, with administrative responsibilities delegated to dormitory and Greek chapter chairpersons.|$|E

In this paper we analyze the special features of <b>leadership</b> <b>teams</b> in Chinese-foreign joint ventures and identify was to improve their effectiveness. We identify five key elements of the IJV leadership team-composition, process, structure, incentives, and the leader's behaviors-that have important implications for IJV success. Our analysis is based on the literature on top management teams, cross-cultural behavior, international joint ventures, and our own in-depth interviews with <b>leadership</b> <b>teams</b> from international joint ventures in China...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{theory and}} research on <b>teams</b> and <b>leadership,</b> few scholars have examined <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> per se. To help fill this void, I examine a construct that intertwines leadership and teams: shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership.</b> Shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> occurs when multiple individuals (not just the formal leader) exert downward, upward, and lateral influence (not just downward influence) on other team members {{in an effort to}} realize team goals. As shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> is an emerging construct, I address several questions to understand (1) What is the relationship between shared and traditional conceptualizations of vertical <b>team</b> <b>leadership?</b> (2) How is shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> different than potentially overlapping constructs? (3) What are the antecedents of shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership?</b> (4) How does shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> relate to <b>team</b> processes, climate, and outcomes? and (5) How does shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> relate to processes, climate, and outcomes over and above vertical <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> as well as the potential overlapping constructs? I examined these questions with a sample of 461 individuals in 39 fast-food restaurants using three different measurements of shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership.</b> Results illustrated both the promises and problems with the construct of shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership.</b> In particular, questions remained regarding several measurement issues of shared team leadership; {{there was a lack of}} between-group heterogeneity as well as convergent validity among the measures. However, the referent shift consensus measurement approach of shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> was significantly and positively related to team functioning. Using this measurement strategy, shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> was moderately related to the potential correlates of cooperation, helping, and climate for initiative. In addition, shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> was related to the antecedent of team member ability, the team process of cohesion, climate for service, and the outcome of subjective performance assessments. Further, shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> related to these potential consequences over and above vertical <b>team</b> <b>leadership</b> as well as the potential correlates in several cases. Overall, these results provide some support for shared <b>team</b> <b>leadership,</b> but also raise new questions about the construct...|$|R
