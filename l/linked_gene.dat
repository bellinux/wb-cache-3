40|$|Similarity in gene {{expression}} pattern between closely <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> {{is known in}} several eukaryotes. Two models have been proposed to explain the presence of such coexpression patterns. The adaptive model assumes that coexpression is advantageous and is established by relocation of initially unlinked but coexpressed genes, whereas the neutral model asserts that coexpression {{is a type of}} leaky expression due to similar expressional environments of <b>linked</b> <b>genes,</b> but is neither advantageous nor detrimental. However, these models are incompatible with several empirical observations. Here, we propose that coexpression of <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> is a form of transcriptional interference that is disadvantageous to the organism. We show that even distantly <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> that are tens of megabases away exhibit significant coexpression in the human genome. However, the linkage {{is more likely to be}} broken during evolution between genes of high coexpression than those of low coexpression and the breakage of linkage reduces gene coexpression. These results support our hypothesis that coexpression of <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> in mammalian genomes is generally disadvantageous, implying that many mammalian genes may never reach their optimal expression pattern due to the interference of their genomic environment and that such transcriptional interference may be a force promoting recurrent relocation of genes in the genome...|$|R
40|$|Are genes nonrandomly {{distributed}} {{around the}} genome and might this {{explain why it}} was found that, in the mouse genome, proteins of <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> evolve at similar rates? Anecdotal {{evidence suggests that the}} similarity of expression of <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> might, in part, explain the similarity in their rates of evolution. Immune system genes, for example, are known to evolve at a high rate and sometimes cluster in the genome. Here we develop methods for statistical tests of similarity of expression of <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> and report that there is a significant tendency for genes of similar expression breadth to be linked. Significantly, when we exclude tissue specific genes from our sample, the similarity in rates of protein evolution of <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> is greatly diminished, if not abolished. This diminution is not a sampling artifact. In contrast. while half of the immune genes in our sample reside in I of 10 immune clusters in the mouse genome, this clustering appears not to affect the extent of local similarity in rates of evolution. The distribution of placentally expressed genes, in contrast, does have an effect...|$|R

25|$|When two {{genes are}} close {{together}} on the same chromosome, they do not assort independently and {{are said to be}} <b>linked.</b> Whereas <b>genes</b> located on different chromosomes assort independently and have a recombination frequency of 50%, <b>linked</b> <b>genes</b> have a recombination frequency that is less than 50%.|$|R

50|$|Additionally, many TEs contain {{promoters}} which drive transcription {{of their}} own transposase. These promoters can cause aberrant expression of <b>linked</b> <b>genes,</b> causing disease or mutant phenotypes.|$|R
50|$|The {{recombination}} frequency between two loci observed is the crossing-over value. It is {{the frequency of}} crossing over between two <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> loci (markers), and depends on the mutual distance of the genetic loci observed. For any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant, {{and the same is}} then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps.|$|E
50|$|A {{relationship}} between HLA-B7 and sarcoidosis {{has been known}} for 30+ years. However the association is weak and has not been reproducible in all studies. A common serologically defined haplotype in Europeans is HLA A3-Cw7-B7-DR15-DQ6.2 which is composed of alleles A*0301:Cw*0701:B*0702:DRB1*1501:DQA1*0102:DQB1*0602. In persistent sarcoidosis this haplotype was found to be increased in sarcoidosis, and further study eliminated risk contributed by A3-Cw7 and DQ6.2 indicating B7-DR15 haplotype contains risk of disease (OR = 2.5). The region of chromosome 6 contains nearly on million nucleotides so that these genes, or a closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> could be involved in disease.|$|E
5000|$|Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are {{the largest}} {{mammalian}} subgroup of the cadherin superfamily of homophilic cell-adhesion proteins. They were discovered by Shintaro Suzuki's group, when they used PCR to find new members of the cadherin family.

50|$|The {{combined}} {{resistance to}} novobiocin and oxacillin is hypothesized to have originated from a simultaneous introduction of genes controlling {{the resistance to}} the two. These genes were {{believed to have been}} acquired originally through heterologous DNA from a methicillin-resistant strain of one of the novobiocin-resistant species belonging to the S. sciuri or the S. saprophyticus groups. The larger genome size of the SHN compared to that of S. hominis hominis {{may be the result of}} the acquiring of heterologous DNA. This new, divergent strain was first described in 1998, and was first implicated in causing bacteremia in 2002. Another hypothesis is the insertion of the mec A gene and its flanking sequence into the chromosome of SHN might have affected the expression of a closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene,</b> which converted the host to become novobiocin-resistant.|$|E
50|$|Margaret Bastock {{was born}} in the mid-1920s. She began a degree at Oxford University, but her studies were {{interrupted}} by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war she worked for the BBC, but afterwards she returned to Oxford and completed her undergraduate studies in zoology. Bastock then became a member of St Anne's College, Oxford and studied motivational drives in animal behaviour, working with Desmond Morris. In 1950 she began working towards her PhD in Niko Tinbergen’s laboratory. She studied the relationship between behaviour, genetics and evolution using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In 1956, she published the first evidence that a single gene could change behaviour. She studied a mutation called yellow in Drosophila and showed that this gene or a closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> affected the fly’s mating behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Garber {{started his}} career in 1953 as faculty of the Department of Botany, University of Chicago; he got {{mandatory}} retirement in 1988 but stayed on Professor emeritus of ecology and evolution8. During his career, he made significant contribution in plant genetics based {{on the study of}} higher plants (Sorghum, Peas, Collinsia), lower plants (algae, liverworts), animals (Mice, Carp, Homo sapiens), bacteria (Erwinia, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas) and fungi (Aspergillus, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Penicillium, Microbotrytum). But he made mold system as his favorite model and spent his three decades almost working on filamentous fungi. As a plant geneticist, he wrote more than 150 papers, books and reviews. While working on office of Naval Research in Oakland, California, he made extensive study on causative agent of Plague i.e. Pateurella pestis (now Yersinia pestis) on variation and resistance to streptomycin in vitro and in vivo and also discovered sex <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> in mice. In the University of Chicago, he taught genetics, supervised 11 Master's Thesis and 20 PhD dissertation. He supervised the MS and PhD thesis dissertation of mycologist Joan W. Bennett and geneticist Michael L. Baird. He was honored with University of Chicago's Quantrell Award for excellence in teaching in 1982. He also worked with Richard J. Boyajian of University Lab School to develop a human genetics curriculum for Chicago's Public School System and participated {{in the design of the}} sickle cell anemia exhibited at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.|$|E

40|$|Associations between {{milk protein}} genotypes and milk {{production}} traits were estimated from 6803 first lactation records. Exact tests of associated hypotheses and unbiased estimates of genotype effects were from an animal model. Milk protein genotype effects were estimated using {{a model in}} which each milk protein gene was analyzed separately (single-gene analysis) and a model in which all milk protein genes were analyzed simultaneously (multigene analysis). The results of the two models indicate that some effects ascribed to certain milk protein genes in the single-gene analysis are not effects of the milk protein gene itself but of linked genes. Results from this study and from literature indicate that the K-casein gene or a very closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> affects protein percentage, and the ß-lactoglobulin gene or a very closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> affects fat percentage. Furthermore, effects of ß-casein genotypes on milk production, fat percentage, and protein yield were significant, and ß-lactoglobulin genotypes had significant effects on milk production and protein yield. It is less clear whether those effects are due to effects of milk protein genes themselves or to effects of linked genes...|$|E
40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} gene APC was recently identified, and the cDNA was cloned from chromosome 5 q 21. Point mutations affecting APC are seen in the hereditary syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis, and point mutations in APC and a closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene,</b> MCC, as well as loss of heterozygosity involving chromosome 5 q {{have been reported in}} sporadic colon cancer. To our knowledge, loss of heterozygosity involving APC or MCC or both has not yet been described in any other human cancer besides lung cancer. We used the polymerase chain reaction and DNA content flow cytometric nuclear sorting to examine 30 primary human esophageal cancers for loss of heterozygosity of APC or MCC or both. Loss of one allele was detected in 77 % of 26 informative cases. These data suggest that loss of heterozygosity of regions on 5 q including the APC and MCC genetic loci is involved in the development and/or progression of most human esophageal cancers. They imply that inactivation of APC, MCC, and/or a <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> on chromosome 5 q plays a role in the pathogenesis of some cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as in colon cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis...|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} {{a series}} of delta ompR delta envZ mutants by inducing a strain carrying a lambda prophage in the closely <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> malP and screening the bacterial survivors for loss of the major outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC. Characterization of these deletion strains showed that both OmpR and EnvZ were necessary for transcription of ompF and ompC and that neither gene was essential for cell viability. Moreover, the deletion strains did not exhibit the pleiotropic membrane protein deficiency observed with certain envZ mutants. The method described should allow the simple isolation of deletions in any region of the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|An {{extension}} of the usual mixture model of heterogeneity (two family types, one with and one without linkage) is proposed by introducing age at onset as a covariate. The extended model defines age-dependent penetrances where the exact parametrization of age-at-onset distributions depends on the given genotype and family type (linked or unlinked). This extension was applied to breast cancer families. We postulated that the mean age at onset in individuals affected by the <b>linked</b> <b>gene</b> was lower than the mean age at onset in all other affected individuals.
