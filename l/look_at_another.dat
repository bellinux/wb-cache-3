25|$|She {{was born}} Lenuța Petrescu into a peasant family in Petrești commune, Dâmbovița County, in the {{informal}} region of Wallachia. Her father {{worked as a}} ploughman. Her records show she left school with a good mark only in needlework in primary school. After primary school, she moved along with her brother to Bucharest, where {{she worked as a}} laboratory assistant before getting a job at a textile factory. She joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1939 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu was instantly attracted to her which, reportedly, made him never <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>another</b> woman in a romantic manner. Their relationship was interrupted by Ceaușescu's frequent stints in prison, but they finally married on 23 December 1947.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells us to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>another</b> bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It {{is easy to see}} that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E
500|$|Sam Huff, a linebacker, was {{inducted}} in 1982. Originally a third round selection by the New York Giants in the 1956 NFL Draft, Huff {{played for the}} Giants from 1956–1963 and later for the Washington Redskins from 1964–1969. Huff's football career, let alone his future in the NFL, [...] almost never came to pass, however. [...] As a junior in high school, WVU head coach Art Lewis came to Huff's town to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>another</b> prospect. Luckily for Huff (and for the Mountaineers), Lewis wound up recruiting Sam instead. Fate intervened once more for Huff {{at the end of}} his collegiate career, as Giants scout Al DeRogatis came to Morgantown to look at All-American guard Bruce Bosley. DeRogatis instead discovered Huff, proclaiming that [...] "there's another guard here who will be even greater. His name is Sam Huff." [...] Huff became a five-time Pro Bowl selection, a four-time First-Team All-Pro selection, an inductee in the NFL 1950s All-Decade Team, and was named as one of the 70 Greatest Redskins of all-time. Huff was also recognized as the NFL's Top Linebacker in 1959.|$|E

After one sharp glance at me, the landlady appeared to be satisfied that she was dealing with a gentleman.

6000|$|... disposes {{not only}} of the patriots who are so {{patriotic}} that they never leave their own country to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>another,</b> but of the citizens who are so domestic that they have never married again and never loved anyone except their own husbands and wives. The domestic doctrinaires are also the dull people. The impersonal relation of sex may be judicially reserved for one person; but any such reservation of friendship, affection, admiration, sympathy and so forth is only possible to a wretchedly narrow and jealous nature; and neither history nor contemporary society shews us a single amiable and respectable character capable of it. This has always been recognized in cultivated society: that is why poor people accuse cultivated society of profligacy, poor people being often so ignorant and uncultivated that they have nothing to offer each other but the sex relationship, and cannot conceive why men and women should associate for any other purpose.|$|E
60|$|The man {{had spent}} the early winter, when the snow {{facilitates}} traveling, in the auriferous regions of the North, arranging for the further development of the mineral properties under his control. That done, he had, returning some distance south, struck out again into the wilds to examine some alluvial claims {{in which he had}} been asked to take an interest. It was difficult to reach the first of them; and then he had spent several weeks in determined toil, cutting and hauling in wood to thaw out the frozen surface sufficiently to make investigations. Crestwick had accompanied him, but during the last few days he had gone down to a Hudson Bay post with the owners of the claim, who were returning satisfied with the arrangements made. His object was to obtain any letters that might have arrived, and Lisle, going on to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>another</b> group of claims, had arranged to meet him where he had camped.|$|E
