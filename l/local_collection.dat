40|$|The {{genetics}} {{of native}} plants influence {{the success of}} ecological restoration, yet genetic variability of <b>local</b> seed <b>collections</b> and commercial seed releases remains unclear for most taxa. Poa secunda, a common native grass species in Intermountain West grasslands and a frequent component of restoration seed mixes, is one such species. Here, we evaluate the genetic variation of <b>local</b> Poa secunda <b>collections</b> {{in the context of}} wild populations and commercial seed releases. We evaluated AFLP markers for seven Poa secunda collections made over a 4000 -hectare area and four commercial releases (High Plains, MT- 1, Opportunity, and Sherman). We compare the genetic distance and distribution of genetic variation within and between <b>local</b> <b>collections</b> and commercial releases. The extent and patterns of genetic variation in our <b>local</b> <b>collections</b> indicate subtle site differences with most variation occurring within rather than between collections. Identical genetic matches were usually, but not always, found within 5 m 2 collection sites. Our results suggest that the genetic variation in two Poa secunda releases (High Plains and MT- 1) is similar to our <b>local</b> <b>collections.</b> Our results affirm that guidelines for Poa secunda seed collection should follow recommendations for selfing species, by collecting from many sites over large individual sites...|$|R

40|$|What would {{collection}} developers do in {{the absence}} of <b>local</b> <b>collections?</b> Collection developers partition the universe of documents, privileging selected documents for acquisition and retention. Their selections of documents, based on expected demand and perceived value, direct the actions of technical services staff. A comparable selective privileging of documents, based on demand and value, and a similar direction of a reoriented technical services activity appears needed with networked electronic resources. Collection developers will be needed for value-based privileging more than for demand-based decisions...|$|R

50|$|Until recently, {{waste was}} taken to local rubbish dumps {{with little or no}} control as to where they were sited. Often the dumps were close to water ways. In recent years the {{location}} of dumps was consolidated and they are now constructed as sanitary landfills to prevent leaching of the contents into water bodies. Transfer stations, especially in cities, act as a <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> point where the waste is compacted before being transported to the nearest landfill.|$|E

These galaxies had diverse morphologies, ranging from ellipsoids to disks. The concentrated band of starlight that is the visible signature of the Milky Way was indicative of a disk structure for our galaxy; however, our location within our galaxy made structural determinations from observations difficult.|$|E

50|$|Sheffield’s Central Library {{was officially}} opened in 1934. In {{planning}} it Mr J. P. Lamb, {{who was then}} City Librarian, gave considerable thought to the accommodation and expansion of the local history and 'special' collections (as they were then called). A large reading room was provided to accommodate readers and house the <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> of printed material; there were storage facilities for maps and special collections in an adjoining room and two small strongrooms in the basement, providing about 700 feet of shelving for manuscripts.|$|E
50|$|Some states allow {{collection}} {{of small business}} hazardous wastes at the same location as household hazardous wastes. However, it is more common for public collection facilities to limit hazardous waste collection to households. In 1992 the US EPA issued a policy that allowed states the option to collect and mix household hazardous wastes with conditionally exempt hazardous wastes from small businesses. This has encouraged a trend of <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> programs evolving from household hazardous waste only to also include small business hazardous waste collection.|$|E
50|$|Data {{acquisition}} {{includes the}} data collection, data storage, and data reporting functions. “Data” in DDIS model is broadly conceptualized as {{any type of}} information that guides teaching and learning. In practice, schools collect academic data standardized assessment test scores, as well as non-academic data like student demographic information, community survey data, curricula, technological capacity, and behavioral records. In order to store such data, some schools develop their own <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> strategies using low-tech printouts and notebooks, whereas other schools rely on high-tech district storage systems, which provide tremendous amounts of reports. School leaders have discussions around which data needs to be reported and how to report the data {{in a way that}} they can use to guide teaching practices.|$|E

50|$|The {{founding}} {{of a natural}} history museum at the university—then an institution only a decade old, known as Nevada Southern University—began {{with a collection of}} specimens from the Desert Research Institute (DRI), the Nevada System of Higher Education's graduate research institute. In September 1967, the DRI opened a small museum facility in premises across from the university's grounds, as part of an expansion of DRI's activities into southern Nevada. The museum was created under the direction of archaeologist Richard H. Brooks, assistant research professor at the university and a researcher (later director) of the DRI-affiliated Nevada Archaeological Survey. Its exhibits consisted of DRI's <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> of living desert animal specimens and Native American artifacts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collection}} process for wool in England {{has remained the}} same for many centuries. Shepherds brought their fleeces to a <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> point, for example Chipping Camden for wool from the Cotswolds, {{where it would be}} graded, paid for, consolidated into bales, sold to wholesalers and shipped to the manufacturer. The existence of bales in ancient times is attested by the custom of the English Lord Chancellor to sit on the so-called Woolsack from which he presides over the House of Lords. This seat is therefore not in reality a [...] "sack", in which the shepherds probably brought 20 or so fleeces, probably two per mule, being the equivalent of today's [...] "sheet", but is rather a bale, compacted by the weight of human feet at the merchant's premises.|$|E
50|$|Elsey {{launched}} Funds2Orgs, {{a solution}} for nonprofits, churches, and schools in 2013. This for-profit social enterprise helps nonprofit organizations achieve financial sustainability through shoe drive fundraisers and other fundraising events. The organization seeks to eliminate shoes, clothing, and purses from being discarded in landfills by repurposing them in developing nations within the secondary markets. On February 4, 2015, Funds2Orgs announced a new crowdfunding platform shoefunding.com, in which shoes can be donated in place of money. The new platform allows groups and individual to ask for pledges on its platform to the people for donating shoes, with a goal of collecting {{a certain number of}} shoes stated in their pledge. The shoes can be dropped at a <b>local</b> <b>collection</b> center or mail at the address, once the shoes are donated Funds2Orgs will pay the fundraiser for a collected pair of shoes.|$|E
