5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E

25|$|The Mars Orbiter Mission {{team won}} US-based National Space Society's 2015 Space Pioneer Award {{in the science}} and {{engineering}} category. NSS said the award was given as the Indian agency successfully executed a Mars mission in its first attempt; and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high apoapsis where, with its high resolution camera, it is taking full-disk colour imagery of Mars. Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> down in mapping mode. These images will aid planetary scientists.|$|E

25|$|Stockholm's {{location}} {{just south}} of the 60th latitude means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter— about six hours, while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the Summer solstice the sun never reaches further below the horizon than 7.3 degrees. This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set, because it does not get any darker than nautical twilight. Also, when <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> up towards the zenith, few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is {{not to be confused with}} the midnight sun, which occurs north of the Arctic Circle, around 7 degrees farther north.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} premiered on May 19, 1995, through MTV. It {{features}} Madonna, her dancers, and her chihuahua Chiquita in black leather and latex outfits. The S inspired outfits were {{to symbolize the}} [...] "breaking out of the restraints" [...] as the lyrics described. Her hair, which appears brown in the video was actually blonde at the time. She had leather strips painstakingly braided into her hair to blend with her dark roots. The frizzy afro she sports halfway through the video was actually a hairpiece. During {{the middle of the}} video, Madonna and her dancers appear in a series of boxes, trying to break free. Another sequence shows the singer being thrown around within a series of ropes managed by her dancers. As the video concludes there is a shot of Madonna sitting in a chair, <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> into the camera as she says the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets!". Then there is a brief shot of her standing next to the chair as she boxes into the air.|$|E
500|$|In 1847, Holmes {{was hired}} as Parkman Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard Medical School, where he served as dean until 1853 and taught until 1882. Soon after his appointment, Holmes was criticized by the all-male student body for {{considering}} granting admission to a woman named Harriot Kezia Hunt. Facing opposition from not only students but also university overseers and other faculty members, {{she was asked to}} withdraw her application. Harvard Medical School would not admit a woman until 1945. Holmes's training in Paris led him to teach his students the importance of anatomico-pathological basis of disease, and that [...] "no doctrine of prayer or special providence is to be his excuse for not <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> at secondary causes." [...] Students were fond of Holmes, to whom they referred as [...] "Uncle Oliver". One teaching assistant recalled: [...] "He enters [...] and is greeted by a mighty shout and stamp of applause. Then silence, and there begins a charming hour of description, analysis, anecdote, harmless pun, which clothes the dry bones with poetic imagery, enlivens a hard and fatiguing day with humor, and brightens to the tired listener the details for difficult though interesting study." ...|$|E
500|$|Yar's {{death in}} the episode was after Crosby had asked to be let out of her contract, and rumors had {{circulated}} of her departure. She later described her time spent on Star Trek: The Next Generation as [...] "miserable", and it was well known {{at the time that}} she was unhappy with the way her role had been developed. She later said that if she'd had more scenes written for her similar to the one she shared with Worf {{at the start of the}} episode then she wouldn't have wanted to leave the show. Yar's memorial scene was filmed twice, the first was with Crosby reciting the lines while <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> ahead, which was the director's preferred choice. However a version with her looking towards each of the other characters in turn was ultimately used. Scanlan later said [...] "Don't ask me how she knew where they'd be standing". Marina Sirtis's tears in the scene were real, as she was cued by Crosby standing off camera. [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] was not the last episode in the first season in which Denise Crosby appeared. [...] "" [...] was subsequently filmed after this episode, but was aired earlier in the run. In fact, toward the end of [...] "Symbiosis" [...] you can see Crosby waving goodbye to the fans (it is the scene where Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay). Crosby would also later return to the Yar role in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the two part series finale [...] "" [...] and as Yar's half-Romulan daughter Sela in several episodes. Guest stars in [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] included Walker Boone as Leland T. Lynch, Brad Zerbst as a nurse and Raymond Forchion as Ben Prieto. Even though this episode marked the death of Yar, Crosby would be credited for the remaining three first season episodes.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E

2500|$|The {{front cover}} artwork for Tomorrow's Harvest {{features}} a blurred {{shot of the}} city skyline in San Francisco, California, United States. The photograph was taken from Alameda Naval Air Station, a closed naval air station in Alameda, on the San Francisco Bay. Two of the tallest buildings in San Francisco's skyline, 345 California Center and 555 California Street, are reversed on the album's artwork. Commenting on the artwork, Marcus Eoin {{referred to it as}} [...] "an ingredient of the theme on this record" [...] and added, [...] "if you look again at the San Francisco skyline on the cover, it's actually a ghost of the city.

In good weather, {{they were allowed to}} sit outside their cells, <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> forward, and the rule of silence was strictly enforced. Meals consisted of a little rice and soup. The prisoners were given no blankets, and the only clothing was the clothing that they had been captured in. The normal stay at Ōfuna was limited to eight days, although some prisoners were held much longer. Some were held at Ōfuna for several months. Three crew members of the [...] remained at Ōfuna {{for the duration of the}} war and were used to intercept allied radio traffic.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of the Environment {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published on 4 March 1976 and tests showed no equipment fault on the train. Postmortem evidence indicated that, {{at the time of}} impact, the driver's hand was on the [...] "dead man's handle", rather than {{in front of his face}} to protect it, implying he had made no attempt to stop. Witnesses were interviewed; some passengers on the train reporting that the train accelerated when entering the station, and some witnesses standing in the station reported that the driver, 56-year-old Leslie Newson, was sitting upright in his seat and <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> ahead as the train passed through the station. The state of the motor-control gear, as found after the accident, indicated that power had been applied to the motors until within two seconds of the impact.|$|E
2500|$|Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is {{the first}} {{official}} portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. [...] "Slowly" [...] he says he realized {{the importance of the}} project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. He was keen to capture Catherine's [...] "charm, serenity and intelligence" [...] and [...] "sparkling green eyes". The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as [...] "quite amenable". According to Emsley, Catherine had asked for herself to be painted naturally, as opposed to her official self." [...] It shows Catherine wearing a bottle green pussy bow blouse, <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may [...] "look like caricatures". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen {{to draw attention to the}} rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, [...] "I don't have lots of things in the background. I do like large faces, I find them strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To have anything else in there is really just an interference." [...] As Catherine's image [...] "is so pervasive", he told the media he needed to go past the image on his mind.|$|E
