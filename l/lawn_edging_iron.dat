50|$|<b>Lawn</b> <b>edging</b> with {{a string}} trimmer will often be done with a blade fitted to the head rather than chord.|$|R
50|$|Some designs {{allow the}} angle {{at which the}} cutting chord or blade or blades strike the <b>lawn</b> <b>edge</b> to be adjusted.|$|R
50|$|Some string {{trimmers}} {{are designed}} {{so that they can}} be easily maneuvered with their head being positioned vertically instead of the default horizontal. Other string trimmers come with specific <b>lawn</b> <b>edging</b> attachments, or the one head can be pivoted to be realigned vertically.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of roller based manual lawn edgers. Both are driven by pushing a roller wheel along a hard surface {{adjacent}} to the <b>lawn</b> <b>edge.</b> One type causes a solid steel cutting disc to cut the <b>edge</b> of the <b>lawn.</b> The other type causes two star spoked discs to rotate against each other shear cutting the <b>edge</b> of the <b>lawn.</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} I had the {{distorted}} {{idea that a}} large back yard was a luxury to be desired since ours was comparatively small. I had gazed with envy at spacious, green <b>lawns,</b> <b>edged</b> with even, neatly trimmed hedges, with perhaps a row of rustling popular trees at one end, and carefully tended rock gardens at the other, rendering it a scene of symetry and color; yards with rose-covered trellises or graceful bird baths...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the xiphos, {{which is}} a {{thrusting}} weapon, the kopis was a hacking weapon {{in the form of}} a thick, curved single <b>edged</b> <b>iron</b> sword. In Athenian art, Spartan hoplites were often depicted using a kopis instead of the xiphos, as the kopis was seen as a quintessential [...] "villain" [...] weapon in Greek eyes.|$|R

25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} thrive in urban areas, especially in backyards, golf courses, parks, recreational areas, school grounds, and street verges, {{in which their}} presence may deter outdoor activities. If they enter homes or properties, they can harm pets if they are either caged, penned, tied or cannot escape. Nests can be built under pavements or even roads, as well as under driveways, foundations, <b>lawns,</b> <b>edges</b> of sidewalks, under patio slabs, in electrical boxes or near power lines. A colony can excavate huge quantities of soil, resulting in structural problems in driveways, pavings and walls, and can also cause the formation of potholes in roads. Additional damage by mounds can be inflicted on trees, yard plants, and pipes; some structures may also collapse. Colonies may migrate into human homes after heavy rain to take refuge from saturated soil.|$|R
5000|$|Purpose {{designed}} manual spade based lawn edgers are a half moon shaped, semicircular, broad blade {{attached to}} an elongated handle {{and are used}} in a downwards and rocking motion. [...] The blade may have a flat top to allow the operator {{to step on the}} blade to apply more force. The blade is driven through the lawn and into the lawn substrate parallel to and adjacent to the hard boundary feature bordering the lawn, cutting any protruding lawn material. This type of lawn edger is also known as an <b>edging</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of methanol (CH 3 OH) at the Fe 3 O 4 (001) -c(2 x 2) {{surface was}} studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). CH 3 OH adsorbs exclusively at surface defects sites at room temperature to form hydroxyl groups and methoxy (CH 3 O) species. Active sites are identified as step <b>edges,</b> <b>iron</b> adatoms, antiphase domain boundaries in the c(2 x 2) reconstruction, and above Fe atoms incorporated in the subsurface. In TPD, recombinative desorption is observed around 300 K, and a disproportionation reaction to form methanol and formaldehyde occurs at 470 K. Comment: 7 figure...|$|R
2500|$|The {{landscape}} {{has been}} described as [...] "Kahn's most elegant built example of landscape planning" [...] by Philadelphia landscape architect George Patton. Approaching the main entrance past a <b>lawn</b> <b>edged</b> by pools with running water, the visitor enters a courtyard through a grove of Yaupon Holly trees. The sound of footsteps on the gravel walkway echoes from the walls {{on either side of the}} courtyard and is magnified under the curved ceiling of the entry porch. [...] After that subtle preparation, the visitor enters the hushed museum with silvery light spread across its ceiling. Harriet Pattison played the lead role in the landscape design and is also the person who suggested that open porches flanking the entrance would create a good transition from the lawn and courtyard to the galleries inside. [...] Pattison, who had also worked with Kahn on other projects, was an employee of Patton. She is the mother of film director Nathaniel Kahn, Louis Kahn's son who made the film [...] "My Architect" [...] about his father.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first child}} to be born to Anne and James after James succeeded Elizabeth I of England, Mary was the first princess of Great Britain, {{although}} then {{it was not so}} named. Her birth was thus awaited with much excitement among both the Scottish and the English. Disputes among nobility as to the distribution of places in the establishment for the unborn child were very common. A note containing the necessaries ordered by the king for his child contains orders of the following: [...] "a carnation velvet cradle, fringed with silver fringe and lined with carnation satin; a double scarlet cloth to lay upon the cradle at night; a cradle cloth of carnation velvet with a train, laid with silver, and lined with taffeta to lay upon the cradle; two small mantles of unshorn velvet, lined with the same velvet; one large bearing cloth of carnation velvet, to be used when the child is brought forth of the chamber, lined with taffeta; one great head sheet of cambric for the cradle, containing two breadths, and three yards long, wrought all over with gold and coloured silks and fringed with gold; six fine handkerchiefs of fine cambric, one to be edged with fair cut work, to lay over the child's face; six veils of <b>lawn,</b> <b>edged</b> with fair bone lace, to pin with the mantles; six gathered bibs of fine <b>lawn</b> with ruffles <b>edged</b> with bone lace; two bibs to wear under them, wrought with gold and coloured silks." [...] The total cost of this went up to £300, currently worth around £790,000.|$|R

40|$|Model {{atmosphere}} {{calculations of}} the spectrum of a neutron star cooling after an X-ray burst show that the photoelectric <b>edge</b> of <b>iron</b> should be prominent. No clear evidence for such a redshifted feature in the spectrum of a burst from X 1636 - 53 is found, and it is concluded that the iron abundance there must be less than 0. 3 solar. Unless the iron abundance of the surface matter on the neutron star is highly time-dependent, the present result argues against the 4. 1 -keV absorption line seen in some bursts from X 1636 - 53 by Waki et al. (1984) being due to <b>iron.</b> The <b>iron</b> <b>edge</b> will be a powerful diagnostic of the surface redshift of the neutron star in burst sources where the iron abundance is more nearly solar...|$|R
25|$|The present garden {{follows a}} layout {{established}} by Mellon. Each flower bed is planted {{with a series}} of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower bed facing the central <b>lawn</b> are <b>edged</b> with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers are interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter.|$|R

An {{overgrown}} metal windmill, about eight metres in height, stands approximately ten metres {{to the south}} of the south-west corner of verandah. At the eastern end of this line of beds is located a rough pergola also made from cut saplings over which bougainvillea has been trained. There is a similar structure adjacent to the south-east corner of the entry to the south-facing verandah. A timber pergola runs {{along the length of the}} west-facing verandah. It supports bougainvillea and sandpaper vine (Petrea volubis). The pergola's timber frame is founded on a raised rock garden planted with agapanthus. Timber stairs bring people down from the verandahs to the garden.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, {{during the}} John F. Kennedy administration, {{the garden was}} largely {{redesigned}} by Rachel Lambert Mellon concurrently with extensive repair work to the East Garden. Mellon created a space with a more defined central lawn, bordered by flower beds that were planted in a French style whilst largely using American botanical specimens. The present-day garden follows the same layout first established by Mellon, where each flower bed is planted {{with a series of}} 'Katherine' crabapples and Littleleaf lindens bordered by low diamond-shaped hedges of thyme. Additionally, the outer edges to the flower bed which face the central <b>lawn</b> are <b>edged</b> with boxwood, and each of the four corners to the garden are punctuated by Magnolia × soulangeana; specifically, obtaining specimens that were found growing {{along the banks of the}} Tidal Basin by Mellon.|$|R
