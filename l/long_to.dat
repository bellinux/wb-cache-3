[...] In order to make his cruelty better known, we have set down two examples for remembrance.|$|R

5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death.

5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took <b>long</b> <b>to</b> persuade Meisdalshagen to {{even take}} the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E

5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters <b>long.</b> <b>To</b> convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E

Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback took so <b>long</b> <b>to</b> {{pay for the}} stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known {{to many of the}} other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too <b>long</b> <b>to</b> make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long {{handled the}} {{northern}} and southern regions of Vietnam cautiously, not wanting them to be jarred by rapid centralization after centuries of national division. Tonkin, with the administrative seat of its imperial military protector (quan tổng trấn) at Hanoi, had thirteen provinces (tổng trấn Bắc Thành), and in the Red River Delta, the old officials of the Le administration continued in office. In the south, Saigon was the capital of the four provinces of Cochinchina (tổng trấn Nam Hà), as well as the seat of the military protector. The citadels in the respective cities directly administered their military defense zones. This system allowed Gia <b>Long</b> <b>to</b> reward his leading supporters with highly powerful positions, giving them almost total autonomy in ordinary administrative and legal matters. This system persisted until 183132, when his son Minh Mạng centralized the national government.|$|E

5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola waited too <b>long</b> <b>to</b> file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E

Between August and September 1964, Viet Cong regiments executed deep thrusts into Bình Dương and Châu Thành to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese outposts situated on Route 14. During the second phase of their campaign, the Viet Cong ambushed two South Vietnamese infantry companies and destroyed five armoured vehicles, which consisted of M24 Chaffee light tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers. The Viet Cong defeated regular ARVN units at the strategic hamlets of Bình Mỹ and Bình Co.|$|E
