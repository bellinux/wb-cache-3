40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research describes how Foreign Military Sales aviation <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> {{will be provided}} for in the future based on changes currently {{taking place in the}} Department of Defense, Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force, and private industry. Information on the current system was gathered through a thorough review of literature. Outsourcing and privatization efforts by the Department of Defense, especially in depot privatization, will affect the way that aviation <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> is provided in the future. With a decade long reduction in American defense spending, private industry is increasing the emphasis on providing aviation <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> through contractual agreements as another method of creating revenue and maintaining production lines. Third party companies have emerged as an important entity in the <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> field, providing specialized support to the Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force, private industry, and foreign customers. The Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force and private industry each has their own advantages and disadvantages in providing aviation <b>logistical</b> <b>support.</b> The findings conclude that aviation <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> will be increasingly provided through Department of Defense outsourcing programs, and that private industry is seeking to increase its participation in this area of <b>logistical</b> <b>support.</b> Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
