40|$|Alcohol Action Ireland, the {{national}} charity for alcohol-related issues, {{has called on}} pubs and nightclubs not to use cheap alcohol promotions to target young people planning on celebrating their Leaving Cert results this week. “It’s natural that students want to go out, {{have a good time}} and celebrate with their friends. This is an important milestone for them and they should enjoy the celebrations,” said Conor Cullen of Alcohol Action Ireland. “The reality is that for a significant number of young people, their plans to celebrate this week will include drinking and, as a result, they are already being targeted by venues with offers of cheap alcohol, including price promotions {{based on the number of}} drinks bought. Promotions and ‘drinks deals’ like this are aimed squarely at young people and encourage the type of harmful binge drinking that is such a threat to their health and wellbeing. There can be a high cost for cheap alcohol. “It is also worth remembering that many of those attending pubs and nightclubs running these types of promotions will be going there having already consumed alcohol, with the extremely cheap alcohol on offer in the off-trade, particularly supermarkets, contributing greatly to the increasing prevalence of ‘pre-drinking’ among young Irish people,” said Mr Cullen. “However, there is nothing to be gained by pointing the finger at young people. When it comes to drinking, they are, in many ways, a product of their environment, and we have created an environment for them that is saturated with alcohol - it is cheap, widely available and they are also exposed to a huge amount of alcohol marketing and advertising, which is a powerful influence on their drinking behaviour. “All these factors have led to a situation where the Health Research Board recently found that both harmful and dependent drinking in Ireland are highest among the 18 -to 24 year-old age group. It is vital if we want to protect and prioritise the health and wellbeing of our young people that we legislate comprehensively to regulate alcohol pricing, availability and marketing, beginning with the full implementation of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill,” said Mr Cullen. Alcohol Action Ireland is also urging parents to talk openly with their children about their plans to celebrate their Leaving Cert results. “Getting the Leaving Cert results can be an emotional and, for some, a stressful time, particularly for those who may not have done quite as well as they had hoped. If you add alcohol into the mix this can make an already challenging situation even more difficult for young people,” said Mr Cullen. “We are urging parents to talk openly with their children about what their plans are for the evening and make sure they know all the important details, such as what they will be doing, who they will be with where they are going and how – and at what times – they plan on getting there and coming home. “It is also important to <b>let</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> know they can call you without fear of recrimination if they feel unsafe or unwell at any point. They need to know that, as parents, while you may not be happy with the fact they may have been drinking, their safety is your priority and that they are to contact you immediately if they are in trouble. ” -Ends- For further information or comment please contact Conor Cullen, Communications Officer, Alcohol Action Ireland, on 01 - 8780610 or 087 - 9950186...|$|E

40|$|Sibling rivalry You have a {{headache}} and the dog is barking. You cannot get the sales person off the phone {{and you can see}} the long list of chores posted on the refrigerator door. On top of everything else, your kids are fighting like crazy with everything they’ve got—biting, scratching, and throwing toys. ■ Fighting among young children Constant fighting, put downs, and arguing among children cause frustration and concern in most parents. Although sibling rivalry can have several reasons, brothers and sisters often fight to get the attention of parents or to show power or superiority over another child. Some bickering is normal among brothers and sisters. Constant arguing, fighting, and creating potentially dangerous situations, however, are not normal. The following are some ideas to help reduce your frustration over quarrelsome siblings and lessen the fighting too. ■ Let siblings express their feelings about each other When children complain about each other, parents often try to talk them out of their feelings. (“You shouldn’t be mad at your sister, ” or “Stop complaining. He’s the only brother you have. ”) Instead, acknowledge their anger or frustration. <b>Let</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> know that you understand their anger. That can help them feel better and even treat another child better. Use this as a tool to lessen sibling rivalry in several ways. Identify the angry child’s feelings with words, (“You sound furious! You wish he’d ask before using your things. ”) and suggest symbolic or creative activity (“Would you like to draw a picture of how mad you feel?”). You may be surprised at how quickly the anger disappears when you <b>let</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> know that you’re aware of, and understand their frustration. Jennifer has two sons, Jimmy, 5, and Danny, 4, who had trouble getting along since they were very little. Playing together often ends in grabbing toys, calling each other names, and complaints to Jennifer. At an evening class on parenting, Jennifer heard that kids fight less when the parent describes what the kids might be feeling. It seemed too good to be true, but Jennifer decided to give it a try. The next time Danny came to complain about Jimmy, Jennifer said, “Sounds like you’re feeling pretty ma...|$|R

40|$|On Friday 12 June 1964, a {{crowd of}} more than 300, 000 people congregated {{in the streets of}} Adelaide to see the Beatles. 'Hysteria in City', 'Amazing scenes as Hotel Besieged' and 'Beatle Frenzy' the {{headlines}} in Adelaide’s newspapers shouted. Two days later, 30, 000 'screaming, chanting, struggling' teenagers massed outside Melbourne's Southern Cross hotel to glimpse the Beatles. Clearly distressed, television reporter Tony Charlton exclaimed: 'Mothers, if <b>your</b> <b>child</b> is out there, you should be ashamed'. 'The stupidity of <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> come to something like this must be hitting home'. With mounted police carrying collapsed teenagers from the mayhem and about 150 injuries, the spectacle frightened many observers. In Sydney too, Beatlemania, reigned supreme, as more than 10, 000 'screaming, squealing, stomping fans packed into the Beatles' concerts. A number of lucky fans attended Paul McCartney’s birthday party. The Beatles performed in New Zealand, before returning to Australia to play at Brisbane. Again the group generated frenzied and hysterical cheering and uncontrollable screaming from their fans, with the Courier-Mail reporting that during the concerts 'the thumping guitars and piercing screams could be heard a block away'. But the Brisbane visit was an anti-climax in many ways. Although 8000 fans greeted the Beatles at the airport, university students, sick of hearing Beatles records on the radio and Beatlemaina more generally, threw eggs at the 'fab four'. Furthermore, the police prevented large crowds from congregating outside the Beatles’ hotel.

40|$|Practicing sports has {{traditionally}} been regarded as a good and healthy leisure activitiy for children. Organised sport has a strong position in Sweden and most children will take part in organised sport {{at some point during}} their childhood (Engström 1996; Patriksson 1987; Ungdomsstyrelsen 2005). The image of children participating in organised sport seems to be so strong and positive that it has become a part of what is considered ‘good childhood’ (and ‘good parenthood’ means <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> participate in sport activities), along with play and innocence. Sport has become a part of how children’s life and childhood today are socially constructed. Through sport a child can become what it should be, and learn important lessons before entering adulthood. However, the belief that children automatically benefit and develop into good citizens just by participating in organised sport is losing its strength in the public debate. One {{reason for this is that}} it seems as if the most important element, playing for fun, is gradually disappearing and that children’s sports have become too serious (David 2004; Peterson 2002). Increasing professionalism and commercialisation of sport has been blamed for contributing to the seriousness and the belief that children should practise sports from an early age, in order to develop the right and necessary sport specific skills (ibid.). The critical voices in the public debate may have been influenced by the growing awareness of Children’s Rights. Whether this is true or not is an interesting question; however, it is not the subject of this article. Instead, the aim is to discuss the social construction of children and (indirectly also) childhood in connection to two empirical examples, the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Swedish sports movement. The point of departure is a presentation of ‘new childhood studies’ and some previous research on children’s sports connected to children’s rights (human rights). This is followed by a brief account of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, and a short retrospect of children’s admission to the Swedish sports movement. Throughout the article I will elaborate on the shortcomings of previous research and some of the paradoxes in the social construction of childhood in order to point out some interesting questions for further research...|$|R

6000|$|It {{happened}} {{that when the}} Bawcombes settled at Doveton, just as Mr. Ellerby had taken to the shepherd, making a friend of him, so Mrs. Ellerby took to the shepherd's wife, and fell {{into the habit of}} paying frequent visits to her in her cottage. She was a very handsome woman, of a somewhat stately presence, dignified in manner, and she wore her abundant hair in curls hanging on each side to her shoulders--a fashion common at that time. From the first she appeared to take a particular interest in the Bawcombes, and they could not but notice that she was more gracious and friendly towards them than to the others of their station on the farm. The Bawcombes had three children then, aged six, four, and two years respectively, all remarkably healthy, with rosy cheeks and black eyes, and they were merry-tempered little things. Mrs. Ellerby appeared much taken with the children; praised their mother for always keeping them so clean and nicely dressed, and wondered how she could manage it on their small earnings. The carter and his wife lived in a cottage close by, and they, too, had three little children, and next to the carter's was the bailiff's cottage, and he, too, was married and had children; but Mrs. Ellerby never went into their cottages, and the shepherd and his wife concluded that it was because in both cases the children were rather puny, sickly-looking little things and were never very clean. The carter's wife, too, was a slatternly woman. One day when Mrs. Ellerby came in to see Mrs. Bawcombe the carter's wife was just going out of the door, and Mrs. Ellerby appeared displeased, and before leaving she said, [...] "I hope, Mrs. Bawcombe, {{you are not going to}} mix too freely with <b>your</b> neighbours or <b>let</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> go too much with them and fall into their ways." [...] They also observed that when she passed their neighbours' children in the lane she spoke no word and appeared not to see them. Yet she was kind to them too, and whenever she brought a big parcel of cakes, fruit, and sweets for the children, which she often did, she would tell the shepherd's wife to divide it into three lots, one for her own children and the others for those of her two neighbours. It was clear to see that Mrs. Ellerby had grown fond of her children, especially of the eldest, the little rosy-cheeked six-year-old boy. Sitting in the cottage she would call him to her side and would hold his hand while conversing with his mother; she would also bare the child's arm just for the pleasure of rubbing it with her hand and clasping it round with her fingers, and sometimes when caressing the child in this way she would turn her face aside to hide the tears that dropped from her eyes.|$|R
