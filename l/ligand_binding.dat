5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on <b>ligand</b> <b>binding.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ribose-binding {{protein is}} a bifunctional soluble {{receptor}} {{found in the}} periplasm of Escherichia coli.

We have generated a functional map of the surface of ribose-binding protein by creating and analyzing directed mutations of exposed residues. Residues in an area on the cleft side of the molecule including both domains have effects on transport. A portion of the area involved in transport is also essential to chemotactic function. On the opposite face of the protein, mutations in residues near the hinge are shown to affect chemotaxis specifically...|$|R

25|$|The {{foundations}} for which <b>ligand</b> <b>binding</b> assay {{have been built}} {{are a result of}} Karl Landsteiner, in 1945, and his work on immunization of animals through the production of antibodies for certain proteins. Landsteiner’s work demonstrated that immunoassay technology allowed researchers to analyze at the molecular level. The first successful <b>ligand</b> <b>binding</b> assay was reported in 1960 by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson. They investigated the binding interaction for insulin and an insulin-specific antibody, in addition to developing the first radioimmunoassay (RIA) for insulin. These discoveries provided precious information regarding both the sensitivity and specificity of protein hormones found within blood-based fluids. Yalow and Berson received the Nobel Prize in Medicine {{as a result of their}} advancements. Through the development of RIA technology, researchers have been able to move beyond the use of radioactivity, and instead, use liquid- and solid-phase, competitive, and immunoradiometric assays. As a direct result of these monumental findings, researchers have continued the advancement of <b>ligand</b> <b>binding</b> assays in many facets in the fields of biology, chemistry, and the like.|$|E

An example of a TNF receptor is Fas (CD95), which recruits activator caspases like caspase-8 upon binding TNF at the cell surface. The activation of the initiator caspases then initiates a downstream cascade of events that results in the induction of effector caspases that function in apoptosis.|$|R

25|$|The {{interaction}} of most ligands with their binding sites {{can be characterized}} {{in terms of a}} binding affinity. In general, high-affinity <b>ligand</b> <b>binding</b> results from greater intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity <b>ligand</b> <b>binding</b> involves less intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor. In general, high-affinity binding results in a higher degree of occupancy for the ligand at its receptor binding site than is the case for low-affinity binding; the residence time (lifetime of the receptor-ligand complex) does not correlate. High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior of an associated ion channel or enzyme.|$|E

Herein, we report the development of the novel method differential epitope mapping by STD NMR (DEEP-STD NMR) for identifying the type of protein residues contacting the ligand. The method produces differential epitope maps through 1) differential frequency STD NMR and/or 2) differential solvent (D 2 O/H 2 O) STD NMR experiments. The two approaches provide different complementary information on the binding pocket. We demonstrate that DEEP-STD NMR can be used to readily obtain pharmacophore information on the protein. Furthermore, if the 3 D structure of the protein is known, this information also helps in orienting the <b>ligand</b> in the <b>binding</b> pocket...|$|R
