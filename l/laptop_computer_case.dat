5000|$|The <b>computer</b> <b>case</b> {{encloses}} most of {{the components}} of the system. It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer, and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs from Apple, namely the iMac, and similar types, include a video display in the same <b>case.</b> Portable and <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> require <b>cases</b> that provide impact protection for the unit. A current development in <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> is a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as s touch-screen tablet. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called case modding.|$|R

40|$|Popularity {{of mobile}} {{computing}} in organizations has risen significantly {{over the past}} few years. Notebooks and <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> provide the necessary computing power and mobility for executives, managers, and other professionals. Such advantages come with a price for the security of the organizational networks: increased vulnerability. The paper discusses three types of mobile computing vulnerability: physical, system, and network access vulnerability. Using a managerial approach, the paper offers a framework to deal with such vulnerabilities. The framework suggests specific courses of action for two possible scenarios. When there is no present threat, a proactive approach is suggested. When one or more threats are present, a reactive, matrix-based approach is suggested. Both approaches offer a systematic methodology to address laptop vulnerabilities. A similar framework can be extended to address security vulnerabilities of other mobile computing devices in addition to notebooks and <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> A real <b>case</b> scenario from a network in a university college in the southeastern U.

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} {{has changed}} the outlook of traditional business trading behavior. It is now common to see business-to-business (B 2 B), business-to-consumer (B 2 C) and consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) commerce on the Internet. However, another type of model, consumer-to-business (C 2 B), is seldom found. A possible reason for this phenomenon is transaction cost; to unite a group of candidate buyers’ common needs and preferences to buy a product or service is uneasy. Difficulties arise, for example, in how to synthesize individual’s preferences into a group’s consensus, how {{to communicate with each}} other within the group, and how to collectively negotiate with a seller, etc. To establish a successful business model in the electronic market, however, these processes have to be implemented. We address these issues in this paper, and propose a Buyer Collective Purchasing (BCP) model implemented in a multi-agent framework. A prototype system, which uses a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> purchasing <b>case</b> as an example, is created to demonstrate the idea and show how the model works...|$|R

Two different possibilities to locate a Vehicle have been studied and experimented with and are described in this report: standalone GPS and Differential GPS (DGPS). In both cases we must use a Computer running Windows 95 with a map display carefully chosen, a Terminal Node Controller (TNC) and a VHF receiver at the base station which was situated in Gillin Hall. In each vehicle, we needed at least a GPS receiver, a TNC, a VHF transmitter, and a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer.</b> In the <b>case</b> of the DGPS system, we must also have a beacon receiver for the corrections.

40|$|Master of EducationLaptop {{computers}} {{have been used}} in mathematics classrooms for approximately 10 years and {{there has not been a}} comprehensive study into how <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> are used, teachers' attitudes towards <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> use, and perceived student benefits. This study focuses on: i) How <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> are used in the mathematics classroom, concentrating on the types of software used and the type and the activities conducted. ii) Teachers' attitudes towards the use of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> in the mathematics classroom, in particular how their attitudes and experiences may effect the use of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> iii) Teachers' perceptions of student benefits in terms of understanding and performing mathematical tasks using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> This study shows that there is a wide variety of software used and a large number of activities completed in mathematics classrooms with <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> Teachers favoured using spreadsheets above any other type of software and tended to use the <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> for computational, open-ended activities rather than conceptual tasks. Teachers had varying attitudes about how and when <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> should be used in the mathematics classroom. There appeared to be connections between a teacher's own use of the computer and the way the teacher used the <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> in the classroom. Some teachers used the <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> very frequently whilst others used them sparingly. The most valuable type of in-service about using computers came from the teacher's own faculty, through formal and informal discussions. Finally, not all teachers believed there were benefits for their students from using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> There was no conclusive evidence about whether teachers believed their students had an increased ability to understand mathematics due to using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers,</b> but, there was evidence of increased student motivation.

40|$|Thermal {{management}} {{materials used}} for heat sink in <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> is reviewed in this paper. In <b>laptop</b> <b>computers,</b> heat sink plays {{a vital role}} of dissipating heat from the system. Heat sink is a vital component in a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> because it dissipates the heat generated by the system. The overall efficiency, cost, {{and size of the}} system could be influenced by the heat sink device. Four selection criteria; thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, density, and cost were abducted for selecting a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> heat sink material in this paper. An ideal heat sink material exhibits high thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, low density, and low cost. Aluminium and copper are mainly used for <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> heat sinks. Aluminium is used where weight reduction is needed while copper is used when weight is not considered as a major factor. However, the high demand for materials with low coefficient of thermal expansion and high thermal conductivity is due to the use of ceramic materials for substrates. Aluminium and copper fall short of the required coefficient of thermal expansion hence the need for advance composite materials. Based on the four selection criteria for a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> heat sink material, Al/SiC has superior property potentials and is recommended as a near optimum material for this purpose...|$|R
