Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E

30|$|All paint samples {{presented}} {{illustrate that}} arsenic migrates {{throughout the whole}} depth of the multi-layered paint structure of the artwork, from the wood substrate to top varnish layers. The De Heem sample indicates that arsenic has a high affinity for lead-containing layers resulting in lead-arsenic rich crystalline needles, interpreted as <b>lead</b> <b>arsenates.</b> <b>Lead</b> <b>arsenates</b> are typically seen as opacifiers in glasses, {{and this is the}} first time that they are observed to form as paint degradation products. The emerald green particles might seem visually to be intact in the Van Gogh and the Austrian cupboard samples. Nevertheless, relatively low yields of arsenic are found throughout the paint sample indicating minor degradation of emerald green occurring in the area surrounding these particles. The photo-degradation of orpiment and realgar and the chemical degradation of emerald green have the arsenic-containing degradation products in common. XANES of the De Heem and The Descent of the Cattle samples revealed As 3 + in and close to the intact particles, while at larger distances As 5 + is present. It was not possible to distinguish between arsenic trioxide and emerald green with XANES because in both cases arsenic has a 3 + valence. It is clear that the most favorable and stable form of the arsenic degradation product in paint is arsenate. Further research is required to understand the extent of any lateral migration of the arsenic.|$|R
30|$|Arsenic K-edge XANES {{analyses}} {{carried out}} on The Descent of the Cattle sample identified species containing both As 3 + and As 5 +. Figure  8 i shows the XANES taken from the emerald green pigment (reference sample, black), an As–Cu rich particle in the paint sample (layer 6, magenta), the iron-containing ground layer (layer 3, green), the copper rich layer (layers 9 – 10, red), and the varnish (layer 15 – 16 blue). The white line of the emerald green pigment is found at 11, 871.8  eV, but the As–Cu rich particle has peaks at both 11, 871.9 and 11, 875.2  eV. The first peak in the XANES of the As–Cu particle matches the white line of the emerald green reference and is interpreted as an intact emerald green pigment particle. As the XANES represents {{the bulk of the}} paint sample (no thin section was made), we expect that the white line at 11, 875.2  eV originates from the degradation product of the emerald green surrounding the particle. The iron-containing ground as well as the copper-containing layers both have white lines at 11, 875.4  eV, while the white line of the varnish lies at 11, 875.7  eV. The main arsenic species in The Descent of the Cattle sample is As 5 +, an arsenate. The slight difference in the position of the white line is thought to be caused by different counter-ions. Lead is the dominating cation present in the varnish and can act as a counter ion forming <b>lead</b> <b>arsenates</b> [1]. Iron arsenates {{are most likely to be}} formed in the iron layer, but <b>lead</b> <b>arsenates</b> cannot be excluded. Besides copper, the copper-containing layer also has lead, calcium, and potassium, so presumably <b>lead</b> and/or calcium <b>arsenates</b> are present. As in previous research, arsenic trioxide has been proposed as the main degradation product, and these results show that arsenates are the final end product of the chemical degradation of emerald green.|$|R

50|$|Arsenite {{inhibits}} {{not only}} the formation of acetyl-CoA but also the enzyme succinic dehydrogenase. Arsenate can replace phosphate in many reactions. It is able to form Glc-6-Arsenate in vitro; therefore {{it has been argued}} that hexokinase could be inhibited. (Eventually this may be a mechanism leading to muscle weakness in chronic arsenic poisoning.) In the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction arsenate attacks the enzyme-bound thioester. The formed 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate is unstable and hydrolyzes spontaneously. Thus, ATP formation in Glycolysis is inhibited while bypassing the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction. (Moreover, the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes might be affected, followed by a higher oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and subsequently enhanced cyanosis) As shown by Gresser (1981), submitochondrial particles synthesize Adenosine-5’-diphosphate-arsenate from ADP and arsenate in presence of succinate. Thus, by a variety of mechanisms <b>arsenate</b> <b>leads</b> to an impairment of cell respiration and subsequently diminished ATP formation.

Efforts were made to find a process-oriented concept so as to provide a wide field of application. In developing the model and the laboratory experiments, this meant studying all the processes in groundwater separately as far as possible and avoiding case-specific sum parameters. The work centered on an examination of sorption processes during transport in groundwater, as this combination of processes is always found in natural porous aquifers. In water-saturated-column experiments on combinations of arenaceous quartz, feldspar, montmorillonite, goethite, peat and manganese oxide as the aquifer material, the transport of cadmium, copper, <b>lead</b> and <b>arsenate</b> was simulated on the bench scale.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 546. Pentavalent arsenic {{and lead}} are {{presently}} {{considered to be}} one of the major soil pollutants. Theseand widespread elements t occur in very low concentrations. Their natural concentrations in soils and waters are the results of leaching from rocks containing Pb and As(V) minerals. However, concentration of these elements in environment can be drastically raised by anthropogenic processes, such as coal combustion, mining, metallurgy, pesticides application or glass manufacturing. Leaching of Pb and As(V) from soils and residues containing <b>lead</b> <b>arsenates</b> may cause contamination of the pedosphere. Arsenic and lead minerals are relatively numerous but in nature occur occasionally. The most common secondary As(V) and Pb minerals are schultenite (PbHAsO 4), mimetite (Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl), hydroxymimetite (Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 OH) and sahlinite (Pb 14 (AsO 4) 2 O 9 Cl 4), though mimetite is considered to be prevalent (Bajda 2011). Mimetite, as a slightly soluble and thermodynamically stable mineral, especially at pH above 5 characteristic to natural waters and soil solutions, is considered to have great possibilities to be applied in remediation procedures (Bajda 2010). Mobility and bioavailability of lead and arsenic can be controlled by mimetite crystallization at mentioned pH range, then important aim arises, to determine stability of Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl at pH below 5. Solubilization of extremely insoluble apatite through efficient ligand-promoted organic complexation of metals has been observed before, which suggests that mimetite dissolution may be similarly enhanced by low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) (Bajda 2011). The influence of LMWOAs on mimetite stability was investigated, but malic acid was not included in these experiments, which is a purpose of this research. Batch dissolution experiments were carried out with use of mimetite synthetized of Na 2 HAsO 4 · 7 H 2 O, KCl and Pb(NO 3) 2. Malic acid concentrations selected to these experiments were 0. 1 mM; 0. 5 mM; 1 mM; 5 mM; 10 mM. As a control there were used threre non-organic solutions with pH set using HNO 3 to be similar to the primary pH measured in certain organic acid solutions. The purpose of performing non-organic samples was to compare effect of pH on mimetite dissolution at parallel pH value in organic and inorganic acid solutions. Duration of the experiment was 120 hours and samples were taken after 24, 48, and 120 hours. The total Pb concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and pentavalent As concentration were determined colorimetrically by the molybdene blue method (UV-Vis). Data obtained for the experiment allowed to notice that the state of equilibrium was reached before 24 hours regardless of pH and organics concentration. It was found that lower values of pH enhance mimetite dissolution, which is confirmation of previously run studies (Bajda 2011, Magalhales & Silva 2003). Solubility of mimetite expressed by the amount of As(V) and Pb released to the solution was significantly higher at low pH. Similar correlation was observed investigating solubility and acid concentration: the higher the acid concentration is, the more elements were released to the solution. The total concentration of As(V) in 10 mM acid solution was about 20 times greater than in 0. 1 mM. For lead this ratio was lower and equaled 11. 4. This mechanism mainly depends on free protons concentration and the process of protonation, which is proved by released curves for controls where samples containing inorganic nitric acid instead of malic also exhibit higher solubility of mimetite at low pH. However, because of Pb-malate complexes formation, presence of organic anions can noticeably increase the scale of mimetite decomposition. Complexation and protonation of mimetite surface are complementary and additive processes, which speeds up and intensifies mimetite dissolution. The difference between total As(V) in samples and controls was 12. 5 % for 5 mM and 26. 5 % for 1 mM while for Pb it was respectively 5. 6 % and 8. 6 %. This suggests that soil organic acids can potentially liberate Pb and As(V) from mimetite and thereby comprise a probable risk to the groundwater quality. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
