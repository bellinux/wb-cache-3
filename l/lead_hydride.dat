By utilizing a peristaltic pump, an acidic solution of Pb 2 + was first oxidized with ammonium peroxodisulphate, NH 4 S 2 O 8, and followed by reduction with sodium tetrahydroborate, NaBH 4. After a gas-liquid separation, the gaseous <b>lead</b> <b>hydride</b> produced was directly swept into an electrically heated open ended quartz tube, located at the light path of an atomic absorption spectrometer in order to have possibilities for specific atomic absorption spectroscopic measurements. The absorbance signals caused by lead atomic absorption could be used proportionally to estimate the density of atomic lead vapor produced in the thermal decomposition under investigation. Results showed that on-line pre-oxidation of the analyte is very important and crucial step in the gaseous hydride generation of lead, and no <b>lead</b> <b>hydride</b> was produced without the involvement of this step. Moreover, it was observed that the use of low major gas flows cannot be applied in quantitative atomic absorption spectrometric determination of lead by this technique.

The effects of trapping temperature and argon flow rate were also investigated. Under the conditions giving the best peak area sensitivity, the detection limit (concentration giving a signal equal to three S.

The detection limit was improved to 0. 03 μg l− 1 when the ferricyanide was purified by passage through a cation-exchange resin.

The determination of Mg in aqueous slurries of kaolin was optimised using the Mg(II) 279. 079 nm line and conventional sample introduction.

40|$|Analytical {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of trace amounts of germanium, tin and arsenic were established using hydride generation coupled with direct current plasma atomic emission spectrometry. A continuous gas flowing batch system for the hydride generation was investigated and was applied to {{the determination of}} germanium(Ge), tin(Sn), antimony(Sb) and lead(Pb) (Preliminary results suggest that it is also applicable to arsenic) As)). With this system, the reproducibility of signals was improved and the determination was speeded up, compared with the conventional batch type hydride generation system. Each determination was complete within one minute. Interferences from a number of transition metal ions, especially from Pd(II), Pt(IV), Ni(II), Cu(II), Co(II), and Fe(II, III), have proven to be very serious under normal conditions, in the determination of germanium, tin, and arsenic. These interference effects were eliminated or significantly reduced in the presence of L-cystine or L-cysteine. Thus, a 10 - 1000 fold excess of Ni(II), Cu(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Pt(IV), Pd(II), etc. can be tolerated without interference, In the presence of L-cystine or L-cysteine, compared with absence of interference reducing agent. The methods for the determination of Ge, Sn, and As were examined by the analyses of standard reference materials. Interference effects from the sample matrix, for example, in transition metal-rich samples, copper, iron and steel, were eliminated by L-cystine (for As and Sn) and by LI cysteine (for Ge). The analysis of a number of standard reference materials gave excellent results of As and Sn contents in agreement with the certified values, showing there was no systematic interference. The detection limits for both germanium and tin were 20 pg ml- I. Preliminary studies were carried out for the determination of antimony and lead. Antimony was found to react with NaBH 4, remaInIng from the previous determinations, giving an analytical signal. A reversed injection manner, i. e., injection of the NaBH 4 solution prior to the analyte solution was used to avoid uncertainty caused by residual NaBH 4 present and to ensure that an excess of NaB H 4 was available. A solution of 0. 4 % L-cysteine was found to reduce the interference from selected transition metal ions, Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pt(IV). Hydrochloric acid - hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid - ammonium persulphate, and potassium dichromate malic acid reaction systems for <b>lead</b> <b>hydride</b> generation were compared. The potassium dichromate - malic acid reaction medium proved to be the best with respect to reproducibility and minimal interference. Cu(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II) caused strong interference In lead determinations, which was not reduced by L-cysteine or Lcystine. Sodium citrate, ascorbic acid, dithizone, thiosemicarbazide and penicillamine reduced interferences to some extent. Further interference reduction studies were carried out uSIng a number of amino acids, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and histidine, as possible interference reducing agents in the determination of germanium. From glycine, alanine, valine to leucine, the interference reduction effect in germanium determinations decreased. Histidine II was found to be very promising In the reduction of interference. In fact, histidine proved more efficient than L-cystine and L-cysteine In the reduction of interference from Ni(II) in the determination of germanium. Signal enhancement by easily ionized elements (EIEs), usually regarded as an interference effect in analysis by DCP-AES, was studied and successfully applied to advantage in improving the sensitivity and detection limit in the determination of As, Ge, Sn, Sb, and Pb. The effect of alkali and alkaline-earth elements on the determination of the above five hydride forming elements was studied. With the appropriate EIE, a signal enhancement of 40 - 115 % was achieved. Linear calibration and good reproducibility were also obtained in the presence of EIEs. II...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFormation {{of metal}} {{hydrides}} {{is a serious}} complication that occur when hydride forming metals such as zirconium, niobium, vanadium and magnesium are exposed to long term hydrogen environment. The main {{concern is that the}} hydride, as being a brittle material, has very poor fracture mechanical properties. Formation of hydride is associated with transportation of hydrogen along the gradients of increasing hydrostatic stress, which leads to crack tips and other stress concentrators, where it forms the hydride. In the present study the thermodynamics of the evolving hydrides is studied. The process is driven by the release of free strain, chemical, and gradient energies. A phase field model is used to capture the driving forces that the release of the free energy causes. The study gives the conditions that <b>lead</b> to <b>hydride</b> advancement versus retreat and under which conditions the metal-hydride interface becomes unstable and develops a waviness.

In order to study the combined effects of temperature, hydrogen content, loading direction and stress state, Axial Tensile, Hoop Tensile, Expansion Due to Compression and hoop Plane Strain Tensile tests are performed at room temperature, 350 °C and 480 °C on the material containing various hydrogen contents up to 1200 wt. ppm (hydrides are circumferential and homogeneously distributed). These tests are combined with digital image correlation and metallographic and fractographic observations at different scales. The flow stress of the material decreases with increasing temperature. The material is either strengthened or softened by hydrogen depending on temperature and hydrogen content. Plastic anisotropy depends on temperature but not on hydrogen content. The ductility of the material decreases with increasing hydrogen content at room temperature due to damage nucleation by hydride cracking. The plastic strain that <b>leads</b> to <b>hydride</b> fracture at room temperature decreases with increasing hydrogen content. The influence of stress triaxiality on hydride cracking is negligible in the studied range.

40|$|Abstract. Hydride-induced {{embrittlement}} is {{one type}} of material deterioration caused by hydrogen in metals such as zirconium, titanium, magnesium, niobium and vanadium. According to in-situ electron microscopy studies, embrittlement may occur by the precipitation of brittle hydrides at stress concentration locations. The fracture of the <b>hydrides</b> could <b>lead</b> to delayed <b>hydride</b> cracking, which is a sub-critical crack growth mechanism operating by the repetition of hydride precipitation and fracture near the crack tip. In the present work, steady-state sub-critical crack growth in α-titanium is investigated. It is confirmed that hydride precipitation has a strong effect on the hydrostatic stress level ahead of the propagating crack and leads to significant deviations from the well-known near-tip stress distributions in elastic-plastic materials. The threshold stress intensity factor for sustained load cracking is predicted by considering {{the distribution of the}} hoop stress on the crack plane. The extent of the hydride-rich zone near the crack tip is also calculated and used for the estimation of the velocity of the crack within stage-II regime. Thus a simplified diagram of crack velocity vs. applied stress intensity factor is constructed...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{injection}} hydride generation {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry is the practice of derivatizing the analyte to the volatile hydride by flow injection and introducing it to the spectrometer in the gas phase. Although hydride generation is well developed, there are still aspects and nuances which require investigation to improve the understanding of this method of sample introduction. The suggestion that the addition of various surfactants to the reagents in the hydride forming reaction has beneficial effects has been investigated. Although, in previous reports, an increase in sensitivity had {{been reported in the}} presence of surfactants, such an improvement was not observed for the flow injection procedure used in the work described in this dissertation. ^ The effect of dissolved salts on the hydride forming reaction has been investigated. An increase in sensitivity in the presence of high concentrations of dissolved salts has been observed. This has been attributed to an increase in the proportion of the volatile hydride which is removed from the reagents in the on-line procedure. ^ In the hydride trapping procedure, the hydrides are trapped on the interior of an electrothermal atomizer prior to atomization. Although previous reports have indicated that one may improve the limit of detection simply by increasing sample size, a practical and theoretical investigation concluded that the relationship is not linear, and that the limit of detection is limited by impurities in the reagents. ^ Methods for the determination of <b>lead</b> by <b>hydride</b> generation with quartz tube and electrothermal atomization have been developed.

Two types of C–H bond activation are observed in the experiment, and pertinent mechanistic features include inter alia: (i) the metal center of [Zn(OH) ]+ serves as active site in the hydride transfer to generate [i-C 3 H 7]+ as major product, (ii) generally, a high regioselectivity is accompanied by remarkable chemoselectivity: for example, the activation of a methyl C–H bond results mainly {{in the formation of}} water and [Zn(C 3,H 7) ]+. According to computational work, this ionic product corresponds to [HZn(CH 3 CH[double bond, length as m-dash]CH 2) ]+. Attack of the zinc center at a secondary C–H bond <b>leads</b> preferentially to <b>hydride</b> transfer, thus giving rise to the generation of [i-C 3 H 7]+; (iii) upon oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), liberation of CH 3 CH 2 [double bond, length as m-dash]CH 2 occurs to produce [HZn(H 2 O) ]+. Both, ODH as well as H 2 O loss proceed through the same intermediate which is characterized by the fact that a methylene hydrogen atom from the substrate is transferred to the zinc and one hydrogen atom from the methyl group to the OH group of [Zn(OH) ]+. The combined experimental/computational gas-phase study of C–H bond activation by zinc hydroxide provides mechanistic insight into related zinc-catalyzed large-scale processes and identifies the crucial role that the Lewis-acid character of zinc plays.

The first investigation applies to locating the steam generators in the risers {{instead of the}} down-comers of a simple flow path designed sub-critical reactor of 600 MWth power. This was compared to a similar design, but with the steam generators located in the downcomers. The transients investigated were Total-Loss-of-Power and unprotected Loss-Of-Flow. It is shown that this reactor peaks at 1041 K after 29 hours during a Total-Loss-Of-Power accident. The difference between locating the steam generators in the risers and the downcomers is insignificant for this accident type. During an unprotected Loss-Of-Flow accident at full power the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 1010 K, which is 337 K above nominal outlet temperature.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis explores two distinct fields of organometallic chemistry with a common goal of selectively transforming cheap and abundant feedstocks to value-added chemicals using homogeneous catalysts. Chapter 1 presents the synthesis and characterization {{of a series of}} bis(diphenylphosphino) amine ligands and their corresponding chromium(III) trichloride complexes. The isolated chromium complexes are precursors to highly active catalysts for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1 -hexene and 1 -octene. The unique feature of the ligands presented herein is the presence of coordinating functionalities tethered to the nitrogen backbone. These act as hemilabile donors, which stabilize the active species and/or transition states during catalysis. This increased stability leads to more productive catalysts. Furthermore, important solvent and additive effects have been investigated. While reactions in non-polar solvents exhibit poor activity at lower ethylene pressures, those in more polar solvents are highly active and generate very little undesired polymer. Varying the solvent has a significant impact on 1 -hexene/ 1 -octene selectivity as well. Experiments with potentially coordinating additives result in a higher tendency for 1 -octene formation. An investigation of catalyst decomposition is also discussed. Chapter 2 presents synthetic, structural and reactivity studies on a series of Group 7 carbonyl derivatives relevant to synthesis gas conversion. Reduction of the carbonyl precursors with a hydride source generates the corresponding formyl species. This reaction is facilitated when more electrophilic carbonyl complexes are employed. Neutral and cationic Fischer carbene complexes were prepared by the reaction of the formyl species with boranes and alkyltriflates, respectively.

The reaction {{was carried out in}} a recirculation apparatus with continuous on-line analysis of all gas-phase components (H 2, D 2, HD, H 2 S, D 2 S, and HDS) by a mass spectrometer. The low reaction temperature (423 K) allowed {{for the first time a}} comparison to be made of the catalytic activity between Co sulfide particles in low-temperature sulfided (373 K) carbon-supported Co and those in standard sulfided (673 K) carbon-supported CoMo, which have similar 57 Co MES parameters. On the basis of the much higher activity of the bimetallic catalyst than of the monometallic catalysts (Co and Mo sulfide) it is concluded that the observed synergy is related neither to the effect of the high dispersion of the Co sulfide nor seemingly to spillover effects as put forward by the remote control model. The results indicate that the sulfur atoms that bridge between Co 2 + and Mo 4 + play a crucial role during the catalytic cycle. During the equilibration reaction also extensive exchange takes place between hydrogen (deuterium) atoms adsorbed on the sulfided phase and hydrogen atoms present at the carbon support surface. This spillover process is accelerated by admixture of H 2 S, which most probably leads to an increase of terminal SH groups by dissociative H 2 S adsorption. These SH groups are thought to form hydrogen bridges with the carbon support functional groups. Both H 2 and H 2 S compete for adsorption on the same coordinatively unsaturated sites. While heterolytic dissociation of H 2 is considered to <b>lead</b> to a <b>hydride</b> and a bridging SH group between Co and Mo, heterolytic dissociation of H 2 S would lead to the formation of two SH groups, one bridging SH group and one terminal SH group active in forming hydrogen bridges with the support surface functional groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of osmium(II) complexes containing a CC 6 H 4,CBzIm,CBzIm,CC 6 H 4 -tetradentate ligand with a −CH 2 CH 2 – {{link between the}} benzimidazolidene (BzIm) groups is described, {{and the influence of}} the link on their structures and emissive properties is analyzed. The hexahydride complex OsH 6 (PiPr 3) 2 (1) reacts with 1, 1 ′-diphenyl- 3, 3 ′-ethylenedibenzimidazolium bromide in dimethylformamide to afford OsBr{κ 3 -C,C,C-(C 6 H 4 -BzIm-CH 2 CH 2 -BzIm-Ph) }(CO) (PiPr 3) 2 (2), {{as a result of the}} direct metalation of both benzimidazolium moieties of the salt, the o-CH bond activation of a phenyl substituent, and the carbonylation of the metal center by action of the solvent. Treatment of 2 with Na[BH 4] <b>leads</b> to the <b>hydride</b> derivative OsH{κ 3 -C,C,C-(C 6 H 4 -BzIm-CH 2 CH 2 -BzIm-Ph) }(CO) (PiPr 3) 2 (3), which evolves into Os{κ 4 -C,C,C,C-(C 6 H 4 -BzIm-CH 2 CH 2 -BzIm-C 6 H 4) }(CO) (PiPr 3) 2 (4) as a consequence of the assisted C–H bond activation of the second phenyl substituent. The use of dimethyl sulfoxide instead of dimethylformamide allows the generation of the tetradentate ligand in one pot. Stirring of dimethyl sulfoxide solutions of 1 leads to Os{κ 4 -C,C,C,C-(C 6 H 4 -BzIm-CH 2 CH 2 -BzIm-C 6 H 4) }(DMSO) 2 (5). The solvent molecules of 5 can be displaced by 1, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) ethylene (bdppe), 1, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) benzene (dppbz), and tetrafluorobenzobarrelene (TFB) to yield the [4 + 2] derivatives Os{κ 4 -C,C,C,C-(C 6 H 4 -BzIm-CH 2 CH 2 -BzIm-C 6 H 4) }L 2 (L 2 = bdppe (6), dppbz (7), TFB (8)). The X-ray structures of 4, 6, and 7 reveal that, in these compounds, the tetradentate ligand adopts a mer three-planar disposition of a phenyl and two benzimidazolidene groups with the other phenyl group situated in a perpendicular direction disposed trans to L. The reason for this preference is electronic. Thus, the stereochemistry of 7 is the same as that found in the related complexes Os{κ 2 -C,C-(MeBzIm-C 6 H 4) } 2 (dppbz) (13) and Os{κ 2 -C,C-(MeBzIm*-C 6 H 4) } 2 (dppbz) (14) containing two free ortho-metalated N-phenylbenzimidazolidene ligands. Complexes 7, 13, and 14 are phosphorescent. The first of them shows emissions narrower and bluer than those of 13 and 14.

40|$|Overview of Research Goals and Accomplishments for the Period 07 / 01 / 06 – 06 / 30 / 07 : Our overall {{research}} goal is {{to transform}} the rapidly emerging synthetic chemistry involving alkyl-alkyl cross-couplings into more of a mechanism-based field so that that new, rationally-designed catalysts can be performed under energy efficient conditions. Our specific objectives for the previous year were 1) to obtain a proper electronic description of an active catalyst for alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions and 2) {{to determine the effect}} of ligand structure on the rate, scope, selectivity, and functional group compatibility of C(sp 3) -C(sp 3) cross-coupling catalysis. We have completed both of these initial objectives and established a firm base for further studies. The specific significant achievements of the current grant period include: 1) we have performed magnetic and computational studies on (terpyridine) NiMe, an active catalyst for alkyl-alkyl cross couplings, and have discovered that the unpaired electron resides heavily on the terpyridine ligand and that the proper electronic description of this nickel complex is a Ni(II) -methyl cation bound to a reduced terpyridine ligand; 2) we have for the first time shown that alkyl halide reduction by terpyridyl nickel catalysts is substantially ligand based; 3) we have shown by isotopic labeling studies that the active catalyst (terpyridine) NiMe is not produced via a mechanism that involves the formation of methyl radicals when (TMEDA) NiMe 2 is used as the catalyst precursor; 4) we have performed an extensive ligand survey for the alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions and have found that electronic factors only moderately influence reactivity in the terpyridine-based catalysis and that the most dramatic effects arise from steric and solubility factors; 5) we have found that the use of bis(dialkylphosphino) methanes as ligands for nickel does not produce active catalysts for cross-coupling but rather <b>leads</b> to bridging <b>hydride</b> complexes of varying geometries; 6) we have determined that the geometry of aforementioned bridging hydride complexes is largely determined by external forces such as hydrogen bonding interactions and crystal packing forces; 7) we have found that the rate of reductive elimination of alkane from a (pyridyl- 2 -pyrrolide) AuMe 2 complex is severely inhibited due to the rigid geometry of the pyridyl- 2 -pyrrolide ligand; 8) we have prepared, structurally characterized, and explored the reactivity of 1 -adamantylzinc reagents as model nucleophiles for sterically challenging alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions. The continued success of this work will lead to alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling catalysts with broad scope and selectivities. The work has potential to significantly impact science and technologies of interest to the DOE as the chemistry is focused on developing useful reactions using reagents that can be directly prepared from petroleum and natural gas feedstocks. Moreover, the developing synthetic chemistry can profoundly affect the way materials, fine chemicals, and drugs are made. Since the methodology we are developing can shorten existing synthetic protocols, proceed at room temperature, and operate under environmentally benign conditions, it can greatly reduce energy expenditures, especially considering the contribution of the chemical manufacturing field to the gross domestic product...|$|R
