500|$|Music critic Keith Harris of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Janet Jackson has {{abandoned}} the plastic R of 2006's 20 Y.O. for a sexier brand of digitized megapop [...] you can dismiss any {{images of the}} abusive Jackson clan that flit into your mind. Just <b>lie</b> <b>back</b> and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on Discipline, and while {{none of it is}} exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list for a little while longer." ...|$|E
500|$|Stepping {{back into}} the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly [...] "what the fuck is going on?" [...] He motions to her to join him {{on the bed and}} at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing {{conversation}} that he has been living in the hotel room for [...] "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They <b>lie</b> <b>back</b> on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he [...] "will never be [...] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" [...] starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.|$|E
500|$|Street Fighter X Mega Man {{mimics the}} {{appearance}} and gameplay style of Mega Man games released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. [...] The game's premise and plot center around {{its status as}} a crossover video game and the respective anniversaries of both franchises. [...] Having fought countless Robot Masters over the years, Mega Man is ready to <b>lie</b> <b>back,</b> relax and enjoy his 25th anniversary. Getting wind of this, Ryu and his fellow Street Fighters want one last battle before they let their own anniversary finish. [...] In terms of gameplay, Mega Man uses the same set of moves (the slide and the charge shot) featured in Mega Man 4. [...] Instead of using stages based on Mega Man and using Robot Masters as level bosses, the stages share influences from the Street Fighter franchise stages and characters such as Blanka, Chun-Li, and Ryu take the place of the Robot Masters as the end of level bosses. [...] The Street Fighter characters use their signature moves as attacks; in addition, they have their own Super Meters that build up when they take damage during the boss fights and allow them to launch a powerful attack at Mega Man once filled. [...] Like other Mega Man games, defeating each boss earns Mega Man a new weapon based on the characters' attacks, such as Ryu's Hadouken and Chun-Li's Hyakuretsu Kyaku. After clearing the eight main levels, the player then moves on to face the final set of bosses. Clearing certain conditions allows players to fight hidden bosses Sagat and Akuma {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of many observers, Ali became a {{different}} fighter after the 3½-year layoff. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's corner physician, noted {{that he had lost}} his ability to move and dance as before. This forced Ali to become more stationary and exchange punches more frequently, exposing him to more punishment while indirectly revealing his tremendous ability to take a punch. This physical change led in part to the [...] "rope-a-dope" [...] strategy, where Ali would <b>lie</b> <b>back</b> on the ropes, cover up to protect himself and conserve energy, and tempt opponents to punch themselves out. Ali often taunted opponents in the process and lashed back with sudden, unexpected combinations. The strategy was dramatically successful in the George Foreman fight, but less so in the first Joe Frazier bout when it was introduced.|$|E
