25|$|In the {{following}} two years the pitches at The Oval were exceedingly fiery and gave Lockwood a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>help.</b> In 1892, he was regarded as the most difficult bowler {{of the year and}} took a career-high 151 wickets. The following year, he proved his class as a bowler with 9 for 126 for Lord Sheffield's XI against the Australians in May, and 8 for 33 against Cambridge University to give Surrey a surprise win. After taking twenty-one wickets in two games on firm pitches against Yorkshire and Sussex, Lockwood played his first Test at Lord's and took an impressive six for 101. He followed this up with eight for 133 in two innings of the second Test, but injury ruled him out of the last.|$|E
25|$|Seam bowlers {{can get a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> {{from certain}} types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the {{hardness}} {{makes it easier to}} bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as variable bounce. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. Green pitches can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a flat track in cricket vernacular) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.|$|E

Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient."

500|$|Michigan {{started the}} 1975 season ranked #3 in the country, {{and moved into}} the [...] #2 spot with a 23–6 win over Wisconsin in the season opener. [...] Despite being {{hampered}} by a muscle pull, Bell still rushed for 210yards in 28carries against Wisconsin. [...] After the game, Bell noted that he [...] "couldn't cut as well as (he) would have liked," [...] but he played through the injury realizing that, as a senior, [...] "the coaches expect us to show the way." [...] On being named the UPI's Midwest Back of the Week, Bell noted, [...] "It's really {{an honor to be}} recognized like that, {{but you have to have}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> out there. [...] I thought Rick Leach was just super in the game. [...] He sure didn't look like a freshman. [...] And our offensive line did the job despite having so many sophomores in there." [...] Bell's 210-yard performance against Wisconsin stood as the school record in a season opener for 28years until Chris Perry rushed for 232 yards in the 2003 season opener against Central Michigan.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E
