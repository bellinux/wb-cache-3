Lindsay cries more, breaks through a window with her heel and shatters a lamp on the ground. Yes, Lindsay, yes. We <b>love</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> you're angry." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{it was by}} the {{sea that}} I lived, {{in a town that}} was unlovely enough were it not for its glorious neighbour. And who cares for the town when one can sit on the bench at the headland, and look out over the huge, blue bay, and the yellow scimitar that curves before <b>it.</b> I <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> its great face was {{freckled}} with the fishing boats, and I <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> the big ships went past, far out, a little hillock of white and no hull, with topsails curved like a bodice, so stately and demure. But most of all I <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> no trace of man marred the majesty of Nature, and when the sun-bursts slanted down on it from between the drifting rainclouds. Then I have seen the further edge draped in the gauze of the driving rain, with its thin grey shading under the slow clouds, while my headland was golden, and the sun gleamed upon the breakers and struck deep through the green waves beyond, showing up the purple patches where the beds of seaweed are lying. Such a morning as that, with the wind in his hair, and the spray on his lips, and the cry of the eddying gulls in his ear, may send a man back braced afresh to the reek of a sick-room, and the dead, drab weariness of practice.|$|R

[...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." [...] Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the [...] "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9p.m. watershed.|$|E

500|$|On 11 October 2016, Buffon {{became the}} first goalkeeper ever to win the Golden Foot Award. Buffon had {{initially}} suffered criticism in the media {{at the beginning of}} the 2016–17 season over a high-profile error against Spain in a World Cup qualifier with Italy, followed by another mistake with Juventus against Udinese in Serie A; although certain analysts questioned his longevity, on 18 October, Buffon drew praise from pundits for his performance in his club's third fixture of the 2016–17 Champions League group stage, as he helped a ten-man Juventus to a 1–0 away win over Lyon. During the match, he saved Alexandre Lacazette's penalty in the 35th minute (his first penalty save in the Champions League since 2003), and later also made a decisive stop on Nabil Fekir's deflected shot early into the second half, while he used his legs to deny Corentin Tolisso's point-blank header in the 71st minute. The victory meant that Juventus had managed to earn their first ever away victory against a French side in the Champions League, while Buffon sealed his third consecutive clean sheet of the season in the competition, and the 42nd Champions League clean sheet of his career. Following the match, Buffon commented [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they celebrate your funeral, and then you show them that you're still alive." [...] Following his performances throughout the calendar year, Buffon was included in the 30-man shortlist for the 2016 Ballon d'Or; he placed ninth alongside Pepe in the final ranking. In Juventus' fourth Champions League group match of the season on 2 November, a 1–1 home draw against Lyon, Buffon made his 100th Champions League appearance (excluding appearances in qualifying rounds), becoming the 29th player to reach this landmark. On 4 November, he was included in the 23-player shortlist for The 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 6 November, Buffon earned his 600th Serie A appearance in a 2–1 away win against Chievo, the fourth player to reach this milestone. His performances saw him earn the Juventus Player of the Month Award for October 2016. On 21 November, Buffon was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for the ninth time his career, making him goalkeeper with the most nominations ever, alongside Iker Casillas. On 1 December, Buffon was nominated for the 2016 FIFPro World XI, making him the only player, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, to have been included in the shortlist every year since its inception in 2005. On 23 December, Buffon made his 600th competitive appearance for Juventus in the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana; following a 1–1 draw after extra time, Juventus lost 4–3 to Milan in a penalty shoot-out, although Buffon saved Gianluca Lapadula's initial spot kick. Buffon capped off the year by placing second in the 2016 IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper Award, finishing behind Neuer once again.|$|E

Some of the show's catchphrases, such as [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> a plan comes together", [...] "Hannibal's on the jazz", and [...] "I ain't gettin' on no plane!" [...] have also made their way onto T-shirts and other merchandise.|$|E

[...] The show ran five seasons on NBC from 1983 to 1987. It made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. It has been reported that the role was originally written with James Coburn in mind, but Coburn declined and thus it went to Peppard. Peppard was reportedly annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship refused to speak directly to Mr. T. [...] Instead, he sent messages through intermediaries (including at times fellow cast members, particularly Dirk Benedict) and for this Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player.|$|E
