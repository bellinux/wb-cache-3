5|$|In 1960 Howard and Outram {{launched}} the Gauntlet Press, a small private press which produced hand-bound <b>letterpress</b> volumes of Outram's poetry and Howard's wood engravings. These limited editions, prized by collectors, {{can also be}} found in such public collections as Library and Archives Canada, the Library of Congress, the British Library and the University of Toronto Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the Gauntlet Press also issued a series of <b>letterpress</b> broadsheets of Outram's poems, all of them designed (and many illustrated) by Howard. Digital facsimiles of the books and broadsheets of the Gauntlet Press {{in the collection of the}} Memorial University of Newfoundland can be viewed at the website dedicated to The Gauntlet Press of Richard Outram and Barbara Howard, together with extensive background material and an exhaustive bibliography.|$|E

5|$|Minneapolis is the third-most literate {{city in the}} U.S. A {{center for}} {{printing}} and publishing, Minneapolis was the city in which Open Book, the largest literary and book arts center in the U.S., was founded. The Center consists of the Loft Literary Center, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts and Milkweed Editions (the latter is sometimes called the country's largest independent nonprofit literary publisher).

5|$|Publisher Kaspar Braun, who {{commissioned}} Busch's first illustrations, {{had established}} the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving. This <b>letterpress</b> printing technique {{was developed by}} English graphic artist Thomas Bewick {{near the end of}} the 18th century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years. Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterwards writing the verse. Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement and physiognomy studies.|$|E
5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in <b>letterpress</b> printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E
5|$|The serious {{collection}} and publication of Washington's documentary record {{began with the}} pioneer work of Jared Sparks in the 1830s in Life and Writings of George Washington (12 vols., 1834–1837). The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 (1931–44) is a 37 volume set edited by John C. Fitzpatrick. It contains over 17,000 letters and documents and is available online from the University of Virginia. The definitive <b>letterpress</b> edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968, and today comprises 52 published volumes, with more to come. It contains everything written by Washington or signed by him, together with most of his incoming letters. Part of the collection is available online from the University of Virginia.|$|E

25|$|<b>Letterpress</b> {{printing}} was {{the normal}} form of printing text from its invention by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century and remained in wide use for books and other uses {{until the second}} half of the 20th century, when offset printing was developed. More recently, <b>letterpress</b> printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.|$|E

This is the first limited edition to use a ruling other than standard graph, opting instead for a [...] "dot-graph pattern". Packs also included a [...] "Fire Spotter" [...] temporary tattoo. Fire Spotter also lead to the creation of [...] "Red Blooded", a regularly available edition released in early 2012. The major differences between [...] "Fire Spotter" [...] and [...] "Red Blooded" [...] were ruling (Fire Spotter featuring dot graph, and Red Blooded featuring standard graph), and the lack of the [...] "Fire Spotter" [...] logo {{on the back of}} the Red Blooded edition books.|$|R
25|$|<b>Letterpress</b> {{printing}} is {{a technique}} of relief printing. A worker composes and locks movable type into the bed of a press, inks it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.|$|E
25|$|Hersey also pursued {{an unusual}} sideline: he {{operated}} the college's small <b>letterpress</b> printing operation, which he sometimes used to publish broadsides– during 1969 printing an elaborate broadside of an Edmund Burke quote for Yale history professor and fellow residential college master Elting E. Morison.|$|E

50|$|Publishing {{poetry and}} short fiction with a {{secondary}} interest in bilingual or multilingual translation, rufus books produced limited editions in both chapbook and full-length formats {{with an emphasis}} on traditional production values and methods combined with modern techniques (<b>letterpressed,</b> offset, hand-sewn, or smyth-sewn and perfect bound) and featuring artistic collaborations. Audio recordings of writers reading from their own works were also introduced.|$|R
50|$|Prints, {{which are}} created by using a press and metal plate system, made {{possible}} the production of multiple copies of the same image. In the late 18th century America, the local silversmith with a talent for engraving on metal often worked with the town printer to produce printed pictures for the general public. <b>Letterpresses</b> and printing procedures are demonstrated in the Museum’s Print Shop.|$|R
25|$|By 1970, as offset {{printing}} began to replace <b>letterpress</b> printing, the Composer would be adapted as the output unit for a typesetting system. The system included a computer-driven input station {{to capture the}} key strokes on magnetic tape and insert the operator's format commands, and a Composer unit to read the tape and produce the formatted text for photo reproduction.|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s {{printing}} plants often incorporated electrotyping and stereotyping departments, and electrotyping and stereotyping {{had become}} trades with associated apprenticeships. In the United Kingdom, the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, electrotypers had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union. In 1978, an Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that 2000 electrotypers and stereotypers were employed in the US. However, job prospects were reported as poor. Offset printing has supplanted <b>letterpress</b> printing in most printing plants; the last <b>letterpress</b> facility for a newspaper was installed in the 1980s. For offset printing, the printing plates are typically prepared by coating them with light-sensitive materials, and creating {{the image on the}} plate by direct optical exposure (the photo-offset process); stereotyping and electrotyping are not used.|$|E
25|$|As a {{printing}} technology, lithography {{is different from}} intaglio printing (gravure), wherein a plate is either engraved, etched, or stippled to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and woodblock printing or <b>letterpress</b> printing, wherein ink {{is applied to the}} raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with offset lithography, which has become {{the most common form of}} printing technology since the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|It {{would have}} been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with {{footnotes}} and references. In some chapters {{there is not a}} sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the <b>letterpress</b> {{would have been}} swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography {{at the end of the}} volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.|$|E
25|$|The presses {{first used}} {{were of the}} {{ordinary}} <b>letterpress</b> type, the engraved plate being fixed {{in the place of}} the type. In later improvements the well-known cylinder press was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a sharp blade of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid on the plate, was passed round the pressure cylinder. The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.|$|E
25|$|During the 1850s, {{the cost}} of the Transactions to the Society was {{increasing}} again (and would keep doing so {{for the rest of the}} century); illustrations were always the largest outgoing. Illustrations had been a natural and essential aspect of the scientific periodical since the later seventeenth century. Engravings (cut into metal plates) were used for detailed illustrations, particularly where realism was required; while wood-cuts (and, from the early nineteenth century, wood-engravings) were used for diagrams, as they could be easily combined with <b>letterpress.</b>|$|E

50|$|The museum print shop {{houses a}} {{significant}} collection of printing presses and allied equipment. The plant mainly consists of <b>letterpresses</b> and several small offset presses. The most impressive machine is an 1863 Wharfdale flat bed tumble cylinder press requiring two operators. Manufactured by W. Dawson and Sons of Otley, England, this newspaper press {{was first used}} in Invercargill about 1863 to print the Southland Times. It was moved to Waimate in 1914 to print the Daily Advertiser. It came to the museum in 1972, where it is still operational and occasionally demonstrated.|$|R

Jon Stone of the American Songwriter reacted positively to the second EP, The Solstice Bare, stating that [...] "The songs are not mind blowing, but for once, Billy doesn't seem like he is trying to prove his relevance to both old and new fans on every track. Respect is given to the song, rather than just the hook—quite an accomplishment from one of the most prolific and talented of hook writers." ...|$|R
