40|$|Increasingly erratic {{rainfall}} and unreliable cropping seasons in southern Africa, combined with high food prices, heighten vulnerability of rural people to food insecurity. To understand what actions {{are needed to}} expand adaptive capacity to climate change and its consequences for food security, {{it is useful to}} learn from existing agricultural practices in semi-arid areas that exploit positive opportunities of rainfall variability. To determine how residents attain food self-sufficiency based on rain-fed maize farming in a semi-arid region that receives an average annual precipitation of 400 mm, we carried out a detailed, interdisciplinary study of the agricultural system in Massingir, Mozambique from 2006 to 2010. We found that some people produced enough maize when rainfall conditions were favorable to sustain the staple food needs of a household for 2 â€“ 3 years, buffering the negative effects of subsequent poor cropping seasons and avoiding seasonal hunger periods. To maximize production people employed a variety of practices including: planting after every rainfall event throughout the rainy season, up to six times in one season on as large an area as possible, as much as 18 ha per household, and employing labor/oxen exchange arrangements. We explored the role of these practices as key factors that determined total food production and variability among households. Although only 35 % of planting events were successful, total seed sown represented only 8. 5 % of harvest over 15 years. Labor/oxen exchange arrangements allowed disadvantaged households to produce twice as much as without collaboration. Recent invasion of the <b>large</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (Prostephanus truncatus), a devastating post-harvest storage insect pest, represents a major new threat to the sustainability of the agricultural system and to food security that could worsen with climate change.

40|$|The <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (Prostephanus truncatus) {{has been}} known for many years as a pest of farm-stored maize in Central America, but since the late 1970 s it has spread widely in Africa. In 1981 it was {{identified}} as a new pest causing severe losses to farm-stored maize in the hot, dry Tabora region of Tanzania. It subsequently spread widely within Tanzania and into Southern Kenya, Burundi and recently Malawi. In West Africa, a serious outbreak of the pest was found in 1984 in Togo, and more recently it has been identified in Ghana, Benin, Guinea Conakry, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. It is believed that the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has the potential to spread to all the major maize-producing regions in Africa. The <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> is also a major pest of dried cassava. Losses as high as 30 % have been recorded in some cases. Additionally, adults bore into a wide range of foodstuffs and other materials, such as wood. In heavy infestations, wooden storage structures may become damaged and act as reservoirs of infestation from which the new harvest may be attacked. Neither is the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> restricted to stores: it occurs widely in the natural environment and is dispersed by flight. A leaflet on the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has been produced by the Group for Assistance on Systems Relating to Grain After Harvest (GASGA) and the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and published by CTA. It covers recognition, distribution, life history, damage, control in storage, monitoring and sensible precautions - all succinctly covered in just a few pages. The aim of the leaflet is to create awareness and to provide guidance to extension workers and other professionals concerned with the identification and control of this pest.

However, they did discover two predators in Costa Rica, Teretriosoma nigrescens and a species of Calliodis, which were not found in Africa. Tests with Calliodis showed that although it reduced borer population eventually, it was ineffective until populations were high and damage to the grain had already been done. T. nigrescens on the other hand showed that it was well adapted to its host, its population keeping in step wit-in that of the borer. The beetle can also survive for some time without food, should the borer population be reduced, and will not attack other insects such as bees or silkworms. T. nigrescens is attracted by pheromones given off by the borer. Trials are continuing but it is hoped that they can soon be completed by the release of the predatory beetles in Togo.

40|$|The {{selection}} of grain-hosts by the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> Prostephanus truncatus {{was investigated in}} environments containing both uninfested maize grains and grains previously infested by the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais. The grain-host selection preference of P. truncatus {{was reflected in the}} number of adults in each type of grain and the number of damaged grains. Results showed that P. truncatus individuals were significantly more attracted to uninfested grains than to infested grains. Several densities (according to egg density) of S. zeamais infested maize grains mixed together with uninfested grains were exposed to P. truncatus. The <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> damaged significantly more uninfested grains relative to infested ones. Infested grains seemed to have a deterrent effect on the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer.</b> We hypothesised that this behaviour was due to larval activity and to deterrent substances deposited on maize by adults of the maize weevil. To verify the first hypothesis, adults of P. truncatus were placed with uninfested grains and infested grains bearing immature stages of S. zeamais. Results showed that the infested grains were preferentially damaged during the first two weeks, while three and four weeks after infestation with S. zeamais the uninfested grains were more damaged by P. truncatus. These observations indicated a close relationship between the development of S. zeamais larvae inside maize grains and the {{selection of}} grain-host by 19 truncatus. To test the second hypothesis, adults of P. truncatus were placed together with uninfested maize grains, and with infested grains that had been cleaned of substances deposited by S. zeamais using different organic solvents (n-hexane, ether-diethylene and methanol). Results showed that the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> damaged indiscriminately both infested and uninfested grains. Therefore, the deterrent effect of S. zeamais against P. truncatus was also associated with the existence of substances deposited on the grain surface by adult weevilsPeer reviewe...|$|R

One hundred and twenty (120) inbred lines were evaluated in the field for adaptation and tested in the laboratory for resistance to the LGB and weevil. Insect-damage parameters namely grain damage, weight loss, flour weight and number of insects, were measured. Heritability, genotypic and phenotypic variances for the damage traits were determined. Genotype stability for insect pest resistance was determined based on genotypic variance and coefficient of variation (CVi) for each genotype. There were significant differences (P< 0. 001) among the lines for all the traits measured.

40|$|It may be {{that only}} the sea at the Cape of Good Hope can halt the inexorable advance of the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (LGB), Prostephanus truncatus, in {{southern}} Africa. Even that might not help, since it arrived from the Americas by boat, in a food relief shipment to Tanzania in the late 1970 s. The dark coloured beetles, around 4 mm long, are extremely damaging to dried maize stored on the cob. Losses can reach more than 30 % {{after six months of}} storage. Since its arrival, the borer has spread relentlessly throughout sub-Saharan Africa. It was reported to have entered South Africa and Namibia in 1999. Chemical insecticides, such as Actellic Super Dust, are effective in controlling LGB. Alternative storage techniques and hygienic measures around the storage sites are also important. According to Peter Golob of the Natural Resources Institute, United Kingdom, the key to good non-chemical control may be a predator of LGB discovered in Central America, the beetle Teretrius nigrescens (TN). After successful laboratory trials, TN was released in Ghana, Kenya, Togo, Uganda and Zambia where it established itself widely. Unfortunately, it will never be adequate to contain LGB, which breeds more quickly than TN and can multiply rapidly, even when TN is present. Various measures therefore need to be combined to control the pest. To know more: Peter Golob Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich Kent ME 4 4 TB, UK Fax: + 44 1634 883 567 Email: P.

40|$|The <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> a beetle pest {{introduced}} accidentally into Africa, is relentlesly spreading through maize growing areas where, if unchecked, it can decimate {{stocks of}} stored maize and dried cassava. Until 1981 the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (LGB), Prostephanus truncatus, {{was known as}} a pest of stored maize and dried cassava only in Central America. However in that year the beetle was confirmed as being responsible for the destruction of these crops stored on farms in central Tanzania. Following its accidental introduction into Tanzania, LGB has become firmly established on farms throughout most maize growing regions of the country, where it is now the major storage pest. Losses can be total The beetle is extremely destructive. It exhibits a preference for maize on the cob and dried cassava and, by its continual boring through the food, it reduces them to dust. LGB is also capable of damaging stored wheat, sorghum, sweet potato and groundnuts, and it will even tunnel into wooden utensils and storage structures. Maize grains and dried cassava are often so heavily damaged as to be rendered totally unfit for human consumption. The levels of loss can be exceptionally high; weight losses of 34 % have been recorded in cob maize in a crib after 3 - 6 months of storage and up to 70 % of dried cassava was considered lost after only 4 months' farm storage. Although the beetle is quite capable of flying between individual farm stores, much of its spread has been assisted by the movement of infested maize, dried cassava and perhaps used grain bags in local, regional and international trade. Infestation can be carried to uninfested areas via maize and cassava bought at rural and urban markets. The distance travelled may extend to many hundreds of kilometres along major bus and lorry routes. LGB may be spread from one country to another by similar means: pests do not respect national borders. In some areas there is much local movement of small amounts of grain across borders as head-loads, and passengers travelling on long distance buses and lorries frequently carry small quantities of maize and cassava for gifts or personal consumption. On a larger scale there are commercial export shipments of food, feed or seed maize and, to a lesser extent, dried cassava and other grains. Through various routes LGB has spread over much of Tanzania and across the borders with neighbouring countries to become established in Burundi and parts of Kenya. In 1984, as a consequence of a second accidental introduction, this time into West Africa, LGB became established in Togo. From there it has spread to neighbouring Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso. Very recently the beetle has also been found in Guinea Conakry. It is now recognized that Prostephanus has the potential to spread to all the major maize-producing regions of Africa. There is now increasing evidence that it may survive outside the storage environment. Containment and control A package of recommendations for maize has been devised which involves shelling dried cob maize as soon as possible after harvest and mixing a suitable insecticide powder with the shelled maize before storage. Following intensive extension campaigns, farmers are now able to combat the pest and to contain the losses. The success of the control programme is dependent upon providing a timely supply of the insecticide and ensuring its correct application. A supplementary approach to control, without employing insecticide, is currently under investigation. This involves the use of another beetle, Teretriosoma niqrescens, which in Central America is a natural predator on Prostephanus. Teretriosoma does not yet occur in Africa but it is hoped that, following the very recent release of the beetle there, the ravages of Prostephanus maybe checked through biological control (see pages 13, 15). International implications To date, the elimination of LGB from infested areas has not proved possible, despite sustained control programmes. One consequence of this problem is the difficulty of trading grain from countries in surplus, where LGB is a recognized pest, to countries not known to have the pest. LGB-infested countries with surplus grain stocks find that they are unable to secure commercial markets for their maize because prospective buyers fear the risk of introducing the beetle. In addition, international organizations involved in financing and distributing 'triangular' food aid in the African region are naturally concerned not to contribute to the risks. A major study of the implications of LGB in ten countries in Eastern and Southern Africa was recently sponsored by the European Commission. A strategy has been proposed which would have two major objectives: firstly, to prevent the distribution of LGB in long-distance commodity movements and secondly to encourage governments, exporters and food aid donors to adopt stricter specifications for the purchase and movement of potentially infested grain. For those countries where LGB is already established, the study makes technical proposals to ensure that exported maize is free from live LGB {{in order to be able}} to reassure potential buyers.

Delayed mortality was further increased with the increase of dose and the initial exposure, but knockdown was extremely low, with the exception of P. truncatus. The results of the present work show that O. surinamensis was the least susceptible species, while P. truncatus was the most susceptible. These findings show that, despite the increased mortality, recovery after short exposures is likely for all species tested here. In this regard, partially treated areas on which the insects are exposed only for short intervals may reduce thiamethoxam efficacy...|$|R

As time and money for such work are generally scarce, {{it is important to}} be able to make the best use of them to get the information needed. This paper describes some of the specific techniques and experience developed by the Ghana MoFA/UK ODA <b>Larger</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>Borer</b> Project for rapid storage surveys on small-scale farms. It is argued that the following factors can critically contribute to producing more timely and relevant results: â€¢	formulation of specific survey objectives which focus on gathering data needed for decision-making. â€¢	use of a range of techniques to meet these objectives, including secondary data and key informants, informal surveys, case studies and participatory meetings. â€¢	avoidance of unwitting sampling bias, using rapid techniques such as transect village walks to select farmers, along with careful timing of field visits. â€¢	methods of sample analysis which can be used in the field, rather than the lab. Field analysis has many benefits including cost, speed, potential for increased sampling, and most importantly the greater participation of farmers and field staff in the analysis and interpretation of results. â€¢	use of rapid and flexible techniques of analysis and presentation, in particular mapping.

The dose rates used were 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 ppm. The bioassays were carried out at three temperatures, 20, 25 and 30 Â°C and two relative humidity levels, 55 and 75 %. Mortality of R. dominica and S. oryzae was high even at 0. 01 ppm of spinosad, reaching 100 % at 55 % relative humidity and 30 Â° after 21 days of exposure. Generally, mortality of R. dominica, increased with temperature while for S. oryzae mortality increased with temperature and with the decrease of relative humidity. Moreover, for S. oryzae, mortality was low at 20 Â°C. In the case of T. confusum, mortality was low at doses between 0. 01 and 0. 5 ppm even after 21 days of exposure. At 1 ppm, mortality exceeded 90 % only at 30 Â°C and only after 21 days of exposure. Mortality of P. truncatus was low on maize treated with 0. 01 ppm, but increasing the dose to 0. 1 ppm resulted in > 87 % mortality after 14 days of exposure.

50|$|Its roots can {{be ground}} into a fine powder {{which is used}} to protect stored grains. Methyl {{salicylate}} is a well-known plant stress signal which often has insect repellent properties. Methyl salicylate constitutes up to 90% of the volatile component of its roots, which is very uncommon in other grains or legume seeds. A mixture of methanol extract and methyl salicylate creates a very effective natural pesticide against weevils and other insects in stored grains. Studies done on grains such as corn and cowpea indicated that after 6 days of exposure to S. longipedunculata, the mortality rate of adult beetles was 100% in an enclosed jar. In addition, when S. longipedunculata powder was applied to grains already infested with weevils, the damage done to the grains was reduced by 65%. The beetles that are most likely to infest stored grains are Sitophilus zeamais (Maize weevil), Rhyzopertha dominica (Lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer),</b> and Prostephanus truncatus (<b>Larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer).</b> Studies suggest that the Maize weevil is able to detect the scent of methyl salicylate and tends to avoid it. It is a repellent for insects as well as a poison, which helps {{to reduce the number of}} female eggs in the grains. As this type of pesticide use is very efficient, it allows storage of the grains for at least 9 months. This discovery provides some small-scale farmers in Africa with a low cost, natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. In some developing countries, it is difficult for poor farmers to access good quality and affordable synthetic pesticides. In addition these can harm the environment if they are not properly implemented. Such indigenous practices require further validation.|$|R

Leaf samples were harvested from 10 healthy plants per genotype and bulked. Genomic DNA was extracted using {{a modified version of}} mini-prep Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) method. The samples were genotyped with 55 SSRs makers. Univariate analysis of variance was done using the general linear model procedure of SAS statistical package. Rodgers genetic distance was calculated for all data sets as a measure of genetic distance using NTSYS-pc for Windows. The distance matrices were used to generate phenograms using the unweighted pair group method based on arithmetic average (UPGMA) method in MEGA 5. The genotypes were assigned into different populations using population structure software. The data was further subjected to discriminant and principal component analysis to group the gnotyoes. Analysis of molecular variance within and among the different populations was done using arlequin. There were significant differences (P â‰¤ 0. 001) for all the biophysical traits evaluated. The SSR marker data estimated successfully the close relationship among different hybrids and inbred lines within clusters.

In spite of containment efforts {{and the introduction of}} the predator Teretrius nigrescens Lewis from Mexico, LGB has spread to the main maize production zone in western Kenya during the past five years. The present work presents results from a 28 -month monitoring effort of LGB and its predator, using pheromone traps at five locations along an east-west transect across Kenya. LGB occurred in all regions with highest trap catches in the high potential maize production zones in Western Kenya. T. nigrescens had not spread to western Kenya and trap catches were very low and mostly zero in Eastern Kenya, even in the area where it was released during the 1990 s, suggesting that it became locally extinct after initial establishment. LGB flight activity was closely related to relative humidity, temperature and vapour pressure deficit. A model based on climatic factors accurately predicted seasonal trends of LGB flight behaviour in Kakamega and Mombasa but not in Kitale and Thika. It was concluded that models that rely on the direct effect of climate cannot predict LGB flight accurately enough to allow assessment of the impact of T. nigrescens on a regional basis.

The efficacy of spinetoram against numerous insect pest species {{in a variety of}} field crops has been well demonstrated. However, there are no data available for the effectiveness of spinetoram against stored grain insects. In the present study, we evaluated spinetoram as a grain protectant, against six stored-product Coleoptera. The species tested were: the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae, the lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> Rhyzopertha dominica, the <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> Prostephanus truncatus, the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum, the granary weevil, Sitophilus granarius and the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis. All species were tested at the adult stage, on wheat (or maize in the case of P truncatus) treated to achieve spinetoram concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 ppm. Mortality was recorded after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure, and 65 d later the wheat and maize were examined for offspring emergence. Among the species examined, P. truncatus and R. dominica were by far the most susceptible, given that mortality was close to 100 % after 7 d on wheat treated or maize with 0. 1 ppm of spinetoram. At this concentration, progeny production of P. truncatus and R. dominica was negligible. On the other hand, T confusum was the least susceptible; mortality reached 95 % only at 10 ppm, and only after 14 d of exposure. Similarly, O. surinamensis was of limited susceptibility to spinetoram; mortality reached 95 % only after 14 d of exposure on wheat treated with 5 ppm. Nevertheless, offspring emergence of these species was extremely low. For S. granarius and S. oryzae, complete (100 %) mortality was recorded after 14 d of exposure, at 0. 5 and 1 ppm, respectively. At these concentrations or higher, progeny production was notably reduced. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrate that spinetoram is effective as a grain protectant, but its efficacy varies according to the target species, concentration and exposure interval.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for the rapid assessment of losses in stored maize cobs and dried cassava chips (cossettes) : {{the use of}} visual damage scales. The scales can be calibrated against conventional weight loss assessment techniques to permit the estimation of percentage weight losses in stores. The scales were first developed for a survey of <b>Larger</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>Borer</b> beetle (Prostephanus truncatus (Horn)) damage in farm stores in central Togo. They were constructed by sorting infested maize and cassava by eye into different damage classes(four classes for maize cobs and five for cassava chips). In the survey, each sampled cob or chip was scored for damage on the appropriate visual scale, using reference photos to ensure consistency. Advantages of the method include: it is quick and easy to use, {{increasing the number of}} stores which can be sampled; data loss or fabrication is reduced; anomalous results can be checked on the spot; and it increases farmer participation in the survey work. Methods of data analysis are discussed in detail. The raw (ranked) data can be analysed by chi-square tests, rank correlation and ordinal logistic regression. Alternatively, if the scales are used to estimate weight losses, this permits the use of more powerful techniques such as analysis of variance. The scales have potential for many types of survey work, especially rapid appraisal. {{one of the most interesting}} applications could be to estimate parameters such as loss in market value and loss of final food product (rather than whole grain), but more work is needed to devise appropriate ways of calibrating the scales for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) is a {{destructive}} pest of stored maize and cassava that {{has recently been}} accidentally introduced into tropical Africa. Males produce an aggregation pheromone when on food, that attracts dispersing males and females. P. truncatus aggregation pheromone {{is being used to}} monitor the spread of P. truncatus (<b>Larger</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>Borer)</b> across Africa. The biological function of this pheromone is controversial. This thesis investigates the role of aggregation pheromone in mate choice in P. truncatus.;The literature on Coleopteran aggregation pheromones was reviewed, with particular reference to the possible adaptive functions of aggregation pheromones.;Variation in Prostephanus truncatus aggregation-pheromone signalling was detected. Conspecifics can detect these differences and are preferentially attracted to some males more than others. Both males and females 'agree' which males are most attractive (shown in a laboratory bioassay and in trapping experiments in the field). Females also discriminate between potential mates on contact by a stylised pushing behaviour. Some males consistently secure more matings than others when two males are presented at once to a female. Discrimination between males mediated on contact through pushing is not influenced by the male's aggregation pheromone signal (both natural variation and manipulation of the pheromone signal were studied).;Observation of adult beetles in an artificial host sandwiched between two glass plates revealed that males and females pair up, and cohabit within the same tunnel system. Pairs mate multiply (up to 20 times per 12 hours) and dissection of recently mated females revealed that males deliver an oversized ejaculate (approx. 50 000 sperm) as an oval spermatophore. Male investment in ejaculate was not found to be influenced by male crowding or the presence of Female Factor (an involatile pheromone produced by females, which can trigger aggregation pheromone shut down in males) ...|$|R
40|$|Improvements to maize cob storage {{on farms}} in the Volta Region of Ghana were {{investigated}} {{with a view to}} limiting the damage and losses associated with the <b>Larger</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>Borer</b> (Prostephanus truncatus) and weevils (Sitophilus spp). The study was initiated by a survey of those technologies adopted following an earlier project to help farmers protect maize against P. truncatus. The study included farmersâ€™ perceptions of their own storage problems and was designed to provide background information on how farmers might benefit from a novel technique of applying pesticide to only the basal layers of cobs on the platform. Field trials, comparing losses in experimental maize platforms showed that treatment of only the bottom 20 % of maize cobs, with Actellic Super (permethrin and pirimiphosmethyl) in dust or emulsion formulation, could give protection that was significantly better than no treatment and not significantly different from full treatment. When combined with placing a plastic sheet over the platform there was a significant reduction in losses while the presence of preharvest infestation resulted in somewhat higher losses. Farmer participatory trials demonstrated that farmers could implement the technique successfully by themselves and subsequent analysis showed that a range of major stakeholders perceived benefits from the method and reaffirmed it as a practical approach. The cost effectiveness of the method was investigated based on assumptions about maize losses and prices. This analysis suggested that targeted treatment is likely to be cost-effective under a wide range of circumstances. However, it was concluded that the safest option for farmers would be to use targeted treatment for those platforms that would be consumed {{during the course of the}} year and use full treatment for platforms destined for long-term storage (> 6 months). It is suggested that such an approach would widen farmer access to stock protection and improve food security and livelihoods. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of storage losses, {{especially}} insect damage, on storage behavior and market prices. Although we treat these research questions in two separated essays, they are both embedded in the farmers 2 Ì† 7 decision of grain storage. Farmers store grain either for consumption, sale or both. We address the research questions with cross -sectional data from a survey of 360 rural households in Benin. ^ In the essay 1, we use an econometric model of storage to analyze how a household with access to storage technologies makes his or her storage decision {{in the presence of}} high insect damage and price variability. We find that storage technologies may have differential effects on a household 2 Ì† 7 s storage decision. Chemical use, for instance, has a marginal statistically significant effect on storage, suggesting that on average farmers using chemicals store 193 kg more than other farmers who do not use chemicals. In contrast, the use of plastic (mostly woven polypropylene) bags reduces the stored quantity by 296 kg, because this technology also facilitates the harvest period sales. The results also suggest that market-driven farmers may rely on high post-harvest prices as a shield against expected losses from storage. But subsistence farmers remain vulnerable to storage losses, and financial constraints during the harvest period might even weaken their food security during the post-harvest period. ^ In the essay 2, we compare hedonic price models and contingent valuation methods to estimate the price premium for grain damaged by insects (<b>Larger</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>Borer).</b> Following the hedonic model, we find that a price discount is applied to low grain quality, because farmers 2 Ì† 7 past market transactions reveal that 1...|$|R
40|$|The <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> Prostephanus truncatus, is {{a serious}} beetle pest that tunnels {{extensively}} to produce large quantities of dust and frass. The natural enemy Teretrius nigrescens is an important biological control beetle which is known to exploit at close-range solvent-extractable chemical cues in the dust and frass. The objective {{of the current study}} was to analyse quantitatively and qualitatively, the free fatty acid mixtures in different food-substrate materials both before and after insect attack by a range of stored-product pests in order to ascertain whether differences in these mixtures could explain the T. nigrescens selectivity to P. truncatus dust/frass over that of other species irrespective of food substrate. By TLC, GC and GCâ€“MS we found triglyceride and five free fatty acids were the most abundant chemicals in dust/frass (palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), stearic acid (C 18 : 0), oleic acid (C 18 : 1), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and linolenic acid (C 18 : 3)). In maize flour, Sitophilus species did not significantly change free fatty acid concentrations whereas with P. truncatus, Rhyzopertha dominica and Dinoderus minutus there were 4 â€“ 6 -fold increases, and, for Tribolium species there were over 20 -fold increases. These differences provide interesting insights to tunnelling/feeding habits and are correlated with known feeding preferences within grain. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that free fatty acid ratios in dust/frass of different species are most linked to the food substrate and confer little discriminatory information {{that could be used to}} distinguish between the different species. Although increases in free fatty acid concentrations are good indicators of pest infestation and this may contribute behaviourally in an additive or synergistic way, we conclude that other chemical(s) are present and are key to T. nigrescens recognition of P. truncatus on different substrates...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{decided to}} explore whether diatomaceous earths (DEs) might meet the grain {{protection}} demands of rural households. These inert dusts are non-toxic to mammals but deadly to insects absorbing the wax from the insectâ€™s cuticle {{which leads to}} water loss and death. Following laboratory studies, promising commercial DEs were trialled collaboratively by researchers and farmers as grain protectants in Zimbabwe. Protect-lt and Dryacide applied at 0. 1 %w/w were {{as effective as the}} synthetic conventional insecticide, Actellic Super dust, in limiting insect damage on stored maize, sorghum and cowpea grains for periods of eight months. However, laboratory studies revealed that the devastating <b>larger</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> now spread throughout many African countries was more tolerant to DEs than the storage pests found in Zimbabwe. This initiated the testing of DEs in combination with other products. Higher DE application rates of 0. 25 %w/w, a DE-pyrethroid combination and a local African DE were successfully tested by farmers in Tanzania. During this work the importance of the link between a potential technology such as DEs and the wider post-harvest service provision context became clearer. This led to the exploration of this context using: an enquiry approach to learn about post-harvest decision making amongst diverse rural households; and an experimental learning process to empower farmers. As the nature of the different stakeholders within the agricultural innovation system and their information requirements became more central to the work, the importance of the patterns of interaction amongst them and associated attitudes was repeatedly revealed. A learning alliance of key post-harvest stakeholders was established to explore and test opportunities for stakeholders to work together differently to help overcome institutional and other constraints.
