25|$|The Twentieth Air Force, {{eventually}} operating 20 {{groups and}} 1,000 bombers, also adopted a tail identification system in 1945. The other six numbered air forces {{fighting in the}} Pacific War also used tail markings within the various air forces both as group and squadron identifiers. The patterns or themes varied; some were designated at the Air Force level, some at the Command level and others down at Group or squadron level. As in Europe, geometeric shapes and colors were used as were letters, numbers and variations based on the RCN or serial number <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four digits.

We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} ten years, until Fred Grace's early death, the Grace {{brothers}} ran the USEE as its match organisers, for which they received payment, but they played for expenses only. Although the Graces were an expensive acquisition, they were cricket's main attraction and were guaranteed to draw large crowds wherever the USEE played. As a result, the USEE continued to prosper while the trend among its rival elevens was to fade from the scene. The USEE {{was the last of}} the major travelling elevens to fold, having seen a decline in public interest through its <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four seasons. The travelling elevens lost out in the cricket market to county cricket which burgeoned during the 1870s, ironically because of the Graces' county Gloucestershire. In addition, the public quickly warmed to international cricket which emerged {{at the end of the}} 1870s. The travelling elevens, which played largely meaningless matches against weak and unbalanced opposition, could not compete with the quality of top-class matches played by the county clubs against each other or a touring Australian team.|$|E

Lofton finished the regular season with a [...]275 batting average and a career-low seven stolen bases. With the Yankees looking to reshape their roster and the Philadelphia Phillies looking for a player with post-season experience, Lofton was dealt on December 3, 2004, which {{as part of the}} deal also had the Yankees sending $1.525 million to Philadelphia and the Phillies giving up reliever Felix Rodríguez. After the trade, Lofton stated, [...] "It's been very tough. I'm the kind of guy that likes to be settled down. It's been very tough the <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four years. Everyone in New York understood I wanted to play. I just wanted an opportunity to perform and be a part of the team. I didn't feel as much of a part of the team." ...|$|E
