5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lanes in both directions. Other benefits are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, {{the final}} {{at-grade}} intersections—one at Morning Star Drive, and another as a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> to the southbound lanes with eastbound Highway409—were replaced, making Highway427 a fully controlled-access freeway for its entire length.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{entering}} Stony Point, CR106 intersects CR98 where CR106 makes a <b>left</b> <b>turn.</b> CR106 then proceeds east toward its intersection with the Palisades Parkway. This is at exit15 {{and is the}} last residential exit northbound on the PIP, with everything north of this point being exits within Harriman and Bear Mountain.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between westbound Highway403 and eastbound on the parkway being {{provided by a}} loop ramp and access between westbound on the parkway and westbound Highway403 requiring a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> at a traffic light.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, {{construction}} {{began on}} an intersection expansion project at Milwaukee Avenue in Lincolnshire. Its outdated design was {{a gap in}} the stretch of recently completed roadwork in the surrounding area. The improvements on Illinois 22 have widened the east–west approaches at this major intersection to five lanes, with the new additions being dual <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lanes as well as right turn lanes. The new lanes were opened {{for the first time on}} October 15, 2010.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, 37 {{states and}} Puerto Rico allow <b>left</b> <b>turns</b> on red only if both {{the origin and}} {{destination}} streets are one way. See South Carolina law Section 56-5-970 C3, for example. Five other statesAlaska, Idaho, Michigan, Oregon, and Washingtonalso allow <b>left</b> <b>turns</b> on red into a one-way street from a two-way street.|$|R

5|$|MD 331 reaches Rhodesdale, {{where it}} intersects MD 14 (Rhodesdale Eldorado Road). At this intersection, the route makes a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> to run {{concurrent}} with MD 14 along East New Market Rhodesdale Road, heading west through Rhodesdale. The road leaves Rhodesdale and heads into farmland. MD 331 splits from MD 14 in Shiloh Church by turning north on Shiloh Church Hurlock Road at an intersection. Along Shiloh Church Hurlock Road, MD 331 passes a few residences before heading through more farm fields.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} {{into the}} town of East Windsor, the roadway becomes two lanes wide with auxiliary <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lanes and is known as South Main Street. It intersects with Route 191 (Phelps Street), {{which leads to the}} East Windsor town center. About half a mile (0.8km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44). Just south of the Enfield town line, US 5 intersects with Route 140, which crosses the Connecticut River {{into the town}} of Windsor Locks and Bradley International Airport.|$|E
5|$|After this interchange, US 9 crosses CR 646 {{and enters}} Absecon. The route crosses the marshy Absecon Creek prior to passing businesses. After {{crossing}} under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line, another route into Atlantic City, US 30 (White Horse Pike), crosses US 9. After US 30, the road turns east into wooded neighborhoods, becoming Wyoming Avenue. Route 157 intersects US 9 from the south, with US 9 making a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> to head northeast onto Shore Road. The road continues into Galloway Township, with residential development becoming less dense as it runs {{a short distance}} {{to the west of}} inland bays, intersecting the southern terminus of CR 561.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a more {{accurate}} method for the estimation of the left-turn adjustment factor for protected <b>left</b> <b>turns</b> at traffic signals. Research on the left-turn adjustment factor for two-lane approaches with protected <b>left</b> <b>turns</b> from a shared lane, gave results that differ from those of the HCM. Based on extended field measurements, the model proposed in this paper relates the left-turn adjustment factor for protected <b>left</b> <b>turns</b> from a shared lane to a number of traffic parameters. Such as the distribution of vehicles in the lanes, the mean volume per lane and the proportion of the left-turning vehicles...|$|R
5000|$|On 2003, {{after the}} {{perceived}} effectiveness in EDSA, Commonwealth Avenue and Marcos Highway, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) implemented the [...] "clearway scheme"; this has prohibited crossings and <b>left</b> <b>turns</b> on the avenue.

5|$|An {{additional}} three-mile {{section of}} Illinois 22 from Illinois 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related project {{that was once}} again met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E
5|$|MS 311 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MS 7 {{in the northern}} part of Holly Springs, heading northwest on two-lane undivided Mount Pleasant Road. The route passes through wooded areas with some homes and businesses as it comes to an intersection with the Holly Springs Bypass and makes a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> to continue to the northwest and leaves the city. Upon leaving Holly Springs, the road continues through forested areas with some farm fields and residences. Farther north, the highway reaches the community of Mount Pleasant. MS 311 passes a few homes and businesses within Mount Pleasant before reaching its northern terminus at the US 72 intersection. At this point, the road continues north as Rossville Road. MS 311 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.|$|E
5|$|Portland Road {{begins at}} a {{crossroads}} where the A215 crosses the A213 on South Norwood High Street and South Norwood Hill becomes Portland Road. The road then travels down a hill with many shops (mainly takeaways, newsagents). It passes South Norwood Leisure Centre, a new leisure centre which includes a creche, cafe, gym, swimming pool etc. Portland Road ends with a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> {{to stay on the}} A215 at Spring Lane or straight on to change onto the B243, Woodside Green. From June 2010, the road will be the site of a station on the new London Overground network.|$|E

5|$|Route 41 and County Route 573 {{continue}} {{north on}} Highland Avenue and cross into Haddonfield, {{where the road}} becomes Chews Landing Road. The two routes meet County Route 551 Spur (Kings Highway), and they bear to the right onto Kings Highway, heading northeast. They pass over New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line and the PATCO Speedline and then intersect County Route 561 (Haddon Avenue) Past CR 561, the road crosses the Cooper River into Cherry Hill Township. Route 41 and County Route 573 make a right turn onto a four-lane divided highway and intersect Route 154 (Brace Road). At this point, County Route 573 ends and Route 41 makes a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> onto a six-lane divided highway, becoming state-maintained again and forming a concurrency with Route 154.|$|E

Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 AM EST. Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions, the aircraft initiated a <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> to a heading of 290. In {{the course of the}} turn, at 1,600 feet, the Boeing banked too far, flipped past 90 degrees, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive.|$|E
5|$|The plane {{took off}} {{normally}} from runway 17 (today's runway 18) at 12:55am Central Time on Tuesday, February 3. Dwyer, {{the owner of}} the flight service company, witnessed the take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to see clearly the aircraft's tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> onto a northwesterly heading and a climb to 800ft. The tail light was then observed gradually descending until it disappeared out of view. Around 1:00am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts to establish communication were made, at Dwyer's request, by the radio operator, but they were all unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|East of Jacobsville, MD 177 {{receives}} {{the eastern end}} of MD 100. There is no direct access from eastbound MD 100 to westbound MD 177. The state highway becomes a three-lane road with the center lane controlled by lane use signals. During rush hours, there are two lanes in the relevant direction; at all other times, the center lane serves as a center <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> lane. The eastern end of the three-lane section is at South Carolina Avenue in the community of Lake Shore. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road and passes a loop of Old Mountain Road. At Pinehurst Road, which leads to Downs Memorial Park, the route veers southeast toward Gibson Island. MD 177 reaches its eastern terminus at the gatehouse that guards the private island community {{on the north side of}} the mouth of the Magothy River at the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
