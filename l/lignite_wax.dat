50|$|Montan wax, {{also known}} as <b>lignite</b> <b>wax</b> or OP wax, is a hard wax {{obtained}} by solvent extraction of certain types of lignite or brown coal. Commercially viable deposits exist {{in only a few}} locations, including Amsdorf, Germany, and in the Ione Basin near Ione, California.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Lignite</b> <b>wax,</b> an {{important}} chemical material, has good {{physical and chemical}} properties and is widely used in precision casting, wire and cable and other fields. This article briefly introduces the international and domestic markets of the lignite waxï¼Œand proposes the development direction of <b>lignite</b> <b>wax</b> production. Provide the basis for the production process through summary basic research data, and look for efficient solvent to improve yield and quality, and develop integrated production to realize comprehensive utilization of resources...|$|E
40|$|In {{experiments}} {{conducted at}} Savannah, Ga., dichlorvos dispensers of montan (<b>lignite)</b> <b>wax</b> installed {{at a rate}} of six units per 1000 cubic feet (28 m 3) in huts with mud or bamboo walls and with thatched roofs produced kills of caged Anopheles quadrimaculatus (12 hours' exposure) at or above 95 % for 5 - 6 weeks. The doors, windows, and eaves of the huts were open for maximum ventilation. In a non-ventilated plywood hut, a single dispenser gave effective kills for 7 months but in a non-ventilated mud hut the period was 5 months. Air concentrations of dichlorvos in the mud hut were shown to be definitely lower than those in a plywood hut at the same dosage level...|$|E
