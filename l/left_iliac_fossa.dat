30|$|Examination {{revealed}} deep tenderness in {{the right}} <b>iliac</b> <b>fossa</b> with no guarding or rigidity. Laboratory parameters revealed a normal white cell count and normal inflammatory markers. Transabdominal ultrasound scan showed a complex 4.4 [*]×[*] 4 [*]×[*] 5.7  cm thin-walled cystic area {{to the right of}} the dome of the bladder and several small cysts {{in the right}} ovary. MRI confirmed the same findings of a complex cystic area superior to and {{to the right of the}} dome of the bladder. The uterus and left adnexa were normal. There was a tiny trace of free fluid in the pelvis. The serum human chorionic gonadotrophin and alpha fetoprotein were within normal limits. She was taken to theatre for a laparoscopic assessment. A standard laparoscopy was performed using open insertion of the 5  mm umbilical port and two further ports in the right and the <b>left</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>fossae.</b> Per-operative findings revealed a small amount of pelvic free fluid, large tense hydrosalpinx with several loops of small bowel adherent to it, normal uterus and the left ovary and fallopian tube and a follicular cyst in the region of the right ovary. A decision was taken to proceed with right salpingectomy. Small bowel loops were separated from the hydrosalpinx and it was resected, using a PDS Endoloop to ligate the stump. The resected specimen was retrieved through the umbilical port and sent for histopathological examination. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 3 rd post-operative day. The histopathology revealed a hydrosalpinx on the right side. The patient was doing well and was pain free when seen in the clinic post-operatively.|$|R

Her blood pressure was low (78 / 33  mmHg), pulse 58 beats per minute and she was tender in both the <b>left</b> and right <b>iliac</b> <b>fossae.</b> She was administered plasma expanders and her blood was cross-matched. In view of her presentation and the initial suspicion of a cervical ectopic pregnancy, consent was given for evacuation of a possible cervical ectopic pregnancy and intrauterine pregnancy. In theatre, the cervix was observed to be enlarged (bulbous) and the transvaginal scan confirmed a cervical ectopic pregnancy and an intrauterine pregnancy.|$|R

30|$|A 48 -year-old {{woman of}} Polish origin {{with a history}} of lower {{abdominal}} pain and a pelvic mass was referred by her general practitioner. She previously had emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix. Abdominal examination revealed a longitudinal paraumbilical scar with a small incisional hernia. A pelvic ultrasound scan showed a left-sided ovarian cyst, measuring 8.4 [*]×[*] 7.1 [*]×[*] 6.1  cm, with no complex features. Tumour markers were normal. At operation, the laparoscope was introduced through a 10 -mm intraumbilical incision. Two additional 5 -mm ports were inserted in the <b>left</b> and right <b>iliac</b> <b>fossae</b> under direct laparoscopic vision. A left oophorectomy was performed using ‘tripolar’ coagulation shears, and the specimen was removed through the 10 -mm umbilical port using a laparoscopic tissue retrieval ‘Endocatch’ (Cory Bros, Shenley, Hertfordshire) bag. This was done under direct vision with a 5 -mm laparoscope, inserted through the right <b>iliac</b> <b>fossa</b> port.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abdominal lavage is {{a common}} {{surgical}} practice, but {{few studies have been}} conducted to assess its efficacy at removing cells from the abdominal cavity, particularly during laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: After three 12 -mm trocars were inserted into six female 30 -kg pigs at the umbilicus <b>left</b> and right <b>iliac</b> <b>fossae,</b> the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide. The pelvis of each pigs was injected with 6 million radiolabeled LIM 1215 cells. Then the abdominal cavity was irrigated with either 500 ml 0. 9 % saline, 500 ml 10 % betadine solution, or 1 L 0. 9 % saline. A maximum of 5 L of solution was used for each animal. The lavage fluid was suctioned into separate containers after each aliquot, and each container was measured for radioactivity. RESULTS: Significantly greater numbers of cells were removed by lavage by the first to third lavage cycle; however, after four lavage cycles, relatively few cells were removed by each further cycle. No difference was observed between 500 -ml and 1 -L aliquots. Additionally, the mechanical efficacy of 0. 9 % saline and 10 % betadine solution appeared similar. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that optimal lavage consists of four irrigation/suction cycles utilizing 500 -ml aliquots...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe main organs in the <b>left</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>fossa</b> are the {{descending}} colon, {{sigmoid colon}} and, in women, internal reproductive organs. An {{infection of the}} <b>left</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>fossa</b> must lead the clinician firstly to suspect diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon in older patients and salpingitis in women of childbearing age. Other less common aetiologies are possible (inflammatory or infectious colitis, epiploic appendagitis, abscess of the psoas, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, etc.). Sonography as a first-line investigation may lead to diagnosis (especially in gynaecological disease), but a CT scan with intravenous injection of an iodine-containing contrast medium will allow for a full assessment of disease spread, and complications of sigmoid colitis or its differential diagnoses (abscess, fistula, perforation) to be investigated.
