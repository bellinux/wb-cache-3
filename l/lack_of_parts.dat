5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave {{a boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently before the war became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts,</b> particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the trams were too wide.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the original 1922 locomotives is increasingly difficult, due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> and expertise, and the remoteness of his base in El Maitén. This can cause frequent delays or service shut-downs.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of Fall Rot, French aviation industry had reached a considerable output, and estimated its strength at nearly 2,000. However chronic <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> crippled this industrial feat. Only 29% (599) aircraft were serviceable, of which 170 were bombers, of which all were vastly inferior and vulnerable to the Luftwaffe's Jagdgruppen equipped with the Bf 109E.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1942, WCBW (like {{almost all}} {{television}} stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were canceled, since the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting {{exclusively to the}} occasional broadcast of films. [...] This was primarily {{due to the fact}} that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> [...] In May, 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by Ned Calmer, and then by Everett Holles.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-January, Japanese {{advances}} southward cut {{the anticipated}} aircraft ferry routes to the Philippines and reinforcement {{was no longer}} feasible. Instead, using aircraft as their assembly was completed and assigning personnel at hand, provisional fighter squadrons were organized in Brisbane to assist the Royal Netherlands Indies Air Force (ML-KNIL) in defending the NEI. The 17th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) was established on 14 January, and 13 of its 17 pilots had previously been with the 24th PG. With 17 P-40s delivered by the Pensacola convoy (assembly of the 18th could not be completed because of a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts),</b> it flew across northern Australia from Brisbane to Darwin, then to Java via Penfoie Airdrome at Koepang and Den Pasar Field on Bali between 16 and 25 January. Only 12 Warhawks arrived at the designated FEAF fighter base at Ngoro Field, the others lost to accidents, combat, and pilot illness. [...] The 20th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional), incorporating pilots of the 35th PG, took off from Darwin in 25 P-40s on 2 February, but only 17 reached Java, the remainder shot down over Bali or damaged on the ground by air raids. Likewise, 25 P-40s of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) departed Brisbane, but because of accidents involving novice pilots, only 18 reached Darwin on 8 February. Just nine eventually reinforced Ngoro; an entire flight of eight was lost when it exhausted its fuel after its LB-30 navigation guide aircraft became lost in a storm trying to find Koepang. Survivors of both the 3rd and 20th provisional squadrons were integrated into the 17th PS. The 33rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) was en route to Java at Darwin when it was nearly annihilated by a Japanese air raid on 19 February. Of 83 P-40s assembled and flown from Brisbane, only 37 arrived at Ngoro Field, and by 15 February less than 20 could be mustered for operations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{processing}} of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) {{by means of}} shape-cutting technologies is state-of-the-art today. These processes still perform in some applications with <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>part</b> quality such as delamination and low processes productivity. Therefore, laser processing by ultra-short laser pulses has a great potential in material ablation of CFRP. Nevertheless laser process parameters have to be adjusted carefully to reduce extension of heat affected zone (HAZ) and its influence on part quality [1]...|$|R
