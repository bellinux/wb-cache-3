25|$|In 1975, archaeologists {{discovered}} {{evidence of}} a port complex between Ratcliff and Shadwell, that was used throughout Roman occupation of Britain, and being most active in the 3rd century AD.

The foundation worked to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS-related issues, {{with a focus}} on hemophiliacs like Ryan White, and on families caring for relatives with the disease. The foundation was active throughout the 1990s, with donations reaching $300,000 a year in 1997. Between 1997 and 2000, however, AIDS donations declined nationwide by 21%, and the Ryan White Foundation saw its donation <b>level</b> <b>drop</b> to $100,000 a year. In 2000, Ryan's mother closed the foundation, and merged its remaining assets with AIDS Action, a larger charity.

500|$|The shore is {{the most}} {{indented}} coastline in the Mediterranean. The majority of the coast is characterised by a karst topography, developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform.

The eastern coast's largest part consists of carbonate rocks, while flysch rock is significantly represented in the Gulf of Trieste coast, on the Kvarner Gulf coast opposite Krk, and in Dalmatia north of Split. There are comparably small alluvial areas of the Adriatic coast in Croatia—most notably the Neretva river delta. Western Istria is gradually subsiding, having sunk about [...] in the past 2,000years.|$|E

50|$|Another major {{point of}} {{discussion}} regards {{the presence of}} erosional deep canyons along the continental margins of the Basins. These {{should be expected to}} be present because of the assumption of a major sea <b>level</b> <b>drop.</b> And in fact they have been described by several authors (summarized in e.g. Clauzon et al., 1996). Most of them are infilled by early Pliocene sediments. As outlined in van Dijk et al. (1998) this phenomenon can be explained in two ways: A major eustatic sea <b>level</b> <b>drop,</b> or a tectonic uplift of the margins (for example associated with a minor sea <b>level</b> <b>drop).</b> It constitutes, therefore, not a real proof for the desiccation of an existing originally deep basin.|$|E
