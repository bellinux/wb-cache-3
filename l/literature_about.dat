5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European <b>literature</b> <b>about</b> Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons {{that he decided to}} become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist {{as a sign of the}} author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.|$|E

30|$|There were no {{relevant}} <b>literatures</b> published <b>about</b> {{the application}} of computational mass transfer theory {{in the field of}} MBR, so there is not any literature reference for the establishment of mathematical model in this field. However, in the field of chemical industry, especially the rectifying tower, {{there are a lot of}} <b>literatures</b> <b>about</b> concentration field simulation. Therefore, in the field of MBR, mathematical model of the chemical industry can be used. Because both the rectifying tower and the MBR follow the law of momentum transference and concentration transference, the model of computational mass transfer theory is commonly accepted.|$|R
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in the <b>literature</b> <b>about</b> whether Suillus cothurnatus {{represents a}} different species from S.salmonicolor. The online mycological taxonomy database MycoBank lists them as synonyms, contrary to Index Fungorum. In their 2000 monograph of North American boletes, Alan Bessette and colleagues list the two taxa separately, {{noting that the}} range of S.cothurnatus {{is difficult to determine}} because of confusion with S.salmonicolor. In a molecular analyses of Suillus phylogeny, based on the internal transcribed spacer, S.salmonicolor (as S.subluteus) and S.intermedius clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of genetic similarity. These analyses were based on comparing the sequence differences in a single region of ribosomal DNA; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.|$|E
5|$|Tunjos (from Muysccubun: tunxo) {{are small}} votive {{offering}} figures produced in great quantities by the Muisca. They {{are found in}} various places on the Altiplano, mainly in lakes and rivers, and {{are the most common}} object housed in museum collections outside Colombia. The word tunjo was used first in the <b>literature</b> <b>about</b> the Muisca in 1854, by scholar Ezequiel Uricoechea. The figurines are mostly anthropomorphic with other examples being zoomorphic. The tunjos were mostly elaborated using tumbaga; an alloy of gold, copper and silver, some with traces of lead or iron. The majority of ceramic or stone tunjos has been described from Mongua, close to Sogamoso. The tunjos served three purposes; as decoration of temples and shrines, for offering rituals in the sacred lakes and rivers in the Muisca religion, and as pieces in funerary practices; to accompany the dead to the afterlife. Ceramic human Tunjos were kept in the houses (bohíos) of the Muisca, together with emeralds.|$|E
