Therefore, the use of a torso-related transfer function in applications that require a high level of precision is suggested. The variability of the responses also depends on the tactor direction.

Literary {{scholarship}} has always shown {{an interest in}} spatial dimensions and extensions of biographies, but it ascribed them a specific value. Pioneers of literary geography from the German linguistic area (Siegfried Robert Nagel and Josef Nadler) were mostly interested in the local, regional, national, or provincial origins of the authors, which {{is second only to}} the title of the work {{when it comes to the}} most commonly mapped literary-historical information. The province or geographical space was understood as the humus orbasis from which the authors and also the spiritual or literary achievements originate. Such a deterministic view of the space/place eased overtime, becoming only one of the factors that influence the development of the literary culture. Scholars such as Horst Dieter Schlosser started addressing other spatially bound datafor example, places of education, career, travels, publishing, or networking. Consequently, the manners of mapping have also changed: from the simple charts covered with transparent paper displaying literary monuments to more complicated-though not necessarily more explicit-biographical displays using a wide variety of cartographic symbols (from point marks to graphically more representative cartographic symbols such as the quaver). As a result of a project whose goal is to map the biographies of prominent Slovenian men of letters, this paper returns to a more basic manner of displaying biographies, using, say, point and <b>linear</b> <b>display.</b> In this sense, it is closer to the attempts from the beginning of the twentieth century. However, by using modern GIS technologies the project models cartographic displays according to the latest cartographic guidelines. Moreover, unlike the 1980 s attempts, the project emphasizes not individual trajectories, but, using corpus processing, the literary culture from the beginnings of Slovenian aesthetic production. This enables not only new findings about the spatial development of Slovenian literature, but also certain generalizations of these findings. The structure of the entry mask for biographies, which was constructed for the purposes of this project, is accordingly differentiated and in principle enables the collection and visualization of all spatially bound and statistically relevant literary-historical data. Thematic maps designed as analytical tools for a spatial analysis of literature will focus on individual objects, displaying the following spatially linked components of biographies: 1) the network of birthplaces 2) the network of the places of death 3) the network of secondary school locations 4) the network of secondary schools, which belong to the wider context of literary culture 5) career paths that must be considered when verifying the modes of mobility of the men of letters and the spatial extent of literary culture 6) the density of literary networks 7) the print media and presses that participated in consolidating literary activityand 8) individual literary memorial events.

The variation of parameters, such as displacements and strains, with the applied load was recorded and presented in a graphical form. The reduction in stiffness of the units owing to cracks was estimated from these graphs. The predominant mode of failure {{was found to be}} cracking initiated at the soffit of the units (tension zone) and mainly around the symmetry line (where maximum bending stresses congregate). These cracks propagated gradually towards the top. The measured and predicted strain distribution across the depth of the vertical part of the terrace unit (riser) was found to be predominantly <b>linear,</b> <b>displaying</b> tension at the bottom and compression at the top. A large portion of the horizontal part of the unit (tread) followed closely the behaviour of the riser, however, to reveal tension rather than compression at the top.

College students read a 6500 word text on abnormal behavior either with or without {{a set of}} adjunct displays, and then were tested either immediately or two days later. Tests included both objective and essay items. Objective items measured knowledge of concept facts that either appeared (represented) or did not appear (nonrepresented) in the adjunct displays, knowledge of the hierarchical structure of concepts, and the ability to transfer knowledge of concepts by identifying novel examples. Essay items measured knowledge of between-concept comparisons and whether written expression of those comparisons involved the use of contrasting premises (comparing concepts along characteristics). Results revealed the following significant findings: (1) the graphic organizer group outperformed the text-only group on the comparisons measure, and (2) the graphic organizer group outperformed the outline group on the contrasting premises measure. Responses to a questionnaire also indicated that students rated graphic organizers as easier to understand than outlines.

The line edge derivative approach to determining MTF did not yield useful MTF results for the halftoned forms. The Weiner spectrum for the Diamond Dot and Bryngdahl screens contained components at the halftone cell frequency, while the spectrum for the Bayer and Allebach screens contained components at much higher frequencies.
