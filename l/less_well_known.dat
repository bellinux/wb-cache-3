40|$|Two drug {{products}} are considered bioequivalent ‘if their bio-availabilities [...] . {{are similar to}} such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, will essentially be the same’. 1 The bioequivalence of two drug products is generally demonstrated through a clinical study in healthy volunteers, the so-called bioequivalence study. If bioequivalence is shown for two drug products, therapeutic equivalence of the drug products is implied. Chow and Liu 2 call this assumption, namely that bioequivalence implies therapeutic equivalence, the ‘fundamen-tal bioequivalence assumption’. Most drug products on the market today have been subjected to bioequivalence assessment at various stages in their devel-opment.

The industry standard value at risk exhibits many deficiencies. It does not account for the size of the losses and may penalize diversification.

40|$|In 1936 Saul Rosenzweig (19072004) {{published}} a scientific paper concluding that psychotherapies of different {{theoretical and practical}} orientations all produce equivalent effectiveness-a conclusion that remains unchanged today despite 75 years of empirical research seeking to find differential effectiveness for different forms of psychotherapy treatment. What is <b>less</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> however, is that despite equivalent effectiveness of therapy brand names, there is considerable variation in effectiveness between individual therapists. It is therefore fitting that this book begins with a message from Rosenzweig, which sets the scene for a very different volume from the first edition. The first edition (1999), edited by Hubble, Duncan and Miller, quickly became a classic text in the field because it took Rosenzweig 2 ̆ 7 s conclusion, and then {{turned it into a}} set of principles to help therapists become more effective. The idea at the time was that therapists should capitalise on four common factors: (1) mobilise the client 2 ̆ 7 s life circumstances and environment; (2) enhance the therapy relationship; (3) create an atmosphere of hope and expectation of change; and (4) use therapy techniques in the service of helping the client to make their own changes.

40|$|Women’s organizing, both at {{the local}} and global level {{has been one of}} the new social {{movement}} phenomena in which the role of human agency to resist global restructuring is most significant.   However, such resistance strategies are particularly difficult when the challenge is not only confronting economic globalization as such but also part of the comrades in arms in such confrontation, that is trade unions that as such embody part of this resistance to transnational capital. The entanglement of the identities of class and gender is not unproblematic but it also opens new possibilities for example in the way of the creation of alternative labour organizations rejecting the traditions of authoritarianism and patriarchal hierarchies plaguing classical trade unions. The aim of this article is to show one such example of labour organizing among women workers within maquiladora (assembling factories-outsourcing) industries, the case of San Marcos in El Salvador. As it is <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> these industries have traditionally, in the first phases of their establishment and specially within textile manufacture, recruited mostly female workers, that is to say cheap labour. The story of their exploitation is quite <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> what is <b>less</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> is their organizing experiences, and these are quite varied. Taking as point of departure the example of El Salvador I want to illustrate how these women have been able to overcome many difficulties and sometimes form their own trade unions in alliance with NGOs. I will try to present their strategies and challenges as well as their potential for the near future. Thus, one can perhaps delineate the different factors that make this organizing possible, the importance of the local context vis a vis the international and the possibilities and limits of this kind of local resistance to the conditions imposed by globalization.

Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in alluvial forest (forest near a river), where there are many decaying trees that the bat can use as roosting sites. In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed deciduous forest. In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are <b>less</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b> Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the greater and lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros) and Myotis emarginatus.

Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} data to accurately estimate population sizes {{at the time}} of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala. The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern Petén lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab. The Yalain appear to {{have been one of the}} three dominant polities in Postclassic central Petén, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of Lake Macanché. At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups. In the late 17th century, Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including Zacpeten on Lake Macanché and Ixlu on Lake Salpetén. Other groups in Petén are <b>less</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Manche Ch'ol, and the Mopan.|$|E
