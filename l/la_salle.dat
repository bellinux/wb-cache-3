5|$|René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> (1643–87) was a French explorer. In 1682, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> led a canoe {{expedition}} {{to explore the}} Mississippi River basin. The expedition landed to hunt, when one of their members went missing. The armorer Pierre Prudhomme was assumed captured by Chickasaw Indians. <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> decided to stay and search for the missing member. <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after their lost man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member found his way back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting. The expedition reached {{the mouth of the}} Mississippi River on April 6, 1682.|$|E
5|$|The first European outpost within modern Indiana was Tassinong, a French {{trading post}} {{established}} in 1673 near the Kankakee River. French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> {{came to the}} area in 1679, claiming it for King Louis the XIV of France. <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> came to explore a portage between the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers, and Father Ribourde, who traveled with <b>La</b> <b>Salle,</b> marked trees along the way. The marks survived to be photographed in the 19th century. In 1681, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> negotiated a common defense treaty between the Illinois and Miami nations against the Iroquois.|$|E
5|$|During the 58-day voyage, twopeople died {{of illness}} and onewoman {{gave birth to a}} child. The voyage to Santo Domingo had lasted longer than expected, and {{provisions}} ran low, especially after the loss of the St. François. <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> had little money with which to replenish supplies, and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade goods to the islanders, and lent their profits to <b>La</b> <b>Salle.</b> To fill the gaps left after several men deserted, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> recruited a few islanders to join the expedition.|$|E

5|$|The colony faced {{numerous}} difficulties {{during its}} brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> led several expeditions {{to find the}} Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> realized the colony could survive only {{with help from the}} French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was struggling in conference play. In this game, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E

50|$|Joutel {{was born}} in Rouen. After serving as a soldier, he joined <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> {{expedition}} and became the commander of <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> southern colony and base of operations in the New World at Fort Saint Louis (Texas). After {{the loss of the}} colony's ships, a mutiny, and <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> murder by others, in 1687-88, Joutel led members of the expedition back to France, going north, over land and river, by way of the Illinois Country to New France in what became Canada. Joutel's journal provides some of the earliest written information on the interior, natural history, and ethnography of central North America.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, much of North America had been claimed by European countries. Spain had claimed Florida {{as well as}} modern-day Mexico {{and much of the}} southwestern part of the continent. The {{northern}} and central Atlantic coast was claimed by Britain, and New France comprised much of what is now eastern Canada as well as the central Illinois Country. The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims of its neighbors. In 1681, French nobleman Robert Cavelier de <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> launched an expedition down the Mississippi River from New France, at first believing he would find a path to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> found a route to the Gulf of Mexico. Although Hernando De Soto had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140years before, on April 9, 1682, <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king Louis XIV, naming the territory Louisiana in his honor.|$|E
5|$|European powers {{ignored the}} area until accidentally {{settling}} there in 1685. Miscalculations by René-Robert Cavelier de <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River. The colony lasted {{only four years}} before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.|$|E

5|$|After the Ateneo de Manila, <b>La</b> <b>Salle,</b> and San Beda left, the NCAA {{opened its}} doors to new members. In 1984, Perpetual Help College of Rizal was {{accepted}} as a new member, while Trinity College of Quezon City became a full member in 1985 (despite earlier explanation that the Stallions were admitted earlier, in 1974). San Beda rejoined the league in 1986, while Trinity left in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{is home to}} Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational {{institution}} of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths.

5|$|<b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> mission had {{remained}} secret until 1686 when former expedition member Denis Thomas, who had deserted in Santo Domingo, {{was arrested for}} piracy. Trying to have his punishment reduced, Thomas informed his Spanish jailers of <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> plan to found a colony and eventually conquer Spanish silver mines. Despite his confession, Thomas was hanged.|$|R

5|$|Four {{of the men}} deserted {{when they}} reached the Neches River. <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for twomonths. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight {{surviving}} members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, French {{explorer}} <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> led {{an expedition}} south from the Illinois River {{to the mouth}} of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico, claiming the entire valley for France. <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> named the Mississippi river basin La Louisiane (Louisiana) after King Louis XIV; the region between and near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers was named the Illinois Country. As part of a series of forts in the Mississippi valley, the French built settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia, Illinois. French trading companies also built towns during the 1720s and 1730s, including Fort de Chartres and Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, the first European town in Missouri west of the Mississippi. From 1756 to 1760, fighting in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War) halted settlement building. The economy remained weak through 1762 due to the ongoing war, in which Britain defeated France the following year.|$|E

5|$|The University Belt {{refers to}} the area {{where there is a}} high {{concentration}} or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel, Quiapo and Sampaloc districts meet. Generally, it includes the western end of España Boulevard, Nicanor Reyes St. (formerly Morayta St.), the eastern end of Claro M. Recto Avenue (formerly Azcarraga), Legarda Avenue, Mendiola Street, and the different side streets. Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other. Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the Pasig River, mostly at the Intramuros and Ermita districts, and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part of Malate near the border with Pasay such as the private co-educational institution of De <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> University, the largest of all De <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> University System of schools.|$|E
50|$|In April 1969 College Hall was the {{location}} of a sit-in conducted by about two to three hundred students. The students were protesting <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> policy that mandated that all freshmen and sophomores participate in <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> ROTC program. The sit-in lasted four days, with students working in shifts. After the fourth day, the college decided to accept the students' demands, and ended its mandatory ROTC policy.|$|R
50|$|<b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> {{teams have}} won two {{national}} championships: The 1954 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and the 1980 Division II AIAW Field Hockey Championship.

50|$|In 1968, Jelks left Texas for a {{teaching}} position at Illinois State University. There he organized an anthropology curriculum and taught {{undergraduate and graduate}} courses in archaeology, including a seminar in historical archaeology. He continued to involve students in archaeological work, particularly research involving French explorer <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> colonizing efforts. Jelks carried out exploratory excavations at the first location of <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> Fort St. Louis (1680) at Starved Rock,Illinois but failed to locate the site of <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> later Fort St. Louis near Peoria. In 1983, Jelks and ISU history professor Carl Ekberg did identify the first site of the French Fort de Chatres, built along the Mississippi River in southern Illinois in 1719.|$|R
