Some serious rock <b>licks</b> <b>back</b> him up on some cuts, while he goes a little old school on others and then shifts to a more modern hip-hop sound on a few more. Lyrically, Manafest covers ground from {{witnessing}} to others to the pressures {{of living in the}} 21st century to living for God. Overall, this is a strong debut and it makes a big statement for this young artist." [...] Paul Portell of Jesus Freak Hideout {{went on to say that}} [...] "Manafest's debut may take more than a listen or two to fully appreciate his talent and attempts at songwriting.

It achieved moderate crossover CHR success, ultimately peaking at number forty-two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number twenty on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Due to the explicit sexuality of the song's lyrics, it was heavily edited and censored for radio and video play. The video became a top six hit on BET's 106 & Park.

Listen to the album through headphones to hear a new fill, <b>lick,</b> <b>backing</b> vocal or riff every time.

50|$|One popular home {{method to}} {{determine}} the presence of bad breath is to <b>lick</b> the <b>back</b> of the wrist, let the saliva dry {{for a minute or}} two, and smell the result. This test results in overestimation, as concluded from research, and should be avoided. A better way would be to lightly scrape the posterior back of the tongue with a plastic disposable spoon and to smell the drying residue. Home tests that use a chemical reaction to test for the presence of polyamines and sulfur compounds on tongue swabs are now available, but there are few studies showing how well they actually detect the odor. Furthermore, since breath odor changes in intensity throughout the day depending on many factors, multiple testing sessions may be necessary.|$|R
50|$|Bombus bifarius {{workers have}} short proboscides (tongue-like structures), which makes nectar {{foraging}} {{more difficult for}} them relative to bumblebees with longer proboscides. Therefore, in order to effectively retrieve nectar from plants, B. bifarius individuals often use their short proboscides to <b>lick</b> along the <b>back</b> of nectar ducts of the plant in question. This yields a smaller reward than the rewards obtained with larger proboscides, but not small enough to make nectar foraging ineffective.|$|R

50|$|The {{bumblebee}} tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy {{structure that}} extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla.

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 October, the final orders came at around 05:00. The main {{objective}} was still Binarville-La Viergette road. The attack was to start at 07:00, to give time for the fog to lift and the men to eat. Whittlesey and McMurtry ordered Companies D and F to remain along the western ridge to become a containing force. The rest {{of the first and}} second battalions would continue along a hill known as [...] "hill 198" [...] to complete a flanking maneuver on the enemy. The problem was that on the hill was a double trench line of German soldiers. The plan was once the two battalions took the hill that they would then send back companies E and H to create a line to Companies D and F. By the night of 2 October, after a long day of battling, Major Whittlesey received information that the men found a way up the right of Hill 198. At around this same moment the French experienced a massive counterattack by the Germans and were forced to fall back exposing the left flank of the 308th. The same occurred on the right flanks with the other American Division, causing the 308th to be surrounded. However, they did not discover this until shortly after they reached the peak of Hill 198. The hill was now in their control; however, it was too quiet for Whittlesey. He realized that he could hear nothing of the 307th {{that was supposed to be}} on their flank. [...] "Either they had broken through the line as well and reached their objective over there, or they had been <b>licked</b> and fallen <b>back.</b> The former would be good news for the 308th … The latter, however, was unthinkable; orders forbade it…" ...|$|R
60|$|The plants which I {{raised from}} {{purchased}} seed varied greatly in the colour of their flowers, so that hardly two individuals were quite alike; the corolla being of all shades of yellow, {{with the most}} diversified blotches of purple, crimson, orange, and coppery brown. But these plants differed in no other respect. (3/1. I sent several specimens with variously coloured flowers to Kew, and Dr. Hooker informs me that they all consisted of Mimulus luteus. The flowers with much red have been named by horticulturists as var. Youngiana.) The flowers are evidently well adapted for fertilisation by the agency of insects; {{and in the case}} of a closely allied species, Mimulus rosea, I have watched bees entering the flowers, thus getting their backs well dusted with pollen; and when they entered another flower the pollen was <b>licked</b> off their <b>backs</b> by the two-lipped stigma, the lips of which are irritable and close like a forceps on the pollen-grains. If no pollen is enclosed between the lips, these open again after a time. Mr. Kitchener has ingeniously explained the use of these movements, namely, to prevent the self-fertilisation of the flower. (3/2. 'A Year's Botany' 1874 page 118.) If a bee with no pollen on its back enters a flower it touches the stigma, which quickly closes, and when the bee retires dusted with pollen, it can leave none on the stigma of the same flower. But as soon as it enters any other flower, plenty of pollen is left on the stigma, which will be thus cross-fertilised. Nevertheless, if insects are excluded, the flowers fertilise themselves perfectly and produce plenty of seed; but I did not ascertain whether this is effected by the stamens increasing in length with advancing age, or by the bending down of the pistil. The chief interest in my experiments on the present species, lies in the appearance in the fourth self-fertilised generation of a variety which bore large peculiarly-coloured flowers, and grew to a greater height than the other varieties; it likewise became more highly self-fertile, so that this variety resembles the plant named Hero, which appeared in the sixth self-fertilised generation of Ipomoea.|$|R
