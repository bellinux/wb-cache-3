40|$|Buckling of {{composite}} laminates with delaminations is studied {{based on}} a proposed isogeometric <b>layerwise</b> approach. The isogeometric approach employs the NURBS basis functions of the geometry’s description to approximate the physical response in an isoparametric sense. <b>Layerwise</b> theories provide an accurate prediction of the three-dimensional structural responses of composite laminates while maintaining a two-dimensional data structure. Usually, to model the delaminations through thickness, the displacement field is enriched with a unit step Heaviside function which allows for discontinuities at the delamination interfaces. An improved implementation of a displacement-based <b>layerwise</b> theory based on the isogeometric paradigm is proposed. The delaminated and undelaminated regions of the laminate are modeled as separate patches. For the undelaminated and delaminated patches respectively, the C 0 -continuity and discontinuity conditions of the displacement field at the ply interfaces can be easily facilitated within the isogeometric framework. More reliable and accurate buckling loads are obtained by considering a contact analysis across the delamination interfaces to avoid physically inadmissible buckling modes. The proposed model is verified using laminated composite beam plates. The results are compared to a classical <b>layerwise</b> approach.
