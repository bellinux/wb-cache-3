5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had too many redundancies in the cases and left too <b>little</b> <b>control</b> to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they {{lost control of the}} action.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{resulting}} many-sided dispute among the Parliamentarians and Covenanters was prompted by accounts very soon after the battle that all three allied generals-in-chief had fled the field. The Earl of Manchester left the field but he subsequently rallied some infantry and returned, although {{he was able to}} exercise <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over events.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E

5|$|While {{the leaders}} of Congress languished in jail, the other parties {{supported}} the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over events. At {{the end of the}} war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) played {{a young man}} (Peter). The play's script assigns {{dialogue}} to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after {{the first page of}} the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature. Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> of Righton's portrayal of the part.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's {{foreign policy}} was largely defensive. The {{exception}} was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, {{which ended in}} failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This paid off {{in the war against}} Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had <b>little</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over lords, or required {{the construction of}} new castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– {{as was the case in}} England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March, the Cambodian National Assembly deposed Sihanouk {{and named}} Lon Nol as {{provisional}} head of state. This led Sihanouk to immediately establish a government-in-exile in Beijing and to ally himself with North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge, the NLF, and the Laotian Pathet Lao. In doing so, Sihanouk lent {{his name and}} popularity {{in the rural areas}} of Cambodia to a movement over which he had <b>little</b> <b>control.</b> The North Vietnamese response to the coup was swift. PAVN began directly supplying large amounts of weapons and advisors to the Khmer Rouge, and Cambodia plunged into civil war.|$|E

5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E
5|$|The Empire {{succeeds in}} unsealing all eight Mana Seeds. However, Thanatos betrays the Emperor and his henchmen, killing them and seizing {{control of the}} Mana Fortress for himself. The hero and his party journey to locate the Mana Tree, {{the focal point of}} the world's life energy. Anticipating their arrival, Thanatos {{positions}} the Mana Fortress over the Tree and destroys it. The charred remains of the Tree speak to the heroes, explaining that a giant dragon called the Mana Beast will soon be summoned to combat the Fortress. However, the Beast has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over its rage and will likely destroy the world as well. The Mana Tree also reveals that it was once the human wife of Serin, the original Mana Knight and the hero's father. The voice heard at Potos' waterfall was that of Serin's ghost.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had <b>little</b> <b>control.</b> In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E
40|$|Dyspareunia is {{generally}} described, in both psychiatric nosologies and gynecological texts, as a recurrent acute pain experienced primarily during intercourse. A condition rare in men, dyspareunia affects an estimated 10 – 15 % of sexually active women (Laumann et al., 1994). Despite the high estimated prevalence of this disorder, {{there has been}} <b>little</b> <b>controlled</b> research on it (Meana and Binik, 1994). The etiological theorizing has also been mostly dualistic, with gynecology focusing on cases associated with observable peripheral pathology and psychiatry/psychology focusing on cases where no such pathology was evident...|$|R

5|$|The great {{majority}} of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons (No.460, No.462, No.463, No.466 and No.467squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, {{and the proportion of}} Australians in these units increased over time. No.464Squadron, which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into No.6Group RCAF in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over how they were used.|$|E
5|$|John's {{preparations}} have no effect, however, {{as he is}} tricked into {{killing the}} guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the {{events leading up to}} the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis's time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano's, and Angie, from the current run, with three different artists, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin and Leonardo Manco each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.|$|E
