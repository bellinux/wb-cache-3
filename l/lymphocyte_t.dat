Methods: Patients who initiated first cART between January 2008 and October 2014 were included. Discontinuation was defined as stop of at least 1 drug of the regimen, regardless of the reason. All causes of discontinuation were evaluated and 3 main endpoints were considered: toxicity, intolerance, and simplification.

The culture of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was divided into three groups containing 5, 25 and 50 mg/L of mangiferin, and a control group (RPMI medium). The proportion of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and IL- 2 Rα (CD 25) expressed T cells were evaluated using immunoflouorescens techniques after one and three days of lymphocytes cultures. Our study showed that 5, 25 and 50 mg/L mangiferin was effective to enhance IL- 2 Rα (CD 25) on <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> culture and <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> prolifferation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Immunohistochemical {{procedures}} {{were used to}} analyse the subpopulations of mononuclear cells in muscle biopsies from 24 patients with polymyositis. The character of the cellular infiltrate was similar at the perivascular, perimysial, and endomysial sites, with cytotoxic-suppressor <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (<b>T</b> 8 +) and macrophages being the dominant elements. Helper <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (<b>T</b> 4 +) and B lymphocytes were present in smaller numbers. A control series of 17 muscle biopsies from normal subjects and patients with non-inflammatory myopathies and neurogenic conditions was also studied: the numbers of mononuclear cells present were much smaller than in polymyositis, but the ratio of T 4 :T 8 lymphocytes {{was similar to that}} found in biopsies affected by polymyositis. We conclude that both cytotoxic-suppressor <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and macrophages are important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathy...|$|R
