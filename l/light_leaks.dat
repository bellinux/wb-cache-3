Furthermore, some gloves can detect finger bending {{with a high degree}} of accuracy (5-10 degrees), or even provide haptic feedback to the user, which is a simulation of the sense of touch. The first commercially available hand-tracking glove-type device was the DataGlove, a glove-type device which could detect hand position, movement and finger bending. This uses fiber optic cables running down the back of the hand. Light pulses are created and when the fingers are bent, <b>light</b> <b>leaks</b> through small cracks and the loss is registered, giving an approximation of the hand pose.|$|E
50|$|One {{frequent}} {{source of}} <b>light</b> <b>leaks</b> in 35 mm cameras {{is around the}} film door due to degrading foam. Replacing the foam is a simple matter. Medium format system cameras or large format cameras may have leaks between their various interchangeable parts or in old leather bellows. Electrical tape {{is often used to}} repair <b>light</b> <b>leaks</b> in these cases.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the internal flat field {{behavior of the}} WFC 3 /IR channel using data obtained during the Servicing Mission Observatory Verification (SMOV) for Program 11433. The detector was illuminated to a high signal level through each filter using the Tungsten 2 lamp. Comparison of the resulting flat field images to those collected during ground testing reveals similar illumination patterns, {{and an increase in}} the Tungsten lamp flux of 6 - 10 %. Signal rates show that the lamp’s irradiance was constant to within 0. 5 % during these observations. These data show that the on-orbit internal flats can be used to update the calibration flat field images. Roughly 30 % of the observations associated with this proposal were contaminated by a <b>light</b> <b>leak</b> while HST was pointed at the Earth.

50|$|The Holga's {{low-cost}} {{construction and}} simple meniscus lens often yields pictures that display vignetting, blur, <b>light</b> <b>leaks,</b> and other distortions.

As of November 2015, Production has been ceased on this camera.|$|E
50|$|While most {{professional}} medium-format cameras are very expensive, some inexpensive plastic imports, such as Diana and Holga, are gaining in popularity, particularly with toy camera enthusiasts. Many of these cameras are sold through the Austrian Lomographische AG. Due {{to the poor}} quality of the cameras, the exact image captured on the negative is somewhat random in nature. These cameras often have plastic lenses that offer poor or uneven focus, <b>light</b> <b>leaks</b> that oddly colorize an image, extreme vignetting, and a multitude of other attributes that are generally undesirable to photographers. While these elements certainly are flaws {{from the point of}} view of camera design, they can produce interesting, artistic, or enjoyable results. Because of the popularity of lomography and toy camera culture, medium-format photography has seen a resurgence with amateur photographers. Twin-lens reflex cameras (TLRs) and folders without the distortion and <b>light</b> <b>leaks</b> can be purchased on the used market in the same price range.|$|E

Tolkowsky's calculations included neither a culet nor a girdle. However, a girdle is required in reality in order to prevent the diamond from easily chipping in the setting.

5000|$|A <b>light</b> <b>leak</b> is a hole or gap in {{the body}} of a camera, or other optical instrument, where light is able to [...] "leak" [...] into the {{normally}} light-tight chamber, exposing the film or sensor with extra light. This light is diffuse, although parts within the camera may cast shadows or reflect it in a particular way. For most purposes this is considered a problem. Within the lomography movement it is seen as a positive effect, giving photos character.|$|R
5000|$|In place, {{the dark}} slide is {{in a film}} holder or magazine. Film holders usually refer to cut sheet film and {{magazines}} refer to roll film. Vintage film holders were made of wood and held in place either photo-sensitized plates or photo sensitive film. In either case, the construction must be such to reduce <b>light</b> <b>leaks,</b> or any unwanted light from striking the film until the holder is {{held in place by}} a camera and considered [...] "light tight". Some holders held only one piece of light sensitive material, some are double sided and hold two pieces of film.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to Eastman Kodak's {{concept of}} the [...] "Kodak moment", the {{philosophy}} behind Lomography is summarized in its motto, [...] "Don’t Think, Just Shoot." [...] This motto is accompanied by The Ten Golden Rules which are supposed to encourage spontaneity and the taking of photographs anywhere, while minimizing considerations of formal technique. Typical Lomography cameras are deliberately low-fidelity and of simple construction. Some cameras make use of multiple lenses and rainbow-colored flashes; some exhibit extreme optical distortions and <b>light</b> <b>leaks.</b> The intention of the lomographic style is one of acceptance of such deficiencies {{in order to create}} images with a unique character.|$|E

50|$|A paper {{published}} in 2006 by Profs. Alfons Stahlhofen and Günter Nimtz described an experiment which sent {{a beam of}} microwaves towards a pair of prisms.
