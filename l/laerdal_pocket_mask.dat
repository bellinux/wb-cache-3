50|$|The <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> {{is a small}} {{device that}} can be carried on one's person. Air is {{administered}} to the patient when the emergency responder exhales through a one-way filter valve. Modern <b>pocket</b> <b>masks</b> have either a built in one-way valve or an attachable, disposable filter to protect the emergency responder from the patient's potentially infectious bodily substances, such as vomit or blood.|$|R
50|$|While a <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> {{is not as}} {{efficient}} as a bag valve mask, it does have its advantages when only one rescuer is available. As suggested by its name, the <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> benefits from a somewhat easier portability {{when compared to the}} bag valve mask. Also, in contrast to the bag valve mask, which requires two hands to operate (one to form a seal and the other to squeeze the bag), the <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> allows for both of the rescuer's hands to be on the patients head. This hand placement provides a superior seal on the patient's face, and allows the responder to perform a jaw thrust on patients suspected of a spinal injury.|$|R

40|$|Athletic {{health care}} {{professionals}} have been concerned about how to optimize the emergency care the cervical spine-injured football player receives on the field. Much of the discussion has centered on how to best expose and prepare the airway for rescue breathing in the quickest and safest manner possible. This study compared the time required and the extraneous motion induced at the cervical spine during three traditional and one new airway exposure and preparation technique. Twelve subjects wearing football helmets and shoulder pads were exposed to multiple trials of airway exposure via face mask repositioning using a manual screwdriver, power screwdriver, and the Trainer's Angel cutting device. Subjects also underwent airway preparation using the <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> insertion technique. Cervical spine motion was measured in two dimensions using an optoelectronic motion analysis system. Time and qualitative assessment were obtained through videotape analysis. Significant {{differences were found between}} the techniques with respect to time and cervical spine motion. The <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> allowed quicker activation of rescue breathing than the other three traditional techniques. There was no significant difference in the amount of extraneous motion induced at the cervical spine between the <b>pocket</b> <b>mask,</b> manual screwdriver, and power screwdriver techniques. The Trainer's Angel induced significantly more motion than the other three techniques in each of the four motions measured. Changes in traditional protocols used to treat cervical spine-injured football players on the field are recommended based on these data...|$|R
50|$|Patients who {{are unable}} to breathe on their own will require {{positive}} pressure to move oxygen into their lungs for gaseous exchange to take place. Systems for delivering this vary in complexity (and cost), starting with a basic <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> adjunct which can be used by a basically trained first aider to manually deliver artificial respiration with supplemental oxygen delivered through a port in the mask.|$|R
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of artificial respiration can be greatly increased by the simultaneous use of oxygen therapy. The amount of oxygen {{available to the}} patient in mouth-to-mouth is around 16%. If this is done through a <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> with an oxygen flow, this increases to 40% oxygen. If either a bag valve mask or a mechanical ventilator is used with an oxygen supply, this rises to 99% oxygen. The greater the oxygen concentration, the more efficient the gaseous exchange {{will be in the}} lungs.|$|R
5000|$|Use {{of manual}} resuscitators to {{ventilate}} {{a patient is}} frequently called [...] "bagging" [...] the patient [...] and is regularly necessary in medical emergencies when the patient's breathing is insufficient (respiratory failure) or has ceased completely (respiratory arrest). Use of the manual resuscitator force-feeds air or oxygen into the lungs in order to inflate them under pressure, thus constituting a means to manually provide positive-pressure ventilation. It is used by professional rescuers in preference to mouth-to-mouth ventilation, either directly or through an adjunct such as a <b>pocket</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a basic (i. e., essential) medical {{emergency}} kit suitable for a general dental practitioner varies somewhat between different authorities. A practitioner 2 ̆ 7 s choice is also dependant on the proximity of medical aid {{and the nature of}} the dental practice. Over recent years the trend has been to restrict the items to a minimum, in the interest of both common sense and safety, for example, just oxygen, adrenaline 1 : 1000, an oral carbohydrate source, glyceryl trinitrate and aspirin as first options. Ancillary equipment should include an oxygen therapy facemask, a <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> and a set of oral (Guedel) airways. Two further medication options for consideration are an aerosol bronchodilator and, in certain circumstances, an injectable antihypoglycaemic agent. This paper provides a selective overview of the subject. An absolute necessity is for dentists to be competent in Basic Life Support skills, and to maintain a complete and current medical history for all patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The CAREvent((R)) Public Access Resuscitator (PAR, O-Two Medical Technologies, Ontario, Canada) {{is a new}} oxygen-driven device {{alternating}} two ventilations with 15 prompts for chest compressions. The PAR {{is designed}} for use with a standard resuscitation face mask and is equipped with mask leakage and obstruction alarms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the quality of basic life support (BLS) by hospital nurses and to evaluate if BLS with the PAR is better than BLS using the mouth-to-mask technique. Methods: The study group consisted of 352 nurses from Ghent University Hospital working outside the critical care and emergency departments. BLS skills were measured using a Laerdal Skillreporter manikin (Laerdal, Norway) connected to a Laerdal PC Skillreporting system. To assess base line skills, 200 nurses were tested without previous notice in single rescuer BLS using a <b>pocket</b> <b>mask</b> (PM, <b>Laerdal,</b> Norway) or a bag-valve mask device (Laerdal, Norway) over a period of 2 min. A separate consecutive sample of 152 nurses was randomised to the PM or PAR groups after a standard BLS refresher course. The PAR group received a short period of training in PAR use. Immediately after training,, both groups performed the 2 min single rescuer BLS test. Results: Unprepared nurses achieved only 26 compressions and 3 ventilations/min. Immediately after training, nurses using the PAR delivered 54 compressions/min as opposed to 35 for the PM group (p < 0. 0001). PAR users ventilated six times/min compared to five times for PM users (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Immediately after training, the use of the PAR improved BLS performance by ward nurses significantly, bringing the number of ventilations and compressions per minute close to the theoretical maximum achievable within the current guidelines. Retention tests after 6 and 12 months will show if the effect is sustained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Compared {{to other}} industries, {{the service and}} {{hospitality}} industries employ {{a greater proportion of}} low-skill and part-time employees. Those workers generally earn less pay than do skilled or full-time workers. Thus, the hospitality industry 2 ̆ 7 s supposed low pay may actually reflect the low-skill nature of much of the work and perhaps <b>mask</b> <b>pockets</b> of highly paid positions. For this reason, it would be informative to compare pay levels of jobs according to the jobs 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). If the hospitality industry pays less for given levels of KSAs than do other industries, then the hospitality industry justly could be labeled as low-paying. On the other hand, if the hospitality industry pays an amount similar to that of other industries for particular KSAs, one could argue that the perception of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s offering relatively low pay is inaccurate...|$|R
5000|$|The {{day before}} the wedding of Elise (Amy Adams) and Michael (Adam Garcia) in Los Angeles, their friends from college gather to attend the {{bachelor}} and bachelorette parties and then the ceremony the following day. Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) are the best man and maid of honor, and themselves a couple, although Rich is wary {{at the idea of}} marriage, while Samantha is pushing him to consider it, while hiding her pregnancy from him. Sam Malone (Jon Abrahams), nicknamed [...] "Pockets" [...] because he can always find the right item in his <b>pockets</b> (and to <b>mask</b> the fact that he's called like the protagonist from Cheers), is flying in from Thailand, still harboring an unrequited love for neurotic Lana (Mena Suvari) since their college days, when she broke his heart. The group also includes Quentin (Colin Hanks), a spirited film agent, and Simon Black (James Van Der Beek), a self-important movie star who shows up in the company of Franklin Brauner (Roger Avary), director of his next project, described as [...] "a metaphysical western, sort of El Topo meets The Matrix". Jennifer (Lauren German), who comes from London, was Elise's one-time girlfriend in college, is still in love with her and tries to prevent her from marrying Michael. During the day, Michael's estranged father Jonathan (Xander Berkeley) also shows up, hoping in a reconciliation, but is rebuffed.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{survey results}} regarding opinions {{and attitudes of}} the 18 - 60 y. o. Hungarian population concerning tax evasion and corruption, while it also examines the actual and intended behavior of the economically most active {{segment of the population}} concerning these matters, and explores the socio-demographic factors determining this behavior. After presenting some basic sample characteristics, we investigate the scope and prevalence of hidden employment (both unreported employment and employment masked as contract with a subcontractor), its underlying social and economic factors and the main reasons behind accepting or turning down work offers in the hidden economy. Our results suggest that the selection of the particular form of tax sparing employment, i. e. the choice between accepting unreported employment (receiving unreported wage directly into one's own <b>pocket)</b> and employment <b>masked</b> as pretended subcontracting 2 ̆ 01 d is determined by the worker's socio-economic background to a great extent. Accepting unreported employment (unreported wage) is more prevalent amongst those {{on the periphery of the}} labor market, while pretended subcontracting 2 ̆ 01 d occurs more frequently amongst graduates and those working in public administration, health care, education and culture. We also investigate to what extent the respondents engage in purchasing products and services form the hidden economy. Men purchase from the black economy more often then women, and those living in Budapest also buy products and services there (thus evading VAT payments) more frequently than the rest of the population. Although one would probably expect that members of families with low income engage in unreported transactions more frequently than the others, our results do not support this hypothesis. We also look at the reactions of respondents to hypothetical situations in which reliance on tax evasion and/or corruption seemingly offer a relatively easy and favorable solution. Answers to questions on such hypothetic situations can serve as a control to our results on actual behavior. Those who estimate the share of population receiving income from the hidden economy higher in their neigborhood would be more likely to rely on illegal but economically favorable solutions (such as tax evasion or corruption) ...|$|R
