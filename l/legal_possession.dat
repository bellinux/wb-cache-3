[...] However, Oregon marijuana law is further complicated due {{to the existence of}} Oregon's medical marijuana program. [...] The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program allows individuals with a medical history of one or more qualifying illnesses and a doctor's recommendation to apply for registration with the program. [...] Accepted applicants are issued a Medical Marijuana Card, which entitles them to different treatment under the law. [...] Essentially, medical marijuana patients are allowed to possess, without fear of citation, arrest, or penalty, up to 1.5 pounds of marijuana at a time. [...] Possession of a greater amount, however, does become punishable by law. [...] In addition to <b>legal</b> <b>possession,</b> cardholders may also legally grow, without fear of citation, arrest, or penalty, up to 18 immature cannabis plants and 6 mature ones at a single time. [...] Cardholders are also allowed to designate a primary caregiver and a grower of their choice, if so inclined. [...] These people enjoy the same freedoms, in regard to possession, as the cardholder as long as they remain officially registered. [...] The above limits of <b>legal</b> <b>possession</b> apply to the total combined property of the cardholder, caregiver, and grower. [...] If a grower is growing plants for more than one cardholder, he or she may possess up to 18 immature plants per cardholder. [...] A grower may not grow plants for more than four cardholders at a time. [...] Also, in addition to <b>legal</b> <b>possession</b> and manufacture as outlined above, cardholders, caregivers, and growers may legally deliver marijuana to each other, and to other cardholders, so long as the delivery is made without consideration. [...] The privileges which normally protect cardholders, caregivers, and growers from citation, arrest, and penalty do not excuse possession, manufacture, or delivery in cases where they are simultaneously guilty of certain offenses listed in ORS 475.316, such as driving under the influence of marijuana or using marijuana in public.|$|E

[...] Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not receive any publishing royalties, and he made strenuous efforts to block the single's release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as Don and Phil Everly themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. Nevertheless, from 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other writers to avoid paying royalties to Acuff-Rose.

He also obtained possession of other sites around Acre related to Bahá'u'lláh's life, including the House of `Abbud. Around Haifa, he expanded the Shrine of the Báb by developing its golden-domed superstructure, and purchased lands surrounding the Shrine in order to create gardens. Shoghi Effendi had also decided that the buildings housing the institutions of the religion indicated in Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet of Carmel, including the Universal House of Justice, the as yet unestablished governing body of the worldwide Bahá'í community, would be arranged in the shape of an arc surrounded by gardens. The fulcrum of this arc would be the Monument Gardens, which hold the graves of members of the Bahá'í holy family. During his own lifetime he started the construction of one of the buildings comprising the arc, the International Archives building. He also negotiated tax-exempt status for all Baha'i properties. The religion's situation in Israel was clarified in an agreement signed in 1987 by then Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, in which the government formally acknowledged the Bahá'í Faith as a “recognized religious community in Israel,” declared its “friendly relations” with the Bahá’í world community, noted that the “holiest places of the Bahá’í Faith, … are located in Israel,” and confirmed “that the Universal House of Justice is the Trustee of the Bahá’í International Community over the Holy Places of the Bahá’í Faith in Israel and over the Bahá’í endowments in Israel.” ...|$|E

General Clavering claimed the office to which he ought to succeed, and Mr. Francis adhered to him: Mr. Barwell stuck to Mr. Hastings. The two parties assembled separately, and everything was running fast into a confusion which suspended government, and might very probably have ended in a civil war, had not the judges of the Supreme Court, on a reference to them, settled the controversy by deciding that the resignation was an invalid act, and that Mr. Hastings was still in the <b>legal</b> <b>possession</b> of his place, which had been actually filled up in England.
