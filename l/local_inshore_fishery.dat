40|$|A social {{study of}} the shrimp {{fisheries}} of Galveston Bay, Tex., and Calcasieu Lake, La., was made {{during the summer of}} 1987 to examine the impacts of the seasonal closure of the Federal waters off Texas and to understand the infrastructure and demographic processes of these two diverse fisheries. Survey instruments were administered to 159 shrimp boat captains: 89 from Galveston Bay and 70 from Calcasieu Lake. Shrimp-house owners were interviewed in each region as well. The results suggest that the <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> (i. e., shrimpers and shrimp houses) are distinct from the offshore fisheries. The infrastructure of the two <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> examined differ in that the market distribution of shrimp from Galveston Bay was more diffuse than from Calcasieu Lake. Much more of the shrimp harvested from Galveston Bay was channelled into the surrounding community than from Calcasieu Lake. The distribution of age,years as a commercial fisherman, and family involvement in fishing suggest that participation in Calcasieu Lake's and Galveston Bay's <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> have expanded concurrent with declining economies. While overall the Texas closure had little impact on either of the <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries,</b> the Galveston Bay shrimpers experienced more of a direct impact on their livelihood than Calcasieu Lake shrimpers...|$|R

40|$|Public {{participation}} {{is a key}} ingredient of good governance {{and there are many}} advantages of involving stakeholders in the decision-making process. The European Commission identified the lack of stakeholder involvement as one of the major weaknesses of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). As such, the 2002 Reform of the CFP aimed to improve its system of governance by increasing the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making. Over the last decade, Scottish inshore waters have seen an increase in management measures focused on involving fishers, delegating responsibilities and decentralizing management. The present document investigates commercial inshore fishers' perceptions of participation in the decision-making process and attitudes towards a new management regime - the <b>Inshore</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Groups (IFGs) - which aims to increase participation in and decentralization of <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> management. A survey was conducted, through face-to-face interviews, and ordered logistic and multiple regression models created to identify which characteristics influence fishers' perceptions and attitudes. The present analysis concluded that, 5 years subsequent to the reform of the CFP, the majority of inshore fishers perceive themselves not to be consulted or involved in the decision-making process. However, {{and despite the fact that}} fishers are not completely certain of the potential of the IFGs to increase their participation in the management process, they have an overall positive attitude towards their implementation.
