40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} voltage on rise time and <b>light</b> <b>output</b> from incandescent brake lamps {{for a range of}} voltages representing realistic values for large trucks. The findings indicate that, relative to nominal voltage of 12. 8 V, realistic voltages for large trucks lead to significant increases in rise time and to decreases in <b>light</b> <b>output.</b> At 9 V, for example, 90 % of the asymptotic <b>light</b> <b>output</b> is reached about 113 ms later than at 12. 8 V, and the asymptotic <b>light</b> <b>output</b> is about 28 % of the output at 12. 8 V. Analogous comparisons of 6 V with 12. 8 V indicate an increase in the rise time to 90 % of asymptotic <b>light</b> <b>output</b> of about 316 ms and a decrease in asymptotic <b>light</b> <b>output</b> to about 5 %. The changes obtained in rise time and <b>light</b> <b>output</b> of incandescent lamps as a function of voltage are of practical importance because they can be expected to increase following drivers' reaction times to brake signals and to increase the frequency of missed signals...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 14) This {{study examined}} the effect that hydrophobic treatment of glass headlamp lenses has on <b>light</b> <b>output</b> when headlamps are exposed to contaminants under naturalistic driving conditions. The hypothesis, a priori, was that the water-repelling nature of a glass surface after hydrophobic treatment would aid in minimizing the adhesion, or promote the removal, of contaminants on the lens, thereby leaving <b>light</b> <b>output</b> less affected. Additional variables of interest included the presence of precipitation, {{the side of the}} vehicle the headlamp was on, and whether the headlamp was illuminated during the exposure. The study examined vehicles with glass lenses installed as intended by the vehicle manufacturer. The vehicles were driven on a 155 -km route under conditions of active precipitation or no precipitation, and with or without the headlamps on. Subsequent to each drive, measurements of <b>light</b> <b>output</b> were made at eight key test points in the headlamp beam pattern. The headlamps were then cleaned and measured again. In this way, each headlamp served as its own control. The results indicate that hydrophobic treatment of glass headlamp lenses did not affect <b>light</b> <b>output.</b> However, the presence of precipitation did result in decreased <b>light</b> <b>output</b> below the horizontal cutoff of the beam pattern and increased <b>light</b> <b>output</b> above the horizontal cutoff.
