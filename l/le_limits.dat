40|$|A new {{attempt is}} {{demonstrated}} that QFTs can be UV finite {{if they are}} viewed as the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory (complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the modern standard point of view. This approach is much simpler in principle and in technology comparing to any known renormalization program. Some subtle and difficult issues can be easily resolved. The importance of the procedure for defining the ambiguities is fully appreciated in the new approach. Some simple but important nonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and plausibility of the new approach. Now, {{it has become a}} standard point of view that a fundamental theory (well defined in every aspect) underlies the present QFTs that are in fact low energy (LE) effective theories for the phenomena in LE ranges [1]. But as far as the author knows, we are still lacking a formulation that can yield finite results in a natural way making use of this point of view. Here I would like to present a new approach directly based on this principle [2]. In this point of view, all the Feynman amplitudes (FAs) or the various Green functions given by a present QFT should correspond to the <b>LE</b> <b>limits</b> of certain subset of the well-defined ’Green functions ’ given by the underlying theory. Employing a generating functional or path integral formalism [3] to assemble these Green functions for each of the subsets, the true formulation should be Z 0 ({J i {∫}; · · ·) ≡ L{σ} Dµ(φ i {σ}) exp{iS(φi {σ}; {Ji}...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{evaluated}} {{the possibility of}} using data extracted from Smart Eye tracking pro les for the task of driver identi cation in near-IR videos using face recognition techniques. Two texture-based methods are presented to solve this task. The rst method utilizes local binary patterns (LBP) combined with local discriminant analysis (LDA) to identify subjects whilst the second method investigates brute-force template matching for identi cation purposes. The LBP-method was evaluated for both closed-set and open-set identi cation and achieved good results. In the closed-set scenario, a recognition rate of 98 % was reached on our own data set of 47 videos containing 24 di erent subjects, {{despite the fact that the}} subjects had modi ed their appearances in half of the videos. The LBP-method is fast and our results demonstrates the LBP-method's ability to handle partial facial occulusions and appearance variations. The tem- plate matching method showed decent results with a peak recognition rate of 81 % in the closed-set scenario. However, the method proved very time-consuming due to large number of templates in the pro <b>les,</b> <b>limiting</b> the method's viability in real-time applications. Future re nements and extensions are proposed for both methods...|$|R

For such nonregular models, standard asymptotic distribution theory does not apply.

5000|$|The Saturn line is {{constructed}} of maple and walnut (the oldest lines {{were made of}} basswood instead of walnut). The kit {{is constructed}} of 6 plies of wood for a shell thickness of 5.1 millimeters. It shares a number of options with both the Mars and Orion line, but is not available with birdseye maple plies. Saturn kits {{come in a variety}} of lacquer and wrap finishes (including bursts, sparkles and fades) and come with the option of black or chrome hardware. The Saturn has become very popular, as the thinner hybrid shells provide a lower/warmer/darker fundamental tone than similar all-maple shells. Although they are priced as midrange drums, they are considered a fully professional kit and used by recording artists such as Chris Adler from Lamb of God, who recently switched over to the new Black Panther line of drums. During 2011 and 2012 Mapex also offered the Saturn <b>LE</b> (<b>Limited</b> Edition) and Saturn SE (Special Edition) Birch/Walnut kits. Mapex built 100 Limited Edition kits only, and a limited number of the SE kits as well. According to the Mapex site as of March 2013, the Special Edition Saturn Birch/Walnut was an extension and addition to the distinctive Saturn sound. Mapex had taken the rich sonic characteristics of walnut and combined them with the bright and articulate punch of birch. The result is a drum shell that projects the perfect fusion of depth and clarity. The five-piece shell pack was available in Ocean Wave Fade, Moss Green, Wine Burst, or Walnut Fade over Figured Maple and is appointed with smoky black hardware. The relative rarity of the LE and SE kits is increasing their value and they are some of the finest Saturn kits ever made.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a {{class of}} dynamic {{voluntary}} contribution games in a setting with discounting and neoclassical payoffs (differentiable, strictly concave in the public good, and quasilinear in the private good). An achievable pro <b>le</b> is the <b>limit</b> point of a subgame perfect equilibrium path – the ultimate cumulative contribution vector of the players. A pro le is shown to be achievable {{only if it is}} in the undercore of the underlying coalitional game, i. e., the pro le cannot be blocked by a coalition using a component-wise smaller pro le. Conversely, if free-riding incentives are strong enough that contributing zero is a dominant strategy in the stage games, then any undercore pro <b>le</b> is the <b>limit</b> of achievable pro les as the period length shrinks. Thus, in this case when the period length is very short, (i) the set of achievable contributions does not depend on whether the players can move simultaneously or only in a round-robin fashion; (ii) an ef cient pro le can be approximately achieved if and only if it is in the core of the underlying coalitional game; and (iii) any achievable pro le can be achieved almost instantly...|$|R

5000|$|Measured in millihenries (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large <b>Le</b> values <b>limit</b> the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a sliding inductor core, increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|R

2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. This poor combustion in the trailing side of chamber {{is one of the}} reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in a Wankel's exhaust stream. A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system.
