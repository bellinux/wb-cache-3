5|$|Both ships served {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they {{operated}} against Russian {{forces in the}} Black Sea. They were primarily tasked with supporting Ottoman forces ashore, though Muin-i Zafer also helped to defend the port of Sulina. After the war, both vessels were placed in reserve, and saw no further activity until 1897, when they were mobilized {{at the start of}} the Greco-Turkish War. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman fleet, both ships were in poor condition and were unable to be used offensively.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where Lüft-ü Celil was sunk by a Russian {{artillery}} battery on the Danube. Hifz-ur Rahman engaged Russian minelayers {{at the mouth}} of the Danube but otherwise saw little action. She survived the war and was laid up for the following twenty years. She was mobilized at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman fleet, was in poor condition. The ship was eventually sold in 1909 and broken up.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, Indiana, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation, was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana. Urbanization declined. Governor Paul V. McNutt's administration struggled to build from scratch a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were cut drastically {{in response to the}} Depression. The state government was completely reorganized. McNutt also enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law {{to put an end to}} worker strikes.|$|E

As a result, the fleet was kept safely behind the Dardanelles forts and it saw no action. The ship remained in service for another decade until she was decommissioned in 1909; she was sold in November that year to ship breakers and thereafter dismantled.|$|E

Conversely, Riku battles Zexion and Lexaeus, Vexen's allies. Ansem also appears in Riku's story as an entity that attempts to control Riku.

Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E

About one month before the pilot aired, a focus group report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was leaked to the media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was not ready for prime-time television. The pilot episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
