However, since the tone <b>split</b> <b>dating</b> from Middle Chinese still depends on the voicing of the initial consonant, these constitute just three phonemic tones.

The high register includes the first, third, fourth and sixth tone with the second, fifth and seventh tone in the low register.|$|R

50|$|Having {{both the}} date and time of day in the same {{dimension}}, may easily result in a huge dimension with millions of rows. If a high amount of detail is needed it is usually {{a good idea to}} <b>split</b> <b>date</b> and time into two or more separate dimensions. A time dimension with a grain of seconds in a day will only have 86400 rows. A more or less detailed grain for date/time dimensions can be chosen depending on needs. As examples, date dimensions can be accurate to year, quarter, month or day and time dimensions can be accurate to hours, minutes or seconds.|$|R

We provide Monte Carlo evidence that our bootstrap-based inference is valid. The in-sample, and the sample split invariant out-of-sample mean and maximum tests that we propose, are in broad agreement. Finally we demonstrate how one can construct sample split invariant out-of-sample predictability tests that simultaneously control for data mining across many variables...|$|R

50|$|Wenzhou {{has three}} phonemic tones. While it has eight phonetic tones, {{most of these}} are predictable: The yin-yang tone <b>split</b> <b>dating</b> from Middle Chinese still {{corresponds}} to the voicing of the initial consonant in Wenzhou, and the shang tones are abrupt and end in glottal stop (this has been used as evidence for a similar situation independently posited for Old Chinese). The ru tones, however, are unusual in being distinct despite having lost their final stops; in addition, the vowel has lengthened, and the tone has become more complex than the other tones (though some speakers may simplify them to low falling or rising tones).|$|R
