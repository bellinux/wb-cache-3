40|$|Airborne Gamma Spectrometry (AGS) is {{well suited}} to the mapping of {{radioactivity}} in the environment. Flight parameters (e. g. speed and <b>line</b> <b>spacing)</b> directly affect the rate of area coverage, cost, and data quality of any survey. The influences of <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> have been investigated for data from inter‐tidal, coastal and upland environments {{with a range of}} 137 Cs activity concentrations and depositional histories. Estimates of the integrated 137 Cs activity (‘inventory’) within specified areas and the shapes of depositional features were calculated for subsets of the data at different line spacings. Features with dimensions greater than the <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> show variations in inventory and area of less than 3 %, and features with dimensions less than the <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> show larger variations and a decreased probability of detection. The choice of <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> for a task is dependent on the dimensions of the features of interest and required edge definition. Options for <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> for different tasks are suggested. It is noted that for regional mapping, even 5 – 10 km <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> can produce useful data...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} question {{discussed in}} this dissertation {{is the problem of}} characterizing the linear and convex functions on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> A linear function is shown to be a convex function. The linear and convex functions are characterized, that is, a function f:[right arrow] X? is linear [convex] if and only if f[subscript l] is linear [convex] in the usual sense on each line of a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space</b> X. We prove that if a function has at least one support at each point on its graph, then it is a convex function. In the first chapter the basic concepts of abstract convexity spaces are introduced. The next chapter is concerned with join systems which are shown to be examples of abstract convexity spaces. On the other hand, a domain-finite, join-hull commutative abstract convexity space with regular straight segments satisfies the axioms of a join system. Consequently, such abstract convexity spaces satisfy the separation property. In Chapter III, the linearization of abstract spaces is done using a linearization family. The following chapter is on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> and graphically it is shown that Pasch?s and Peano's axioms do not hold in a certain generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> It is also proved that the separation property may not hold, in general, in a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> Finally, the convex and linear functions are studied on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> The linearization of generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> is done by means of the properties of a linearization family...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{meet the}} {{performance}} {{test for the}} confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) accurately in some specific application occasions, the spatial resolution imaging principle of confocal laser scanning microscope was analyzed theoretically. And the micron <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> as the measurement standard has tried to investigate the lateral resolution of CLSM in experiment. The value range of the lateral resolution was calculated by the fluctuation state of the output light intensity signal when there is the lateral movement between the objective with sample. At the same time, some reasons for spatial resolution are also been evaluated in theory. Experiments demonstrate that if {{the value of the}} <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> standard is closer to the spatial resolution of CLSM, the standard can be utilized to test the spatial resolution. So we can use a a series of <b>lines</b> <b>spacing</b> standards with different <b>lines</b> <b>spacing</b> values to test the serial effective resolution. And in our experiment, we only measured <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> standard with 8 µm line width and 100 µm line pitch with many times by CLSM, and the spatial resolution of the CLSM is obtained about more minimal than 0. 3 µm by the scanning curves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a novel dichromatic-based method for {{estimating}} illuminant chromaticity. The proposed method is essentially based on the Dichromatic Slope and Dichromatic <b>Line</b> <b>Space</b> that we introduce. Dichromatic slope is {{the slope of the}} dichromatic line that passes the image chromaticity of a pixel in chromaticity space. It is specularity-invariant and can be computed for each pixel. Accordingly, each pixel can be projected into a three-dimensional dichromatic <b>line</b> <b>space</b> defined in terms of image chromaticity and dichromatic slope. Reliable dichromatic lines can then be obtained by detecting local maxima in dichromatic <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> Illuminant chromaticity is easily estimated by finding the intersections of the resulting dichromatic lines. The proposed method has some advantages. It does not require precise color segmentation, and therefore, can deal with highly textured images. In addition, the proposed method does not suffer from nearly parallel dichromatic lines and it can estimate artificial illuminant chromaticity. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{watermarking}} electronic text documents that contain justified paragraphs and irregular <b>line</b> <b>spacing.</b> The proposed method uses a spread-spectrum technique {{to combat the}} effects of irregular word or <b>line</b> <b>spacing.</b> It also uses a BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) error coding technique to protect the payload from the noise resulting from the printing and scanning process. Watermark embedding in a justified paragraph is achieved by slightly increasing or decreasing the spaces between words according {{to the value of}} the corresponding watermark bit. Similarly, watermark embedding in a text document with variable <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> is achieved by slightly increasing or decreasing the distance between any two adjacent lines according to the value of the watermark bit. Detecting the watermark is achieved by measuring the spaces between the words or the lines and correlating them with the spreading sequence. In this paper, we present an implementation of the proposed algorithm and discuss its simulation results...|$|R

30|$|It is not {{surprising}} that optimal nanofiber generation was observed at the smallest <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> of 0.025  mm. Since the laser diameter is theoretically very close to the size of this <b>line</b> <b>spacing,</b> little to no area is left that does not come into direct contact with the laser. This results in a more heated region and the plume density is kept stable for a longer period. This further increases the overall light absorption of the sample due to the change in topography. By creating a fiber network, the surface area increases and therefore all the mechanisms directly linked to area are enhanced.|$|R
