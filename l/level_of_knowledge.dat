25|$|Developmental psychology, and {{especially}} the psychology of cognitive development, opens a special perspective for educational psychology. This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge {{on a number of}} crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> they can assimilate, which, in turn, {{can be used as a}} frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why Piaget's theory of cognitive development was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education. In the same direction, the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and working memory capacities that characterize successive age levels.|$|E

Current research indicates that the majority of dental practitioners have low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the physical signs of an eating disorder and are usually not engaging in eating disorder specific secondary prevention practices. The present study extended these findings and examined skills essential to secondary prevention practices; namely, the ability to identify the physical signs of an eating disorder and the ability to communicate findings to the patient or another healthcare professional. Using an online survey, students and practitioners in dentistry and dental hygiene professions from the Pacific Northwest completed demographic information and assessments <b>of</b> their <b>knowledge</b> and communication skills regarding eating disorders. Results confirmed previous findings that the majority of dental practitioners hold low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the oral and physical manifestations of eating disorders.

Teachers or learners with different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> can access the platform and highlight portions of textual content which are deemed as particularly relevant.

However, highlights are often incomplete or unsuitable for learners with different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> This paper addresses the problem of predicting new highlights of partly highlighted electronic learning documents. With the goal of enriching teaching content with additional features, text classification techniques are exploited to automatically analyze portions of documents enriched with manual highlights made by users with different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and to generate ad hoc prediction models. Then, the generated models are applied to the remaining content to suggest highlights. To improve the quality of the learning experience, learners may explore highlights generated by models tailored to different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> We tested the prediction system on real and benchmark documents highlighted by domain experts and we compared the performance of various classifiers in generating highlights. The achieved results demonstrated the high accuracy of the predictions and the applicability of the proposed approach to real teaching documents...|$|R
