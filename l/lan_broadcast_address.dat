50|$|A <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is {{an address}} that allows {{information}} {{to be sent to}} all interfaces in a given subnet, rather than a specific machine. Generally, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is found by obtaining the bit complement of the subnet mask and performing a bitwise OR operation with the network identifier. In other words, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is the last address in the address range of the subnet. For example, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> for the network 192.168.5.0 is 192.168.5.255. For networks of size /24 or larger, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> always ends in 255.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{conflict}} between network <b>addresses</b> and <b>broadcast</b> <b>addresses</b> arose because some software used non-standard <b>broadcast</b> <b>addresses</b> with zeros instead of ones.|$|R
50|$|In {{networks}} {{smaller than}} /24, <b>broadcast</b> <b>addresses</b> {{do not necessarily}} end with 255. For example, a CIDR subnet 203.0.113.16/28 has the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> 203.0.113.31.|$|R
50|$|A Layer 2 {{technique}} {{that allow for}} the coexistence of multiple <b>LAN</b> <b>broadcast</b> domains, interconnected via trunks using the IEEE 802.1Q trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).|$|R
30|$|BSs in IEEE 802.16 {{standard}} are configured {{to belong}} to one or various neighborhoods within the network topology. Each BS may receive channel information related to their neighboring BSs over the backbone network. Each BS, similar to access point balises in wireless <b>LAN,</b> <b>broadcasts</b> the network topology relative to its neighborhood using the MOB_NBR_ADV message. A BS may belong {{to more than one}} neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|A <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is {{a logical}} address at which all devices {{connected}} to a multiple-access communications network are enabled to receive datagrams. A message sent to a <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is typically received by all network-attached hosts, rather than by a specific host.|$|R
5000|$|Packets {{sent to the}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>address,</b> all one bits, are {{received}} by all stations on a local area network. In hexadecimal the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> would be FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. A broadcast frame is flooded and is forwarded to and accepted by all other nodes.|$|R
5000|$|In Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) networks, <b>broadcast</b> <b>addresses</b> {{are special}} {{values in the}} host-identification part of an IP address. The all-ones value was {{established}} in [...] as the standard <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> for networks that support broadcast. This method of using the all-ones address was first proposed by R. Gurwitz and R. Hinden in 1982 (IEN-212). [...] The later introduction of subnets and Classless Inter-Domain Routing changed this slightly, so that the all-ones host address of each subnet is that subnet's <b>broadcast</b> <b>address.</b>|$|R
50|$|A special {{definition}} {{exists for}} the IP <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> 255.255.255.255. It is the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> of the zero network or 0.0.0.0, which in Internet Protocol standards stands for this network, i.e. the local network. Transmission to this address {{is limited by}} definition, {{in that it is}} never forwarded by the routers connecting the local network to other networks.|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{problem of}} pin-constrained electrowetting-ondielectric (EWOD) biochips becomes {{a serious issue}} to realize complex bio-chemical operations. Due to limited number of control pins and routing resources, {{additional}} Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing layers may be required which poten-tially raises the fabrication cost. Previous state-of-the-art work has tried to develop a framework that uses a network-flow-based method for broadcast electrodeaddressing EWOD biochips. Nevertheless, greedily merging of electrical pins in previous works is {{at high risk of}} producing unroutable design. Routability should have higher priority than pin reduction. While previous works dedicated their effort on pin reduction, we have addressed our attention on routability of <b>broadcast</b> <b>addressing.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that taking routability into consideration can even have higher pin reduction. Viewed in this light, we present ACER, a routability driven clustering algorithm followed by escape routing using integer linear programming that effectively solves both pin merging and routing in <b>broadcast</b> <b>addressing</b> framework. Our proposed algorithm does not greedily focus on pin-reduction. Instead, routability is taken into consideration through agglomerative clustering. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, our proposed algorithm can further reduce required control pins by an average of 13 % and route the design using 68 % less wirelength.
