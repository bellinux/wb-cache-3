[...] Six of the Oxford University dons were tasked with helping Bodley in refitting the library in March 1658. Duke Humfrey’s Library was refitted, and Bodley donated a number of his own books to furnish it. The library was formally re-opened on 8 November 1602 under the name “Bodleian Library” (officially Bodley's Library). [...] There were around two thousand books in the library at this time, with an ornate Benefactor's Register displayed prominently, to encourage donations.

At six o'clock the doors were opened and hundreds of enthusiastic men, women and children crowded in.

50|$|In 2009 Tejada-Herrera {{traveled}} to Lima, Peru {{where she was}} invited to create an artwork at the Peruvian National Library. Elena Tejada-Herrera was granted permission to create artworks with the librarians during their working hours. Tejada-Herrera invited the librarians to bring their hobbies to their offices, and to participate within video art pieces. Tejada-Herrera also brought an approach with which she was working for many years since her first stay in Virginia, USA. This approach consisted of working within people's homes, like in the piece Paper Animals, and One Day at the Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. The piece created within this process was Art Delivery realized with the librarian Nelly Bobbio. The resulting artwork is a video art piece with the librarian's voice over. This voice over explained the detail of her practice as a librarian while in the video she is performing a sculpture using her body and the furniture in her house. This piece features what Tejada-Herrera calls cultural exchanges, approach in which Tejada-Herrera explains her art practice to the participant who then she invites to interpret from his/her own perspective using the materials at hand. In this case the materials were the domestic furniture. The exhibition presented several video screens placed on top of wooden <b>library</b> <b>furniture.</b> There were huge amounts of shredded paper {{coming out of the}} furniture drawers on to the floor, covering big areas. The videos displayed the librarians executing their hobbies and expressing their opinions. There were librarians acting in front of the camera, singing solo and in group. There were librarians singing a serenata for a sanitation worker at the library. Another librarian sang karaoke in front of his co-workers. In a video piece a librarian was working while shredded paper covered him and his whole office. A librarian performed his normal regular duties as a librarian on a desk inside the gallery while he listened at his favorite music and Tejada-Herrera served him coffee and his favorite snacks.|$|E

40|$|Background: In our {{competing}} educational world, {{students spend}} a considerable {{part of their}} daily life, studying at <b>library</b> <b>furniture.</b> Not surprisingly, {{due to lack of}} proper anthropometric databases, these products have typically been ill fitted for the intended user populations. Objective: To verify the optimum anthropometric match of <b>library</b> <b>furniture</b> within an academic environment, through a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. Methods: 267 (120 female and 147 male) students, were subjected to 11 standard anthropometric measurements. In line with the measurements, subjective evaluations were also considered through detailed fitting trials on selected groups of participants. Results: Combinational equations defined the unacceptable furniture dimensions according to elbow and sitting popliteal heights, mainly for smaller and taller divisions of the studied population, which were systematically comparable along with subjective and objective outcomes. In brief, if we classified studied students into “small,” “medium,” and “tall” groups, the design dimensions should be altered by - 5. 1, - 2. 2, and + 1. 6 cm for chair seat height; and by - 8. 3, - 5. 4, and + 1. 1 cm for table height, for each student group, respectively. Conclusion: The furniture size to be used by Iranian students should be changed to fit their anthropometric measures. </p...|$|E

In the second part, working in a concrete problem, a case study about public libraries interior design is exposed to illustrate positioning procedures. Computer graphics techniques are used in the generation of a large range of possible locations of typical <b>library</b> <b>furniture.</b> The results are governed by sets of rules, which are introduced following functional and dimensional needs. The case of public libraries is intended to be just one example of the general system directed to locate objects in the space.
