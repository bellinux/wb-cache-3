40|$|Since {{the first}} MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) in 2011, {{there have been}} over 4, 000 MOOCs on various {{subjects}} on the Web, serving over 35 million learners. MOOCs have shown the ability to transcend time and space, democratize knowledge dissemination, and bring the best education {{in the world to}} every learner. However, the disparate distances between participants, the size of the learner population, and the heterogeneity of the learner backgrounds make it difficult for instructors to interact with learners in a timely manner, which adversely affects their learning outcome. To address these challenges, in this thesis, we propose a framework of educational content linking. By <b>linking</b> <b>pieces</b> of learning content scattered in the various course materials into an easily accessible structure, we hypothesize that this framework will guide learners and improve content navigation. Since most instruction and knowledge acquisition in MOOCs takes place when learners are surveying course materials, better content navigation may help learners find supporting information to clear up confusion and improve the learning outcome. To support our conjecture, we present end-to-end studies to investigate our framework around two research questions. We first ask, does manually generated linking improve learning? To investigate this question, we choose two STEM courses, statistics and programming language, and demonstrate how the annotation of linking among course materials can be accomplished with collaboration between course staff and online workers. With this annotation, we implement an interface that can simultaneously present learning materials and visualize the linking among them. In a large-scale user study, we observe that this interface enables users to find desired course materials more efficiently, and retain more concepts more readily. This result supports the notion that manual linking does indeed improve learning outcomes. Second, we ask, can learning content be generated using machine learning methods? For this question, we propose an automatic linking algorithm based on conditional random fields. We demonstrate that automatically generated linking can still lead to better learning, although the magnitude of the improvement over the unlinked interface is smaller. We conclude that the proposed linking framework can be implemented at scale with machine learning techniques. by Shang-Wen Li. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Abstract The {{severity}} of climatic changes threatening urban coastal areas is introducing and intensifying environmental hazards that are endangering physical safety and livelihood security. The Philippines, {{and the capital}} Manila in particular, is at extreme risk from intensifying climate change impacts, such as sea level rise and the increased frequency and intensity of storms, leading to increased runoff that quickly overwhelms existing flood infrastructure. These exacerbated risks require drastic adaptation actions than past coping strategies. One possible adaptation strategy is managed retreat, the facilitated movement of populations away from at-risk areas. Managed retreat can be conducted through resettlement, suggesting that the existing resettlement infrastructure for informal settlements in Manila could be an avenue for conducting future climate change adaptation in the city. 	This thesis assesses the feasibility of employing resettlement as a climate change adaptation strategy for low-income communities in less developed nations, using the case study of Manila, Philippines. It is written as two manuscripts, with <b>linking</b> <b>pieces</b> for clarity. The research first develops defining Principles for climate-related resettlement, and then applies them to Manila’s resettlement landscape to identify if resettlement is an appropriate climate change adaptation (CCA) strategy for the megacity. The study uses multiple research methods, including secondary data collection and analysis, and key informant interviews (n= 27) with actors involved in resettlement, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and CCA Manila. The first manuscript outlines the concept of resettlement as climate change adaptation. The review considers three literature themes surrounding resettlement: (1) climate change, (2) hazard and natural disasters (i. e. floods, hurricanes, earthquakes) and (3) economic development (i. e. dam construction, natural resource extraction). Successful resettlement planning, approaches, and lessons learned are extracted to identify 5 Principles for resettlement in a climate change context: Proactivity, Communication and Participation, Permanence, Compensation, and Livelihood Protection. The results of the analysis suggest these 5 Principles are appropriate as a guideline for implementing resettlement as climate change adaptation for low-income and informal communities in less developed nations. Ultimately, these recommendations {{can be used to}} assess the feasibility of employing resettlement as managed retreat in less developed nations. 	The second manuscript assesses the feasibility of using resettlement as structured by the 5 Principles as CCA in Manila, Philippines. Using data from key informant interviews (KII) with resettlement, CCA, and DRR professionals, this research addresses the topic in three phases. First, it investigates the role of resettlement in existing CCA and DRR priorities and projects to understand if movement from environmental hazards is already occurring. Next, the research gathers interviewee perspectives on the applicability of the 5 Principles in relation to Manila’s existing resettlement landscape, and identifies any amendments or foreseen challenges to them. Finally, it explores the perceptions of resettlement, DRR, and CCA actors on the feasibility of employing resettlement as CCA in Manila, including any challenges that may impede the strategy. The findings suggest that there are some existing infrastructure that could be enhanced to include CCA planning as identified by the 5 Principles, such as in-city relocation sites and vertical housing. Poverty is the greatest challenge to implementing any successful adaptation strategy, including resettlement. Thus, poverty reduction may be the foundation of CCA planning for some urban poor communities in Manila. Further research is needed investigating the Principles identified as challenging to fully implement in Manila, including Communication, Compensation, and Livelihood Protection...|$|E

40|$|In {{different}} areas of the Central European Barbaricum, the Przeworsk Culture territory included, there is evidence in the Early Roman Period of some a certain standardization of belt fittings attributed to the warrior class. This observation applies not only to belt fastenings and strap ends, but also to fittings attached to the perimeter of the belt. They served a decorative function but, presumably, even more so a utilitarian one. Found among them are fittings commonly understood to have served in suspending from the belt objects belonging to the so-called personal equipment of warriors, namely: belt hangers, belt pendants and belt fittings with a pendent ring. A special attention was paid to this type of belt fitting during analysis of warrior belts of Early Roman Period data found in site at Illerup Ådal in Jutland (J. Ilkjær 1993 a). Belt hangers known from Przeworsk Culture assemblages come in several variants depending on the shape of the bar and rivet-plates which attached them to the leather strap. Depending on the differences {{in the shape of the}} bar three variants may be distinguished: 1. with a bar made of folded wire, approximately W-shaped (Fig. 1; List 1, Fig. 4); 2. with a U-shaped bar (Fig. 2; List 2, Fig. 5); 3. with a frame-like bar (Fig. 3; List 3, Fig. 6). The shape of the rivet-plates is not in a correlation with the shape of the bar. In the Przeworsk Culture territory belt hangers appear in phase B 1 of the Early Roman Period (variants 1 and 2). Their largest number, irrespective of their shape, has been recorded in assemblages dated to phase B 2 b. All three belt hanger variants are documented in the Late Roman Period, chiefly in phase C 1 a. Elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum analogous belt hangers have been recorded with the same frequency and within the same chronological confines (phase B 1 -C 1 a), as in the Przeworsk Culture territory. Metal belt sets of which belt hangers formed part have a similar character both in the territory of the Przeworsk Culture settlement as in other regions of the Central European Barbaricum. Most of them belonged to belts worn by warriors. In the Przeworsk Culture (Fig. 7 : 1) in phase B 1, similarly as in the Elbian Circle, in the Bohemian Basin (Fig. 12 : 1) and in Lower Austria, belt hangers were used on belts fastened with buckles with an eight-shaped frame (group A) and fitted with profiled strap ends. In phase B 2 there is an increase in the number of belts provided with belt hangers. Some of these belt sets are reminiscent stylistically to those of the preceding chronological period in that they include profiled strap ends (Fig. 8 : 1, 10 : 2). On the other hand, in phases B 2 b and C 1 a everywhere in the Central European Barbaricum belts with belt hangers (mostly variants 2 and 3), dissimilar in style design become widespread. These belts tended to be fastened with a buckle having a rectangular frame, mostly of type G 16, and were usually fitted with a strap end type 4 – 6 or 9 (Fig. 7 : 3, 8 : 2. 3, 9 : 1 11 : 1). Belt hangers were used in belts worn by the local elites (Fig. 13 : 2). In the outfit of the Przeworsk Culture warriors belt hangers (variants 2 and 3) appear also as an element of wide belts which were fastened with a heavy buckle of group G, with a double prong (Fig. 10 : 1). In phase C 1 a, in the Przeworsk Culture, we find a very small number of belt hangers forming part of new belt sets which include buckles with a D-shaped frame set on an axis, type D 17 (variant 1; Fig. 7 : 2). Singly belt sets of this type, with belt hangers, variants 2 or 3, have been recorded in the Elbian Circle, the Luboszyce Culture on the one hand, and the territory of the Dollkeim-Kovrovo Culture on the other. From the territory of the Przeworsk Culture settlement we also have a record on belts fitted with belt hangers identified with women’s outfits dating to phase B 2 b (Fig. 11 : 2). A very small number of belts with belt hangers attributed to women has been recorded in the Elbian Circle, the Wielbark Culture and the Luboszyce Couture, as well as in south-western Slovakia. Moreover, belt hangers are an element of so-called Sambian belts, typical for women’s outfits in the Dollkeim-Kovrovo Culture. In the Przeworsk Culture territory belt pendants are much less frequent finds (Fig. 14, 15). They differ both in the proportions of their top part and the shape of their lower part, used for suspending objects, and have been distinguished on this basis into five variants: 1. with the top part passing to a rectangular frame (Fig. 14 : 1 - 4; List 4, Fig. 15); 2. with the top part passing to a single loop (Fig. 14 : 5. 6; List 5, Fig. 16); 3. with the top part passing to a double loop (Fig. 14 : 7 - 11; List 5, Fig. 16); 4. with the top part passing to D-shaped loop (Fig. 14 : 12; List 5, Fig. 16); 5. with the top part in the form of a rectangular bar with a D-shaped loop (Fig. 14 : 13. 14; List 5, Fig. 16). In the Przeworsk Culture territory belt pendants as elements of belts are more characteristic for phase C 1 a than for phase B 2 b, and are documented also in phase C 1 b (variants 1 and 2). A small number of earlier belt pendants dating to phases B 2 a (variant 2) and B 2 b (variants 1 and 5) originate for the most part from the eastern range of the Przeworsk Culture, whereas younger specimens are known primarily from the western range of that culture. Elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum a small number of belt pendant finds have a similar chronological position as in the Przeworsk Culture. Specimens known at present represent all belt pendant variants known from the Przeworsk Culture, except for variant 4. On the other hand, belt pedants recorded elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum (Fig. 17 : 1. 2) lack analogies in the Przeworsk Culture materials. In the Przeworsk Culture territory, similarly as in other areas of the European Barbaricum, belt pendants were characteristic for belts worn by warriors fastened with buckles with a rectangular frame, group G, mostly type G 16 (Fig. 18 : 1. 2), often with strap ends. As in the case of belt hangers in the Przeworsk Culture environment belt pendants were also, on very rare occasions, attached to belts fastened with buckles with a D-shaped frame, group D (Fig. 18 : 3. 4). There is no conclusive evidence that belt pendants formed part of the outfit of women of the Przeworsk Culture people. Another form of metal belt fitting serving a function analogous to that of belt hangers and belt pendants are fittings with a single pendent ring. Not that these fittings were necessarily associated functionally with leather straps forming part of clothing, they could also belong to straps used for suspending drinking horns or in strapping swords. The main argument assisting the identification of fittings with a pendent ring as elements of belts is that they have been found in context with other metal elements of the belt set. In the Przeworsk Culture territory two variants of fittings have been set apart: 1. with a narrow fitting and a relatively thickset ring (Fig. 19 : 1 - 6; List 6, Fig. 20), 2. with a relatively small body fitting, usually lightly expanded at the top, and a relatively small ring (Fig. 19 : 7 - 9; List 6, Fig. 20). Belt fittings variant 1, mostly made of bronze, are recorded during phase B 2 a in the eastern zone of the Przeworsk Culture settlement; variant 2 (bronze or iron) are noted during phase B 2 and in C 1 a. Bronze variant 1 fittings found in the Przeworsk Culture territory are a characteristic form used in women’s belts fastened with buckles, group D, type 1, without metal strap ends (Fig. 21 : 1). On the other hand, variant 2 belt fittings occur mainly in the male outfit, used in belts fastened with a buckle having a rectangular frame, group G (Fig. 10 : 2), or a D-shaped frame, group D (Fig. 8 : 1). Outside the Przeworsk Culture territory belt sets with belt fittings with a pendent ring, variants 1 and 2, have been recorded in areas of the Central European Barbaricum and were in use mostly in phases B 2 and C 1. The source of impulse which led to the emergence in the outfit of warriors of barbarian Europe as early as in phase B 1 of belts with fittings which allowed for suspension of objects belonging to the so-called personal equipment is hard to pinpoint. Personal equipment is represented by fire striking sets consisting of a firesteel and a pin, or just one of these items (Fig. 22). In phases B 2 b and C 1 a in grave inventories in the Central European Barbaricum are seen to include assorted objects of which some could have been secured at the belt, e. g., knives in leather sheaths, awls, tweezers, whetstones. Some variant 3 belt hangers are very thickset, suggesting that even quite heavy objects may have been suspended from them. It may be conjectured that Przeworsk Culture warriors wore belts with pouches attached to them (Fig. 7 : 3). As for women’s belts, they may have had keys suspended from them (Fig. 21 : 1. 2). Fire striking tools surviving in the Przeworsk Culture territory and elsewhere in the Central European Barbaricum dating to the horizon of phases B 2 b–C 1 a were fixed to belt hangers and pendants by means of short <b>linking</b> <b>pieces</b> which could have reduced the functionality of such a set (Fig. 11 : 1, 22 : 3 - 6). Consequently, its funerary purpose may not be ruled out. On the other hand, a very modest number of longer <b>linking</b> <b>pieces</b> has been recorded (Fig. 22 : 1. 2, 23). It is remarkable that some belt hangers and belt pendants recovered in the Central European Barbaricum and dating to phases B 2 b and C 1 a include small fittings (Fig. 24 : 1 - 4) allowing introduction of narrow and long thongs and only on them suspension of e. g., firemaking tools, obviously making it easier to use them. Moreover, firesteels and tweezers found with a surviving fitting prove that they could have been attached to the belt on narrow straps, or suspended from them using the fittings discussed here (Fig. 8 : 2, 9 : 1, 18 : 1. 3). Not to be ruled out either is that use was made of the loop of the firesteels themselves to wear them at the belt suspended on a narrow leather strap (Fig. 25 : 4. 5). In discussing the functionality of belts with objects suspended from them (R. Articus 2004) other reconstructions have been put forward as well (Fig. 25 : 1 - 3). The greatest uniformity of belt sets associated with outfit of warriors and suspension from belts of the so-called personal equipment is observed in the Central European Barbaricum in phases B 2 b-C 1 a. It may be recognized with some confidence as the result of contacts between groups of warriors hailing from different cultural environment and their mobility. This could be related to settlement and culture shifts observed at this time, intimated also by the modest written sources at hand (K. Godłowski 2000, p. 26 - 30) ...|$|E

It also experiments with the first person voice of its own speaker. Birdhouse includes familial elegies, amatory poems and commissioned work. The dissertation represents the first study of length of the father in the American poet Sharon Olds's work. Olds's oeuvre from 1980 to 2004 is examined through close-reading of the poems. It is argued that a reflective reading reveals the intentional subjectivity of the speaker, but should not discount the na'ive reading the poems prompt {{which is part of}} their aesthetic experience. The centrality of the father is challenged, and it is argued that it is the daughter-speaker of the poems who is their hidden subject. The speaker asserts her happiness but uses ambiguity and suggestion to invite a reader to condemn the father. The father is an archetype, as are Olds's other familial characters, and a literary descendant of fathers in the poetry of confessional predecessors, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. The lack of specificity surrounding the father's crimes is used to demonstrate his archetypal depiction, and the speaker's focus on her survival narrative. The dissertation contends that the latent subject of Olds's book of elegies The Father is the speaker's prolonging of her father's suffering in poems which enact a literary killing, The dissertation concludes that the poems present a version of a family history spoken by a daughter who survives her archetypal presentation and valorises the role of poetic speaker.

A simplified version of a Home Heating Control System is used to illustrate our approach and technical implementation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a representation of}} plan cases as a structured set of goals and actions. These goals and actions are the unit pieces that form a case. These case pieces are related each other by hierarchical and temporal links (explanations) forming a tree-like network. We give importance not just to explicit links, i. e., <b>links</b> between case <b>pieces</b> which are concretely known, but also to implicit ones, i. e., possibly unknown <b>links</b> between case <b>pieces...</b>|$|R

50|$|Extemporization, both in {{the form}} of {{introductions}} to <b>pieces,</b> and <b>links</b> between <b>pieces,</b> continued to be a feature of keyboard concertising until the early 20th-century. Amongst those who practised such improvisation were Franz Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn, Anton Rubinstein, Paderewski, Percy Grainger and Pachmann. Improvisation in the area of 'art music' seems to have declined with the growth of recording.|$|R

It was she who had stolen the riband. He sat down again, his head in his hands, and swiftly, link by <b>link,</b> he <b>pieced</b> together a complete chain.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of two <b>linked</b> <b>pieces</b> of work {{undertaken}} between March 2001 and May 2002. A mapping study was conducted up to November 2001 and identified the range and type of research studies addressing the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on literacy learning in ages 5 to 16. An in-depth review then addressed one area identified in this mapping – the impact of networked technologies on literacy learning in English 5 to 16. Results from the in-depth review are reported in Chapter 6 and Appendix C. The in-depth review is the first of a number planned by the English Review Group in the field of ICT and literacy. Further in-depth reviews will take place in 2002 and beyond on evidence from experimental studies from 1990 to the present; the moving image and visual literacy; English as an additional language (which includes English as a second language); literature teaching; and word-processing...|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, Jason Kells {{joined the}} band on lead guitar. The song [...] "Extracted Nails" [...] was {{recorded}} in April 1991 at Double Tea Studios for a compilation on the German label Mangled Beyond Recognition, released the following year. The compilation featured Therion, God Macabre, Rottrevore, Cadaver, Crematory, Pan.Thy.Monium, Cenotaph, Hydr Hydr. On 3-4 August 1991, the band went back to Double Tea studios to record their second demo, [...] "Deep Sensory Perception into Aural Fate". This recording marked a big step forward in the maturity of the songwriting, performance and overall production. The demo sparked the interest of Relapse Records, who signed them up and released the demo as the Dusk extended play in 1992. It was an edited version of the demo which omitted the <b>linking</b> <b>piece</b> of music between the two tracks. It included the first recorded version of [...] "Cerulean Transience of all My Imagined Shores", a third track not featured on the earlier demo.|$|R
