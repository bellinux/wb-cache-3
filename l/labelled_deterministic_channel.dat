The main result is that the <b>deterministic</b> <b>channel</b> uniformly approximates the Gaussian channel, the capacity regions differing by a universal constant. The problem of finding the capacity of the Gaussian channel to within a constant error is therefore reduced to that of finding the capacity of the far simpler <b>deterministic</b> <b>channel.</b> Thus, the paper provides an alternative derivation of the recent constant gap capacity characterisation of Etkin, Tse and Wang.

40|$|Cross-layer {{optimization}} {{is a key}} step in {{wireless network}} design that coordinates the resources allocated to different layers {{in order to achieve}} globally optimal network performance. Existing work on cross-layer optimization for wireless networks often adopts simplistic physical-layer models for wireless channels, such as treating interference as noise or interference avoidance. This crude modeling of physical layer often leads to inefficient utilization of resources. In this paper, we adopt a <b>deterministic</b> <b>channel</b> model proposed in [1], [2], a simple abstraction of the physical layer that effectively captures the effect of channel strength, broadcast and superposition in wireless channels.
