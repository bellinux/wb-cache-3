40|$|Automorphic loops are loops {{in which}} all inner {{mappings}} are automorphisms. This variety <b>of</b> <b>loops</b> includes, for instance, groups and commutative Moufang loops. We study uniquely 2 -divisible automorphic loops, particularly automorphic <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> odd order, {{from the point of}} view of the associated Bruck loops (motivated by Glauberman's work on uniquely 2 -divisible Moufang loops) and the associated Lie rings (motivated by a construction of Wright). We prove that every automorphic <b>loop</b> $Q$ <b>of</b> odd order is solvable, contains an element of order $p$ for every prime $p$ dividing $|Q|$, and $|S|$ divides $|Q|$ for every subloop $S$ of $Q$. There are no finite simple nonassociative commutative automorphic loops, and there are no finite simple nonassociative automorphic <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> order less than 2500. We show that if $Q$ is a finite simple nonassociative automorphic loop then the socle of the multiplication group of $Q$ is not regular. The existence of a finite simple nonassociative automorphic loop remains open. Let $p$ be an odd prime. Automorphic <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> order $p$ or $p^ 2 $ are groups, but there exist nonassociative automorphic <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> order $p^ 3 $, some with trivial nucleus (center) and of exponent $p$. We construct nonassociative "dihedral" automorphic <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> order $ 2 n$ for every $n> 2 $, and show that there are precisely $p- 2 $ nonassociative automorphic <b>loops</b> <b>of</b> order $ 2 p$, all of them dihedral.

5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback <b>loop</b> <b>of</b> the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
