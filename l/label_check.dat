40|$|It is {{estimated}} that human error in the quality control <b>checking</b> of product <b>labels</b> on consumer packaging costs the UK retail industry £ 50 m per annum. Our research program aimed to understand the behavior of individuals when performing <b>label</b> <b>checks</b> on fresh produce in order to inform {{the development of a}} software application designed to support quality control. On a simulated <b>label</b> <b>checking</b> task, eye-tracking data showed that individuals used different checking methods. A more systematic method led to higher accuracy. Two computer-assisted approaches, varying in the level of computer support provided, were then designed to push checkers towards systematic checking. Greater improvements in accuracy were found under the computer-assisted approaches than under a control condition.

40|$|Despite robust {{quality control}} procedures, {{labelling}} errors on fresh produce {{are estimated to}} cost the UK supermarket industry approximately £ 50 million pounds per year in product recalls and wastage. Changing {{the format of the}} labels themselves is not a viable option. Instead, the challenge is to change or guide human operatives' behaviour so that label printing errors do not go undetected during quality control procedures. To this end, a simulated <b>label</b> <b>checking</b> task was presented to naïve participants to compare more systematic and strategic methods of <b>label</b> <b>checking.</b> Two conditions in which behaviour was computer-led were compared with a control condition in which checkers adopted their own idiosyncratic checking method. The data indicate that the two computer-led approaches resulted in improved levels of accuracy. Pushing label checkers towards a more systematic approach would appear to be effective in reducing undetected label errors, and could lead potentially to significant financial savings and reduced environmental wastage in the fresh produce industry...|$|R

40|$|Cooperation {{requires}} sharing data, but enforcing access restrictions across enterprises is a challenge. Different {{sites have}} different policies {{and use a}} variety of access control methods that are tailored to the individual enterprises&# 039; needs. Mapping one set of rules into another may require complex computations, possibly with a separate method for each pair of sites. This paper proposes an information flow control model for enforcing access restrictions across a virtual enterprise. Labels are assigned to data structures to ensure uniform treatment across the enterprise, and dynamic <b>label</b> <b>checking</b> provides flexibility during operation. A set of rules are presented to facilitate data manipulation so that they do not lead to information leak.

40|$|We present {{disjunction}} category (DC) labels, a new label {{format for}} enforcing information {{flow in the}} presence of mutually distrusting parties. DC labels can be ordered to form a lattice, based on propositional logic implication and conjunctive normal form. We introduce and prove soundness of decentralized privileges that are used in declassifying data, in addition to providing a notion of privilege-hierarchy. Our model is simpler than previous decentralized information flow control (DIFC) systems and does not rely on a centralized principal hierarchy. Additionally, DC labels can be used to enforce information flow both statically and dynamically. To demonstrate their use, we describe two Haskell implementations, a library used to perform dynamic <b>label</b> <b>checks,</b> compatible with existing DIFC systems, and a prototype library that enforces information flow statically, by leveraging the Haskell type checker...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{technique for}} protecting privacy {{and integrity of}} sensitive data is to statically check information flow within programs that manipulate the data. While previous work has proposed programming language extensions to allow this static checking, the resulting languages are too restrictive for practical use and have not been implemented. In this paper, we describe the new language JFlow, an extension to the Java language that adds statically-checked information flow annotations. JFlow provides several new features that make information flow checking more flexible and convenient than in previous models: a decentralized label model, label polymorphism, run-time <b>label</b> <b>checking,</b> and automatic <b>label</b> inference. JFlow also supports many language features {{that have never been}} integrated successfully with static information flow control, including objects, subclassing, dynamic type tests, access control, and exceptions.

40|$|Surface {{checking}} often disfigures {{the appearance}} of wood, but methods of accurately and rapidly measuring checking in wood are not well developed. This paper describes the principal features of a software package that measures the dimensions and numbers of checks in scanned images of weathered wood surfaces. Procedures within the program analyze images searching for brightness minima that satisfy criteria that are characteristic of checks. A black-and-white image is then produced in which checks are shown black on a white background. Further procedures reduce noise in the black-and-white image eliminating artifacts and small checks invisible to the naked eye. The final stage of the analysis identifies and <b>labels</b> <b>checks</b> and quantifies their positions, sizes and shape. Using this software it has been possible to successfully quantify checking {{in a range of}} preservative treated wood specimens that have been subjected to natural weathering. The advantages of the system for quantifying checking in wood as well as its limitations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Labelling errors {{on fresh}} produce are {{estimated}} to cost the UK supermarket industry £ 50 m per year in product recalls and wastage. Such errors occur despite robust quality control procedures. Given the financial and environmental impact of these errors, {{it is important to}} understand whether labelchecking performance can be predicted by individual differences in cognitive abilities. To this end, participants carried out a simulated label-checking task together with a number of measures of information processing speed, attention, short-term/working memory, and mind-wandering. Accuracy of <b>label</b> <b>checking</b> was found to be significantly predicted by three of the measures, with better short-term verbal memory being most strongly associated with performance. Cognitive tests such as these provide a means of identifying how well employees are likely to perform when undertaking such tasks and, if necessary, how they should be supported in that role, possibly forming a screening battery when recruiting new quality control staff. The findings highlight the importance of determining the component processes of cognition which contribute to performance in real-world work environment...|$|R

Recent concerns by the U. S. public health community about the intake of sodium by Americans have led ARS, USDA {{to develop a plan}} to monitor the levels of sodium in highly consumed commercial packaged and restaurant foods. NDL scientists worked with USDA's Food Surveys Research Group (FSRG) to identify 125 Sentinel Foods, to serve as indicators for assessment of change in the sodium content in the food supply. For each food (e. g., cheese pizza) NDL used market share data to identify the predominant brands and types of foods (e. g., frozen cheese pizza, restaurant pizza) to be monitored for changes in the sodium level over time. Periodically, nutrient values for frequently consumed foods will be updated by chemical analysis or <b>label</b> <b>checks.</b> Estimates will be compared to existing values in the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR). Since 2010, about 140 foods have been sampled and analyzed by NDL contractors. NDL will continue to generate new sodium data which will be disseminated in the successive releases of the SR. Accurate and current data for sodium in processed foods will support the assessment of changes in sodium in foods as well as the assessment of sodium intake by the U.

40|$|Although {{the study}} of social {{influence}} has been a fruitful topic of inquiry {{in the field of}} communication, past research has focused almost exclusively on its consequences, and rarely asks how people construct their perceptions of social reality in the first place. This dissertation contributes to our knowledge by thoroughly examining how people form descriptive social norm perceptions in their everyday communication environment through repeated media exposure. We investigated this question with different forms of media exposure, engaged in different lines of theoretical inquiry and utilized observational and experimental methods. ^ The first study relied on self-report measures and examined how the effects of repeated incidental media exposure to e-cigarette use information across multiple sources may travel through interpersonal conversations and descriptive norm perceptions, and finally reach behavior decisions. We presented evidence of direct and indirect pathways with cross-sectional and longitudinal data among a nationally representative sample of youth and young adults. The second set of studies conducted online experiments to manipulate people’s exposure to repeated individual behavior cues embedded in online comments. We confirmed that people were equipped with a “quasi-statistical” sense that allowed them to automatically collect and identify the behavior choice distribution within the online comment boards, based on which they formed the behavior prevalence perceptions in the real world. The results were replicated with both e-cigarette use and Genetically Modified Food <b>label</b> <b>checking</b> behaviors. Applying similar experimental procedures, the third study comprehensively examined the exposure-norm relation with much more elaborated treatment conditions. We observed that descriptive norm perceptions responded to repeated exposure in a dose-response fashion, contingent {{on the size of the}} overall information pool. ^ This work addresses the underlying mechanisms of descriptive social norm perception formation and how they could be better harnessed in promoting behavior changes moving forward. Our examination of user-generated contents on news websites adds to the sparse literature on the intersection between mass and interpersonal communication processes in the context of the unique dynamics and characteristics of social perception formation in our current media landscape. ...|$|R
