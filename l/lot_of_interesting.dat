In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't have a good relationship with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. It would certainly create a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> dilemmas".|$|E

Russo specifically found a Synthi AKS synthesizer for the show, as that instrument was used during the making of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, one of Hawley's favorite albums and what Russo described as [...] "the sound of schizophrenia, the sound of mental illness in the ’70s. So why not use that as the touchstone for what the sound of this score might be?" [...] Russo experimented with the instrument, and began [...] "recording and writing melodies around its unusual sounds." ...|$|E

What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story.

Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes {{to see just how}} crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama."

500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Richard Edwards {{was more}} negative, giving the episode three stars out of five. He {{felt that the}} story had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> ideas but then became standard. He also criticised {{the use of the}} sonic screwdriver and the Doctor's monologue, which he felt had been overused too much recently, but said that the episode was saved by Clara. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was also disappointed, saying that it [...] "amounts to little more than series of events and has a more preposterous premise than usual". He questioned the physics and noted that there was not much of an ending and surprisingly found Smith not up to his usual performance. Doctor Who Magazine reviewer Graham Kibble-White also reacted negatively, writing, [...] "There wasn't a wet eye in the house, as pathos run nauseatingly amok," [...] and claimed it [...] "by some stretch the least awesome Doctor Who we've encountered for a long time." [...] He also claimed it seemed like [...] "Cross hadn't seen an episode since the 1980s" [...] and that [...] "even the leftfield mention of the Time War feels as if it's come from a quick consult with Wikipedia."

2500|$|Ursula and {{her three}} older brothers, Clifton, Theodore, and Karl Kroeber, were {{encouraged}} to read and were exposed to their parents' dynamic friend group. Le Guin has stated that, in retrospect, she is grateful for the ease and happiness of her upbringing. The encouraging environment fostered Le Guin's interest in literature; her first fantasy story was written at age 9, her first science fiction story submitted for publication in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction at age 11. The family spent the academic year in Berkeley, retreating in the summers to an old ranch named [...] "Kishamish" [...] in Napa Valley, which she once described as [...] "an old, tumble-down ranch in the Napa Valley … [...] a gathering place for scientists, writers, students, and California Indians. Even though I didn't pay much attention, I heard a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>interesting,</b> grown-up conversation." [...] She was interested in biology and poetry, but found math difficult. Le Guin attended Berkeley High School. She received her B.A. (Phi Beta Kappa) in Renaissance French and Italian literature from Radcliffe College in 1951, and M.A. in French and Italian literature from Columbia University in 1952. Soon after, Le Guin began her Ph.D. work and won a Fulbright grant to continue her studies in France from 1953 to 1954.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck {{between the two sides}} of the law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. I think if we can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E
