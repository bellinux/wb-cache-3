2500|$|Photoluminescent fire {{extinguisher}} signs {{are made with}} nontoxic photoluminescent phosphor that absorbs ambient light and releases it slowly in dark conditions—the sign [...] "glows in the dark". Such signs are independent of an external power supply, and so offer a low-cost, reliable means of indicating the position of emergency equipment in dark or smoky conditions. The luminance performance for life safety appliance location signs should {{meet the requirements of}} International Standard ISO 17398 so that the sign is not only excited at very low ambient light levels (25 lux), but also has effective luminance intensity and longevity, making the life-safety message conspicuous in the event of power failure, or if smoke obscures emergency ceiling lights. The Photoluminescent Safety Products Association (PSPA) has guidance classifications for luminance performance to help users with applications under [...] "International Maritime Organization Emergency Equipment and <b>Life-saving</b> <b>Appliance</b> Location Requirements," [...] and worldwide industrial fire-safety management requirements.|$|R

40|$|Arctic cruise {{tourism is}} gaining in popularity. There {{is a need}} to better {{understand}} hazards that are connected with cruise traffic and evacuation in the Arctic. The Polar Code tries to enhance the safety of persons travelling in polar waters by giving functional requirements to <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances.</b> However, it is unclear what is needed to achieve the required functionality, and how existing <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances</b> perform compared to the requirements in the Polar Code. This thesis looks to present the challenges associated with cruise traffic in the Arctic, the main hazards associated with evacuation in an arctic environment, and what the possible gaps are between the current <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances</b> and the level of safety the Polar Code tries to ensure. Based on a literature review, a risk analysis and a practical test, the thesis presents a review of arctic region characteristics, historical accidents, regulations and existing <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances.</b> It also presents a description of the main hazards associated with evacuation from a cruise ship in an arctic environment, and the corresponding gaps between the performance of existing <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances</b> and the level of safety the Polar Code tries to ensure. The challenges, hazards and gaps are discussed through incorporating results from the literature review, the risk analysis and the practical test. The thesis also highlights the contributions the authors provided to the SARex project through a preliminary hazard analysis, leading risk assessments prior to the practical test, actively participating in the test and documenting the workshop that summarized the experiences from the test...|$|E
40|$|During a {{lifeboat}} training session, {{the authors}} experienced a lifeboat {{to be somewhat}} “on the edge” with regards to its stability, and an interest to practically test lifeboats’ stability and their compliance with the relevant requirements arose. This, together {{with the fact that}} one relatively newly manufactured and type-approved lifeboat was found to not fully comply with the relevant requirements in a recently performed test, despite having undergone and passed the regulated tests and evaluation in the classification process, prompted this study on stability and evaluation of lifeboat stability. This study investigates how well three type-approved lifeboats comply with the relevant stability requirements of the <b>Life-saving</b> <b>Appliances</b> Code (LSA), and how the responsibilities are delegated between the involved parties in the classification process of <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances.</b> The theoretical chapter presents the relevant regulations, laws and requirements applicable to a totally enclosed lifeboat and the classification process of <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances.</b> Furthermore, basic theory behind transverse ship stability and heel angle testing is presented. For answering the research questions of the study, two research methods were applied; an experimental method comprised of field experiments and systematic observations for testing of the lifeboats’ compliance with the stability requirements through practical heeling tests, and a documentary research method to investigate how the responsibilities are delegated within the classification process. The results from the experimental stability tests show that one of the tested lifeboats does not fully comply with the stability requirements of the LSA-Code. The results on the responsibility delegation show, that the regulations of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances</b> which in turn have been transposed into the legal system of the European Union, point towards a responsibility delegation where the Notified Bodies or Recognized Organisations as the controlling party, carry the responsibility for ensuring that the <b>life-saving</b> <b>appliances</b> comply with the requirements during manufacturing, as well as on-board installation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the Davit-Launched Lifeboat Project (DLLBP). The project was initiated by the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF) in December 2009, and was executed as a joint effort between OLF and the Norwegian Shipowners' Association (NSA). The project is a continuation of NSA LAP (<b>Life-saving</b> <b>Appliances</b> Project) and lessons learned in OLF Free Fall Lifeboat Project. The project was organised in six Work Packages (WPs) and was completed in June 2011. The studies in the project covered the following phases during lifeboat evacuation; (1) lifeboat lowering, (2) water entry, (3) release of wire falls and (4) sail-away. Findings and recommendations related to each of the four phases are presented in this paper. The members of the Norwegian Lifeboat Network, consisting of representatives from authorities, unions, suppliers, OLF and NSA, were informed {{during the course of the}} project...|$|E
40|$|Cruise {{traffic in}} the Arctic is a hot topic today since the melting ice has allowed for new {{possibilities}} for the cruise ship companies to frequent new and interesting routes. The climate around the poles is not only recognizable by the stunning views and landscape, but also by extreme cold, ice and strong winds, combined with an ever-changing weather that can hit without warning. IMO:s legal framework The Polar Code sets the requirements for ships in the Arctic and Antarctic, which makes the subject highly relevant since the code entered into force on January the 1 st, 2017. This study covers {{the risks associated with}} cruise {{traffic in the}} polar regions, and has analyzed The Polar Code from an LSA (<b>Life-Saving</b> <b>Appliances)</b> perspective. The study also examines how the implementation of the code will affect LSA onboard, and investigates the opinions that professional navigational officers who frequents the polar regions has regarding The Polar Code. This has been achieved by a literature study and by conducting semi-structured interviews. The results of the study show that new equipment must be acquired onboard the ships to fulfill the new and tougher requirements set by The Polar Code. Lack of space onboard the cruise ships has been pointed out as a major issue, and the acquisitions of new equipment might possibly call for reconstructions or other logistic solutions onboard to accommodate the new LSA. The most substantial risk faced in the Arctic and Antarctic is that of the ice, which presents danger in many ways. This is how The Polar Code describes the risk that ice entails; Ice, as it may affect hull structure, stability characteristics, machinery systems, navigation, the outdoor working environment, maintenance and emergency preparedness tasks and malfunction of safety equipment and systems. All of interview participants shared the opinion that ice presented the most significant risk, and that smaller part of icebergs, so called growlers constituted the most prominent danger for the ship’s hull. These consists of extremely hard glacier ice that has separated from icebergs. They are big enough to cause major damage, yet small enough to be detected by neither radar nor visual means. The study also covers the remote location and the lack of land based SAR infrastructure, and what consequences this could have if a large-scaled incident were to happen...|$|E
