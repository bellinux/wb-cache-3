50|$|First, in the 1980s, the {{increasing}} availability of personal computers lowered {{the barriers to}} software development and made computers increasingly available to more managers. But it's worth remembering that even in 1987, selling strategic planning software often required selling a manager a computer and training them how to use productivity software (i.e. word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, outlining, etc.) Laptops were initially nonexistent {{and the state of}} art in portability was a sewing machine sized <b>luggable</b> <b>computer.</b> Previously, report creation often required hand writing or dictation which was then typed up by a secretary or word processing pool.|$|E
5000|$|The {{portable}} micro computer Portal of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially {{appeared in}} September 1980 at the Sicob show in PARIS. It was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department of R2E Micral {{at the request}} of company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. It was based on an Intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHZ. It was equipped with a central 64K bite Ram, a keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys ( [...] separate blocks [...] ), a 32-character screen, a floppy disk : capacity = 140 000 characters, of a thermal printer : speed = 28 characters / second, an asynchronous channel, a synchronous channel, a 220V power supply. It weighed 12Kg and its dimensions were 45cm x 45cm x 15cm. It provided total mobility. Its operating system was Prologue. The Osborne 1, released in 1981, was a <b>luggable</b> <b>computer</b> that used the Zilog Z80 and weighed 24.5 lb. It had no battery, a 5 in CRT screen, and dual 5.25 in single-density floppy drives. Both Tandy/RadioShack and HP also produced portable computers of varying designs during this period. The first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early 1980s. The Dulmont Magnum was released in Australia in 1981-82, but was not marketed internationally until 1984-85. The US$8,150 (US$ today) GRiD Compass 1101, released in 1982, was used at NASA and by the military, among others. The Sharp PC-5000, Ampere and Gavilan SC released in 1983. The Gavilan SC was described as a [...] "laptop" [...] by its manufacturer, while the Ampere had a modern clamshell design. The Toshiba T1100 won acceptance not only among PC experts but the mass market as a way to have PC portability.|$|E

25|$|Bill Gates {{claimed that}} the Apple II family with a Z-80 SoftCard was the single most-popular CP/M {{hardware}} platform. Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the Altair 8800, the IMSAI 8080, the Osborne 1 and Kaypro <b>luggables,</b> and MSX <b>computers.</b> The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the Amstrad PCW. In the UK, CP/M was also available on Research Machines educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the BBC Micro when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the Amstrad CPC series, the Commodore 128, TRS-80, and later models of the ZX Spectrum. CP/M 3 was also used on the NIAT, a custom handheld computer designed for A.C. Nielsen's internal use with 1Mbytes of SSD memory.|$|R
