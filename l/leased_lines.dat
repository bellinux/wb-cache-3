25|$|On March 1, 1871, the D leased the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad Company, which, {{along with}} its <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> {{provided}} a network stretching north from Albany and Schenectady to Saratoga Springs, and continuing northeast to Rutland, Vermont, {{as well as an}} eastern route to Rutland via trackage rights over the Troy and Boston Railroad west of Eagle Bridge. The D also obtained a 1/4 interest in the Troy Union Railroad from this lease.|$|E
25|$|UUCP {{networks}} {{spread quickly}} {{due to the}} lower costs involved, {{and the ability to}} use existing <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> X.25 links or even ARPANET connections. By 1983, thousands of people participated from more than 500 hosts, mostly universities and Bell Labs sites but also a growing number of Unix-related companies; the number of hosts nearly doubled to 940 in 1984. More than 100 newsgroups existed, more than 20 devoted to Unix and other computer-related topics, and at least a third to recreation. As the mesh of UUCP hosts rapidly expanded, it became desirable to distinguish the Usenet subset from the overall network. A vote was taken at the 1982 USENIX conference to choose a new name. The name Usenet was retained, but it was established that it only applied to news. The name UUCPNET became the common name for the overall network.|$|E
25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E

In the <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> a major concern is to provide connection of telephone to all the locations.

This chapter deals with this situation {{with the help of}} a network diagram in which each node represents the locations and the edge between each node represents <b>leased</b> <b>line.</b> Each edge has a number attached to it which represents the cost associated with installing that link. Aim of the paper is to determine the <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> network connecting all the locations at minimum cost of installation...|$|R
500|$|The 1850s and 1860s were a time {{of great}} {{expansion}} for Cleveland, which grew from a small lakeside town to a major player in Great Lakes commerce and a rival to the southern Ohio city of Cincinnati. [...] With peace restored in 1865, Hanna struck out on his own ventures. [...] Foreseeing a demand for petroleum products, he built a refinery, and also invested his own money in the Lac La Belle, a swift Great Lakes steamer. [...] The ship sank and the refinery burned, uninsured. [...] The losses reduced Hanna to near-insolvency. [...] According to Hanna biographer Herbert Croly, [...] "he had gained little from the first nine years of his business life except experience." [...] His father-in-law, appreciating Hanna's potential, took him into his own business in 1867 as a partner, and soon retired. [...] The firm, Rhodes and Company (later M.A. Hanna and Company), dealt principally in coal and steel, but under Hanna expanded into many fields. [...] The firm had close dealings with the railroads—especially the Pennsylvania Railroad, which carried much of its freight. Hanna later became director of two railroads, including one of the Pennsylvania's <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

There's a street-walker over there in those flats that's got a million times more chance to get to heaven--if there is any--than those financiers, as they call 'emselves--I ain't much on high finance, but I've got some respect for a second story man now--he takes some risks! I'll tell you what they did, they bought up the short car lines that didn't pay and sold 'em to themselves for fifty times as much as they were worth; and they got controlling interests in the big lines and leased 'em to themselves with dividends guaranteed as high as eighteen per cent. They capitalized the Consolidated for more millions than a little man like me can think of, and we handed 'em our money because we thought they were honest. We thought the men who listed the stock on the Exchange were honest. And when the crash came, they'd got away with the swag, like any common housebreakers. There were dummy directors, and a dummy president. Eldon Parr didn't have a share--sold out everything when she went over two hundred, but you bet he kept his stock in the <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> which guarantee more than they earn. He cleaned up five million, they say.... My money--the money that might give that boy fresh air, and good doctors ....Say, you believe in hell, don't you?
