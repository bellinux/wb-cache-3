The district is roughly bounded by Congress, Polk, State, Taylor, and Wells Streets and includes 28 contributing buildings. The district includes many of the printing buildings used by Chicago's printing industry, {{the largest in the}} midwest from the 1880s through the 1930s. Due to its proximity to Dearborn Station and its thin property blocks that allowed for tall and thin printing buildings, land in the district was attractive to large printing companies.

A <b>loop</b> antenna is <b>printed</b> {{on both sides}} of a dielectric substrate: a dual PIN diode loaded <b>loop</b> is <b>printed</b> on one side while a dual gap loaded smaller <b>loop</b> is <b>printed</b> on the other side. By controlling the ON/OFF states of the PIN diodes, the polarization of the proposed antenna can be switched electronically to right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) or left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) over a wideband frequency range. A prototype is fabricated and measured to verify the performance of the antenna. The measured results indicate that the antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of over 30 %, and a 3 -dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 12. 7 % and 14. 9 % for RHCP and LHCP, respectively. The measured gain is around 8 dBic for LHCP state and 7 dBic for RHCP state.

From an artificial intelligence point of view, compression is a useful way of measuring how deeply the observed data is understood.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{frequency}} selective surface (FSS) for interference control causes by {{the proliferation of}} mobile devices. FSS is a periodic structure etched on a dielectric substrate which acts as a spatial filter. The proposed FSS is designed as a band-stop filter to attenuate the cellular signals operating at GSM 900, GSM 1800 and IMT 2000 frequency bands. The employment of the FSS is an effective shielding technique as it {{eliminates the need for}} power supply and prevents the use of mobile phone without disrupting other types of communications. All the designs and simulations are done using the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio software. There are three main groups of the FSS prototype designed in this study. The first group of the FSS prototype is etched on FR- 4 substrate using the photolithography technique. On the other hand, the second group of the FSS prototype is printed on glossy paper substrate using the manual fabrication and inkjet printing techniques. These two techniques are implemented using the conductive silver pen and copper nanoparticle ink, respectively. The simulated results of the conventional square <b>loop</b> FSS <b>printed</b> on paper shows a good angular stability compared to the conventional square <b>loop</b> FSS <b>printed</b> on FR- 4 substrate. The utilization of the inkjet printing technique is proposed in order to overcome the limitations of the manual fabrication technique. In order to transform a non-conductive printed pattern to a conductive one, the printed FSS element has to undergo the post-processing, called sintering. This consequently leads to a final prototype of the FSS printed on polyimide film. In order to validate the simulated results experimentally, the measurement is performed inside the anechoic chamber. The measured and simulated results are shown to be in a very good agreement with each other. FSS printed on glossy paper is highly recommended due to its very low cost and environmental-friendly material...|$|R
