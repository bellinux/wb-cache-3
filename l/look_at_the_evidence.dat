Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take a new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E

6000|$|Not that I deny, a priori, the {{possibility}} of Coleridge's story. As Mr. Huxley says, 'strictly speaking, I am unaware of anything that {{has a right to}} the title of an [...] "impossibility," [...] except a contradiction in terms.'[7] To the horror of some of his admirers, Mr. Huxley would not call the existence of demons and demoniacal possession 'impossible.'[8] Mr. Huxley was no blind follower of Hume. I, too, do not call Coleridge's tale 'impossible,' but, unlike the psychologists, I refuse to accept it on 'Bardolph's security.' And I contrast their conduct, in swallowing Coleridge's legend, with their refusal (if they do refuse) to accept the evidence for the automatic writing of not-consciously-known languages (as of eleventh-century French poetry and prose by Mr. Schiller), or their refusal (if they do refuse) to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for telepathic crystal-gazing, or any other supernormal exhibitions of faculty, attested by living and honourable persons.|$|E
