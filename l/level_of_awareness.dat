The corresponding figure for the second survey in 1991 was 1, 569 Hispanics (41. 1 percent males). In general, respondents reported low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the presence of product warning messages and signs.

2500|$|According to the Christian {{teaching}} of Father Richard Rohr, {{the concept of}} the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), [...] "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." [...] Rohr refers to this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> as [...] "having the mind of Christ".|$|E
2500|$|Yoga, as Crowley interprets it, {{involves}} {{several key}} components. The first is Asana, {{which is the}} assumption (after eventual success) of any easy, steady and comfortable posture so as to maintain a good physique which complements {{the high level of}} enlightenment that meditation is accompanied with. Next is Pranayama, which is the control of breath. Yogis believe that the number of breaths a human takes are counted before one is even born and thus, by controlling the intake one may also be able to control the life. Mantram, the use of mantras enables the subject to use the knowledge of the Vedas [...] "Atharva Veda" [...] in this context adequately. Yama and Niyama are the adopted moral or behavioral codes (of the adept's choosing) that will be least likely to excite the mind. Pratyahara is the stilling of the thoughts so that the mind becomes quiet. Dharana is the beginning of concentration, usually on a single shape, like a triangle, which eventually leads to Dhyana, the loss of distinction between object and subject, which can be described as the annihilation of the ego (or sense of a separate self). The final stage is Samādhi—Union with the All; it is considered to be the utmost <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> that one could possibly achieve. According to Hindu mythology, one of their main three deities, Shiva, had mastered this and thus was bestowed upon with stupendous power and control.|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the unusually frank {{tone of the}} report, Hassan Abdi Madar states:"The report is addressed to the President of the SDR, the Minister of Defence, and Minister of Interior. The latter, Mjor-General Ahmed Suleiman Abdalla is also a son-in-law of the President, and Third Deputy Prime Minister. Since President Barre is also the Minister of Defence -- the previous holder of that portfolio, General Mohammad Ali Samatar, having been promoted Prime Minister on January 30, 1987 -- the report is seemingly confined to family members. This would explain its extreme frankness in specifying certain clans as targets for implemented and recommended punitive action." [...] Other aims of the policy included arming other clans {{in the region and}} encouraging them to fight the dominant Isaaq: [...] "Since it has become evident that the Isaaq were, by act and intent, with the SNM; and since we could not see them giving up the line they have pursued so deceptively for some time; and in order to forestall them; we arranged for the other inhabitants of the North continuous meetings and a mobilization campaign designed to rouse them to action and to raise their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness.</b> [...] This was intended to strengthen their unity and to surround Somali unity with a defensive wall. [...] Among those inhabitants are: the Awdal people, the various sections of Western Somalis , the Las Qorey people, and the Daami people, etc. There {{is no doubt that the}} unity of these people will restore the balance of the scales which are now tipped in favour of the Isaaq.

2500|$|Awareness {{occurs when}} {{patients}} have anesthesia that is inadequate {{to keep them}} unconscious during an operation. [...] The incidence of this anesthesia complication is variable and seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients according to the surgical setting carried out. This variation reflects the surgical setting {{as well as the}} physiological state of the patient. Thus, the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1 and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized. The majority of these do not feel pain although around one third did, in a range of experience from a sore throat due to the endotracheal tube, to traumatic pain at the incision site. The incidence is halved in the absence of neuro-muscular blockade. In this situation, the patient may feel the pain or pressure of surgery, hear conversation, experience air hunger, or have difficulty breathing. The patient may be unable to communicate any distress because they have been given a muscle relaxant; without this, they can move and the anesthesiologists are alerted and provide more anesthetic drugs to render the patient unconscious again. If anesthesia awareness does occur, about 42% feel the pain of the operation, 94% experience panic or anxiety, and 70% experience lasting symptoms which may be psychological and may be physical or neurological. The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of [...] "awareness" [...] are open to interpretation. These usually involve feeling severe pain, clear recall of the conversations of the operating room staff or suffocation. Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will be asleep, although in fact they are getting a sedation that may allow some <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> as opposed to a general anesthetic.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{function}} is {{the selection and}} assignment of the most appropriate type of response resource, such as an ambulance, from the closest or the most appropriate location, depending {{on the nature of}} the problem, and ensuring that the crew of the response resource receive all of the appropriate information. [...] The EMD is responsible for the management and work assignment (physicians and supervisors provide work direction) for all of the response resources in the EMS system. [...] In many cases, the EMD is responsible for multiple response resources simultaneously, and these may include ALS, BLS, or some mix of skills, ambulances, 'fly-cars', and other types of resources. In a quiet, rural setting, such resources may be at a fixed point, in quarters, most of the time, while in other cases, such as urban settings, all or many of the resources may be mobile. [...] It is not uncommon, in a large urban centre, for an EMD to manage and direct as many as 20 response resources simultaneously. [...] It is the job of the EMD to analyze the information and ensure that it leads to the right resource being sent to the patient in the shortest appropriate time. [...] This requires a constant <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> of the location and status of each resource, so that the closest available and appropriate resource may be sent to each call. Particularly in larger, urban settings, the mental demands and stress level may be comparable to those of an air traffic controller, and 'burn-out' rates may be quite high. [...] This has been eased somewhat in recent years through the use of Automatic Vehicle Locating (AVL), permitting the EMD to monitor the location and status of all assigned resources using a computer screen instead of by memory.|$|E

[...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. We need to get the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E

To prevent transmission and progression of the disease in this community, increased screening is necessary. This study aimed to determine 1) the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> and knowledge regarding hepatitis B, comparing these in tested and non-tested Turkish-Dutch in Rotterdam; 2) the self-reported hepatitis B test status in this population, and how this is related to demographic characteristics, knowledge and awareness. Methods We conducted a postal survey amongst first and second generation migrants, aged 16 - 40 years. Results The response rate was 30. 2 % (n = 355 respondents). <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> and knowledge regarding hepatitis B were low, as {{the majority of respondents}} (73 %) never thought about the disease and 58 % of the respondents scored 5 or less out of ten knowledge items.
