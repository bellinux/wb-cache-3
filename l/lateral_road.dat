5|$|Meanwhile, at 01:00 on 15 December, the New Zealand Division—electing {{not to make}} {{a further}} frontal assault on Orsogna—launched their 5th Brigade in Operation Florence, a new {{flanking}} attack {{to the right of the}} village. By that afternoon, 5th Brigade was well established on the Orsogna to Ortona <b>lateral</b> <b>road</b> and had driven a shallow salient into the German forward defensive line. Although they had exhausted nearly all their reserves, divisional headquarters was optimistic for the prospects for the next day, given the heavy casualties they had inflicted that day.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Hafez, {{commanding}} the 16th Infantry Division, planned {{to contain the}} Israeli attack from the south by having the 18th Mechanized Brigade occupy defenses north of the Chinese Farm, directly behind the 16th Infantry Brigade, but without its organic tank battalion, which was designated {{as part of the}} division's reserve. The 1st Armored Brigade moved southward to occupy positions between <b>Lateral</b> <b>Road</b> and the canal on the right flank of the 18th Brigade. Upon the brigade's arrival, it engaged Israeli armor from Reshef's brigade in al-Galaa'; Egyptian armor destroyed around 15 tanks and several half-tracks. At around 1:00 PM, sorties of Egyptian Su-7s destroyed many Israeli tanks in ground-attack missions over al-Galaa' village. The 1st Brigade countered a flanking attempt on its left at 2:00 PM by a tank battalion, thwarting the attack and destroying ten tanks. During its engagements on October 16, the 21st Division managed to destroy over 50 Israeli tanks and APCs, while subjected to frequent Israeli air strikes and artillery barrages. The 1st Brigade accounted for most of the kills, while suffering fewer losses.|$|E
25|$|The Orne river {{formed the}} eastern, or left, {{flank of the}} Allied {{landings}} at Normandy on 6 June 1944. Control of both bridges was vital because Allied forces needed the Orne as a geographic barrier against an immediate counter-attack against the allied flank by German forces, and because access to a <b>lateral</b> <b>road</b> would ensure supplies from Sword Beach to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been dropped {{to the east of}} Caen. Supplies of ammunition, fuel and rations were essential if the 6th Airborne was to effectively protect the left flank of the Allied invasion force. Furthermore, the crossings had to be held, undamaged, so as to serve as causeways from the beach landing areas, when the Allies moved forward.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} primary {{roads are}} roads which form {{parts of the}} main trunkline system and directly connect three or more major cities and metropolitan areas {{with a population of}} at least 100,000. They are further classified into the north-south backbone, east-west <b>lateral,</b> and other <b>roads</b> of strategic importance. The north-south backbone refers to the main trunkline, the Pan-Philippine Highway (N1, also designated as Asian Highway 26 AH26), which runs from Laoag in the northernmost parts of Luzon to Zamboanga City in southern Mindanao, interconnecting the country's major islands. The east-west <b>lateral</b> <b>roads</b> are roads that traverse this backbone and runs east-west across the different islands. Other roads of strategic importance provide access to other areas vital for regional development and infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The redoubts of {{the first}} line did not require more than 20,000 men to defend them, which left {{the whole of the}} true field-army free not only to {{reinforce}} any threatened point but also to make a counter-attack. To facilitate such movements a chain of signal-stations had been formed from end to end of the lines, and <b>lateral</b> <b>roads</b> of communication had been made so as to enable the troops to pass rapidly along their entire length.|$|R
50|$|Urban development, {{much like}} the other {{settlements}} of Terceira, is constituted by a linear structure, that follows the main roadway that circles the island, with little expansion into the fields. The <b>lateral</b> <b>roads</b> normally accompany the ravines, except for the area between Ribeira do Mouro and Ribeira das Cinco, where smaller urban agglomerations developed along the municipal road of Canadinhas, the circuits 200 m above the Regional Roadway to connect Cinco Ribeiras and Terra Chã (through São Bartolomeu de Regatos).|$|R
25|$|In 1647, the {{great-grandson}} of Ngagi Wangchuk, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, {{noted for}} the building of several other prominent buildings in Bhutan, began constructing a dzong in Trongsa, given its strategical importance. He named it the Chökhor Rabtentse Dzong {{and it was the}} seat of power of the Wangchuck dynasty before they became rulers of Bhutan in 1907. The rulers of Trongsa, the penlops of the Wangchuck dynasty, who resided at Trongsa Dzong were very powerful, exerting influence over all of eastern and central Bhutan, controlling east-west trade for centuries. The only road connecting eastern and western Bhutan (the precursor to the modern <b>Lateral</b> <b>Road),</b> passed through the courtyard of the dzong. By the 19th century, the penlops, ruling from Trongsa Dzong, had become so powerful that Trongsa had effectively become the capital of Bhutan, although never officially so. Its strategic location added to its importance on the east-west trade route and was a source of revenue to the Trongsa penlop. They later became the monarchs of Bhutan that rule to this day.|$|E
500|$|As the {{magnitude}} of Israeli losses became clear, Gonen made the decision at noon to form a defensive line on the <b>Lateral</b> <b>Road,</b> [...] east of the canal, and ordered his divisional commanders to deploy accordingly. At noon, elements of Abraham Adan's 162nd Division and Ariel Sharon's 143rd Division began to reach the fronts. Consequently, Gonen divided the front into three divisional commands: Adan was deployed in the northern sector, Sharon in the central sector, and Mandler in the southern sector.|$|E

That night, a second 8th Indian Division brigade—the 17th Indian Infantry Brigade—passed through and attacked towards Caldari. The 1st Battalion Royal Fusiliers stormed the village in a wild night's fighting while the 1st Battalion 5th Gurkha Rifles seized Point 198 nearby, holding it against determined counterattacks, including from tanks in the afternoon of 14 December. That evening, 1st Battalion 12th Frontier Force Regiment attacked on {{the left of}} the Gurkhas and established positions on the <b>lateral</b> <b>road</b> between Ortona and Orsogna running parallel to the Moro some [...] north of the [...] "Impossible Bridge". On the evening of 15 December, the 1st/5th Battalion Essex Regiment from the Indian Division's 19th Indian Infantry Brigade, which had been held in reserve, was committed on the left flank of the Frontier Force Regiment to advance in the direction of Crecchio and overran a number of German positions. By the end of 16 December, further attacks from the 15th Punjab Regiments 3rd Battalion had secured positions on the <b>lateral</b> <b>road,</b> ensuring that the 8th Indian Division was firmly embedded in the main German defences.|$|E

[...] Less than 100 m behind this barrage, the 48th Highlanders would advance across the Ortona-Orsogna <b>Lateral</b> <b>Road.</b> At the same time, the 8th Indian Division would attack northward toward Crecchio, preventing German reinforcements from reaching The Gully. When the 48th Highlanders reached the Cider Crossroads, the Royal Canadian Regiment would move north, overrunning Cider itself, then advance up the Ortona-Orsogna road. Both battalions would be supported by tanks of The Three Rivers Regiment. At first, the attack went extremely well. However, when the artillery shifted their barrage, the German defences quickly recovered and their machine gun fire devastated the advancing forces. In C Company of the Royal Canadian Regiment, every platoon commander was killed or wounded. The attack was quickly abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|At around 11:55p.m. on Friday, February 22, 1946, Jimmy Hollis, age 25, and his girlfriend, Mary Jeanne Larey, age 19, were {{attacked}} while parked on a secluded road {{known as a}} lovers' lane. The attack happened on a <b>lateral</b> <b>road</b> off of Richmond Road, a mile north of the addition known as Beverly. According to a fourteen-page statement by Hollis, the attack happened about [...] off Richmond Road on an unpaved street, about 100yards from the last row of city homes.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Hollis was a 25-year-old {{insurance}} agent {{at the time}} of the attack. He was born September 25, 1920. He lived at 3502 N. State Line Avenue; a house which no longer exists. On the night of his attack, he was at the movies on a double date with his brother, Bob, who was also an {{insurance agent}}. After the movie, he dropped his brother and his date off. While he was taking his girlfriend home, they stopped on a <b>lateral</b> <b>road</b> off of Richmond where the attack occurred. Hollis suffered three fractures in his skull and was hospitalized for several days at Texarkana Hospital (also known as Pine Street Hospital) which stood at W. 5th and Pine street and no longer exists. He was in critical condition. After four days, he showed slight improvement but was still not fully conscious. He was released from the hospital on Saturday, March 9. His doctor told him it would be [...] "some time" [...] before he was completely well again and that he was not to work for six months. By the middle of May, he was still recovering from his injuries. Three months after the attack, he stated [...] "I still get nervous when I think about it. At night, on the street, even downtown." [...] Hollis was questioned several times by officers after the other killings. Starting at the end of April, he spent a week with Larey in Frederick, Oklahoma before residing in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hollis eventually married and had seven children. He had a Bachelor of Arts in history and a Master of Science in Public Administration. He worked for the US government. He loved to dress in western clothing, including a cowboy hat, a holster and a pistol. He appeared in the 1971 television film They've Killed President Lincoln as Vice President Andrew Johnson. He eventually moved to Houston where he began working for NASA. Hollis died in his sleep at the age of 54. His family remembered him for his jokes and sense of humor, as well as his love for the outdoors, including camping and hunting.|$|E

By this stage, Allied aircraft had been moved forward to airfields in Tunisia to prevent the aerial supply of Axis troops in North Africa (Operation Flax) and large numbers of German transport aircraft were shot down between Sicily and Tunis. British destroyers operating from Malta prevented marine supply, reinforcement or evacuation of Tunisia by sea (Operation Retribution).

40|$|International audienceThis brief {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} nonlinear observer design for both the estimation of vehicle <b>lateral</b> dynamics and <b>road</b> curvature. The latter is recovered by a simple algebraic technique and high-order sliding mode differentiator, which allows to estimate exactly the time derivatives of measured signals. For the lateral dynamics of the vehicle, a new approach is developed {{by the use of}} a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model representing exactly, with no loss of information, the nonlinear vehicle behavior in a compact set of the state space. The TS model involves unmeasured premise variables. The proposed new observer starts with the estimation of these premise variables. Second, the design of an observer with weighting functions depending on these estimated premise variables is considered. Theoretically, the proposed observer ensures exponential convergence of the state estimation error toward zero. This convergence is studied by the Lyapunov theory and the obtained stability conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, experimental results are given for vehicle <b>lateral</b> dynamics and <b>road</b> curvature estimation with real data...|$|R
