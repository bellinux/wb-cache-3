2500|$|The {{total number}} of relays, cam timers and drum sequencers can number into the {{hundreds}} or even thousands in some factories. Early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, {{one of the first}} being <b>ladder</b> <b>logic,</b> where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called programmable logic controllers were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit.|$|E

40|$|Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) are {{presently}} being {{widely used in}} industries for the automation of various processes involved such as controlling machines or factory assembly lines and complex process control using advanced control algorithms. Earlier automation systems had to use thousands of individual relays and cam timers, {{but all of the}} relays and timers within a factory system can often be replaced with a single programmable logic controller. Today, programmable logic controllers deliver a wide range of functionality, including basic relay control, motion control, process control, and complex networking, as well as being used in Distributed Control Systems and SCADA systems Process controls in industries are mainly of three types: 1. Continuous Linear Control –This includes PID control. 2. Continuous Non-Linear Control-This includes the FUZZY control. 3. Sequential Control This paper is divided into two parts. In the first part the operation and structure of PLCs is described and programming of PLCs using <b>ladder</b> <b>logics.</b> In the second part the PLC is used to implement the three type of control algorithms viz: PID control (linear control), FUZZY control (Non-linear control) in the backdrop of most commonly encountered industrial process which is temperature control and sequential control in water treatment plant.

40|$|The {{main feature}} of a run-off river {{hydroelectric}} {{system is a}} small size intake pond that overspills when river flow is more than turbines’ intake. As river flow fluctuates, {{a large proportion of}} the potential energy is wasted due to the spillages which can occur when turbines are operated manually. Manual operation is often adopted due to unreliability of water level-based controllers at many remote and unmanned run-off river hydropower plants. In order to overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method by developing a controller that derives turbine output set points from computed mass flow rate of rivers that feed the hydroelectric system. The computed flow is derived by summation of pond volume difference with numerical integration of both turbine discharge flows and spillages. This approach of estimating river flow allows the use of existing sensors rather than requiring the installation of new ones. All computations, including the numerical integration, have been realized as <b>ladder</b> <b>logics</b> on a programmable logic controller. The implemented controller manages the dynamic changes in the flow rate of the river better than the old point-level based controller, with the aid of a newly installed water level sensor. The computed mass flow rate of the river also allows the controller to straightforwardly determine the number of turbines to be in service with considerations of turbine efficiencies and auxiliary power conservation...|$|R

40|$|Most {{blasthole}} drills {{currently used}} in the mining industry are manually controlled. The drilling control systems which do exist are based mainly on <b>ladder</b> programming <b>logic</b> techniques. This thesis presents a comprehensive strategy for the automatic control of blasthole drills, based on closed loop feedback control approach. A detailed model for the controlled process consisting of the drill rig's mechanical actuators, machine structure, and the drilling process at the bit-rock interface is presented. The model equations are refined and validated by experimental (field) testing. The instrumentation of an Ingersoll-Rand DM- 45 E drill rig and the subsequent drilling tests in a limestone quarry are described, with an in-depth discussion of the field tests results. Analysis of the field tests data establishes the dependencies between the drilling variables and ground conditions during actual drilling. The transfer functions of the mechanical actuators of the machine are also identified. A strategy for automatic control of feed pressure and rotary speed is proposed. The controller is tested and tuned by interfacing it to a software simulator of the controlled process which implements the relationships identified from field testing. Simulation results are presented and analysed. Results of implementing the controller on a Gardner-Denver GD- 120 electric drill, and an Ingersoll-Rand DM-H hydraulic drill at two surface coal mines in British Columbia, Canada, are also presented. These results validate the drilling controller design and tuning. The thesis concludes with suggestions for future research and refinement of the control strategy...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{nutrient}} solution parameters {{is very important}} for the growth and development of plants grown hydroponically. Protocols involving different {{nutrient solution}} replenishment times (e. g. one-week, two-week, or two-day replenishment) provide manual periodic control of the nutrient solution's electrical conductivity (EC). Since plants take-up nutrients as they grow, manual control has a drawback in that EC is not held constant between replenishments. In an effort to correct this problem the Center for Food and Environmental Systems for Human Exploration of Space at Tuskegee University has developed a system for managing and controlling levels of EC over a plant's entire growing cycle. A prototype system is being tested on sweetpotato production using the nutrient film technique (NFT), and it is being compared to a system in which sweetpotatoes are grown using NFT with manual control. NASA has {{played an important role in}} the development of environmental control systems. They have become a forerunner in growing plants hydroponically with some control systems through the use of networked data acquisition and control using environmental growth chambers. Data acquisition systems which involve the use of real-time, calibration, set points, user panel, and graphical representation programming provide a good method of controlling nutrient solution parameters such as EC and pH [Bledsoe, 19931]. In NASA's Biomass Production Chamber (BPC) at Kennedy Space Center, control is provided by a programmable logic controller (PLC). This is an industrial controller which combines <b>ladder</b> computer <b>logic</b> which has the ability to handle various levels of electrical power. The controller controls temperature, light and other parameters that affect the plant's environment, in the BPC, the Nutrient Delivery System (NIX), a sub-system of the PLC, controls nutrient solution parameters such as EC, pH, and solution levels. When the nutrient EC measurement goes outside a preset range (120 - 130 mS/m) a set amount of a stock solution of nutrients is automatically added by a metering pump to bring the EC back into operating range [Fortson, 1992]. This paper describes a system developed at Tuskegee University for controlling the EC of a nutrient solution used for growing sweetpotatoes with an EC controller and a computer with LabView data acquisition and instrumentation software. It also describes the preliminary data obtained from the growth of sweetpotatoes using this prototype control system...|$|R
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Bachillerato en Ingeniería Electrónica) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electrónica, 2001. The {{traditional}} coupling {{technology for}} PVC water pipes consists in attaching a belling {{end with a}} normal end of another tube, applying paste for PVC. However it has been reached {{to the conclusion that}} this method is not ideal due to the tendency to create leaks because of pressure. Therefore, research and development works led to {{what is known as the}} RIEBER System. This system consists basically on a special belling of the PVC tubes, where metallic packing covered with rubber is incorporated. This allows joining to tubes without the necessity to use paste for PVC, the two ends are coupled by means of pressure. At the moment most of the belling machines are designed to do belling without packing. For this reason, it becomes necessary to carry out a conversion in these machines. Additionally, to implement the conversion of these machines to the new system it is appealed to the employment of several makers PLC´s. In general, incompatibilities exist between the I/O interfaces among PLC´s. In this project the control and simulation of a belling machine with high level programming (InControl and InTouch) was developed. This allows reusing the generated code without a great effort. Avoiding the dependence of the PLC manufacturers and their incompability of programming languages, that causes of having to generate new code for the control of a specific process. The software used in the project also offers programming flexibility, since it allows the use and interaction of diverse programming languages like: Relay <b>Logic</b> <b>Ladder</b> (RLL), Structured text and Sequential Function Chart (SFC).

50|$|<b>Ladder</b> <b>logic</b> {{has evolved}} into a {{programming}} language that represents a program by a graphical diagram based on the circuit diagrams of relay logic hardware. <b>Ladder</b> <b>logic</b> is used to develop software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in industrial control applications.

While ladder diagrams were once the only available notation for recording programmable controller programs, today other forms are standardized in IEC 61131-3 (For example, {{as an alternative to the}} graphical <b>ladder</b> <b>logic</b> form, there is also a more assembly language like format called Instruction list within the IEC 61131-3 standard.).|$|E

6000|$|But this {{lingering}} yet living {{power in}} the legend, even for those to whom it {{is little more than}} a legend, has another relevancy to the particular point here. Jesus of Nazareth, merely humanly considered, has thus become a hero of humanitarianism. Even the eighteenth-century deists in denying his divinity generally took pains to exalt his humanity. Of the nineteenth-century revolutionists it is really an understatement to say that they exalted him as a man; for indeed they rather exalted him as a superman. That is to say, many of them represented him as a man preaching a decisively superior and ever strange morality, not only in advance of his age but practically in advance of our age. They made of his mystical counsels of perfection a sort of Socialism or Pacifism or Communism, which they themselves still see rather as something that ought to be or that will be; the extreme limit of universal love. I am not discussing here whether they are right or not; I say they have in fact found in the same figure a type of humanitarianism and the care for human happiness. Every one knows the striking and sometimes staggering utterances that do really support and illustrate this side of the teaching. Modern idealists are naturally moved by such things as the intensely poetic paradox about the lilies of the field; which for them has a joy in life and living things like that of Shelley or Whitman, combined with a return to simplicity beyond that of Tolstoy or Thoreau. Indeed I rather wonder that those, whose merely historic or humanistic view of the case would allow of such criticism without incongruity, have not made some study of the purely poetical or oratorical structure of such passages. Certainly there are few finer examples of the swift architecture of style than that single fragment about the flowers; the almost idle opening of a chance reference to a wild flower, the sudden unfolding of the small purple blossom into pavilions and palaces and the great name of the national history; and then with a turn of the hand like a gesture of scorn, the change to the grass that to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven. Then follows, as so often in the Gospels, the [...] "how much more" [...] which is like a celestial flight of stairs, a <b>ladder</b> of imaginative <b>logic.</b> Indeed this a fortiori, and this power of thinking on three levels, is (I may remark incidentally) a thing very much needed in modern discussion. Many minds apparently cannot stretch to three dimensions, or to thinking that a cube can go beyond a surface as a surface goes beyond a line; for instance, that the citizen is infinitely above all ranks, and yet the soul is infinitely above the citizen. But we are only concerned at the moment with the sides of this many-sided mystery which happen to be really in sympathy with the modern mood. Judged even by our modern tests of emancipated art or ideal economics, it is admitted that Christ understood all that is rather crudely embodied in Socialism or the Simple Life. I purposely insist first on this optimistic, I might almost say this pantheistic or even this pagan aspect of the Christian Gospels. For it is only when we understand that Christ, considered merely as a prophet, can be and is a popular leader in the love of natural things, that we can feel that tremendous and tragic energy of his testimony to an ugly reality, the existence of unnatural things. Instead of taking a text as I have done, take a whole Gospel and read it steadily and honestly and straight through at a sitting, and you will certainly have one impression, whether of a myth or of a man. It is that the exorcist towers above the poet and even the prophet; that the story between Cana and Calvary is one long war with demons. He understood better than a hundred poets the beauty of the flowers of the battle-field; but he came out to battle. And if most of his words mean anything they do mean that there is at our very feet, like a chasm concealed among the flowers, an unfathomable evil.|$|R
5000|$|This latch {{configuration}} is {{a common}} idiom in <b>ladder</b> <b>logic.</b> In <b>ladder</b> <b>logic</b> it {{is referred to as}} seal-in logic.

50|$|Many early PLCs did {{not have}} {{accompanying}} programming terminals that were capable of graphical representation of the logic, and so the logic was instead represented {{as a series of}} logic expressions in some version of Boolean format, similar to Boolean algebra.

Newer formats such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still not as popular as <b>ladder</b> <b>logic.</b> A primary {{reason for this is that}} PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and <b>ladder</b> <b>logic</b> allows the programmer (the person writing the logic) to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.|$|E

5000|$|The {{motivation}} for representing sequential control logic in a ladder diagram was to allow factory engineers and technicians to develop software without additional training {{to learn a}} language such as FORTRAN or other general purpose computer language.
