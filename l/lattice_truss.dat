5|$|The West Cornwall Covered Bridge (an earlier {{incarnation}} {{was known}} as the Hart Bridge) is a wooden covered <b>lattice</b> <b>truss</b> bridge carrying the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike over the Housatonic River in the town of Cornwall, Connecticut. Records indicate that a bridge may have been in place in this location as early as 1762. A previous bridge was destroyed in the flood of 1837 and a new bridge was constructed in 1841. This bridge would also be destroyed and the current bridge would be completed circa 1864. Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and single span, the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E

25|$|Officially {{designated}} as mine destructor vessels, the Cybele class {{was a large}} trimaran vessel, constructed using a steel <b>lattice</b> <b>truss</b> framework.

500|$|Constructed in 1864, the West Cornwall covered {{bridge is}} [...] long, [...] wide and {{supports}} one lane of vehicle traffic for the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike (Connecticut Route 128). The bridge's Town <b>lattice</b> <b>truss</b> is constructed of red-spruce timbers secured by treenails and the span {{is made of}} native oak. A secondary queen-post truss {{was added to the}} bridge at a later date, with one source stating that this was in 1887. The addition of the queen-post truss was likely to stiffen the bridge because wooden trusses have a tendency to sag. Prior to 1946, the bridge had a square port with a flat top, but this was modified to a gable roof which remains today. In 1957, the bridge was painted red for the first time.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA general {{procedure}} {{to determine the}} equivalent beam properties of beam-like <b>lattice</b> <b>trusses</b> is presented. The method {{is based on the}} energy equivalence. Its main features are the use of piecewise linear functions to represent the displacements, and the definition of the continuum stress and strain parameters by their average values over the continuum cell. This allows a unifying approach to be obtained to derive methods for computing the effective beam properties. It is shown {{that there is only one}} rigorous method, and this method takes the lattice periodicity into account. Moreover, the classical method based on static condensation is found to be only approximate, The procedure is applied to examples of planar <b>lattice</b> <b>trusses</b> in static analysis. The results prove the effectiveness and the reliability of the present approach, and comparisons are made with results obtained from other classical methods...|$|R

500|$|The {{company was}} unable to finance the {{building}} of Ordish's design, and in 1870 a new Act of Parliament was passed giving the company permission to build a bridge [...] wide, crossing the river with five spans. Ordish was asked to design a cheaper bridge to the new specifications but refused to change the design, so Julian Tolmé was appointed designer in his place. Tolmé designed a starkly functional <b>lattice</b> <b>truss</b> bridge of wrought iron. It cost £40,000 (about £ in [...] ) to build, and consisted of five identical spans, supported by four pairs of concrete-filled iron piers; each of the cylindrical piers was sunk [...] into the riverbed. The bridge was due to open in early 1873, but the workmen building it went on strike, and a third Act of Parliament was necessary to give the company time to resolve the dispute and complete the project.|$|E

However, Emil Brizay, a French engineer refugee from Singapore {{in the office of}} MR Hornibrook is also credited with designing the construction system on which the igloo was modelled. The igloos at Eagle Farm were one of several designs for lightweight long span structures which utilised timber in small sectional sizes of chords to enable the <b>lattice</b> <b>trusses</b> to be hand nailed in jigs on site and speedily erected at low cost.|$|R
