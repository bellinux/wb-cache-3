40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control design approach for sheet control in a printer paper path. By splitting up the control problem in two levels, i. e. low <b>level</b> <b>motor</b> control loops {{and a high}} level sheet control loop, a hierarchical control structure is obtained. The high level sheet dynamics are formulated in the piecewise linear modeling formalism. Given this model, together with models of the controlled low <b>level</b> <b>motor</b> dynamics, a high level feedback controller is designed with guaranteed H infinity performance. The designed controller is implemented on a experimental paper path setup to show {{the effectiveness of the}} control design in practice...|$|R

40|$|Hierarchical {{models of}} motor {{function}} {{are described in}} which the motor system encodes a hierarchy of dynamical motor primitives. The models are based on continuous attractor neural networks, in which the packet of neural activity representing the position (in the state space) is moved by path integration using a motor efference copy after training with a traced associative learning rule. Sequences of movements can be learned because the state space modulates the effects of an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>motor</b> command. A high-level motor command selects a set of intermediate <b>level</b> <b>motor</b> commands, and the whole movement sequence evolves with the correct order because the state space representation effectively selects the next possible intermediate level command. Thus a single high-level motor command can select whole movement trajectories composed {{of a set of}} motor primitives. It is further shown that the network can perform completely novel motor sequences, and thus provides one solution to Lashley’s ‘problem of serial order in behaviour’. r 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Title: Motor {{skills of}} special schools pupils Objectives: The {{main purpose of}} this work was {{to find out the}} <b>level</b> of <b>motor</b> skills of {{specials}} schools pupils in the practical test battery and the obtained value confront with results of pupils of common primary school. Methods: To determine the <b>level</b> of <b>motor</b> skills of special schools pupils and elementary school pupils was used to test battery Oseretzki for age group 13 - 14 years. The battery includes the following tests - 1. "balance the right and left leg", 2. "coordination of fingers", 3. "jumpig", 4. "tapping", 5. "grading of coin and matches", 6. "wink". Results: In terms of average performance in individual's test was demonstrated lower <b>levels</b> of <b>motor</b> skills of special schools pupils. In terms of values of Cohen's index "d" (outline 0, 5) was a lower <b>level</b> of <b>motor</b> skills demonstrated by girls in tests "balance the right and left leg", "knitwork", "tapping" and "wink". By the boys was demonstrated in test "balance to the right and left leg" and "wink". In the overall assessment performance of boys and girls together was lower <b>levels</b> of <b>motor</b> skills detected just a tests "balance to the right and left leg", "koordination of fingers" and "wink".

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{therapeutics}} {{directed to}} the injured spinal cord, a change in neurological impairment has been proposed as a relevant acute clinical study end point. However, changes in neurological function, even if statistically significant, may not {{be associated with a}} functional impact, such as a meaningful improvement in items within the self-care subscore of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the functional significance associated with spontaneously recovering upper-extremity motor function after sensorimotor-complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Using the European Multi-center Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI) data set, a retrospective analysis was undertaken of individuals with cervical sensorimotor-complete SCI (initial <b>motor</b> <b>level,</b> C 4 -C 7). Specifically, changes in upper-extremity motor score (UEMS), <b>motor</b> <b>level,</b> and SCIM (total and self-care subscore) were assessed between approximately 1 and 48 weeks after injury (n = 74). RESULTS: The initial <b>motor</b> <b>level</b> did not significantly influence the total UEMS recovered or number of <b>motor</b> <b>levels</b> recovered. SCIM self-care subscore recovery was significantly greater for those individuals regaining 2 <b>motor</b> <b>levels</b> compared with those recovering only 1 or no <b>motor</b> <b>levels.</b> However, the recovery in the SCIM self-care subscore was not significantly different between individuals recovering only 1 <b>motor</b> <b>level</b> and those individuals who showed no motor-level improvement. CONCLUSIONS: A 2 motor-level improvement indicates a clinically meaningful change and might be considered a primary outcome in acute and subacute interventional trials enrolling individuals with cervical sensorimotor-complete SCI...|$|R
