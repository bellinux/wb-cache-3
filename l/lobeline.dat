5000|$|As {{a member}} of the genus Lobelia, it is {{considered}} to be potentially toxic. [...] Symptoms of ingestion of large quantities include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, exhaustion and weakness, dilation of pupils, convulsions, and coma.

50|$|<b>Lobeline</b> is an {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} a variety of plants, particularly those in the genus Lobelia, including Indian tobacco (Lobelia inflata), Devil's tobacco (Lobelia tupa), cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis), great lobelia (Lobelia siphilitica), Lobelia chinensis, and Hippobroma longiflora. In its pure form, it is a white amorphous powder which is freely soluble in water.|$|E
50|$|The {{piperidine}} structural motif {{is present}} in numerous natural alkaloids. These include piperine, which gives black pepper its spicy taste. This gave the compound its name. Other examples are the fire ant toxin solenopsin, the nicotine analog anabasine of tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca), <b>lobeline</b> of Indian tobacco, and the toxic alkaloid coniine from poison hemlock, which was used to put Socrates to death.|$|E
50|$|Its latex {{is used as}} an abortifacient, and a hallucinogen, {{which may}} explain one of its common names, Tabaco del Diablo (Devil's tobacco). Ironically, this plant {{has been used as}} a counter effect herb on {{nicotine}} addiction because of alkaloid <b>Lobeline,</b> a nicotinic agonist. The Mapuche Indians of Southern Chile consider it a sacred plant. Tupa leaves have also been found to contain chemicals that act as a respiratory stimulant.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{members of}} the genus are {{considered}} poisonous, with some containing the toxic principle <b>lobeline.</b> [...] Because of lobeline's similarity to nicotine, the internal use of lobelia may be dangerous to susceptible populations, including children, pregnant women, and individuals with cardiac disease. Excessive use will cause nausea and vomiting. [...] It is not recommended for use by pregnant women and is best administered by a practitioner qualified in its use. It also has a chemical known as lobellicyonycin, which may cause dizziness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lobeline</b> has {{multiple}} mechanisms of action, {{acting as a}} VMAT2 ligand, which stimulates dopamine release to a moderate extent when administered alone, but reduces the dopamine release caused by methamphetamine. It also inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin, and acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to which it binds at the subunit interfaces of the extracellular domain. It is also an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors. It {{seems to be a}} P-glycoprotein inhibitor, according to at least one study. It has been hypothesized that P-glycoprotein inhibition reduces chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer, presumably affecting any substrates of P-gp.|$|E
5000|$|The bird-pollinated {{flowers of}} L. telekii are hidden among the large bracts within the inflorescence. The leaves and bracts are blue-green, {{and the flowers}} purple.

It inhabits the drier hill slopes, while its close relative Lobelia keniensis prefers the moister valley bottoms. Hybrids do occur. The hill slopes often have rocky moraines that are home to Mount Kenya rock hyrax, which sometimes eat lobelia leaves and inflorescences, but herbivores are generally deterred by the lobelia's bitter toxic sap, which contains alkaloids, probably including <b>lobeline.</b>|$|E

As of 1987, he was study a recent in the increased use of smokeless tobacco. He has conducted clinical trials with the use of many delivery forms of nicotine available on the US and European markets, including gum, transdermal patches, oral nicotine inhalers, nasal spray, and sublingual tablets. Glover also conducted trials with bupropion (Zyban, a monocyclic antidepressant) and varenicline (Chantix, a nicotine receptor and partial agonist) which resulted in both being approved for use in the US. In addition, he has studied the use of <b>lobeline</b> as a nicotine blocker, and various psychoactive substances including anti-depressants and anti-anxiety agents. He has also investigated rimonabant (an endocabinnoid), varenicline (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) and 3′AmNic-rEPA (a nicotine conjugate vaccine).|$|E
40|$|Behavioural {{studies have}} yielded results that show <b>lobeline</b> {{has the ability}} to {{attenuate}} d-methamphetamine self-administration. Further in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated a blockade of μ-opioid receptors with <b>lobeline.</b> The present investigation examined the ability of <b>lobeline</b> to attenuate heroin intravenous (i. v.) self-administration when administered prior to testing. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were surgically implanted with jugular catheters and trained to lever press for i. v. heroin infusions (18 μg/kg) under a fixed ratio- 2 schedule wherein two active lever presses resulted in heroin delivery. Rats then were tested for heroin self-administration after pretreatment with subcutaneous <b>lobeline</b> injections (0. 3, 1. 0, or 3. 0 mg/kg, 15 min prior to testing sessions). At doses of 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/kg, <b>lobeline</b> attenuated self-administration of heroin. The results suggest a potential for <b>lobeline</b> to be used in pharmacotherapy for opioid abuse...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the physiological role of native low- and high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in regulating dopamine (DA) release from striatal DA terminals. To evaluate the functional interactions {{of the two}} receptor subtypes, nicotine (which interacts with both high- and low-affinity nAChRs) and <b>lobeline</b> (which selectively interacts with high-affinity nAChRs) were perfused through a microdialysis probe implanted into the striatum of freely moving rats. The DA content of successive dialysates was quantified by HPLC with an electrochemical detector. A short-lasting (1 -min) perfusion of nicotine or <b>lobeline</b> dose-dependently increased the DA content of striatal dialysates. A second application of the same dose of nicotine resulted in an attenuated DA increase, compared with the increase elicited by the first application; however, the DA increase elicited by a second application of <b>lobeline</b> {{was similar to that}} of the first <b>lobeline</b> application. The nicotine-induced response was not attenuated when it followed a <b>Lobeline</b> perfusion; in contrast, if the nicotine perfusion preceded that of <b>lobeline,</b> the lobeline-induced response was attenuated. In the presence of mecamylamine (a noncompetitive nAChR antagonist), the increase in DA content of striatal dialysate samples induced by either nicotine or <b>lobeline</b> was attenuated. However, in the presence of methyllycaconitine (a preferential antagonist for low-affinity alpha homomeric nAChRs) the nicotine response was attenuated but that of <b>lobeline</b> was unaffected. These results suggest that the functional inactivation of striatal nAChRs requires the simultaneous activation of both low- and high-affinity nAChRs. Since <b>lobeline</b> is devoid of reinforcing properties, one might infer that the reinforcing properties of nicotine require the simultaneous activation of high- and low-affinity brain nAChRs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableLobeline {{has high}} {{affinity}} for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inhibits {{the function of}} vesicular and plasmalemmal monoamine transporters. Moreover, <b>lobeline</b> {{has been shown to}} alter the neurochemical and behavioral effects of psychostimulants. In drug discrimination studies, <b>lobeline</b> generalized to cocaine and diminished the stimulus properties of methamphetamine. The present study determined the effect of <b>lobeline,</b> nicotine, mecamylamine and hexamethonium on the discriminative stimulus properties of low doses of cocaine (1. 6 or 5. 0 mg/kg) or d-amphetamine (0. 3 mg/kg) in rats, using a standard two-lever drug discrimination procedure for food reinforcement. Nicotine partially generalized to amphetamine and fully generalized to cocaine, although the discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine and amphetamine were not altered by mecamylamine or hexamethonium. In contrast, <b>lobeline</b> fully generalized to cocaine, but did not generalize to amphetamine. In antagonism tests, <b>lobeline</b> doses that did not generalize to cocaine decreased responding on the cocaine-paired levers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Lobeline</b> is {{a partial}} {{nicotine}} agonist, {{which has been}} used in a variety of commercially available preparations to help stop smoking. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of <b>lobeline</b> on long term smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register (most recent search December 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials comparing <b>lobeline</b> to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control, which reported smoking cessation with at least six months follow-up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and form of <b>lobeline,</b> the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no trials meeting the full inclusion criteria including long term follow-up. One large trial failed to detect any effect on short-term abstinence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence available from long term trials that <b>lobeline</b> can aid smoking cessation, and the short-term evidence suggests there is no benefit...|$|E
40|$|Article signalé par l'éditeur en {{open access}} plus : [URL] audienceDocking of <b>lobeline,</b> a partial agonist of nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs), was investigated at once into crystallographic structures of acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBP) and into 7 and 42 nAChRs homology models, and compared to behavior of full agonists, nicotine and epibatidine. The homology models were built using as templates the different pocket geometries established in crystallographic AChBP structures. Systematic cross-docking of each ligand into binding {{pockets of the}} two other ligands {{as well as its}} self-docking into its own pocket were performed in order to better understand the structural features determining the binding of these three ligands chosen for their molecular diversity. In AChBPs, epibatidine and nicotine display similar docking scores in their own pocket and in other ligands pockets: in particular, they also dock favorably into the <b>lobeline</b> pocket. In opposite, <b>lobeline</b> displays different features: it only binds favorably to its own pocket in AChBPs. Furthermore, the docking poses observed starting from <b>lobeline</b> stereoisomers support the importance of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the alcohol function of the-phenyl-hydroxyethyl arm and the piperidinium proton for the <b>lobeline</b> binding to AChBP. For homology models, cross-dockings are still discriminating and the specificity of <b>lobeline</b> for its binding pocket is conserved...|$|E
40|$|In vivo brain {{microdialysis}} {{was used}} to investigate the influence of <b>lobeline</b> on dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) overflow {{in the core of}} the nucleus accumbens of freely-moving rats pretreated with nicotine (0. 4 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c., once per day for 5 days). Locomotion was also recorded. <b>Lobeline,</b> at doses of 0. 7, 4. 0 and 10. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., failed to elicit any significant changes in extracellular dopamine or dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels during the 60 [*]min following its administration and did not stimulate locomotor. The dopamine responses to nicotine (0. 4 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.), were abolished (P< 0. 01) if the nicotine challenge was administered 10 [*]min but not 60 [*]min, after <b>lobeline</b> doses of 4. 0 and 10. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., but were unaffected following <b>lobeline</b> at the lowest dose tested (0. 7 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) at either time.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>lobeline</b> and tubocurarine on the voltage-clamped {{endplates}} of frog sartorius and cutaneous pectoris muscles were examined {{at room temperature}} (20 - 23 °C). Like tubocurarine, <b>lobeline</b> causes nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The half-time of decay (t½) of endplate currents (e. p. c. s) recorded at a holding potential (Vm) of - 90 mV was significantly shorter in endplates treated with <b>lobeline</b> (50 μM; mean t½ ± SEM = 0. 41 ± 0. 02 ms) or tubocurarine (11. 4 μM; t½ = 0. 64 ± 0. 04 ms) than in those treated with Mg 2 + (13 mM; t½ = 1. 39 ± 0. 11 ms) or a low concentration of tubocurarine (3 μM; t½ = 0. 87 ± 0. 05 ms). Similarly, <b>lobeline</b> (10 μM) shortened the t½ of untreated miniature e. p. c. s by 35 %; tubocurarine, however, abolished miniature e. p. c. s at the concentration required to observe its actions on e. p. c. decay kinetics. The t½ of e. p. c. s recorded from preparations treated with Mg 2 + (13 mM), tubocurarine at low concentrations (3 μM), or untreated miniature e. p. c. s was logarithmically related to Vm, being slower at more hyperpolarized values. By contrast, the t½s of e. p. c. s recorded in either <b>lobeline</b> (50 μM) or tubocurarine (11. 4 μM) were independent of voltage in the range - 150 to - 80 mV. The ability of <b>lobeline</b> to shorten t½ and to remove the voltage dependence of t½ was partially antagonized by Mg 2 + (13 mM). As expected, when <b>lobeline</b> or tubocurarine {{was removed from the}} bath or when acetylcholine release from the motor nerve terminals was increased by 4 -aminopyridine (20 μM) and Ca 2 + (10 mM) (in the presence of <b>lobeline</b> or tubocurarine), the amplitude of e. p. c. s increased as a function of time. However, the t½ of the decay phase of the e. p. c. s remained shortened (i. e., unaltered from the earlier treatment). These results suggest that both tubocurarine and <b>lobeline</b> have at least two distinct postjunctional actions including: (i) a block of the acetylcholine receptor and (ii) a block of the ionic channel associated with the acetylcholine receptor...|$|E
40|$|Activation of {{pulmonary}} C fibres (J receptors) {{in animals}} produces inhibition of spinal motoneurones. Intravenous bolus injections of <b>lobeline</b> {{are believed to}} activate pulmonary C fibres (J receptors) in human subjects and to produce characteristic sensations and cardiorespiratory responses. This study quantified the respiratory sensations evoked by such injections and then used a range of suprathreshold doses of <b>lobeline</b> and tested {{for the presence of}} reflex or descending inhibition of motoneuronal output. Injections of <b>lobeline</b> produced dose-dependent sensations of respiratory discomfort referred to the throat and upper chest beginning within about 10 s and often associated with coughing. As the dose increased the latency for the sensations decreased while their duration and intensity increased. Reflex changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ventilation also occurred. Injections of <b>lobeline</b> at doses sufficient to evoke respiratory discomfort lasting 25 - 32 s (37 - 73 μg kg− 1) increased the size of the H reflex in soleus with an onset latency of about 10 s and lasting about 20 s. The size of EMG responses evoked in upper limb muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex increased shortly after injections and remained elevated for about 30 - 35 s. Injections of <b>lobeline</b> during sustained voluntary contractions of the elbow flexors at submaximal or maximal levels did not impair the ability to produce force. Walking was not disrupted by repeated suprathreshold doses of <b>lobeline.</b> It is concluded that injections of <b>lobeline</b> sufficient to evoke cardiorespiratory reflexes and sensations of severe respiratory discomfort are not associated with functionally important inhibition of motor performance. The results cast doubt on the ability of the J reflex to limit exercise in humans...|$|E

40|$|The {{respiratory}} stimulant <b>lobeline</b> {{has been}} used in equine clinical practice to increase inspiratory and expiratory airflow rates at rest in orderto facilitate investigation of both lower and upper airway function. Some of the responses to <b>lobeline</b> in the pony have been reported, but the detailed time course, effect of dose, possible side effects and reproducibility associated with <b>lobeline</b> administration have not been described in the horse. Respiratory airflow rates and oesophageal pre s s u re were measured with a Fleisch No. 5 pneumotachometer and lightweight facemask and amicrotip pressure transducer catheter, respectively. The output of the Fleisch pneumotachometer was calibrated for flow rates up to ± 70 l/s. Seven mature horses with no clinical signs of respiratory disease were studied. Investigations were conducted to determine: (1) the responses to different doses of <b>lobeline</b> (0. 15, 0. 20, 0. 25 and 0. 30 mg/kg bwt) as a rapid i. v. bolus (6 horses); (2) arterial blood gases during and after <b>lobeline</b> administration (0. 20 mg/kg bwt; 3 horses); and (3) the reproducibility of lobeline-stimulated hyperpnoea (5 horses; 2 doses of 0. 20 mg/kg bwt <b>lobeline,</b> 15 min apart). All horses tolerated the lobeline-stimulated hyperpnoea well, although one always coughed or snorted at the onset. Mild tremor was noted following the highest dose in several horses. Apnoea of approximately 40 s was common after the hyperpnoea. Both tidal volume (VT) and frequency (fR) increased with <b>lobeline</b> dose. During peak hyperpnoea at a dose of 0. 30 mg/kg bwt, peak inspired flow rate (PIF), peak expired flow rate (PEF) and minute ventilation (. VE) were mean ± s. e. 41 ± 5 l/s, 61 ± 10 l/s and 920 ± 99 l/min, respectively. The hyperpnoea also caused marked changes in arterial PaO 2, PaCO 2 and pHa at 90 s after <b>lobeline</b> (0. 20 mg/kg bwt) administration (mean ± s. e. 146. 0 ± 6. 9 mmHg, 20. 6 ± 0. 8 mmHg and 7. 707 ± 0. 020, respectively) compared to at rest (mean ± s. e. 104. 0 ± 4. 0 mmHg, 50. 6 ± 2. 8 mmHg and 7. 432 ± 0. 012). Dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) was unaltered by <b>lobeline</b> administration. The lobeline-induced hyperpnoea was highly reproducible, with no significant difference in any of the parameters during 2 stimulations 15 min apart. <b>Lobeline</b> induced highly reproducible responses without any apparent adverse effects and may be useful in the investigation of pulmonary function in healthy horses and those with airway disease.
