50|$|Health {{literacy}} {{is the ability}} to obtain, read, understand, and use healthcare information in order to make appropriate health decisions and follow instructions for treatment. There are multiple definitions of health literacy, in part, because health literacy involves both the context (or setting) in which health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> are made (e.g., health care, media, internet or fitness facility) and the skills that people bring to that situation (Rudd, Moeykens, & Colton, 1999). Studies reveal that only 12 percent of the adults in the U.S. have proficient health literacy. This means 77 million adults have basic or below basic health literacy. These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug. Low health literacy reduces the success of treatment and increases the risk of medical error. Health {{literacy is}} essential to promote healthy individuals and communities.|$|E
50|$|Genna May {{was born}} in 1898 on a dairy farm in central Wisconsin and she began {{attending}} school in a period when schooling was required only 12 weeks a year. Outside of school, literacy played a small role in her life and after graduating high school, she enrolled in college {{just long enough to}} learn to type and obtain a job with a company manufacturing disinfectants for dairy barns. During the Great Depression, the agricultural conditions in the Midwest changed dramatically as small family farms sold out to larger agricultural distributors. The number of people involved in agriculture decreased dramatically and many farmers found themselves performing work, such as transportation, sales, and clerical support, which required extensive record keeping. <b>Literacy</b> <b>demands</b> began changing during this period. For example, Brandt notes, “Whereas farm-based writing might have been used to keep records of a family’s work and monetary dealings, keeping records - other people’s records - now became the work itself.” This illustrates a way in which literacy became directly linked to labor {{for the first time in}} Genna May’s family history.|$|E

The present study describes the accuracy, quality and health <b>literacy</b> <b>demand</b> of renal diet information for adults with kidney disease obtained from the Internet and YouTube (www. youtube. com). Methods: A comprehensive content analysis was undertaken in April and July 2015 of 254 eligible websites and 161 YouTube videos. The accuracy of the renal diet information was evaluated by comparing the key messages with relevant evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management of people with kidney disease. The DISCERN tool (www. discern. org. uk) {{was used to evaluate}} the quality of the material. Health <b>literacy</b> <b>demand</b> was evaluated using the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (www. ahrq. gov/professionals/prevention-chronic-care/improve/self-mgmt/pemat/index. html) and seven validated readability calculators. Results: The most frequent renal diet topic found online was generic dietary information for people with chronic kidney disease. The proportion of renal diet information obtained from websites that was accurate was 73 %. However, this information was mostly of poor quality with extensive shortcomings, difficult to action and written with a high health <b>literacy</b> <b>demand.</b> By contrast, renal diet information available from YouTube was highly understandable and actionable, although only 18 % of the videos were accurate, and a large proportion were of poor quality with extensive shortcomings. The most frequent authors of accurate, good quality, understandable, material were government bodies, dietitians, academic institutions and medical organisations. Conclusions: Renal diet information found online that is written by government bodies, dietitians, academic institutions and medical organisations is recommended.

40|$|Health {{literacy}} deficits affect {{half the}} American patient population and {{are linked to}} poor health, ineffective disease management and high rates of hospitalization. Restricted literacy has also been linked with less satisfying medical visits and communication difficulties, particularly {{in terms of the}} interpersonal and informational aspects of care. Despite growing attention to these issues by researchers and policy makers, few studies have attempted to conceptualize and assess those aspects of dialogue that challenge persons with low literacy skills, i. e., the oral <b>literacy</b> <b>demand</b> within medical encounters. The current study uses videotapes and transcripts of 152 prenatal and cancer pretest genetic counseling sessions recorded with simulated clients to develop a conceptual framework to explore oral <b>literacy</b> <b>demand</b> and its consequences for medical interaction and related outcomes. Ninety-six prenatal and 81 cancer genetic counselors [...] broadly representative of the US National Society of Genetic Counselors [...] participated in the study. Key elements of the conceptual framework used to define oral <b>literacy</b> <b>demand</b> include: (1) use of unfamiliar technical terms; (2) general language complexity, reflected in the application of Microsoft Word grammar summary statistics to session transcripts; and, (3) structural characteristics of dialogue, including pacing, density, and interactivity. Genetic counselor outcomes include self-ratings of session satisfaction, informativeness, and development of rapport. The simulated clients rated their satisfaction with session communication, the counselor's effective use of nonverbal skills, and the counselor's affective demeanor during the session.

40|$|Objective: To {{integrate}} {{the findings of}} research on electronic personal health records (e-PHRs) for an understanding of their health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> on both patients and providers. Methods: We sought peer-reviewed primary research in English addressing the health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> of e-PHRs that are online and allow patients any degree of control or input to the record. A synthesis of three theoretical models was used to frame the analysis of 24 studies. Results: e-PHRs pose {{a wide range of}} health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> on both patients and health service providers. Patient participation in e-PHRs relies not only on their level of education and computer literacy, and attitudes to sharing health information, but also upon their executive function, verbal expression, understanding of spoken and written language. Conclusion: The multiple health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> of e-PHRs must be considered when implementing population-wide initiatives for storing and sharing health information using these systems. Practice Implications: The health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> of e-PHRs are high and could potentially exclude many patients unless strategies are adopted to support their use of these systems. Developing strategies for all patients to meet or reduce the high health <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> of e-PHRs will be important in population-wide implementation...|$|E

Improving maternal emergency preparedness {{is a public}} health priority, and {{more research is needed}} to identify the strengths and weaknesses of various intervention approaches. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the types of emergency preparedness education available to pregnant and postpartum women. Two types of educational intervention were identified: guided learning and self-directed learning. Guided learning was defined as educator-led interventions; self-directed learning was defined as an approach that relies on the initiative of the audience to learn without the aid of a teacher. A search of the peer-reviewed published journal literature was conducted to find guided learning interventions. A sample of self-directed learning resources was assessed for readability and suitability using the Suitability Assessment of Materials. The guided learning intervention literature search found that there is a considerable lack of emergency preparedness interventions for pregnant and postpartum women in the peer-reviewed published journal literature. The assessment of a sample of self-directed learning resources found factors in need of revision for each web page, including unsuitable <b>literacy</b> <b>demand</b> and a lack of informative graphics in these materials.

This presents a problem for educators wishing to provide literacy training best suited to the <b>literacy</b> <b>demands</b> of the workplace. Several research studies have documented the nature of workplace <b>literacy</b> <b>demands,</b> but only a few have attempted to assess the relationship between literacy abilities and on-the-job performance. This study involved observing, interviewing, testing, and rating job performance of electronics technicians from three different employment levels (i. e., from training, experienced, and supervisory levels). Data were analyzed for differences between level of experience groups and the relationships of rated job performance to literacy-related factors. The subjects were 29 electronics technicians who volunteered from a technical school, a naval base, a major Fortune 500 electronics plant, and a small, local electronics plant. Job-related reading time averaged nearly two hours daily (104. 3 minutes) and job-related writing added another half hour (32. 6 minutes). Only 15 minutes of total reading time and only a minute of writing time were uninterrupted. Nearly all job-related literacy was problem solving in nature. Reading ability, as measured with job-related cloze tests, did not significantly correlate to job per-formance and could not discriminate electronics supervisors, experienced workers, and trainees. Metacognitive aspects of literacy did consistently and significantly correlate to job performance.

30|$|People {{of today}} {{typically}} {{spend a great}} amount of time reading on the Internet; consequently, the ability to read digital texts is becoming increasingly important and necessary. Computers, electronic books, Internet tablets, and mobile devices have become essential, not to say indispensable, parts of our lives. This digital reading may be regarded as one of what is sometimes labeled “the new literacies,” where it is claimed that the making of meaning of the semiotics in multimodal texts demands not only abilities that differ from those needed for reading traditional printed texts (Coiro et al. 2008) but also abilities that are unique for digital reading (Forzani 2013). Moreover, in a previous study on Swedish PISA data a factor representing unique aspects of digital reading, nested within an overall reading factor, was identified (Rasmusson and Åberg-Bengtsson 2015). These results indicate that digital reading differs, to some extent, from traditional reading in that additional skills seem to be required. The particular demands on digital reading are, for instance, argued to include skills needed to gather, read, evaluate, integrate, and communicate information online (Leu et al. 2013; Rasmusson and Eklund 2013). As a consequence of altered reading habits, it has been recognized in many countries {{that there is a need}} for teaching and evaluating these new <b>literacies</b> <b>demanded</b> for reading and learning on the Internet (Forzani 2013); the digital reading part in PISA 2009 can be seen as one way to meet this need.|$|R

40|$|The {{embedding}} of literacies {{has become}} a national venture within tertiary contexts in New Zealand (Tertiary Education Commission, 2008). From the literature {{it is evident that}} within such contexts literacies issues come under varied banners; Language, Literacy and Numeracy (LLN); Functional and life skills; critical and cultural literacy; and academic literacies (Ministry of Education, 2010). Such literacies discourses are further compounded by {{the way in which the}} process of embedding is considered. In response to the calls for embedding of academic literacies, an Institute of Technology and Polytechnic in Auckland created four faculty level academic literacies advisory positions. As these faculty advisory roles have progressed it has became evident that the demands for responding to academic literacies issues are as complex as the discourses of academic literacies and embedding themselves. This paper will describe the role and strategies taken by these academic literacies advisors in responding to the teaching and learning of academic literacies in a number of discipline areas. Exemplars of practice will be presented from the disciplines of Applied Technologies, Nursing, and Business. Through the exemplars, attention will be given to outlining the process involved in developing responsive teaching and learning practices towards academic literacies, and the significance played by contextual factors. Use of the exemplars will also serve to highlight the challenge of the multiple <b>literacies</b> <b>demands</b> within tertiary learning environments including operational definitions of academic literacies from the perspectives of the faculty academic literacies advisors...|$|R
40|$|The {{low level}} of {{financial}} literacy in many countries suggests that households {{are at risk of}} sub-optimal financial decisions. In this paper we assess to what extent financial advisors can substitute for such a lack of knowledge, by analyzing the effect of investors’ financial literacy on their decision about how much to rely on financial advisors. We model the strategic interaction between poorly informed investors and perfectly informed advisors facing conflicts of interest. We find that more knowledgeable investors are more likely to consult advisors, while less informed ones either invest by themselves (without any professional advice) or delegate their portfolio choice, suffering the agency costs of such decision. These results are confirmed empirically, where we investigate the effect of financial <b>literacy</b> on the <b>demand</b> for financial advice using the 2007 Unicredit Customers’ Survey. Overall, our results suggest that non-independent advisors are not sufficient to alleviate the problem of low financial literacy.

40|$|Background : International {{research}} has shown that workers have a rather low level of financial literacy. Financial literacy is associated with lifetime planning and saving for retirement. This article focuses on the role of financial <b>literacy</b> in the <b>demand</b> for human capital and on-the-job training among older workers in Japan. Workers with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to demand human capital, plan to enter training programs, and desire to work after retirement. Objective : Does financial <b>literacy</b> affect the <b>demand</b> for additional human capital among older Japanese workers? How does the level of financial literacy affect the age of retirement and plans for working after retirement from a career job in Japan? Methods : This paper analyzes data from a national survey of Japanese employees. We estimate the effect of financial <b>literacy</b> on the <b>demand</b> for additional human capital to remain competitive for promotions and for finding employment after retirement. Results : Higher levels of financial literacy are associated with greater demand for additional human capital and for participation in on-the-job training programs among older workers in Japan. Conclusions : Given the rapid aging of the Japanese population and the decline in the total population, providing employment opportunities for older workers (ages 60 and older) is a key to sustaining economic growth and per capita income. The analysis indicates that greater levels of financial literacy are associated with a desire for more training and human capital. Thus, enhancing the level of financial literacy among older workers may be a key to maintaining economic wellbeing...|$|R
