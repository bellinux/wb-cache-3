5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying <b>lava</b> <b>flow,</b> including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick <b>lava</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> upon <b>lava</b> <b>flow,</b> forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
50|$|Effusive basalt <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> cool {{to either}} of two forms, ʻaʻā or pāhoehoe. Andesite lava {{typically}} forms blocky <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> Dacite <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> often form steep-sided mounds, called lava domes, due to their greater viscosity.|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of the 1914 <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> {{on the western side}} of Sakurajima Volcano was examinedin detail by analyzing the photographs taken during the eruption and then the extrusion rateof the lava was estimated. The reproduction of the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> was tried by the numerical simula-tion {{on the assumption that the}} viscosity of the lava was constant. The simulated lava flowswere fairly coincided with the actual ones in their extension with time along the direction ofthe main stream. The viscosity of the extruded lava was estimated to be (2 - 3) xlO 9 poises. The reproduced <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> however, disagreed with the actual ones in their lateral spreading. The simulated <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> tend to spread more widely than the actual ones. In the case of theactual <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> it is expected that the temperature of the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> decreases faster on thesides of the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> than in the main stream. Therefore, it is necessary for the numericalsimulation of the andesitic <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> to take into account the effect of the cooling of the lava...|$|R
50|$|The San Borja {{volcanic}} field {{covers a}} surface of over 1600 km2 and encompasses at least 227 individual centres. There is a meridiolan zonation, with {{the southern part}} of the field dominated by <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> that cap mesas and the northern part containing individual scoria cones and probable fissure vents also associated with <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> Miocene <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> are tectonically tilted and partly surrounded by Pliocene <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> The various vents are aligned on usually northwest-southeast trending lineaments.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} young <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> is {{less than}} one million years old based on potassium-argon dating, the southern flow is 48,000 ± 12,000 years old based on argon-argon dating on biotite.|$|E
5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, {{it can be difficult to}} tell the difference between a lava lake and a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria {{is formed}} by two {{volcanic}} edifices and one subsidiary <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field. There is no recorded eruptive activity, but the volcano displays vigorous fumarolic activity. It {{is located on}} top of older volcanic rocks and features both andesite and dacite.|$|E
50|$|Putana is a 5890 m high volcano {{elongated}} {{from north}} to south. It is constructed by lavas and pyroclastic material, with effusive products such as lava domes and <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> forming {{the bulk of the}} edifice. Most <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> were viscous enough that they do not exceed 3 km of length, older flows are longer. Younger <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> occur on the western slope, and some <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> appear to be younger than the last glacial age.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fourth and}} final eruptive period 150,000to less than 3,000 years ago {{produced}} rhyodacite <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> domes, breccias and subvolcanic intrusions of the Plinth, Job and Capricorn assemblages. Around Mount Job, porphyritic hornblende, biotite and quartz rhyodacite <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> of the Job Assemblage were erupted. They are prominently layered and locally columnar jointed. On {{the east side of}} Affliction Glacier, they overlie porphyritic andesite <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> of the Pylon Assemblage. Later, rhyodacite <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> of the Capricorn Assemblage were erupted and flowed over biotite rhyodacite of the Job Assemblage. The upper [...] of Capricorn Mountain and Mount Job are formed by these <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the main}} growth stage, {{volcanic}} activity was approximately constant considering the homogeneous {{structure of the}} <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> Temporary periods of dormancy however occurred, causing the formation of erosion valleys on the northern slope that were then filled by younger <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> These younger <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> were themselves subject to glaciation.|$|R
5|$|Early in the 18th century, Mentolat erupted {{and formed}} lava flows on its western flank. These are Mentolat's best {{preserved}} volcanic deposits. The eruption deposited lapilli pumice. No historical records of activity exist, however, although reports by Serrano in the 18th century may {{refer to a}} <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> from Mentolat. The most recent eruption {{may have been in}} 1850, or 1710 ± 5.|$|E
5|$|Holocene {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based {{astronomers have}} led to the identification of differences in the types of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions. They differ in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of <b>lava</b> <b>flow,</b> and whether it is confined within volcanic pits.|$|E
50|$|Ascraeus Mons {{was built}} by many {{thousands}} of fluid basaltic <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> Except for its great size, it resembles terrestrial shield volcanoes like those that form the Hawaiian Islands. The flanks of Ascraeus Mons are covered with narrow, lobate <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and <b>lava</b> channels. Many of the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> have levees along their margins. Levees are parallel ridges formed {{at the edges of}} <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, <b>flowing</b> <b>lava.</b> Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the western}} part of the depression, six Holocene cinder cones are found which have {{generated}} <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> These <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> have thicknesses of [...] These cones include Khorog and Dzan Tologai. An arcuate chain of volcanoes named Odnobokii, Listvennichnyi, and Sosnovyi is found directly southwest of Khorog/Khorgo. The first volcano has a crater lip in its side, while the other two volcanoes are partly buried in <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> These <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> show sag structures formed by the collapse of lava tubes.|$|R
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> vesicular <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and domes.|$|R
5|$|Potassium–argon dating of Lastarria {{has yielded}} ages of 600,000 ± 300,000 {{and less than}} 300,000 years ago. The older date refers to the Negriales lava field, which has also been dated at 400,000116,000 ± 26,000 years ago. The South Spur is dated at 150,000 ± 50,000 years ago. The main edifice started forming 260,000 ± 20,000 years ago. One {{andesite}} <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> was dated at 51,000 ± 13,000 years ago by argon–argon dating.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{lava flows}} on Steens Mountain, Oregon, {{indicate}} that the magnetic field could have shifted {{at a rate of}} up to 6 degrees per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works. This finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> under study, not rapid field change, by one of the original authors of the 1995 study.|$|E
5|$|The caves {{are open}} to {{visitors}} but flashlights are needed except in Indian Tunnel and some form of head protection is highly recommended when exploring any of the caves. Lava tubes are created when the sides and surface of a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> hardens. If the fluid interior flows away a cave is left behind. Entering caves requires a free permit.|$|E
5000|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Anyuyskiy commenced at 15 - 17 km long fissure vents, forming <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> These three <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> {{have a total}} volume of [...] and cover a surface area of 100 km2. In these 30 m thick <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> <b>lava</b> lakes, lava tubes, and 10 - 15 m high swells have been found. This volcanic activity filled {{the valley of the}} Monni River and disrupted the course of its tributaries, resulting in the formation of a number of lakes. Characteristically, the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> slope from north to south, due to the fissure vents being located on the northern side of the valley. Some of these fissure vents are exposed, forming ridges of <b>lava.</b> The <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> probably interacted with permafrost soils.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} stages of trachyandesitic <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> the oldest {{composing}} the Porak volcano {{itself and the}} younger three derived from cones and fissures. Two <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> overlay Sevan Lake deposits with thin soil cover form an early Holocene stage. The second stage forms <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> entering Lake Alaghel and is devoid of soil cover.|$|R
50|$|In {{the western}} part of the depression, six Holocene cinder cones are found which have {{generated}} <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> These <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> have thicknesses of 3 - 5 m.

5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow <b>lava</b> <b>flow,</b> and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young obvious lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams. Most of these flows are {{on the north side of}} the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork <b>Lava</b> <b>Flow</b> to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E
5|$|The first {{volcanic}} activity of Tuzgle occurred 650,000 {{years ago and}} formed the Tuzgle Ignimbrite. Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and {{volcanic activity}} may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs {{are associated with the}} volcano, and some have been investigated for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined on the mountain. Argentina's National Route 40 runs along the foot of the volcano.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lava</b> <b>flows</b> are {{not only}} a {{fascinating}} scientific problem, involving many branches of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, but are natural events having a strong social impact. A reliable evaluation of volcanic hazard connected with <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> depends {{on the availability of}} physical models allowing us to predict the evolution of these phenomena. In this regard, the rheological properties of lavas are of major importance in controlling the dynamics of <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> <b>Lava</b> is a multi-phase and chemically heterogeneous system. This entails a characteristic, non-Newtonian behaviour of <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> which is emphasized {{by the fact that the}} rheological parameters are strongly temperature dependent and are therefore affected by the progressive cooling of lava after effusion. Physical models of <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> show us the complex relationships between the many quantities governing this process and in the near future they may allow us to predict the dynamics of <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and to take effective measures for the reduction of volcanic risk...|$|R
50|$|Littoral cones are {{a form of}} {{volcanic}} cone. They form from the interaction between <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and water. Steam explosions fragment the lava and the fragments can pile up and form a cone. Such cones usually form on aa <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> and typically require large <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> to form. They have been found on Hawaii and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> of volumes between [...] make {{up part of}} the edifice. The {{upper part of the}} Younger Cone is covered with such <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> which have steep fronts and up to 100 m thick.

5|$|Vinson Massif, {{the highest}} peak in Antarctica at , {{is located in}} the Ellsworth Mountains. Antarctica {{contains}} many other mountains, on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on Ross Island is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on Deception Island, which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> has been observed in recent years.

5|$|In orbit, the {{undermanned}} Enterprise is {{attacked and}} disabled by Kruge. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders {{that one of}} the hostages on the surface be executed. Marcus is killed defending Saavik and Spock. Kirk and company feign surrender and activate the Enterprises self-destruct sequence, killing the Klingon boarding party while the Enterprise crew transports to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has him beam his crew to the Klingon vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, Kirk and Kruge engage in a fistfight; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking Kruge off a cliff into a <b>lava</b> <b>flow.</b> Kirk and his officers take control of the Klingon ship and head to Vulcan.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world.

Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E
