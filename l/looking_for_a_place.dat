As he ran through the woods <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to hide, he came upon a wild boar, white with age. Disturbed by his presence, the boar made three fierce bounds in his direction, but Cadoc's life was spared when the boar miraculously disappeared. Cadoc took this as a heavenly sign, and marked the spot with three tree branches. The valley was owned by his uncle, King Pawl of Penychen, who made a present of the land to his nephew. The location later became {{the site of the}} great church college and monastery at Llancarvan.|$|E

25|$|In 1804, while Rapp and his {{associates}} remained in the United States <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to settle, his followers sailed to America aboard several vessels and {{made their way to}} western Pennsylvania, where they waited until land had been selected for their new settlement. Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and started his first commune, known as Harmonie or Harmony, in Butler County, Pennsylvania, where the Society existed from 1804 to 1815. It soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. Ten years later, the town was sold and the Harmonists moved westward to the Indiana Territory, where they established the town of Harmony, now called New Harmony, Indiana, and remained there from 1815 to 1825. The Indiana settlement was sold to Robert Owen and was renamed New Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time returning to western Pennsylvania, and named their third and final town Economy ('Ökonomie' in German). The Harmonists lived in Economy until the Society was dissolved in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After {{crossing}} the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are just <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to go, too. While lighting {{up the rest of the}} fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they don't distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.|$|E

They put Till {{in the back of their}} truck, drove to a cotton gin to take a [...] fan—the only time they admitted to being worried, thinking that by this time in early daylight they would be spotted and accused of stealing—and drove for several miles along the river <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to dispose of Till.

500|$|Gravel [...] "decided {{to become}} a pioneer in a faraway place," [...] and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where someone without social or {{political}} connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, {{played a role in}} his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, [...] and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.|$|E
500|$|While Korn was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> {{to record}} their debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record {{the majority of the}} album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at {{the back door of the}} studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E

500|$|By the mid-1980s, the orchestra's ambitions {{had grown}} beyond {{the point where}} it could be {{sustained}} by the small town of Evergreen. The increasingly peripatetic performances at Evergreen led to the Denver Post calling them [...] "the guerilla orchestra" [...] because they never knew where they would be playing next. According to Richard Zellner who served as the orchestra's Executive Director from 1982 until 2000, [...] "we were a festival <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to happen." [...] In 1986, the orchestra changed its name to the National Repertory Orchestra, drew up new articles of incorporation, and accepted an offer by Keystone Resort, in Keystone, Colorado to take up residency there. The orchestra provided an entertainment draw for the resort and the resort provided room and board for the musicians, a performing tent, and marketing services, all of which allowed the orchestra to halve its expenses. In 1988, the NRO was the only American orchestra invited to perform at the Seoul Olympics and then extended its tour to Taiwan and Japan.|$|E

2500|$|After the war some {{veterans}} of the Tenth returned to Aspen, including Friedl Pfeifer, another Austrian who {{had been involved in}} developing the ski resort before the war. In 1946 Walter Paepcke, then president of the Container Corporation of America, visited the city with his wife Elizabeth. The couple were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in the mountains of Colorado that would be ideal for an American counterpart to the Salzburg Festival. Aspen had many rundown neglected buildings lat the time, but they saw a lot of Victorian charm that could be brought back to life. They were cheap, and Paepcke bought or leased many, including the Jerome. Pfeifer also convinced him of the area's skiing potential, and Paepcke invested the money in the Aspen Skiing Company that Pfeifer had founded. That allowed the completion of Ski Lift No. 1, claimed to be the longest in the world. Its gala opening in January 1947 was the end of Aspen's [...] "quiet years".|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{straightforward}} {{compassion for}} the poor, {{there are two other}} possible motivations for Mrs Thwaytes's philanthropy. Firstly there was the 19th-century progress of Evangelicalism, which encouraged good works from those with religious sensibility and social pity. [...] Secondly, following the expansion of the middle classes in the 18th and 19th centuries, beneficence was [...] "an avenue for entry into elite society for women and gave them a sense of place and direction outside the home." [...] In other words, for a woman of known humble origins {{and at the same time}} a wealthy widow <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in society, philanthropy would be in her best interests. However 19th-century British elite society was based in the popular imagination upon elegant culture, not money or good deeds, and Herne Bay Clock Tower's opening ceremony drew mockery from the Figaro in London of 6 October 1836, in which she was called a Cockney and her clock, celebration and philanthropy laughed at.|$|E
