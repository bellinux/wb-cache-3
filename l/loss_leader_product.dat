5000|$|A <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> or <b>leader</b> is a <b>product</b> {{sold at a}} {{low price}} (i.e. at cost or below cost) to stimulate other {{profitable}} sales. This would help the companies to expand its market share as a whole. <b>Loss</b> <b>leader</b> strategy is commonly used by retailers in order to lead the customers into buying products with higher marked-up prices to produce an increase in profits rather than purchasing the <b>leader</b> <b>product</b> which is sold at a lower cost. When a [...] "featured brand" [...] is priced to be sold at a lower cost, retailers tend not to sell large quantities of the <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>products</b> and also they tend to purchase less quantities from the supplier as well to prevent loss for the firm. Supermarkets and restaurants are {{an excellent example of}} retail firms that apply the strategy of <b>loss</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|R
40|$|Trade {{promotions}} are {{the most}} important promotional tool available to a manufacturer. However trade promotions can achieve their objective of increasing short-term sales only if the retailer passes through these promotions. Empirical research has documented that there is a wide variation in retail pass-through across products. However {{little is known about the}} variations in pass-through over time. This is particularly important for products with distinct seasonal patterns. We argue that extant methods of measuring pass-through are inadequate for seasonal products. We therefore introduce a measurement approach and illustrate it using two product categories. We find interesting differences in pass-through for loss-leader products versus regular products during high demand and regular demand periods. We find that retailers use a deep and narrow pass-through strategy (high pass-through on loss-leader products, but small pass-through on regular products) during periods of regular demand and broad and shallow pass-through strategy (smaller, but similar pass-through on both loss-leader and regular products) during periods of high demand. <b>Loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>products</b> continue to obtain higher pass-through in high demand periods, if the category's high demand period is also a high demand period for other product categories as well.

50|$|A <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> is a <b>product</b> {{that has}} a price set below the {{operating}} margin. <b>Loss</b> <b>leadering</b> is widely used in supermarkets and budget-priced retail outlets where {{it is intended to}} generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, <b>loss</b> <b>leadering</b> may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.|$|R
5000|$|The Winchester Model 52 was a bolt-action [...]22-caliber target rifle {{introduced}} by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1920. For many years it was the premier smallbore match rifle in the United States, if not the world. Known as the [...] "King of the [...]22's," [...] the Model 52 has been called by Field & Stream one of [...] "the 50 best guns ever made" [...] and by Winchester historian Herbert Houze [...] "perfection in design." [...] However, by the 1970s the World War I-era design was showing its age and had given way in top-level competition to newer match rifles from Walther and Anschütz; the costly-to-produce Model 52, which had long been a <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> prestige <b>product</b> by that time, was finally discontinued when US Repeating Arms took over the manufacture of Winchester rifles from Olin Corporation in 1980.|$|R

40|$|Despite general {{agreement}} that consumers benefit from lower prices {{that are not}} predatory, several nations have laws against <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales {{even when they are}} unlikely to foreclose competition. These laws appear to protect competitors rather than competition. The Competition Committee’s roundtable discussion in October 2005 focused on efforts to reform or remove laws against <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales and efforts to prevent such restrictions from being enacted. The Secretariat background note argued that rules again <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales should be sunsetted because they are likely to harm consumers and protect inefficient competitors, fail to account adequately for pro-competitive business justifications for <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales and detract from economic dynamism and growth. Japan, Germany and France, defended their rules against price competition, although France {{was in the process of}} a reform. Members of a second group of countries were working to remove laws against <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales. The nations in a third group with no law against <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales, reported efforts by groups of competitors to have such rules applied either at the national level or at the state/provincial level. Both the consumer and business submissions argued that prohibiting <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> sales is likely to harm consumers and protect competitors, rather than competition. ...|$|R
50|$|The Warner/Reprise <b>Loss</b> <b>Leaders</b> were {{a series}} of promotional sampler {{compilation}} albums released by Warner Bros. Records throughout the 1970s. Each album (usually a 2-record set) contained {{a wide variety of}} tracks by artists under contract to Warner Bros. and its subsidiary labels (primarily Reprise Records); often these were singles, B-sides, non-hit album tracks, or otherwise obscure material, all designed to arouse interest in the artists' regular albums. Warner advertised the <b>Loss</b> <b>Leaders</b> albums by inserting special illustrated inner sleeves in all of its regular album releases, listing all of the currently available <b>Loss</b> <b>Leaders</b> and including an order form.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to isolate the}} conditions {{that give rise to}} <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> pricing. I show that for sufficiently low distance between firms, the advertised good is priced below cost irrespective of whether firms advertise the same or different products. Instead, if products are sufficiently differentiated, <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> pricing may result only if firms advertise the low reservation value product, otherwise the advertised good is a low margin leader. Thus, whether the advertised good is a <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> or a low margin leader is primarily a function of the extent of differentiation between competing firms. ...|$|R
40|$|We apply an {{indirect}} method {{to test for}} the extent of <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> pricing. Specifically, the extent of <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> pricing should increase with the profit from other regularly-priced items.

A one standard deviation increase in store area was associated with a 3. 7 (± 1. 8) higher bestseller percentage discount.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{a motive}} for R&D cooperation with a rival by considering {{the behavior of a}} quality follower in a model of vertically differentiated products. We show that, in some settings, a quality follower has an incentive to contribute money to R&D activity of a quality leader with the sole purpose of making the <b>leader’s</b> <b>products</b> even better. The reason behind this motivation is that the <b>leader’s</b> <b>product</b> quality is serving as an upper-constraint in the decision process of the follower regarding product quality selection. Thus, if the <b>leader’s</b> <b>product</b> quality is raised both firms will be better off...|$|R

50|$|One {{use of a}} <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> is to draw {{customers}} into a {{store where}} {{they are likely to}} buy other goods.

50|$|Pure {{bundling}} can {{be further}} divided into two cases: in joint bundling, the two products are offered together for one bundled price, and, in leader bundling, a <b>leader</b> <b>product</b> is offered for discount if purchased with a non-leader product. Mixed-leader bundling is a variant of leader bundling with the added possibility of buying the <b>leader</b> <b>product</b> on its own.|$|R
50|$|Similar to Bait pricing, {{retailers}} use leader pricing {{to entice}} customers {{to come into}} the stores by advertising items, the <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> at a low price. When they arrive at the stores aiming for the promoting products, they often end up buying extra products at their full prices. Therefore, businesses earn their profit off of the unplanned buying decisions by customers besides the <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> (Lazear, 1995).|$|R

40|$|I {{evaluate}} German {{regulation that}} requires retail discounters {{to guarantee the}} availability of their products in bargain sales. The regulation is meant to prevent <b>loss</b> <b>leaders.</b> Retailers however claim that rationing is due to demand uncertainty and thereby undermine the regulation's rationale. Indeed, demand uncertainty explains empirical observations better than a theory of <b>loss</b> <b>leaders.</b> This paper shows, however, that also under demand uncertainty the regulation has positive effects. Ultimately, it raises production, which, under imperfect competition, is beneficial. A strict regulation overshoots its goal when high demand is relatively unlikely. In this case more sophisticated regulation is required. ...|$|R
40|$|When some {{customers}} are more profitable to serve than others, {{one might expect}} sellers to compete more vigorously for the more profitable customers. One way sellers might {{do this is to}} sell goods that are purchased primarily by the most profitable customers using a lower mark-up than on other goods. This allows the firms to give discounts to more profitable customers without offering them to less profitable customers. This paper presents a model in which competing multi-product firms facing customers that purchase different quantities of goods, set prices in this manner. This model suggests a theory of multi-product pricing in which the markup on any particular product is inversely related to the average profitability of the customer that purchases the good. One interesting implication of this paper is that <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> pricing might be viewed as a way for firms to compete more vigorously for more profitable customers. Such an explanation offers another characteristic of products that should be used as <b>loss</b> <b>leaders.</b> This explanation provides potentially testable implications about the types of goods that can (or ought to) be used as <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> and can explain why grocery stores sell turkeys as <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> at Thanksgiving and lower the price of eggs at Easter, but not flowers on Mother's Day, or candy on Valentines Day.
