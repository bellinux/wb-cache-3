5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match the <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures {{in the construction of}} the barrel vaults (see animation below).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

25|$|On 19 July 1333, Sir Archibald Douglas and his {{men came}} to face the troops of Balliol and Edward III at the Battle of Halidon Hill, just to the north-west of Berwick.

Their cavalry was forced to dismount by boggy earth and proceed on foot uphill against English archers, who picked them off in great number. Once weakened, they were overrun by the English cavalry, who claimed among their many victims Sir Archibald Douglas himself. The loss of the Guardian was a severe blow for loyalists to David II, who would soon be carried into exile in France, there to remain until 1341.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} at Glemham, Crabbe {{composed}} several novels, none of which were published. After Glemham, Crabbe moved {{to the village of}} Rendham in Suffolk, where he stayed until 1805. His poem The Parish Register was all but completed while at Rendham, and The Borough was also begun. 1805 was the last year of Crabbe's stay in Suffolk, and it was made memorable in literature by the appearance of the <b>Lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Minstrel by Walter Scott. Crabbe first saw it in a bookseller's shop in Ipswich, read it nearly through while standing at the counter, and pronounced that a new and great poet had appeared. In October 1805, Crabbe returned {{with his wife and two}} sons to the parsonage at Muston. He had been absent for nearly 13 years, of which four had been spent at Parham, five at Great Glemham, and four at Rendham.|$|E

25|$|Weill's family {{experienced}} financial hardship in {{the aftermath}} of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a répétiteur at the Friedrich-Theater {{under the direction of the}} new Kapellmeister, Hans Knappertsbusch. During this time, he composed an orchestral suite in E-flat major, a symphonic poem of Rainer Maria Rilke's The <b>Lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke as well as Schilflieder, a cycle of five songs to poems by Nikolaus Lenau. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in Lüdenscheid, where he directed opera, operetta, and singspiel for five months, and also composed a cello sonata and Ninon de Lenclos, a now lost one-act operatic adaptation of a play by Ernst Hardt. From May to September 1920, Weill spent a couple of months in Leipzig, where his father had become the new director of a Jewish orphanage. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed Sulamith, a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.|$|E

500|$|Caernarfon Castle's {{design was}} partly {{influenced}} {{by a desire to}} make the structure impressive {{as a symbol of the}} new English rule in Wales. This was particularly acute as Caernarfon was made the centre of government in the northern part of the country. The Edwardian castle's layout was mostly dictated by the <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land, although the inclusion of the previous castle's motte played a part. It is a narrow enclosure, roughly in the shape of a figure eight. It was divided into two enclosures, upper and lower [...] "wards" [...] in the east and west respectively, with the eastern containing royal accommodation, although this was never completed. The divide was supposed to be established by a range of fortified buildings, however these too were never built.|$|E
500|$|Mark F. Hall, {{examining}} Tolkien's own use of alliterative verse, {{writes that}} Tolkien notes that [...] "the Beowulf poet likely was consciously using archaic and literary words", and compares this to Tolkien's own practice in poems such as [...] "The <b>Lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Children of Húrin", where, Hall thinks, Tolkien's words {{could be applied}} to his own verse: [...] "Its manner and conventions, and its metre, are unlike those of modern English verse. Also it is preserved fragmentarily and by chance, and has only in recent times been redeciphered and interpreted, without the aid of any tradition or gloss". Hall further comments that in 'Lays of Beleriand', Tolkien failed to heed his own warning against archaism, as he uses the word [...] "weird" [...] archaically to mean 'fate' (OE 'wyrd'), and speculates that this may have been a reaction against the [...] "rigidity and formality of translating authentic Anglo-Saxon literature." ...|$|E
