50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>banking</b> in the UK was {{previously}} the preserve of the landed gentry or real estate developers. Many reputable listed commercial building companies engage successfully in <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> for future building projects.

25|$|The {{mortgage}} bonds were {{a way for}} {{the bank}} to raise funds. The bonds, nominal value 100 rubles, were sold to the public by the borrower or the bank. The bank guaranteed redemption of the bonds with its capital and the mortgaged property. A market developed for these bonds. Initially, the market price fluctuated between 81 and 93.25 rubles. Due to the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the price dropped to 78 rubles. When prices rebounded and stabilized at 92–96 rubles, Russian government ordered to lower the interest rate to 5% in 1886. In 1895, the bonds traded at 99–102 rubles and the government lowered the interest to 4.5%. In 1900, among Russian land banks, only Moscow <b>Land</b> <b>Bank</b> had more outstanding mortgage bonds. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the bond price dropped to 68 rubles.

40|$|This {{essay is}} based on my closing {{presentation}} at the Washburn Law Journal 2 ̆ 7 s 2015 symposium entitled “The Future of Housing [...] Equity, Stability and Sustainability. ” It explores how <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>land</b> trusts promote social goods, including socioeconomic integration, by connecting with and shielding against, respectively, market forces. Both engage in stewardship of <b>land.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>banks</b> take temporary ownership of vacant, abandoned properties {{in order to make}} them available for productive use. Land trusts hold land indefinitely to ensure a social purpose is met. Community land trusts hold land for a purpose that is responsive to the human environment, often permanently affordable housing in areas where affordable housing is rare to nonexistent. <b>Land</b> <b>banks</b> encourage people with choices to move into neighborhoods beset by abandonment and poverty. Community land trusts allow lower-income residents to become long-term members of neighborhoods otherwise inaccessible to them. <b>Land</b> <b>banks</b> reduce transaction costs to get the market moving. Land trusts increase transaction costs in order to protect affordable housing and other public goods against elimination by market-driven transfers. The use by these two publicly minded real estate market interventions of opposing tools in starkly different types of neighborhoods raises the following questions: First, do they meet somewhere in the middle? Second, does sustaining neighborhoods of choice hinge on the handoff of some critical mass of real property from <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> to <b>land</b> trusts? The answers to these both questions are negative, if we focus our attention solely on the work done directly by <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>land</b> trusts. The neighborhoods that warrant the housing stewardship activity of land trusts are just too different from those needing the help of <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> to talk of a continuum of care between the two poles of community land resource control. But, if <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> and its conceptual counterpart, “land trusting”, are thought of more broadly as the strategic adjustment of transaction costs for the promotion of social goods, such as residential socioeconomic integration, then an array of intermediate possibilities present themselves. The essay begins with a brief examination of the importance of residential socioeconomic integration and how it might be advanced appropriately. After looking at some misconceptions about the market’s role in segregating neighborhoods by class, I then explore how <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>land</b> trusts intervene to move neighborhoods toward a healthy diversity. The essay concludes with a discussion of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> and, particularly, <b>land</b> trusting as alternatives to formal stewardship that nevertheless also foster the needed diversity of housing types, land tenure types, and ultimately, resident socioeconomic status to sustain neighborhoods of choice...|$|R

500|$|Adams's {{life was}} greatly {{affected}} by his father's {{involvement in a}} banking controversy. In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a [...] "land bank" [...] which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security. The <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the General Court. Opposition to the <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> came from the more aristocratic [...] "court party", who were supporters of the royal governor and controlled the Governor's Council, the upper chamber of the General Court. The court party used its influence to have the British Parliament dissolve the <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> in 1741. Directors of the <b>land</b> <b>bank,</b> including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams's death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government. For Adams, these lawsuits [...] "served as a constant personal reminder that Britain's power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways".|$|E
500|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1739 due to London politics and a currency crisis in Massachusetts. [...] Belcher {{had been ordered}} to effect the retirement of {{a large amount of}} Massachusetts paper currency by 1741, and the legislation to accomplish this was rejected by the Board of Trade, leading to the introduction of competing banking proposals in the province. [...] One faction dominated by landowners proposed a <b>land</b> <b>bank,</b> while merchants proposed a bank that would issue silver-backed paper. [...] The proposals polarized the Massachusetts political establishment, and Belcher was unable to take sides for fear of alienating supporters on either side. [...] He instead sought without success to browbeat the assembly into passing a currency retirement scheme acceptable to London. [...] In 1740 elections <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> supporters swept into office, and the bank began issuing notes. [...] Merchant interests opposed to the <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> began widespread lobbying in London for Parliamentary relief (which came in 1741, when it passed legislation extending the 1720 Bubble Act, which disallowed unchartered companies, to the colonies) likely abetted by John Thomlinson.|$|E
