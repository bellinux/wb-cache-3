500|$|After the races, {{there was}} {{continued}} discussion about overheating engines in high temperatures. Harvick said the temperatures of around [...] had affected the racing, [...] the grills were [...] "too tight" [...] and competitors chose {{to remain in}} a single-file formation because of overheating. Smith said he believed there was no efficient method of tackling the problem. McMurray advocated the widening of the grille, saying, [...] "it was a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> race because you got too hot". One day after the second race, NASCAR announced that no further changes would be made.|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} amongst {{reviewers for}} Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{was the lack}} of additional on-disc content beyond the expanded character roster and gameplay tweaks. While IGN's Steven Hopper praised the inclusion of new characters, he criticized the lack of new features and modes. As a result, he stated that the game's [...] price tag was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> swallow". Tim Turi of Game Informer stated that while hardcore fans would appreciate Capcom's balancing tweaks, casual fans who already played Fate of Two Worlds and were only interested in new characters would [...] "likely be left wanting".|$|E
500|$|The {{contrast}} between [...] "Train's seriousness and Sven's comedy" [...] was appreciated by Sandra Scholes of Active Anime. Margaret Viera {{of the same}} site hailed its comedy usage as [...] "well done and perfectly placed within the storyline." [...] Its mixture of genres was appreciated by Scholes, {{as well as by}} IGN's Jeff Harris who said [...] "it never appears too overdone." [...] Ross Liversidge of UK Anime Network, however, commented that this makes it [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discern what the series is aiming for." [...] While Stig Høgset, writing for THEM Anime Reviews, said the supernatural powers are [...] "kept at a fairly realistic level", Liversidge felt the anime's ending was [...] "just slightly too fantastical to be taken seriously." [...] Høgset and Harris praised the show's imagery, with the latter claiming that it has a [...] "story that in many ways improves on the original manga and fixes some of its problems." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} William Ruhlmann awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "Monk's Dream is a warm reunion of old friends, but those friends could have tried a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with}} {{something}} fresh." ...|$|R
50|$|The soft version however, is a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> nail down. The {{definition}} of a soft anti-genre might include art intentionally dispensing with conventions of its medium or violently breaking with tradition by subversion, vandalism-art, irrationality, self-defeat or other strategies in a rebellious spirit.|$|R
5000|$|... "Nakamura {{preferred}} {{to call the}} [...] "hidden" [...] moves [...] "intermediary" [...] moves, because they occur between the obvious-to-the-eye basic moves, {{and because they are}} not exotic or special, but are just a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> catch. The key to catching them, by the way, is to watch the koshi (pelvic carriage) and hikite (pulling hand) carefully to penetrate the sleight of hand." ...|$|R
500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling or maybe they felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{with the}} law have {{rejected}} such criticism, and argued that the law was reasonable, limited, and carefully crafted. [...] Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official in the George W. Bush administration, said, [...] "The coverage of this law and {{the text of the}} law are a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> square. There's nothing in the law that requires cities to stop people without cause, or encourages racial or ethnic profiling by itself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork was a dissenting voice, {{believing that}} [...] "following Coles Corner, it's... a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> be totally {{taken in by}} album... It begins to feel less like {{appropriation}} than note-perfect recreation... There's been no journey, no emotional progress, and little emotional payoff. For an album and artist so otherwise focused, the effect winds up more soporific than satisfying, however stylish and serene." ...|$|R
50|$|Even the PS2 and GameCube version {{are pretty}} much the same version. They are a few {{different}} things between these two. The levels have a little different in GC version like some platforms are completely gone, making this version a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> beat. On the other hand, some text font was changed and the Donald icon in life counter was smaller in GC version.|$|R

Using US data from between 1947 and 2001 Lucas obtained [...] It is a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> obtain an empirical estimate of although {{it should be}} theoretically possible, a lot of controversies in economics revolve around the precise and appropriate measurement of this parameter. However {{it is doubtful that}} [...] is particularly high (most estimates are no higher than 4).|$|R
2500|$|An FBI {{recording}} of Black's hotel suite in April 1963 recorded him saying of Levinson to columnist Jack Anderson, [...] "Jack, some day when Eddie comes here for dinner or something, I {{want you to}} meet him. He's a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> describe. I know his whole background. He was probably the biggest bookmaker Detroit ever had. I know he was the biggest gambler Miami ever had. Then he went to Las Vegas. He came under the granddaddy law; it excused him for anything he ever did as long as he stayed working in Nevada. He told us all those things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Time {{reviewer}} Josh Tyrangiel praised guitarist Buck's [...] "resurgence" [...] and [...] "propulsive riffs," [...] {{but also}} wrote, [...] "R.E.M.'s 14th album never quite generates the moody atmospherics {{of their first}} 10; it's a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> lose yourself in something that doesn't pause long {{enough for you to}} get lost." [...] Uncut gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer John Mulvey stated, [...] "Accelerate is a simple, pragmatic record built on an uncomfortable truth: sometimes, even the best bands have to retrace their steps, if only to remind themselves what they're really good at." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Bajo and Hex from Good Game {{gave the}} game 10/10, the only such score they handed out in 2014. Both hosts praised the game's writing, voice acting, graphics, and gameplay, with Hex saying that [...] "the writing and voice acting is just excellent" [...] and that [...] "Those sword and board hits though Bajo! So rewarding! It's classic dungeon {{crawling}} combat isn't it?". Bajo praised the game's challenge, stating that [...] "where the combat truly shines is when you're in trouble" [...] {{as well as}} offering a minor criticism that [...] "The crafting system is a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get your head around". They also awarded it [...] "Game of the Year" [...] in their annual Christmas special.|$|E
5000|$|Stark kicked left-footed. To returners, {{that means}} the ball is {{spinning}} the [...] "wrong" [...] way and is a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> handle; FSU opponents had fumbled about one of Stark's punts per game in his three-year career. And {{there was one more}} thing that scouts drooled over: Stark had never had a punt blocked. [...] In his 16 seasons in the NFL, he only had 7 blocked punts.|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} to {{accompany}} the release of [...] "Seven Nation Army" [...] was first released onto YouTube on February 16, 2012 at a total length of two minutes and fifty-eight seconds. Critically, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted the [...] "distinctive soul-pop" [...] vocals showcased by Collins and wrote that, [...] "Truth be told, we wish he'd fought a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> get one those eight original compositions he has on his forthcoming record out first." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most popular}} {{structure}} {{at the site}} is the tzat tun tzat (sometimes written Satunsat, but most commonly called [...] "The Labyrinth"). [...] The Satunsat group is an outlier. It’s a single building, {{a sort of a}} maze or labyrinth, built to replicate a cave complex. There’s no real guess as to what it was built for, though there was a recent discovery that most the ventilation shafts line up with specific positions of the sun, so some think it was a maze used for initiation and practice of religion but there’s nothing conclusive. So it’s a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> place Satunsat into any one phase, but sources continuously point to a probability that this structure was built in the early Oxkintok phase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{salmonella}} {{attack was}} noted {{as the first}} confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to {{have occurred in the}} United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her [...] "gang" [...] left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh's living quarters and made her tapes available to the US authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. Nevertheless, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh [...] as guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh's philosophy was not [...] "disapproving of poisoning" [...] and that he felt he and Sheela had been [...] "genuinely evil". Nonetheless, US Attorney Turner and Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that [...] "they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch". According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had had with Rajneesh about the [...] "need to kill people" [...] in order to strengthen wavering sannyasins resolve in participating in her murderous plots: [...] "She came back to the meeting and [...] began to play the tape. It was a <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> hear what he was saying. [...] And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, {{it was going to be}} necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision." [...] Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh's caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (Dr. George Meredith), because she thought that they were a threat to Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh [...] "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".|$|E

50|$|There is a {{consensus}} that the written archetype of Gísla saga was composed in the thirteenth century, with voices tending towards {{the middle of the}} century, and most commentators preferring 1225×50. However, there is <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> evidence <b>to</b> support this.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times thought [...] "there are implausibilities in {{the plot}} devices that lead the movie to its {{ultimate}} conclusion. And then the final developments themselves, I think, are wrong in both theory and practice. There is some ambiguity about why a final event takes place, and that's all right, but {{the way in which}} the movie reveals it is, I think, singularly ineffective. It leads to one of those endings where you sit there wishing they'd tried a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> think up something better." ...|$|R

His own action was not final. Of late he had done the same thing many times and this last time it seemed a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> do, a <b>little</b> more indicative of vacillation. There were reasons why Belding's gun held for him a gloomy fascination.|$|R
50|$|Deca Sports {{does not}} feature {{the use of}} Miis. Instead, eight {{different}} teams (Average Joes, Speed Strikers, Hard Hitters, Crusaders, Boost Force, Mad Maidens, Team Thunder and Disco Knights) are available for selection in the various sporting events. Each team {{is made up of}} small, medium and large players of both genders. Small athletes are nimble, but are not too strong, while large athletes are powerful, but are slower and a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> control. Medium-size players provide a compromise between speed and strength. Team member size becomes more important during Deca League, where playing one team member for too long will result in fatigue and decreased performance.|$|R

5000|$|The Midget I {{has also}} been sold outside Japan as the [...] "Bajaj", [...] "Tri-Mobile", or [...] "Bemo" [...] (Bemos in Indonesia are used as autorickshaw share taxis). It {{is one of the}} first cars {{manufactured}} by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu, known for its low cost, practical vehicles. Thai production began in 1959, with Indonesia, Pakistan, and many other countries soon following. Almost exclusively used as an autorickshaw (or 'tuk-tuk') the Midget was also a well known icon of public transportation in South Asia. Not meant for performance, this obscure vehicle does weave through larger traffic well, despite the fact that it only has three wheels.

5000|$|Parker {{describes}} his pitching approach as such:I'm aggressive. I like {{to attack the}} zone, down ... Early on, I want to establish the fastball down and be as aggressive as I can, but in certain counts I'll want to raise the hitter's eye level, then {{come back with a}} curveball. Less damage can be done when the ball is down. For me, ground balls are better than fly balls. That's something I really push for, because down in the zone with some movement is going <b>to</b> be a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> hit. But changing eye levels by going up in the zone is important. It's tough for a hitter to lock in when you're moving the ball up and down.|$|R
