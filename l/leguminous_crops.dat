40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of (a) On-farm trials (eight) over a two-year period designed to test the effectiveness of <b>leguminous</b> cover <b>crops</b> in terms of increasing maize yields in Igalaland, Nigeria. (b) A survey designed to monitor the extent of, and reasons behind, adoption of the <b>leguminous</b> cover <b>crop</b> technology in subsequent years by farmers involved, to varying degrees, in the trial programme. particular emphasis was placed on comparing adoption of <b>leguminous</b> cover <b>crops</b> with that of new crop varieties released by a non-governmental organization in the same area since the mid 1980 s. While the <b>leguminous</b> cover <b>crop</b> technology boosted maize grain yields by 127 to 136 % above an untreated control yield of between 141 and 171 kg ha(- 1), the adoption rate (number of farmers adopting) was only 18 %. By way of contrast, new crop varieties had a highly variable benefit in terms of yield advantage over local varieties, with the best average increase of around 20 %. Adoption rates for new crop varieties, assessed as both the number of farmers growing the varieties and the number of plots planted to the varieties, were 40 % on average. The paper discusses some key factors influencing adoption of the <b>leguminous</b> cover <b>crop</b> technology, including seed availability. Implications of these results for a local non-governmental organization, the Diocesan Development Services, concerned with promoting the <b>leguminous</b> cover <b>crop</b> technology are also discussed...|$|R

Thereby, the costs for seeds and the variable machine costs were taken into account. The highest yield was reached for both types of grain following undersown white clover, the second highest following undersown black medic. In contrast, the yield was lower following red clover and grass-clover undersowings as well as different stubble seeds. In parts of these variants, the yield was even lower than in the control without cover crop. ...|$|R

50|$|Crop {{rotation}} can {{be classified}} {{as a type of}} subsistence farming if there is an individual or communal farmer doing the labour and if the yield is solely for their own consumption. It is characterised by different crops being alternately grown on the same land in a specific order to have more effective control of weeds, pests, diseases, and more economical utilisation of soil fertility. In India, <b>leguminous</b> <b>crops</b> are grown alternately with wheat, barley, and mustard. An ideal cropping system should use natural resources efficiently, provide stable and high returns, and avoid environmental damage.|$|E
50|$|The pin-tailed {{sandgrouse}} often feeds in groups and gathers regularly {{in large numbers}} at waterholes, to which the birds fly soon after dawn. During the day they disperse to forage for seeds, which are {{the main part of}} their diet, and also eat buds, green shoots and leaves. They favour leguminous seeds and also eat seeds of knotweed (Polygonum), buckwheat (Fagopyrum), Salicornia, Artemisia, camelthorn (Alhagi), rock rose (Helianthemum) and asphodel (Asphodelus). In cultivated areas they take grain and the seeds of <b>leguminous</b> <b>crops.</b> Beetles and other small invertebrates are sometimes eaten and grit is consumed to help grind up the contents of the crop.|$|E
50|$|Soybeans, a <b>leguminous</b> <b>crop,</b> {{are also}} {{included}} in China's grain statistics. The northeast has traditionally been the most important producing area, but substantial amounts of soybeans are also produced on the North China Plain. Production of soybeans declined after the Great Leap Forward, and output did not regain the 10-million-ton level of the late 1950s until 1985. Population growth has greatly outstripped soybean output, and per capita consumption has fallen. Soybeans are a useful source of protein and fat, an important consideration given the limited amount of meat available and the grain- and vegetable-based diet. Oilseed cakes, by-products of soybean oil extraction, are used as animal feed and fertilizer.|$|R

50|$|Until 1850, natural BNF, cultivation-induced BNF (e.g., {{planting}} of <b>leguminous</b> <b>crops),</b> and incorporated organic matter {{were the only}} sources of N for agricultural production.

By the late 1920s, early industrial processes, albeit inefficient, were commonly used to produce NH3. Due to the efforts of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, the Haber-Bosch process became the largest source of nitrogenous fertilizer after the 1950s, and replaced BNF as the dominant source of NH3 production. From 1890 to 1990, anthropogenically created Nr increased almost ninefold. During this time, mango population more than tripled, partly due to increased food production.|$|E
