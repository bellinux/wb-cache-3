5|$|California spiny <b>lobsters</b> are nocturnal, {{hiding in}} crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long {{antennae}} showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the spiny <b>lobsters</b> form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Female California spiny <b>lobsters</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature spiny <b>lobsters</b> is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|Lobster fishers may not land {{more than}} seven California spiny <b>lobsters</b> on any given day, and may not have {{more than seven}} in their {{possession}} at any time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lobster</b> recipes include <b>lobster</b> Newberg and <b>lobster</b> Thermidor. <b>Lobster</b> {{is used in}} soup, bisque, <b>lobster</b> rolls, and cappon magro. <b>Lobster</b> meat may be {{dipped in}} {{clarified}} butter, resulting in a heightened flavour.|$|R
50|$|Panulirus versicolor is {{a species}} of spiny <b>lobster</b> that lives in {{tropical}} reefs.

5000|$|Panulirus penicillatus is {{a species}} of spiny <b>lobster</b> that lives on shallow rocky and coral reefs in the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific region. Common names for this spiny <b>lobster</b> include variegated crayfish, tufted spiny <b>lobster,</b> spiny <b>lobster,</b> Socorro spiny <b>lobster,</b> red <b>lobster,</b> pronghorn spiny <b>lobster,</b> golden rock <b>lobster,</b> double spined rock <b>lobster</b> and coral cray. It has a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny <b>lobsters</b> including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny <b>lobsters</b> will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|There were no {{permanent}} indigenous settlements on Point Loma {{because of a}} lack of fresh water. Kumeyaay people did visit Ocean Beach periodically to harvest mussels, clams, abalone and <b>lobsters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Animals without blood {{were divided}} into soft-shelled Malakostraka (crabs, <b>lobsters,</b> and shrimps); {{hard-shelled}} Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves); soft-bodied Malakia (cephalopods); and divisible animals Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). Other animals without blood included fish lice, hermit crabs, red coral, sea anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|E

5|$|Fishing has {{declined}} in importance, but still employed 345 individuals in 2001, about 3.5% of the islands' economically active population, the modern industry concentrating on herring, white fish, <b>lobsters,</b> crabs and other shellfish, and salmon fish farming.|$|E
5|$|Homarus gammarus is {{susceptible}} to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American <b>lobsters,</b> the disease has only been seen in captive H.gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H.americanus could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} {{is generally}} blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with <b>lobsters</b> only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.|$|E
50|$|Panulirus ornatus (known by {{a number}} of common names, {{including}} tropical rock <b>lobster,</b> ornate rock <b>lobster,</b> ornate spiny <b>lobster</b> and ornate tropical rock <b>lobster)</b> is a large edible spiny <b>lobster</b> with 11 larval stages that has not been successfully bred in captivity.|$|R

5|$|The main legal {{restrictions}} on fishing for California spiny lobster in Mexico are a minimum landing size of , {{the prohibition of}} catching berried females, and a closed season: from February 16 to November 15, fishing for spiny <b>lobsters</b> is prohibited in a region which moves south along Mexico's Pacific coast during the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{open season}} for {{commercial}} fishing begins {{on the first}} Wednesday in October and runs until the first Wednesday after the 15th of March. Commercial fishermen may use individually buoyed traps, but may not dive for <b>lobsters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The whiskery shark is {{an active}} and highly {{specialized}} predator, feeding almost exclusively on octopuses. Other cephalopods, bony fishes, small rock <b>lobsters,</b> spoon worms, and seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents.

It was observed that <b>lobster</b> analogues prepared with <b>lobster</b> base flavour (paste) are suitable organoleptically. The combination of ginger garlic paste and <b>lobster</b> base flavour in the ratio of 3 : 4 was found to be suitable organoleptically. <b>Lobster</b> analogues coloured with annatto seed colour at 1 : 2 (annatto seed:water) concentration had high values for the colour attribute as compared to orange-red synthetic colour, beetroot colour, caramel colour and paprika colour. It was observed that come-up-time to achieve a temperature of 850 °C was 28 minutes with a processing period of 11 minutes...|$|R

5|$|There is {{an annual}} migration, in which spiny <b>lobsters</b> enter {{shallower}} water {{in spring and}} summer, and head out to deeper water in fall and winter, reaching depths as great as , perhaps to avoid the effects of winter storms.|$|E
5|$|For {{those using}} lobster traps, the fishing effort is {{greatest}} {{at the beginning}} of the permitted season in California, and peters out towards the end of the season, 24 weeks later. Although the fishing effort becomes better concentrated on areas with more spiny <b>lobsters</b> during the season, the fishing efficiency (catch per unit effort) nonetheless decreases throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 {{the first}} {{statutory}} No Take Zone (NTZ) for marine nature conservation in the UK {{was set up}} in the waters to the east of Lundy island. In 2008 this was declared as having been successful in several ways including the increasing size and number of <b>lobsters</b> within the reserve, and potential benefits for other marine wildlife. However, the no take zone has received a mixed reaction from local fishermen.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, spiny <b>lobsters</b> are an {{important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
5|$|The Eumalocostraca {{contains}} {{the vast majority}} of the approximately 40,000 living species of malacostracans and consists of three superorders, Syncarida, Peracarida and Eucarida. Syncaridans are mostly small and found in freshwater and subterranean habitats. Peracaridans are characterised by having a marsupium in which they brood their young. They are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and include Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda and Mysida. Eucarida includes <b>lobsters,</b> crabs, shrimps, prawns and krill.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. <b>Lobsters</b> proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E
