5|$|N-88 was unofficially {{designated}} around 1937, connecting from N-29, to N-86 and N-19 in Bridgeport. The route {{remained relatively}} {{the same as}} the state highway system was officially designated. Before 1955, Nebraska did not have an adequate <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> to define the state highway system. By 1960, N-19 was renumbered to US 385, and US 26 was rerouted north near Bridgeport. The old alignment became part of N-92. Two years later, N-29 was renumbered to N-71. Between 1981-82, a road appeared on the official state map, extending from WYO 151 to N-71. That road became part of N-88 by 1986. No significant changes have been made since.|$|E

25|$|The {{move was}} controversial, as the {{coalition}} parties denied their votes {{to the same}} man they had elected Chancellor a month before and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election.

25|$|Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson {{stated that}} the CPPCG was a <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> {{resulting}} from a diplomatic compromise.

Jonassohn and Björnson go on to say that none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support for various reasons.|$|E

40|$|The note {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> as compared with voluntary regimes in narrowing the gender gap on corporate management boards. It finds that <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> to enforce quotas are an effective and fast means of achieving change. The use of voluntary regimes has led to some increase in the proportion of women on corporate boards, but the effects are significantly smaller and slower. The only instance of achieving 40 % of each gender was through the use of <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> to enforce quotas. The note identifies and reports on the positions and recommendations of nine international bodies on this matter...|$|R
25|$|Noted {{earlier this}} is a state form of bankruptcy, not federal form. The {{assignment}} process or any bankruptcy process for that matter is a legal matter. The state attributes of an assignment process may be understood by any attorney however a local/regional bankruptcy attorney in the specific state usually is best equipped to handle the legal {{end of the process}} for the company making the assignment. This is not asserted to diminish an attorney’s capabilities, but to stress the legal niche that this <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> falls within, bankruptcy. Non legal staff familiar with bankruptcy and the assignment process can also affect the speed validity of the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{granting}} of probate {{is the first}} step in the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's property under a will. A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator's (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the testator's will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.|$|E

The Code of Conduct Group, at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The European Commission has confirmed that the Code is not a <b>legal</b> <b>instrument,</b> and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited [...] "political" [...] authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group {{at the end of the}} Presidency concerned.|$|E
