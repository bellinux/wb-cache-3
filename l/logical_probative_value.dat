5000|$|In 1970 The Supreme Court of Canada was {{concerned}} with exclusionary discretion within the judicial system. In R. v. Wray the term “probative value” is used to explain that “judges in criminal cases {{do not have a}} discretion to exclude evidence because of how it was obtained.” [...] "The trial judge's discretion to exclude admissible evidence does not extend beyond his duty to ensure that the minds of the jury will not be prejudiced by evidence of little <b>probative</b> <b>value,</b> but of great prejudicial effect. Exclusion of evidence on the ground that, although its <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> was unquestionable, it was obtained by methods which the judge considers to be unfair, {{has nothing to do with}} his duty to secure a fair trial for the accused." [...] The sole discretion to exclude evidence is based on the weighing of prejudicial <b>value</b> and <b>probative</b> <b>value.</b> Where the material evidence is being considered for exclusion: [...] "...a judge must determine the value of the evidence based on reliability and the strength of the inference it led to, against the cost presented by such evidence, including things as diverse as the practicalities of its presentation, the fairness to the parties and to witnesses, and the potentially distorting effect the evidence can have on the outcome of the case." [...] Judges may face the need to weigh the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> versus the prejudicial impact in nearly any case. A part of this is symbolized by a weighing scale and represents justice.|$|R

40|$|The {{likelihood}} ratio (LR) is a probabilistic method {{that has been}} championed as a ‘simple rule’ for evaluating the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of forensic evidence in court. Intuitively, if the LR is greater than one then the evidence supports the prosecution hypothesis; if the LR is less than one it supports the defence hypothesis, and if the LR is equal to one then the evidence favours neither (and so is considered ‘neutral’—having no <b>probative</b> <b>value).</b> It can be shown by Bayes' theorem that this simple relationship only applies to pairs of hypotheses for which one is the negation of the other (i. e. to mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses) and is not applicable otherwise. We show how easy it can be – even for evidence experts – to use pairs of hypotheses that they assume are mutually exclusive and exhaustive but are not, and hence to arrive at erroneous conclusions {{about the value of}} evidence using the LR. Furthermore, even when mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses are used there are extreme restrictions as to what can be concluded about the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of evidence just from a LR. Most importantly, while the distinction between source-level hypotheses (such as defendant was/was not at the crime scene) and offence-level hypotheses (defendant is/is not guilty) is well known, it is not widely understood that a LR for evidence about the former generally has no bearing on the LR of the latter. We show for the first time (using Bayesian networks) the full impact of this problem, and conclude that it is only the LR of the offence level hypotheses that genuinely determines the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of the evidence. We investigate common scenarios in which evidence has a LR of one but still has significant <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> (i. e. is not neutral as is commonly assumed). As illustration we consider the ramifications of these points for the case of Barry George. The successful appeal against his conviction for the murder of Jill Dando was based primarily on the argument that the firearm discharge residue (FDR) evidence, assumed to support the prosecution hypothesis at the original trial, actually had a LR equal to one and hence was ‘neutral’. However, our review of the appeal transcript shows numerous examples of the problems with the use of hypotheses identified above. We show that if one were to follow the arguments recorded in the Appeal judgement verbatim, then contrary to the Appeal conclusion, the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of the FDR evidence may not have been neutral as was concluded...|$|R

50|$|The {{rationale}} for the exclusion is the irrelevance of such statements, and their lack of <b>probative</b> <b>value,</b> and {{the ease with which}} they can be fabricated. To allow them would be to open the door to much time wasting and the exploration of collateral issues.|$|R

KEY WORDS: A man and a woman were found in a ditch by their snowmobile. The woman was lying face down in the water. The man was sitting face up, but apparently not breathing. CPR was applied to both. Only the man survived. The state charged him with murder. The prosecution’s theory was that he took the opportunity to kill his wife to recover as the beneficiary of a large insurance policy he had purchased that year. To support this charge, the state introduced evidence that the defendant had repeatedly been unfaithful to his wife (Davis & Follette, 2002; henceforth identified as “DF, 2002 ”).

50|$|Nevertheless, {{informal}} admissions in {{many instances}} will be hearsay in nature. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act defines hearsay evidence as “evidence, whether oral or in writing, the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving such evidence.” When the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of an informal admission depends primarily on its maker (which will almost invariably be the case), {{it will be a}} hearsay statement. As, however, section 3 of the Law of Evidence Amendment Act is “subject to the provisions of any other law,” existing statutory provisions will remain the primary route to admission, and the common law will remain “any other factor” {{to be taken into account}} by the court in the exercise of its discretion to admit hearsay in the interests of justice.|$|R
