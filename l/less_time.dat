5|$|A thru-hike {{generally}} requires five {{to seven}} months, although some have done it in three months, and several trail runners have completed the trail in <b>less</b> <b>time.</b> Trail runners typically tackle the AT with automobile support teams, without backpacks, and without camping in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{for people}} {{experiencing}} difficulties with sleep, spending <b>less</b> <b>time</b> in bed results in {{deeper and more}} continuous sleep, so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except sleep (or sex).|$|E

5|$|Patients {{receiving}} brachytherapy {{generally have}} to make fewer visits for radiotherapy compared with EBRT, and overall radiotherapy treatment plans can be completed in <b>less</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} in <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|A more {{recently}} developed batch production method, the FFC Cambridge process, consumes titanium dioxide powder (a refined form of rutile) as feedstock and produces titanium metal, either powder or sponge. The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes <b>less</b> <b>time.</b> If mixed oxide powders are used, {{the product is}} an alloy.|$|E
30|$|Machining time—It is {{the time}} taken by a CNC turning centre to machine a {{workpiece}} having the desired dimensions and shape. <b>Less</b> machining <b>time</b> reduces the lead time to market a product. So, a CNC turning centre which has <b>less</b> machining <b>time</b> is more beneficial for a manufacturing organization.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their high life expectancy, islanders are noted for their low mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. Wilcox (2007) compared age-adjusted mortality of Okinawans versus Americans and found that, during 1995, an average Okinawan was 8 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> likely to die from coronary heart disease, 7 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> likely to die from prostate cancer, 6.5 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> likely to die from breast cancer, and 2.5 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> likely to die from colon cancer than an average American of the same age.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves take <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to collapse than a circle of the same length.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the <b>less</b> <b>time</b> is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} volcano spends <b>less</b> <b>time</b> actively {{attached to}} the plume. The large difference between the youngest and oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot's velocity is increasing. For example, Kohala, the oldest volcano on Hawaii island, is one million years old and last erupted 120,000 years ago, a period of just under 900,000 years; whereas one of the oldest, Detroit Seamount, experienced 18 million {{or more years of}} volcanic activity.|$|E
30|$|In Table 1, the AdaBoost HL cascade {{obtained}} 90 % {{while our}} MS-EGM achieved a higher performance, 97 %. For the average consuming {{time with the}} AR Faces database, the HL cascade costs <b>less</b> consuming <b>time</b> than our MS-EGM. The reason that the HL cascade can cost <b>less</b> consuming <b>time</b> is that {{the background of the}} occluded images is blank.|$|R
30|$|Since those {{calibration}} points {{used for}} local calibration have been unified {{to the global}} coordinate system, all the single-vision sensors are globally unified. So, it is unnecessary to globally calibrate the single-vision sensor. This method directly unifies the local coordinate system to the global coordinate system. It is useful to improve the calibration accuracy due to <b>less</b> <b>times</b> of coordinate transformation.|$|R
30|$|Mice {{were divided}} into seven groups of 10 animals each. Group 1 was {{administrated}} with saline (i.p.) as a control group; group 2 and group 3 i.p. inoculated with Diclo (14.8  mg/kg, five <b>times</b> <b>less</b> than LD 50 and 7.4  mg/kg, 10 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> than LD 50 respectively (EC-SDS diclofenac, 2014)); group 4 and group 5 i.p. injected with Ibu (120  mg/kg, five <b>times</b> <b>less</b> than LD 50 and 60  mg/kg, 10 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> than LD 50 correspondingly (Adams, Bough, Cliffe, Lessel, & Mills, 1969)); and group 6 and group 7 i.p. injected with Para (73.4  mg/kg, five <b>times</b> <b>less</b> than LD 50 and 36.7  mg/kg, 10 <b>times</b> <b>less</b> than LD 50 separately (EC-SDS Acetaminophen, 2015)) daily {{for a period of}} 1  month. At the end of treatment, three mice from each group were euthanized by cervical dislocation at fasting state. Prior to the scarifying, blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus for immunological and biochemical analyses.|$|R
5|$|Initially, Northumberland's {{relations}} with the other great northern family, the Nevilles, were friendly. He was already connected to the Beaufort-Nevilles through his marriage with Eleanor Neville, and in 1426 he married his sister Elizabeth to the young Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland. In the early 1440s, Northumberland was involved in other disputes. A conflict over land with the Archbishop of York escalated into open violence. The king intervened on the archbishop's side, though Northumberland remained in favour at court. Nevertheless, he spent <b>less</b> <b>time</b> involved in central affairs at Westminster in the later 1440s.|$|E
5|$|Moulds {{are built}} through two main methods: {{standard}} machining and EDM. Standard machining, in its conventional form, {{has historically been}} the method of building injection moulds. With technological developments, CNC machining became the predominant means of making more complex moulds with more accurate mould details in <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 2005, the 9 {{train was}} {{discontinued}} and all 1 trains {{began to make}} all stops. The skip-stop service made less sense by 2005 because of the increased number of trains being run and the higher ridership at the bypassed stations; the MTA estimated that eliminating skip-stop service only added 2 to 3 minutes of travel time (for passengers at the northernmost stations at 242nd Street and 238th Street) but many passengers would see trains frequencies double, resulting in decreased overall travel time (because of <b>less</b> <b>time</b> waiting for trains).|$|E

5|$|Reactions to the {{disclosure}} were diverse, encompassing commentary and {{articles in the}} electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his editorial activities Jordan spent <b>less</b> <b>time</b> editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably <b>less</b> <b>time</b> by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E

5|$|The female Eurasian {{treecreeper}} forages {{primarily on}} the upper parts of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts.
