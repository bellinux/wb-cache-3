Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the LNC relied on taking over all, {{or at least a}} {{significant}} portion, of the burials of London's dead. However, while the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 had repealed Chadwick's scheme for two very large cemeteries near London, it had also permitted London's parishes to make their own arrangements for the burial of their dead. Each parish could make arrangements with the cemetery of its choosing, or use money from the rates to create their own cemeteries. The financial mismanagement and internal disputes within the LNC had delayed the opening of Brookwood Cemetery by 18 months, and during this period new cemeteries nearer London had opened or were nearing completion. While some parishes did choose Brookwood as their burial site, many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries, or to buy land on the outskirts of London and open their own suburban cemeteries. Concerns over the financial irregularities and the viability of the scheme had led to only 15,000 of the 25,000 LNC shares being sold, severely limiting the company's working capital and forcing it to take out large loans. Buying the land from Lord Onslow, compensating local residents for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> over Woking Common, draining and landscaping the portion to be used for the initial cemetery, and building the railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings. With far fewer burial contracts with London parishes than had been anticipated, by the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in November 1854 the LNC {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy.|$|E

Theology courses were restored to a full five years, while Philosophy was extended to three years and by 1810 Legal Studies took four years. By 1804 the Lyceum had some 730 students, which was comparable with University of Prague's 760. In 1805 studies were temporarily suspended, as many students entered the Army during the Napoleonic Wars. Another suspension of lectures took place in 1809 because the Lyceum's buildings were taken over to accommodate army personnel. In 1826, there were altogether 26 professors at the Lyceum.|$|E

2500|$|Feminism's {{effect on}} {{polygyny}} in Islam {{is different in}} every Muslim society, depending on the different cultures that are interacting with Islam in each location. [...] For example, in Iran, changes to women's rights occurred {{in the wake of}} the Islamic Revolution in 1979. [...] During this revolution the Family Protection Law, which had given some power to women and imposed minimal restrictions on polygyny, was overturned. [...] Muslim women were encouraged to return to their traditional roles. [...] This <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> led to the movement realizing that they could not necessarily rely on the government alone to protect their rights. [...] This spurred the creation of the personal status laws, which covered many issues relating to marriage and divorce including polygyny. Passed in 1986, the law [...] "effectively reinstates the provision of the 1975 Family Protection Law granting a wife the right to obtain a divorce if her husband marries a second woman without the wife's permission of if…a man does not treat his wives fairly and equally." [...] This offers Iranian Muslim women some legal protection against polygyny, but the enforcement of the law is still up to the interpretation of the courts. [...] Muslim women's movement organizations have begun to gain more power in Iran due to the increasing number of Muslim women who are studying the Qur'an analytically. [...] These new scholars are able to argue for interpretations of Islam that empower rather than oppress women. [...] They also lead organizations like the Association of Muslim Women and Zeynab. [...] Many Muslim women also go jalasehs where they can openly discuss religious texts in a safe environment. So even though the revolution attempted to reinstate many patriarchal values, like unlimited polygyny, it ended up inspiring women to push for more rights and become more credible by studying religious texts.|$|E

During the Great Purge, Štajner was arrested on 4 November 1936 by the NKVD agents and {{accused of being a}} [...] "counterrevolutionary, Gestapo agent, and accomplice in the murder of Sergey Kirov". He was tried together with Yugoslavian communist leaders Filip Filipović and Antun Mavrak, both of whom died during the Great Purge. From November 1936 til May 1937, Štajner was confined in the NKVD prisons Lubyanka and Butyrka, and then submitted to the military court and confined in the Lefortovo Prison. In June 1937 he was found guilty by the military court and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was then transferred to the Solovki prison camp on the Solovetsky Islands, where he was held until August 1939. He was then transferred to the Nadezhda work camp near Dudinka in northern Siberia. There, he took part in the building of the railway and then in the building of the city of Norilsk. In 1943, Štajner was sentenced to ten more years in prison, plus five years of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> In 1948, after the Tito–Stalin split and the expulsion of the CPY from the Comintern, the NKVD asked him to testify against the Yugoslavian leadership, which he refused. Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to Irkutsk, where he was held until 1949, and then to Bratsk, where he was held until September 1953. His 17-year prison term ended on 22 September 1953, six months after the death of Stalin. After being released from prison, Štajner was not allowed to return to Moscow, but was forced to live in exile in Siberia according to the 101st kilometre Law. While in exile, Štajner lived in Krasnoyarsk, Yeniseysk and Maklakovo between 1953 and 1956. There, he worked as a stonemason, and then as a factory worker.|$|E

40|$|In vivo {{effects of}} GABAB receptor-positive {{modulators}} {{suggest that they}} have therapeutic potential for treating {{central nervous system disorders}} such as anxiety, depression, and drug abuse. Although these effects generally are thought to be mediated by positive modulation of GABAB receptors, such modulation has been examined primarily in vitro. The present study was aimed at further examining the in vivo positive modulatory properties of the GABAB receptor-positive modulators, 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -(3 -hydroxy- 2, 2 -dimethylpropyl) phenol (CGP 7930) and (R,S) - 5, 7 -di-tert-butyl- 3 -hydroxy- 3 -trifluoromethyl- 3 H-benzofuran- 2 -one (rac-BHFF). Both compounds enhanced <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>righting</b> induced by baclofen in mice. However, CGP 7930 was less effective and rac-BHFF was less potent for enhancing <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>righting</b> induced by γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which, like baclofen, has GABAB receptor agonist properties. In contrast with baclofen- and GHB-induced <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>righting,</b> the hypothermic effects of baclofen and GHB were not enhanced by rac-BHFF but were enhanced by CGP 7930 only at doses that produced hypothermia when given alone. CGP 7930 -induced hypothermia was not attenuated by the GABAB receptor antagonist 3 -aminopropyl(diethoxymethyl) phosphinic acid (CGP 35348), at doses that blocked baclofen-induced hypothermia, and was not increased by the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, at doses that increased the hypothermic effects of baclofen and GHB. The results provide evidence that CGP 7930 and rac-BHFF act in vivo as positive modulators at GABAB receptors mediating <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>righting,</b> but not at GABAB receptors mediating hypothermia. Conceivably, CGP 7930, but not rac-BHFF, acts as an allosteric agonist at these latter receptors. Taken together, the results provide further evidence of pharmacologically distinct GABAB receptor subtypes, possibly allowing for a more selective therapeutic interference with the GABAB system...|$|R

In contrast, the duration <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>righting</b> reflex was increased in A(2 A) R KO mice versus controls after administration of pentobarbital. Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine uptake, increased the sleep time observed following administration of ethanol in CD 1 mice and in A(2 A) R WT but not in A(2 A) R KO mice. SCH 58261, a selective A(2 A) receptor antagonist, unlike DPCPX, a selective A(1) receptor antagonist, shortened the duration <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>righting</b> reflex induced by ethanol, thus mimicking the lack of receptor in deficient mice. Finally, the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (25 mg/kg) reduced ethanol-induced hypnotic effects.
