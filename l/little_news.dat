25|$|The 1991 {{model year}} had <b>little</b> <b>news</b> for the Premier {{except for a}} new {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) that was also available on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear tail lamp assemblies.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} decade there was <b>little</b> <b>news</b> on the {{progress}} of the case, with a website, meritorpsfs.com, the main source of information. On August 16, 2002 a judge ruled that the FDIC was wrong in seizing Meritor and that shareholders were entitled to damages. On February 10, 2006, Meritor investors were awarded US$371.7 million, totaling US$6.75 a share.|$|E
25|$|Although {{telegraphy}} {{itself is}} not generally regarded as mass media, as its communications are, in effect, on a one-to-one basis, the data and information that was transmitted through Porthcurno had both national and international importance. Wars were declared, announcements of deaths of royalty announced – these in turn were relayed to the national and local newspapers {{for the general public}} to absorb. Without telegraphy, there would have been <b>little</b> <b>news</b> in newspapers, and very little national and global content over the radio airwaves.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other {{conflicts}} to {{have occurred}} in French colonies, the Kongo-Wara rebellion was relegated to relative obscurity amongst the public in France and few politicians and commentators remarked of it. What <b>little</b> <b>news</b> of the rebellion that was made known in Europe helped bring attention to the conditions faced by Central African workers. This led to criticism of French rule in Africa from communists and other groups, leading to French suspicions of the rebellion itself being instigated by communists. Though not achieving independence from the French colonial administration, the Kongo-Wara rebellion achieved an improvement in the conditions which initially sparked resistance, as the administration reduced the worse forms of oppression in a self-interested reaction to negative press the rebellion had caused. The rebellion also exposed several larger issues endemic to the French colonial system; the effect of unchecked, unrestricted capitalism upon native populations, {{and the fact that}} stability was dependent on a fragile, rural elite. Calls for fundamental reform in the wake of these revelations were silenced once order had been restored.|$|E
500|$|As Marshall made <b>little</b> <b>news</b> and {{was viewed}} as a {{somewhat}} comic figure in Washington because of his sense of humor, a number of Democratic party leaders wanted him removed from the 1916 reelection ticket. [...] Wilson, after deliberating, decided keeping Marshall on would demonstrate party unity; thus in 1916 Marshall won reelection over the still divided Republican Party and became the first vice president re-elected since John C. Calhoun in 1828, and Wilson and Marshall became the first president and vice president team to be re-elected since Monroe and Tompkins in 1820.|$|E
500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but <b>little</b> <b>news</b> about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him to make eye contact, never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E
50|$|In the 1890s {{there was}} <b>little</b> {{positive}} <b>news.</b> A {{fire in the}} electrical wiring, another fire at the Federal Hat Company, an accidental shooting, a suicide, a workman falling 60 feet to the ground through a skylight and, finally, in April 1899, a multiple murder.|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games jointly {{announced}} that the intellectual property had been sold to FFG.

5000|$|The {{newspaper}} published very <b>little</b> local <b>news,</b> {{according to}} Don Russell, an Advocate columnist {{who wrote about}} {{the early history of}} the paper. [...] "The columns were filled with sermons, poems and what were called literary 'gems' from various sources, and some domestic and foreign news items taken from newspapers in big cities." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sarah Palin, Governor of Alaska and (then-presumptive) Vice Presidential nominee. In Palin's speech, she portrayed {{herself as}} a {{reformer}} and a fighter for change. She introduced her family and described her life in Alaska, saying she is just [...] "an average hockey mom," [...] while commenting on her recent negative publicity: [...] "Here's a <b>little</b> <b>news</b> flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve {{the people of this}} great country." [...] She defended her relative lack of political experience and criticized Obama. Her speech was well received by the convention delegates and media commentators.|$|E
2500|$|After {{several months}} of {{relatively}} <b>little</b> <b>news</b> or activity from Microsoft with Longhorn, Build 4008 (with a build date of February 19, 2003) made an appearance on the Internet around February 28, 2003. It was also privately handed out to {{a select group of}} software developers. As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained a number of small improvements, including a modified blue [...] "Plex" [...] theme and a new, simplified Windows Image-based installer that operates in graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the same hardware. An optional [...] "new taskbar" [...] was introduced that was thinner than the previous build and displayed the time differently.|$|E
2500|$|John Houston {{arrived in}} Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and bought {{property}} in South Fort George and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks. [...] The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was <b>little</b> <b>news</b> to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the Liberal Party. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted pneumonia and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the Quesnel hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got a chance to read his own obituary, one printed in error by the Vancouver Province. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor.|$|E

Stephanie Rice, Sally Pearson and Anna Meares, for example, are {{all at the}} top of their game and likely to do well. I wonder, though, if women's Olympic sport will receive a similar amount of news coverage as men's. I wonder this because very <b>little</b> sports <b>news</b> is ever about women's sport...|$|R

5000|$|Gary Hart was {{the target}} of a smear {{campaign}} during the 1988 US presidential campaign. Smear campaigns are a campaign tactic associated with yellow journalism which is a type of journalism that presents <b>little</b> well-researched <b>news</b> and instead uses eye-catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism. For example, during Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign, the New York Post reported on its front page big, black block letters: [...] "GARY: I'M NO WOMANIZER." ...|$|R
