5000|$|The {{mug shot}} {{publishing}} {{industry is a}} niche market of tabloid journalism in the United States. The industry consists of companies that publish mug shots and booking details of individuals arrested by law enforcement agencies. These companies publish the arrest information in tabloids, through local and multi-jurisdictional search websites. More than 60 new mug shot websites were created in the two-year period ending March 2013. The related reputation management industry profits when individuals pay a fee to have their mugshot removed from one or more websites. [...] Although there is criticism of the industry, <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> it is a legal business model.|$|E

5000|$|On June 11, 2012, Middleborough made {{national}} headlines after residents approved {{an ordinance}} outlawing {{the use of}} profanity in public that is punishable by a $20 fine. It passed 183-50 {{in the town of}} over 23,000 residents. Many <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> the law violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Dozens of residents {{on both sides of the}} issue attended a protest in front of the town hall. The Massachusetts attorney general will review the bylaw to determine if it is constitutional and adheres to state law. The Massachusetts state director for the American Civil Liberties Union said, [...] "the Supreme Court has ruled that the government can't prohibit public speech just because it contains profanity."The town meeting actually took the previously existing profanity ban and decriminalized it, making it a civil offense subject to a fine.|$|E
5000|$|On March 15, 2007, BBC News {{reported}} that [...] "Transcripts of his testimony were translated from Arabic and edited by the U.S. Department of Defense to remove sensitive intelligence material before release. It appeared, from a judge's question, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had made allegations of torture in US custody." [...] In the Defense Department transcript, Mohammed said his statement {{was not made}} under duress but Mohammed and human rights advocates have alleged that he was tortured. CIA officials have previously told ABC News that [...] "Mohammed lasted the longest under waterboarding, {{two and a half}} minutes, before beginning to talk." [...] <b>Legal</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> this could taint all his statements. Forensic psychiatrist Michael Welner, M.D., an expert in false confessions, observed from the testimony transcript that his concerns about his family may have been far more influential in soliciting Mohammed’s cooperation than any earlier reported mistreatment.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2012, Brand {{testified in}} front of a {{parliamentary}} committee about drug addiction, sharing his experiences and view that drugs should be decriminalised.

[...] Part of this testimony was included in a BBC Three documentary, Russell Brand: From Addiction to Recovery, that aired in December 2012.

50|$|When Ukrainian {{president}} Petro Poroshenko {{took office}} in 2014, a popular uprising had just toppled his predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych. Poroshenko pledged to sell his candy business (Roshen) if elected, but leaked documents indicate that on August 21, 2014 he instead had Mossack Fonseca set up offshore holding company Prime Asset Partners Ltd in the British Virgin Islands and moved his company there, roughly {{two months after the}} election. The move had the potential to save him millions of dollars on his Ukrainian taxes. Records in Cyprus show him as the firm's only shareholder. Some <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> the explanation may be sound; however this isn't making a difference to Ukrainian media making the point that Poroshenko opened his offshore account in August 2014 as Ukrainian soldiers were being massacred by the Russians in Ilovaisk. The Panama Papers report may also have figured in the defeat of a trade deal with the Netherlands in a referendum there on April 6.|$|E
5000|$|Under Florida law, the use {{of deadly}} force against an {{attacker}} is permissible in certain situations. The adoption of the Stand Your Ground law in 2005 modified the self-defense law so {{that a person who}} reasonably believes he or she must use deadly force to prevent serious injury to him- or herself may lawfully do so without first attempting to retreat from an attacker; prosecution for using deadly force in such situations is prohibited. A defendant in a homicide case who claims to have acted in self-defense may petition the court to grant the defendant immunity from prosecution under these provisions of the law. <b>Legal</b> <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that in a pretrial immunity hearing, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show from [...] "a preponderance of the evidence" [...] that he or she acted lawfully, whereas in a trial by jury the burden of proof is on the prosecution, who must show [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] (a much higher standard than required for establishing [...] "a preponderance of the evidence") that the defendant acted unlawfully.|$|E

5000|$|SHYSTER is a {{specific}} example of a general category of <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems, broadly defined as systems that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to solve legal problems.

Legal analysis systems can be further subdivided into two categories: judgment machines and <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems. SHYSTER again belongs to the latter category of <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems. A <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system, as Popple uses the term, is a system capable of performing at a level expected of a lawyer: “AI systems which merely assist a lawyer in coming to legal conclusions or preparing legal arguments are not here considered to be <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems; a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system must exhibit some legal expertise itself." ...|$|R

40|$|Most <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems {{attempt to}} {{implement}} complex models of legal reasoning. Yet {{the utility of}} a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system lies not in {{the extent to which}} it simulates a lawyer's approach to a legal problem, but in the quality of its predictions and of its arguments. A complex model of legal reasoning is not necessary: a successful <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system can be based upon a simplified model of legal reasoning. Some researchers have based their systems upon a jurisprudential approach to the law, yet lawyers are patently able to operate without any jurisprudential insight. A useful <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system should be capable of producing advice similar to that which one might get from a lawyer, so it should operate at the same pragmatic level of abstraction as does a lawyer—not at the more philosophical level of jurisprudence. A <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system called SHYSTER has been developed to demonstrate that a useful <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system can be based upon a pragmatic approach to the law. SHYSTER has a simple representation structure which simplifies the problem of knowledge acquisition. Yet this structure is complex enough for SHYSTER to produce useful advice. SHYSTER is a case-based <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system (although it has been designed so that it can be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system). Its advice is based upon an examination of, and an argument about, the similarities and differences between cases. SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, but it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments. Instead, it employs statistical techniques to quantify the similarity between cases. It decides which cases to use in argument, and what prediction it will make, on the basis of that similarity measure. SHYSTER is of a general design: it provides advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> using a specification language. Four different, and disparate, areas of law have been specified for SHYSTER, and its operation has been tested in each of those legal domains. Testing of SHYSTER in these four domains indicates that it is exceptionally good at predicting results, and fairly good at choosing cases with which to construct its arguments. SHYSTER demonstrates the viability of a pragmatic approach to <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system design. ...|$|R
