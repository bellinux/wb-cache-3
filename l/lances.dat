5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, <b>lances</b> are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than <b>lances.</b> In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than <b>lances</b> and shuriken, <b>lances</b> and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|The Italian painter Paolo Uccello (1397–1475) {{was fascinated}} by perspective, as shown in his {{paintings}} of The Battle of San Romano (c. 1435–1460): broken <b>lances</b> lie conveniently along perspective lines.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based map, with the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: <b>lances</b> are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against <b>lances.</b> Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which affects their weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E
50|$|Acting <b>lance</b> daffadar is the {{equivalent}} rank to <b>lance</b> corporal in Pakistan, Indian and British Indian Army cavalry units, ranking below <b>lance</b> daffadar. In other units {{the equivalent}} is <b>lance</b> naik. Like a British <b>lance</b> corporal, he wears a single rank chevron.|$|R
5000|$|Major <b>Lance</b> {{was married}} to Christine (née Boular) <b>Lance.</b> He had 12 children. He was arrested twice in his life. In 1965, {{he was arrested in}} {{violation}} of the Paternity Act. A Chicago woman, Para Lee Thomas, claimed she had a son by <b>Lance,</b> Ronnie Maurice <b>Lance,</b> born [...] She asserted that <b>Lance</b> had promised to pay her doctor and hospital bills of around $375, but had defaulted on these payments. Judge Benjamin J. Kanter issued a warrant for <b>Lance's</b> arrest, setting <b>Lance's</b> bond at $1,000.|$|R
40|$|In this research, coal {{combustion}} behavior across {{the regions of}} blowpipe, tuyere, and raceway of blast furnace are numerically examined. Three different <b>lance</b> configurations, including a single <b>lance,</b> a double air-cooled coaxial <b>lance,</b> and an oxy-coal <b>lance</b> with different oxygen enrichment patterns, are taken into consideration. The {{coal combustion}} efficiency by the double <b>lance</b> injection is 5. 1 % higher than that by single <b>lance</b> injection. From the calculated temperature by the oxy-coal <b>lance,</b> coal ignition is retarded due to the cooling effect of enriched oxygen flowing through the <b>lance</b> annulus, resulting in the moderation of pressure loss within the raceway. Most importantly, the enriched oxygen becomes the combustion enhancer in the downstream of coal plume after ignition is triggered. Consequently, the coal burnout under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> injection is comparative to that under the double air-cooled <b>lance</b> injection. The performance of blast furnace may be improved with the advantages provided by the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> injection. Compared with the single <b>lance</b> injection, coal trajectories under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> injection are closer to the tuyere exit due to the higher inertia force of coal particles against hot blast. This {{should be taken into}} account for the designs of the oxy-coal <b>lance...</b>|$|R
5|$|Commanding 75 <b>lances</b> from Kinsky's company, and {{followed}} by {{the bulk of his}} force, Nassau passed through a narrow path in a small forest, and, coming out to open field, was surprised by the Spanish troops, namely by those under Hendrik van den Bergh, followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the 's-Hertogenbosch <b>lances.</b> Van den Bergh's harquebusiers, discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest, fired a volley and, turning right, clashed with the Dutch scouts, starting the action. There was then a firece fight. The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons, but caught by surprise in a narrow passage, the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their <b>lances,</b> so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols. Philip of Nassau, his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight. Kinsky's and Balen's troops, coming in relief, were unable to rescue the wounded commanders, and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield. Nicholas Parker, however, managed to collect the fugitives and, renewing the action, he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry. The encounter turned then a general action out the wood, in open ground.|$|E
5|$|Imports to England {{during the}} inter-war years were chiefly from areas of British {{military}} influence and commerce: Bahrain, Egypt, Transjordan, and Iraq. Both Florence Amherst and the <b>Lances</b> imported breeding stock from {{the latter two}} countries. Despite substantial populations of Salukis in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, none of these were imported to England.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors {{were armed}} with one- and two-handed broadswords, <b>lances,</b> pikes, rapiers, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Crossbows were easier to {{maintain}} than matchlocks, {{especially in the}} humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic free <b>lance,</b> {{discovered}} accidentally in 2005, is a {{new type}} of injection <b>lance</b> with its top-end connected with a flexible joint so that the <b>lance</b> tip could move during the gas injection. Without mechanical driving apparatus, the free <b>lance</b> is capable of injection of reagent into wide space of the bath. The investigation of the free <b>lance</b> indicated that the <b>lance</b> movement caused forceful interaction of the injection gas with the liquid phase, and jet trajectory was changed due to the drag force from the liquid phase. A <b>lance</b> with weight of 15 kg and length of 2 m has been used as the free <b>lance</b> for modeling study, indicating that the heavy free <b>lance</b> for the industry could achieve certain extent of movement for dispersion injection, and this prediction has been proved in 2012 by industrial application of the 9 meters free <b>lance</b> used for the injection modification of end-slag from BOF converter. In 2013, a stationary refractory <b>lance</b> with weight of 2 t for 120 t ladle of steelmaking desulphurization has also been redesigned and converted into the dynamic free <b>lance</b> with initial tests exhibiting the <b>lance</b> movement...|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} home from a camping trip, Anne finds a snake in her belongings. <b>Lance</b> tries to save his sister and he is bitten. <b>Lance</b> becomes jealous when Amy begins {{spending a lot of}} time with Drew Kirk (Dan Paris). Philip and Ruth marry and <b>Lance</b> reassures Hannah about their new family. <b>Lance</b> and Amy break up and <b>Lance</b> begins exhibiting strange behaviour. <b>Lance</b> develops a gambling problem and the stress leads him to collapse. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) offers to be an invigilator when <b>Lance</b> sits his exams at home. <b>Lance's</b> results are not what he expected, but good enough for him to study Horticulture at Eden Hills University. Amy introduces <b>Lance</b> to her boyfriend, Damien Smith (John Ridley), and he begins gambling again. <b>Lance</b> fakes a robbery at Number 26 after he pawns Ruth's fob watch. <b>Lance</b> is ashamed and he writes a letter of apology and begins attending Gamblers Anonymous meetings.|$|R
50|$|After feeling miffed that <b>Lance</b> {{always seemed}} to side with Lorie, Vanessa plotted to shift their family company, Prentiss Industries, into Lucas' control, unbeknownst to <b>Lance,</b> and she later {{followed}} through with her plan. <b>Lance</b> was disappointed when Vanessa oust him as the company boss while Vanessa told Lorie she would not put <b>Lance</b> back in charge unless Lorie divorced him, which put a series of pressure on Lorie after <b>Lance</b> began spirring out of control. Lorie finally gave into Vanessa's demands by straining her marriage to <b>Lance,</b> which led to <b>Lance</b> leaving town.|$|R
5|$|The Fire Emblem series' Weapon Triangle {{mechanic}} {{is featured}} again, {{in which the}} three main close-combat weapons are strong or weak against each other: axes are strong against <b>lances,</b> <b>lances</b> are strong against swords, and swords are strong against axes. Other similar mechanics exist, such as fire magic being more damaging to some beasts, and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies. Weapon durability decreases over time, with weapons eventually breaking when used {{a certain number of}} times. Weapons have different levels of strength, with its assigned letter (E to A and S) denoting the level of skill required to wield it. Weapons forged at Base can also be customized with a unique name. Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle; fire is weak to wind, wind is weak to thunder, and thunder is weak to fire.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges wore heavy armor, such as Sugarloaf helms, {{and scale}} armor (made of iron, bronze, horn or horse hoof). They used long two-handed <b>lances</b> called Contus, which they wielded from horses, whom they barded. Their {{military}} was exclusively {{made up of}} cavalry. They {{are believed to have}} used saddle blankets on their horses.|$|E
5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their <b>lances</b> each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the <b>lances</b> shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E
50|$|While <b>Lance</b> {{reads the}} book, a {{flashback}} shows that <b>Lance</b> cheated on Mia and when Harper went to comfort her, {{she decided to}} sleep with Harper {{in order to get}} back at <b>Lance.</b> Enraged, <b>Lance</b> snaps and nearly beats Harper to death (despite Harper's attempts to explain), culminating in <b>Lance</b> preparing to throw Harper over the balcony ledge. Although Quentin calmly manages to talk <b>Lance</b> out of it, <b>Lance</b> calls off the wedding instead. Quentin gives Harper a look of disapproval before leaving, as Harper has brought all of this on himself.|$|R
50|$|Lorie {{claims that}} the only reason nothing {{happened}} between <b>Lance</b> and herself, was <b>Lance's</b> being in love with Leslie. In answer, Brad tells Lorie that <b>Lance</b> loves Leslie, but as a fan loves a performer. <b>Lance</b> later calls Brad and Leslie to invite himself for a visit. Leslie immediately instigates plans to get Lorie and <b>Lance</b> together again.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lance</b> {{life was}} also low initially. Inexperienced {{operators}} could destroy a <b>lance</b> {{in as little}} as 10 minutes. However, as a result of modifications to the <b>lance</b> design, the development of techniques to determine the position of the <b>lance</b> in the bath, and a rise in the operating experience, the typically <b>lance</b> life was extended to a week.|$|R
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - <b>lances</b> are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than <b>lances.</b> A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Common motifs of the Parthian period include {{scenes of}} royal hunting expeditions and the {{investiture}} of Arsacid kings. Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers. Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, frescos, and even graffiti. Geometric and stylized plant patterns {{were also used}} on stucco and plaster walls. The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with <b>lances</b> {{first appeared in the}} Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad {{also sent}} Khalid on an {{expedition}} to Dumatul Jandal, to attack the Christian Prince Ukaydir {{who lived in a}} castle there. This took place in March 631 AD, 9AH,11th month of the Islamic Calendar. In this campaign, Khaled took the Prince hostage and threatened to kill him until the door of the castle was opened. Muhammad then later ransomed him in exchange for 2000 camels, 800 sheep, 400 sets of armour, 400 <b>lances,</b> and a pledge to pay Jizyah.|$|E
50|$|Hannah Martin {{develops}} {{a crush on}} <b>Lance,</b> a student in Year 9. <b>Lance</b> eventually asks Hannah out and they begin dating. <b>Lance</b> takes his mother's jewellery and gives it to Hannah to impress her. When <b>Lance's</b> father reveals {{the truth about the}} jewellery, Hannah is furious, but forgives <b>Lance.</b> After boasting to his mates that he had had sex with Hannah, <b>Lance</b> is dumped. <b>Lance</b> changes schools and moves {{to the other side of}} Erinsborough. <b>Lance</b> returns and he and Hannah become friends again. Ruth and Philip Martin, Hannah's father, are opposed to their children hanging around together. After a while, things calm down and <b>Lance</b> returns to Erinsborough High and Ruth rents Number 32 from Philip. <b>Lance</b> gets a job at a plant nursery, so he can raise some money to send them on holiday in the hope they will get back together.|$|R
50|$|Philip <b>Lance</b> and Salem Van Every, <b>Lance's</b> son-in-law, {{started selling}} single serve snacks in 1913. Two years later, {{they opened the}} doors of the <b>Lance</b> Packaging Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1943, Philip <b>Lance</b> Van Every took over {{leadership}} of <b>Lance,</b> still a privately held company. Today, <b>Lance,</b> Inc., is a leader in the snack food industry and one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of snack foods in the United States, especially in the South.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lance</b> life is {{typically}} two weeks, with <b>lance</b> changes taking 30 to 40 minutes, and repairs usually being limited to {{replacement of the}} <b>lance</b> tips.|$|R
5|$|One {{of these}} was Brigadier General Frederick Lance of the 19th Lancers, and his wife, Gladys, {{returned}} to Britain with two Salukis from Sarona, where he was stationed during the post-war occupation. The <b>Lances</b> were both keen hunters, and rode with their pack of dogs, including both Salukis and terriers, to course jackal and Dorcas Gazelle whilst stationed in the desert. They imported a male, called Sarona Kelb, who became an influence on the breed in the West.|$|E
5|$|Shulaprota (pierced by sharp pointed spear/dart): Some {{people give}} shelter to birds or animals {{pretending to be}} their saviours, but then harass them poking with threads, needles or using them like lifeless toys. Also, some people behave the same way to humans, winning their {{confidence}} and then killing them with sharp tridents or <b>lances.</b> The bodies of such sinners, fatigued with hunger and thirst, are pierced with sharp, needle-like spears. Ferocious carnivorous birds like vultures and herons tear and gorge their flesh.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — <b>lances</b> are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than <b>lances.</b> As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lance</b> naik (L/Nk) is the {{equivalent}} rank to <b>lance</b> corporal in the Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indian Armies and before 1947, in the British Indian Army, ranking below naik. In cavalry units {{the equivalent}} is acting <b>lance</b> daffadar. Like British <b>lance</b> corporals, each wears a single rank chevron.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lance's</b> partner. An arrogant devidra who {{believes}} firmly in his master {{and who would}} do anything to protect him. Argues with Tamazo a lot and is shown to have a vendetta with the tamadra ever since Tamazo ate his lunch. It is revealed in episode 18 that Devi was [...] "cast aside" [...] by a previous owner and that he should've never become <b>Lance's</b> partner in the first place. His relationship with <b>Lance</b> is familial and he has been with <b>Lance</b> since childhood until <b>Lance</b> was taken away from him by the Guild. In the past, <b>Lance</b> referred to Devi as [...] "Master Devi". Devi now refers to <b>Lance</b> as his [...] "Master", a title handed to <b>Lance</b> when they reunited after years of separation. At the ends of episode 17 and 18, it was revealed Devi met the Ancient of Darkness, Daphness, to discuss something of dire importance regarding <b>Lance...</b>|$|R
50|$|Carly buys <b>Lance</b> {{a lottery}} ticket which wins him {{half a million}} dollars. <b>Lance</b> then {{purchases}} a mobile home in the caravan park. His father, Les (Kevin Golsby) takes $50,000 from <b>Lance</b> and runs off with another woman, leaving Colleen heart-broken. She decides {{to move in with}} <b>Lance,</b> who does not want her to stay with him. <b>Lance</b> buys a new car with some of his money. Martin then acts iressponsibly which results in the vehicle being stolen, <b>Lance</b> nearly tells him he wants nothing to do with him. When Colleen decides she wants to date Donald, <b>Lance</b> spikes his drink. However, Celia Stewart (Fiona Spence) drinks it. He continues to try to keep the two apart. Gary Samuels (Darius Perkins) convinces <b>Lance</b> to invest money in a nightclub. <b>Lance</b> does not realise that Gary is conning him and the nightclub does not exist. Alison Patterson (Kathryn Ridley) then pretends she is attracted to <b>Lance</b> so he will buy her a new dress and hire a limosine for her. She then attempts to persuade him to buy a new car for her and he does so, only it is a toy. <b>Lance</b> then decides to give his money away.|$|R
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against <b>lances,</b> <b>lances</b> strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire <b>lances,</b> the first firearm.|$|E
5|$|News of the Qurayzah's {{supposed}} {{renunciation of}} the pact with Muhammad leaked out, and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were {{reinforced by the}} movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 <b>lances,</b> 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.|$|E
5000|$|The {{usage of}} a <b>lance</b> rest {{can be more}} readily gleaned {{by looking at the}} French term [...] "arrêt", or [...] "arrest". The <b>lance</b> rest was not used to simply hold the weight of the <b>lance,</b> as the English name might suggest, but to arrest the {{rearward}} movement of the weapon. [...] This would allow the wielder of the <b>lance</b> to couch the weapon more securely, thus delivering a more solid blow to his target while lessening the chance of injury to himself. The <b>lance</b> rest achieves this by spreading the impact of a blow through the breastplate to the torso of the wearer, thus redirecting the force of the blow away from the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. [...] A ring of leather around the handle of the <b>lance,</b> placed behind the hand but before the armpit or <b>lance</b> rest and typically known as a grapper or arrêt de <b>lance,</b> is used to further secure the <b>lance</b> in its couched position. When used in conjunction, the <b>lance</b> rest and grapper are able to stabilize the <b>lance</b> considerably when it is in its couched position.|$|R
50|$|At {{the library}} dedication, <b>Lance</b> finds {{that he can}} no longer live with his lie and confesses before the school. <b>Lance</b> is denounced by the {{students}} and faculty, including Claire. <b>Lance</b> nevertheless feels reborn and dives naked into the school's swimming pool. Andrew tells <b>Lance</b> he knew the truth all along, and that he enjoyed <b>Lance's</b> writing. The two of them happily watch a zombie movie with Bonnie.|$|R
