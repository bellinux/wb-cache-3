5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a terraced house in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> {{order to be able to}} afford the {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E

While the number of people working <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> is high <b>in</b> Japan compared to other developed countries, it is high even when compared to underdeveloped countries. The article confirms that overtime hours are longer and the number of annual paid vacation days is low. It also indicates some topics for research on ways to alleviate excessively <b>long</b> working <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> Japan. The article touches upon overtime hours and the function of premium overtime pay, problems in measuring labor productivity, the impact of <b>long</b> working <b>hours</b> on the health of individuals, the effects of a performance-based system, a managerial/supervisorial issue, and consumer demand, indicating that problems in these areas need to be addressed in order {{to solve the problem of}} <b>long</b> working <b>hours.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

The misogeny is expressed as Ilbe's lauguage subculture which conveys criticism of and frustration at the Korean gender structure where men must serve in the conscription and work the <b>longest</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the world, while the most commonly desired occupation for adult women {{is that of a}} housewife.|$|R

25|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature of western style riding {{is in the}} saddle, which has a substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to {{be attached to the}} saddle.|$|E
25|$|The Victorian era in {{particular}} became notorious for {{the conditions under}} which children were employed. Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> dangerous, often fatal, working conditions. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults. Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80-hour weeks.|$|E
25|$|Deng {{arrived in}} France on October 19, 1920, but {{within three months}} the Sichuan Association which {{sponsored}} his trip ran out of money. Deng then worked at Schneider & Co., France's largest ordnance manufacturer, in Creusot, a southern city. Deng {{was surprised to see}} white people treat Chinese like slaves in Shanghai and other ports along the way. Although he and many of his Chinese colleagues had considered themselves economically well off in China, they now worked <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> poor conditions while they saw French families living in luxury unknown in China. Deng learned how to use an industrial welder, a skill which proved useful when he was deposed from power during the Cultural Revolution and sent to work in a factory.|$|E

25|$|The empress {{developed}} extremely {{rigorous and}} disciplined exercise habits. Every castle {{she lived in}} was equipped with a gymnasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her bedchamber {{so that she could}} practise on them each morning, and the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up fencing in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day for hours on end, becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to sciatica, she could no longer endure <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.|$|E
25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to work <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a lariat (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse {{with one hand and}} use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.|$|E

500|$|She would {{describe}} her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience. Initially, {{she felt like}} [...] "a visitor landing in an alien country" [...] as her exposure had been limited to the Bronx and Puerto Rico. Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20). She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year; her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics. She put in <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence. She became a moderate student activist and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students. She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.|$|E

[...] He was not always seen as a [...] "team player" [...] by {{members of his own}} party in the legislature whose backgrounds he did not generally share. [...] This was particularly manifested in his push for a broad-based sales tax, opposition to which had been enshrined in the Democratic Party platform; the proposal went down to bipartisan defeat in the legislature. [...] During his administration, Furcolo established a network of regional community colleges throughout the Commonwealth, and fought for increases in state worker salaries, as well as improvements in workmen's compensation and unemployment benefits. He introduced income-tax withholding from payroll checks, leading to a significant increase in state revenue. [...] According to the state's 1960 report, it ranked first in the nation in education and at or near the top in other social programs. [...] He also appointed the state's youngest state purchasing agent, Bernard [...] "Bunny" [...] Solomon, who saved taxpayers hundreds of thousands annually.|$|E

Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that [...] "not much changed" [...] nearly a decade after Vick left. One resident {{said that there was}} drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and other killings in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many.

Workplace stress and home responsibilities {{are among the}} top five causes of absence from work. Yet work-life balance has emerged as a key concern for employers, policy makers and the media. This edited volume contains findings from 14 research projects within the ESRC's Future of Work Programme. The research examines the notion of employment flexibility and the effects of gender and care responsibilities on work and work performance. Conflicting needs of employers and employees and the gender divisions in work and family life call into question the feasibility of achieving the Government's aim of work-life balance for everyone...|$|R
