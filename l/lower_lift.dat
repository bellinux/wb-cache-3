25|$|Higher lift allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a higher lift cam results in less airflow than with a cam with <b>lower</b> <b>lift</b> but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this higher lift could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the intake side. Notably though, higher lift has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|E
25|$|This LeSabre {{came out}} in 1991 for the 1992 model year, the LeSabre was {{redesigned}} {{along the same lines}} as the previous year's Park Avenue. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door ("family-style") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and <b>lower</b> <b>lift</b> over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} popularity of bariatric sur-gery, patients with multiple body contour deformities {{have become more}} common in plastic surgery practice. Most of the deformities involving the abdomen, thighs, and but-tocks can be effectively corrected with belt lipectomy and <b>lower</b> body <b>lift.</b> A common problem with this procedure is postoperative loss of gluteal projection and resulting flat-tened buttock contour, which is directly proportional {{to the extent of}} <b>lower</b> body <b>lift</b> achieved. The use of local myo-cutaneous flaps to provide coverage for the lumbosacral defects is a common plastic surgery procedure. The authors have used these techniques to create an autologous buttock implant for additional projection during a <b>lower</b> body <b>lift.</b> A local myocutaneous flap originating within the regularly excised supragluteal tissue is rotated caudally to function a...|$|R

50|$|The AE82 Sprinter sedan had {{slightly}} different head lamps {{compared to the}} AE82 Corolla, 4 side windows, inclined c-pillar, different tail lamps the boot was placed a little higher and front aero grills were like the AE86 Levin. It had an overall similarity with the AE86 Levin coupe. The RWD Sprinter came with pop-up head lamps (the Corolla had fixed head lamps) and the front bumper was raised a little to accommodate them. The US Corolla GTS shared the head lamps with the Japanese market AE86 Sprinter but with small differences such as <b>lower</b> <b>lift</b> height and US globe fittings. The Sprinter sold in Australia was actually identical to a Japanese market Corolla {{in all of its}} specifications (e.g. no pop-up head lamps, Japanese market tail lamps).|$|E
5000|$|These {{last three}} designs changed the wing {{geometry}} by extending the wing rearwards {{at right angles}} to the trailing edge. Akaflieg Darmstadt took a different approach, pivoting the single piece flap near the tip and sliding it out from within the wing trailing edge, gaining the mechanism the nickname [...] "penknife wing". As it is extended, a track in the fuselage side guides the thin flap into its high camber position at the wing root. The wing area is increased by 21% with the flaps extended. Although this arrangement avoids the vortexes at the flap tip, like any area increasing method used on a fixed span wing it results in a lower aspect ratio and hence a <b>lower</b> <b>lift</b> to drag ratio.|$|E
