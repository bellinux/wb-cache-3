30|$|Chaudron ([1988]) {{says that}} in a {{learning}} situation where only L 2 {{is used as a}} medium of instruction, learners face problems because their task is three fold. The first is that the <b>learner</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make sense of the instructional task which is presented in the second language. Secondly, the <b>learner</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> attain linguistic competence that is required for effective learning to take place and finally, the student is faced with the problem of mastering the content itself. These findings were on studies done on spoken language. For the deaf, the task of learning a second language that is distinct from their L 1 /MT is even more demanding. But this does not mean it cannot be done.|$|R

This paper provides an overview of practical approaches and techniques to teaching culture in the classroom in conjunction with instruction in the essential language skills.
