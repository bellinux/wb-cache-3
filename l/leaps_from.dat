5|$|For a time, {{it seems}} Exdeath has been truly destroyed, {{and the party}} celebrates in Tycoon. Bartz, however, is {{contacted}} by the sage Ghido. Meeting with him, a thorn suddenly <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> Krile's palm, manifesting as Exdeath, now resurrected and fully {{in command of the}} Void. With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence, tossing them into a tear in reality.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of Hopkins’s poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in Heaven-Haven, where {{the comparison is}} between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, {{as it is in}} As Kingfishers Catch Fire, where he <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.|$|E
25|$|Camel jumping is a {{traditional}} sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe {{on the west coast}} of Yemen in a desert plain by the Red Sea. Camels are placed side to side and victory goes to the competitor who <b>leaps,</b> <b>from</b> a running start, over the most camels. The jumpers train year round for competitions. Tribesmen (women may not compete) tuck their robes around their waists for freedom of movement while running and leaping.|$|E

500|$|Kirkus Reviews {{described}} Voices {{as a story}} [...] "fraught {{with political}} tension", and stated that though the analogies to contemporary politics were clear, Le Guin's world building was so thorough that the story did not [...] "bludgeon readers with allegory", and allowed them to imagine alternatives to violence, and to appreciate the power of language. The San Francisco Chronicle also wrote that the themes of the book were timely, and that while the plot had [...] "high stakes", Le Guin [...] " [...] her prose calm and free of melodrama." [...] Le Guin's prose was likewise praised by a review in The Buffalo News, which said that [...] "The power of the novel lies...in the language that <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> the pages and into the brain pan, producing a lovely explosion there." ...|$|E
500|$|Hippopotamuses have {{barrel-shaped}} {{bodies with}} short legs and long muzzles. Their skeletal structures are , adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity {{allows them to}} sink and move {{along the bottom of}} a river. Hippopotamuses have small legs (relative to other megafauna) because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotamuses can gallop at [...] on land but normally trot. They are incapable of jumping but do climb up steep banks. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> the bottom. The eyes, ears, and nostrils of hippos are placed high on the roof of their skulls. This allows these organs to remain above the surface {{while the rest of the}} body submerges. The testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. In addition, the penis retracts into the body when not erect. The genitals of the female are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large diverticula protrude from the vulval vestibule. The function of these is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Belt {{begins to}} act irrationally then collapses {{screaming}} as he hears {{mention of the}} ghostlike entity from the astronauts. Paramedics are called to attend to him, and find him cowering under his desk whimpering and begging for help. Before Belt is taken away, he tells the agents that the shuttle will not survive reentry due to sabotage by 'the face', which had lived inside his body and possessed him since his time in orbit. At his urging, they alert the shuttle to change its trajectory and are just able to land it successfully. In the hospital, Belt continues to wrestle with the presence, telling Mulder he wasn't responsible but also couldn't stop it, as [...] "it came to me, it lives in me". Eventually, in a last wrestle with the re-possessing entity, he shouts [...] "no more" [...] as he <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> the window to his death - experiencing a lengthy flashback to his last space mission as he falls. Mulder theorizes that, while Belt was compelled to sabotage the launches by the entity possessing him, {{he was also the}} one who sent Generoo the evidence of what was taking place. He lauds Belt's final sacrifice, stating that in the end he gave his life for the mission, as befits a true astronaut.|$|E

500|$|Maximum {{stated that}} Jumping Flash! {{was one of}} the most [...] "imaginative, playable, enjoyable" [...] and {{original}} titles seen on the fifth generation of video game consoles. They criticised its length and lack of difficulty, expressing that it could have been one of the [...] "greatest games ever" [...] if it was longer and more difficult, and questioned whether it was [...] "a really worthwhile" [...] purchase. Game Revolution called the graphics [...] "mind blowing" [...] and the game itself [...] "totally unique", but criticised the overall length and ease of play. IGN's 1996 review similarly disapproved the difficulty, stating that despite the small worlds and easy difficulty, it is [...] "a great, genre-pushing game", also saying it is an essential for all PlayStation owners. In 1996, Next Generation listed it as number 86 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time", saying it had created the genre of 3D platforming. They particularly praised [...] "the vertigo inducing sense of height as Robbit <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> platform to platform." [...] In a 2007 review, Greg Miller of IGN condemned the graphics as [...] "dated", having [...] "jagged edges" [...] and [...] "muddled" [...] colours, and said every aspect of the game is [...] "weak" [...] and that it had not stood [...] "the test of time". In a retrospective review, Andrew Yoon of Engadget praised the gameplay and innovation, saying the [...] "grainy" [...] and [...] "antiquated" [...] graphics did no harm to the vibrant atmosphere of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Haeckel was a {{flamboyant}} figure, {{who sometimes}} took great, non-scientific <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> available evidence. For example, {{at the time}} when Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). [...] At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified. [...] He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, Pithecanthropus alalus, and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to go and find it.|$|E

A horrified housekeeper, who has been following her and had witnessed the murder, does not tell Hitler's parents because of fear of death as punishment, but rather bribes a gypsy to sell her baby. The baby is then returned to the Hitler household where he takes his place to become the Hitler that the world knew.|$|E

Rolando is in a rage while Arrigo confesses his love for Lida but asks for death. [...] Lida then declares {{that she is the}} guilty one. [...] Still raging, Rolando storms out to lead the Milanese troops into battle, but as he leaves, he locks the tower door on Arrigo and Lida, declaring that Arrigo will suffer a fate worse than death: the infamy of being absent from the battle in which he had promised to fight, and so will lose his honour. As trumpets signal the beginning of the battle, Arrigo, in desperation, <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> the tower into the moat, shouting [...] "Long Live Italy!". Lida remains in anguish.|$|E
2500|$|When Basilio {{starts to}} gossip about Cherubino's obvious {{attraction}} to the Countess, the Count angrily <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> his hiding place (terzetto: [...] – [...] "What do I hear!"). He disparages the [...] "absent" [...] page's incessant flirting and describes how he caught him with Barbarina under the kitchen table. As he lifts the dress from the chair to illustrate how he lifted the tablecloth to expose Cherubino, he finds ... the self same Cherubino! The count is furious, but is reminded that the page overheard the Count's advances on Susanna, something that the Count wants to keep from the Countess. The young man is ultimately saved from punishment by {{the entrance of the}} peasants of the Count's estate, a preemptive attempt by Figaro to commit the Count to a formal gesture symbolizing his promise that Susanna would enter into the marriage unsullied. The Count evades Figaro's plan by postponing the gesture. The Count says that he forgives Cherubino, but he dispatches him to his own regiment in Seville for army duty, effective immediately. Figaro gives Cherubino mocking advice about his new, harsh, military life from which all luxury, and especially women, will be totally excluded (aria: Non più andrai – [...] "No more [...] ").|$|E

[...] After telling Management that he wants out, Michael <b>leaps</b> <b>from</b> a helicopter and into the ocean, effectively ending their relationship as well as the [...] "protection" [...] that Management had secretly been providing for Michael.|$|E
