40|$|We study {{coupled motion}} of a 1 -D closed elastic string {{immersed}} in a 2 -D Stokes flow, known as the Stokes immersed boundary problem in two dimensions. Using the fundamental solution of the Stokes equation and the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinate</b> of the string, we write the problem into a contour dynamic formulation, which is a nonlinear non-local equation solely keeping track of evolution of the string configuration. We prove existence and uniqueness of local-in-time solution starting from an arbitrary initial configuration that is an H^ 5 / 2 -function in the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinate</b> satisfying the so-called well-stretched assumption. We also prove that when the initial string configuration is sufficiently close to an equilibrium, which is an evenly parameterized circular configuration, then global-in-time solution uniquely exists and it will converge to an equilibrium configuration exponentially as t→ +∞.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{numerical}} {{model for the}} simulation of constituent transport in both steady and unsteady flow conditions is presented. The transport model is a routing procedure in which the advection process is solved {{by means of the}} <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinate</b> transformation, while the dispersion process is approximated within each time step by means of the convolution principle, exploiting a multilinear procedure. In order to facilitate the application of the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinate</b> transformation during unsteady flow conditions, the unsteady velocity field corresponding to the linearized parabolic approximation of the Saint Venant Equations is provided, taking into account appropriate boundary conditions. Finally, classic BOD-DO relationships are embedded into the routing procedure in order to perform water quality applications with reactive constituents. The model is first demonstrated with respect to a numerical water quality model in both steady and unsteady hydraulic conditions, and is then applied to two real-world cases. Because of its characteristics, the proposed model seems suitable for real time forecast of pollutant concentrations when an emergency event occurs, or for water quality management in real rivers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the collection of}} Lagrangian data from the ocean and results about the well-posedness of the primitive equations have led to a renewed interest in solving flow equations in <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinates.</b> We do not take the view that solving in <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinates</b> equates to solving on a moving grid that can become twisted or distorted. Rather, the grid in <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinates</b> represents the initial position of particles, and it does not change with time. However, using <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinates</b> results in solving a highly nonlinear partial differential equation. The nonlinearity is mainly due to the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation, which is a precise record of how the particles are rotated and stretched. For linear (spatial) flows we give an explicit formula for the Jacobian. We also prove that linear (in space) steady state solutions of the Lagrangian shallow water equations have Jacobian equal to one. Given the formula for the Jacobian, we describe the two situations where the Lagrangian shallow water equations are invalid in <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>coordinates</b> for long time integrations, because the shallow water assumption is violated. On the other hand, in situations where the shallow water assumption is not violated, accurate numerical solutions are found with finite differences, the Chebyshev pseudospectral method, and the fourth order Runge–Kutta method.
