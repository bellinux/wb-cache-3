This is not required by any federal regulation but rather {{is a matter of}} voluntary industry policy. However, as increasing numbers of vehicles are equipped with daytime running lights, daytime-illuminated motorcycle headlamp may no longer provide a significant [...] benefit. Some motorcyclists install headlamp modulators in the belief they increase motorcycle conspicuity in traffic.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop and evaluate various means of making motorcycles more conspicuous. More than 30 conspicuity treatments were developed, and the most promising ones were evaluated in day and night tests involving ordinary car drivers on public roads. The tests established which conspicuity treatments effectively deterred motorists from ac-cepting short time gaps. Findings showed that daytime conspicuity of a motorcycle is sig-nificantly improved if (1) its normal <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> is turned on or (2) its high-beam headlamp is turned on and is modulating in intensity three times per second or (3) the motorcyclist is wearing a high-visibility (fluorescent) vest and helmet cover. Nighttime con-spicuity is significantly improved when the motorcycle uses additional running lights or the cyclist is wearing a retroreflective vest and helmet cover. Given that about three out of four motorcycle accidents occur in daytime, one major conclusion drawn from the study is that the most effective means of improving daytime conspicuity (considering performance, cost, and cyclist convenience) is to require motorcyclists to drive during the day with their <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> turned on...|$|E
40|$|This {{nighttime}} {{field study}} addressed the relative visibility of retroreflective pavement markings from trucks and cars. To do that, both <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> mounting height and observer eye height were varied. The task involved detecting {{the presence of}} a strip of retroreflective pavement marking that was moved towards a stationary observer. The main finding is that headlamp mounting height had a statistically significant effect on detection distance. Increasing the mounting height from the lowest tested level (0. 6 m) to the highest tested level (1. 2 m) resulted in a 19 % increase in detection distance. On the other hand, there was no effect of eye height over the range tested (1. 2 m to 2. 4 m). Because truck headlamps are generally mounted higher than car headlamps, the present findings imply that retroreflective pavement markings are more visible (and thus more effective) for truck drivers than car drivers. Furthermore, these findings are in support of higher headlamp mounting height for all types of vehicles. However, higher headlamp mounting heights lead to more glare for both oncoming drivers and preceding drivers via rearview mirrors. Consequently, determining an optimal headlamp mounting height would require a complex weighing of both visibility and glare considerations...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{visibility}} of a front turn signal is decreased if a headlamp is located near the turn signal. Consequently, both the U. S. and ECE regulations require the turn signals to be more intense in such situations. However, it is unclear how adjacent light sources affect supratheshold aspects, such as conspicuity. The present field study was designed to examine the effects of several factors on the nighttime conspicuity of front turn signals. Specifically of interest were the effects of the number, luminous intensity, and spatial arrangement (including spacing) of the masking lamps. The following are the main findings: (1) The conspicuity of a turn signal was significantly lower when it was separated from a 1000 -cd <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> by 50 mm rather than 100 mm (center-to-edge). A 200 -cd turn signal at 100 mm was equal in conspicuity to a 288 -cd turn signal at 50 mm. This effect is smaller than the effects obtained in previous studies using threshold-visibility paradigms. (2) Adding a second masking light source, at the same 50 -mm spacing as the first masking light source, significantly influenced the conspicuity of the turn signal. The effect of the second masking source can be compensated for by an increase in the turn signal intensity corresponding to 8. 5 % of the intensity of the second masking source. (3) The conspicuity of the turn signal was unaffected by the spatial arrangement of two masking light sources...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in headlamp beam patterns {{as a function}} of the level of haze in sheets of plastic materials that were inserted in front of either a U. S. or a European <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamp.</b> The level of haze was measured according to the method required by the U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This method (ASTM Standard D 1003 - 92) measures the percentage of transmitted light that deviates from the incident beam through forward scatter by more than 2. 5 °. The actual effects on the beam pattern were then compared with predictions based on modeling the effects by assuming Gaussian distributions of the scattered light. The main finding is that the redictions for the four different plastic materials tested were neither uniformly accurate nor uniformly inaccurate. This lack of consistency is in agreement with the fact that the ASTM definition of haze does not uniquely specify the distribution of the scattered light. This problem with using the ASTM definition was confirmed by measuring the distributions of light scattering by two materials that had essentially the same ASTM index of haze. The implication of this research is that establishing a justifiable maximum haze level for headlamp lens materials would require using a definition of haze that uniquely defines the resultant distribution of the light scatter. Consequently, it is recommended that future research should evaluate the distribution of scattered light using actual materials for headlamp lenses after different lengths of weathering exposure...|$|E

40|$|A {{recent study}} by Huey, Dekker, and Lyons (1994) {{concluded}} that a difference between two signal lamp intensities of less than 25 % cannot be detected reliably by most drivers. Consequently, Huey et al. recommended that an intensity difference of 25 % {{be used as a}} criterion for inconsequential noncompliance with federal regulations for signal lamps. The present study was designed to evaluate just noticeable differences for glare intensities of oncoming <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> The results of this study indicate that, under controlled conditions, just noticeable differences in the low-beam headlighting context are between 11 % and 19 %. In real-world conditions, just noticeable differences would probably be somewhat larger. Therefore, the recommendation by Huey et al. of using 25 % as a criterion for inconsequential noncompliance of signal lamps is also about right for <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> at least with respect to how headlamps themselves are perceived by other drivers (such as discomfort glare).

40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance of <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, lamp voltage, number of functioning lamps, vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of road delineation, visibility of vehicle reflex reflectors, visibility of rettoreflective traffic signs, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance of <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> The second most important factor is the number of functioning lamps. The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use of longer-life headlamps...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that current <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> do not provide adequate seeing distance for safety. One approach for remedying this situation might be to provide more total light from <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> leaving the relative distribution of light unchanged. Increasing the light output of low-beam lamps, in addition to providing more light for seeing, would also cause an increase in glare light for oncoming drivers. This {{raises the question of whether}} there would be a net benefit in seeing distance for all drivers if the light output of low beam lamps was generally increased. We addressed this question in an empirical study in which we varied the intensity of headlamps between a value typical of current U. S. low beams and a level about 3. 8 times higher. We measured seeing distance as a function of headlamp intensity, always varying the intensity of the seeing light and glare light by the same proportion. Increasing intensity by a factor of about 3. 8 increased seeing distance by 17 %. This result is qualitatively consistent with earlier findings that seeing distance in a glare situation is longer when high beams oppose high beams than when low beams oppose low beams. It is also consistent with predictions from quantitative vision modeling using veiling luminance to represent the disabling effects of glare. The present findings suggest that, if objective visual performance is the only criterion, there is no clear upper limit to how intense <b>low-beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> should be. However, there may be a level at which people simply will not tolerate the subjectively discomforting effects of glare, or at which glare indirectly affects objective performance through its effects on subjective comfort. Because subjective discomfort, rather than objective visual performance, may be the limiting consideration for setting maximum glare levels, more research should be done to understand the nature and consequences of discomfort glare, including possible effects of subjective comfort on objective visual behavior...|$|R

Independent variables included color (red, yellow, green, and white), retroreflective power (SIA), and participant age. This experiment demonstrated that the color of a retroreflective marking does affect the distance at which a moving pedestrian can be detected. Specifically, all three chromatic stimuli examined (red, yellow, and green) were detected at significantly greater distances (ranging from 7 to 10 %) than was the achromatic stimulus (white). Additional modeling determined that to be detected at the same distance as a red, yellow, or green stimulus, a white stimulus would need to be 26 to 44 % higher in SIA value. The results are consistent with previous research by Schumann et al. (1996), in which colored retroreflective stimuli were perceived by participants to be brighter than a comparable white stimulus.
