40|$|Materialized {{aggregate}} views {{represent a}} set of redundant entities in a data warehouse that are frequently used to accelerate On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). Due to the complex structure of the data warehouse and the different pro <b>les</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> who submit queries, there is need for tools that will automate and ease the view selection and management processes. In this paper, we present DynaMat, a system that manages dynamic collections of materialized aggregate views in a data warehouse. At query time DynaMat utilizes a dedicated disk space for storing computed aggregates that are further engaged for answering new queries. Queries are executed independently, or can be bundled within a multi query expression. In the latter case we present an execution mechanism that exploits dependencies among the queries and the materialized set to further optimize their execution. During updates, DynaMat reconciles the current materialized view selection and refreshes the most beneficial subset of it within a given maintenance window. We show how to derive an efficient update plan {{with respect to the}} available maintenance window, the different update policies for the views and the dependencies that exist among them...|$|E

40|$|The {{synaptonemal complex}} (SC) is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved structure that mediates synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase I. Previous studies have established that <b>the</b> chromatin <b>of</b> homologous chromosomes is organized in loops that {{are attached to}} <b>the</b> lateral elements (<b>LEs)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SC. <b>The</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genomic sequences associated with <b>LEs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SC represents an important step toward understanding meiotic chromosome organization and function. To isolate these genomic sequences, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in rat spermatocytes using an antibody against SYCP 3, a major structural component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LEs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SC. Our results demonstrated the reproducible and exclusive isolation of repeat deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences, in particular long interspersed elements, short interspersed elements, long terminal direct repeats, satellite, and simple repeats. <b>The</b> association <b>of</b> these repeat sequences to <b>the</b> <b>LEs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SC was confirmed by in situ hybridization of meiotic nuclei shown by both light and electron microscopy. Signals were also detected over the chromatin surrounding SCs and in small loops protruding from the lateral elements into the SC central region. We propose that genomic repeat DNA sequences {{play a key role}} in anchoring the chromosome to <b>the</b> protein scaffold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SC...|$|R

To conduct adaptive coding and modulation, modern cellular networks have precise, real-time CNR estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users.</b> These channel quality estimates {{can therefore be}} utilized to obtain estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probability distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CNRs <b>of</b> each one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users.</b> Such probability distribution estimates {{can be obtained from}} some hundred CNR estimates by using, e.g., order statistic filter banks [15].
