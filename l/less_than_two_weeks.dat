40|$|The {{availability}} of an infectious cDNA clone {{is a prerequisite}} for genetic studies on RNA viruses. However, despite important improvement in molecular biology techniques during the last decades, obtaining such clones often remains tedious, time-consuming and rather unpredictable. In the case of potyviruses, cDNA clones are frequently unstable due to the toxicity of some viral proteins for bacteria. The problem can be overcome by inserting introns into the viral sequence but this requires additional steps in the cloning process and depends on the {{availability of}} suitable restriction sites in the viral sequence or adjunction of such sites by mutagenesis. Homologous recombination in yeast rather than in vitro restriction and ligation can be used to build infectious clones or other viral constructs. This paper describes how, by using recombination in yeast and fusion PCR, infectious intron-containing clones were obtained within a few <b>weeks</b> for <b>two</b> strains of watermelon mosaic virus (WMV, Potyvirus), whereas previous attempts using “classical” cloning techniques had failed repeatedly. Using the same approach, intronless infectious clones of two other potyviruses, zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) and papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), were obtained in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>week...</b>|$|R

Out of 182 cases with CCHF, 81. 3 % were male and 18. 7 % female. Ninety one cases (49. 5 %) had an age more than 35 years and 47 % were between 18 - 35.

40|$|The {{outcome in}} 40 {{patients}} who underwent colectomy for idiopathic megacolon and megarectum over an 18 year period was evaluated. All patients had a radiologically dilated bowel and a bowel frequency of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> per <b>week.</b> Twenty <b>two</b> patients had a caecorectal anastomosis, 11 had an ileorectal anastomosis (including {{one with a}} previous caecorectal anastomosis and four with a previous sigmoid resection), and seven had a sigmoid resection. The mean (range) age at operation was 35 (17 - 69) years. All three operations resulted in a normal bowel frequency in more than 80 % of patients but no patient with an ileorectal anastomosis experienced recurrent constipation. Thirty four patients experienced pain preoperatively and this was still present in 14 patients postoperatively. One patient died and four required subsequent laparotomy for bowel obstruction. The functional outcome in patients with dilatation of the whole colon and in those with dilatation of the left colon did not differ.
