40|$|Introducing {{solar energy}} into the gas turbine of Combined Cycle systems (CC) offers {{significant}} advantages over other solar power plant concepts. A promising way to introduce solar power is solar preheating of the compressor discharge air before it enters the combustor of the gas turbine using a receiver built consisting of several metallic tubes. The main challenge during the design of such a receiver is the low solar flux capability caused by the limited convective heat transfer. To ensure a sufficient efficiency, the receiver is usually located in a cavity. The heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> conduction through the (insulated) cavity walls can be reduced by increased insulation thickness. Heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> and convection to ambient depend strongly on the aperture area, receiver inclination and the receiver temperature. The receiver temperatures can be reduced by increasing the cavity si ze, as the flux distribution gets more homogenous and the overall flux density is reduced. Following heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> and convection to ambient are reduced. On the other hand additional costs for the cavity walls have to be considered. The paper deals with the comparison of two different strategies to increase the receiver efficiency of a cavity receiver used to heat the compressed air of a 4. 7 MWel turbine from 330 °C up to 800 °C, with a mass flow of 15. 9 kg/s at 10 barabs. The influence on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of different receiver sizes and one design option (transparent covering of aperture) for reducing the convections losses were analyzed and compared. The thermal and hydraulic layout was done for a thermal heat of 8. 4 MWth and 250 mbar pressure drop using thermal finite element (FE) models considering the local heat flux distribution, heat transfer to working fluid, radiation exchange between components and ambient as well as conduction and convection losses of the cavity. As the convective losses play a significant role, CFD models were {{used to evaluate the}} convective heat losses...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{attractive}} {{features of a}} liquid lithium PFC is that it virtually eliminates recycling, or the re-introduction of cold gas back into the plasma from the vacuum chamber walls. This is because lithium has a high chemical reactivity with atomic hydrogen, which is then retained in the PFC. Flowing liquid lithium can also potentially handle the high power densities expected on fusion reactor walls. In addition, lithium has a low atomic number, Z.

5000|$|In {{the early}} stages of the fire, most of the flames were lying down in the {{escalator}} trench: only a few visibly protruded above the balustrade. The sides of the trench further enhanced the effect by preventing heat <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> to the side, insulating and concentrating the heat along the narrow trench. Emergency services were not prepared for a major fire, due to the lack of visible flames. When the treads of the escalator flashed over, the fire grew dramatically and ignited most of the ticket hall. The HSE's Health and Safety Laboratory in Buxton lit fires in 1/10-scale and 1/3 scale models of the escalator and ticket hall, which demonstrated that the Trench Effect was the main cause of the intensity and rapid spread of the King's Cross fire. The sudden flashover may be attributed to the wood gas (mainly methane) emitted from the pyrolysis of the wooden escalator itself. When the concentration of gas reaches a critical value, the lower flammable limit, the gas suddenly catches fire in the presence of a flame.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome {{results of}} {{measurements}} of laminar burning velocities and of maximum flame temperatures for combustible dust-air mixtures (starch dust-air mixtures, lycopodium-air mixtures and sulphur flour-air mixtures) are presented. Thin (25 and 50 mu m) thermocouples {{have been used to}} measure maximum flame temperatures. The results are compared with those obtained with other devices such as resistors, pyrometers and are compared to the theoretical values. It appears that the observed discrepancies seem principally to come from the relatively poor efficiency of the burning processes inside the flame front than to heat <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> as suggested before. Two methods for determining laminar burning velocities have been used: the classical 'tube method' and a 'direct method' based on the simultaneous determination of the flame speed and of the mixture velocity ahead of the flame front using a tomographic technique. Two different tube diameters are considered as well as additional results obtained with a small burner. The validity of these techniques is firstly assessed by comparing the results obtained with CH 4 -air mixtures and secondly by considering their relevancy for combustible dust-air mixtures (influence {{of the size of the}} apparatus). In particular, the influences of heat flame <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> and of flame stretching are considered...|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal has}} been to {{investigate}} the influence of both dilution and radiation on the extinction process of nonpremixed flames at low strain rates. Simulations have been performed by using a counterflow code and three radiation models {{have been included in}} it, namely, the optically thin, the narrowband, and discrete ordinate models. The counterflow flame code OPPDIFF was modified to account for heat transfer <b>losses</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> from the hot gases. The discrete ordinate method (DOM) approximation was first suggested by Chandrasekhar for solving problems in interstellar atmospheres. Carlson and Lathrop developed the method for solving multi-dimensional problem in neutron transport. Only recently has the method received attention in the field of heat transfer. Due to the applicability of the discrete ordinate method for thermal radiation problems involving flames, the narrowband code RADCAL was modified to calculate the radiative properties of the gases. A non-premixed counterflow flame was simulated with the discrete ordinate method for radiative emissions. In comparison with two other models, {{it was found that the}} heat losses were comparable with the optically thin and simple narrowband model.
