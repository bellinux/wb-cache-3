40|$|Background: Laparoscopic and rebotic {{surgery is}} widely practiced in modern medicine. The {{operative}} procedure is not complete until the port sites are {{closed with a}} fascial closure. Good fascial closure still represents problem, especially in difficult obese patients. This study reported simple technique is suitable in such cases. Material and methods: We herein describe a simple technique for fascial closure after Laparoscopic surgery using percutaneous transabdominal approach by using two <b>looped</b> <b>needles</b> in 87 obese patients. This technique was done while the trocar sheath in its position. Results: The procedure was used in 87 patients (69 females and 18 males) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with mean body mass index 35. 5  kg/m 2 and mean age 47. 1 years from May 2013 through June 2015. No intra-operative incidents and no port sites hernias were reported during a mean follow up of 18 months.

50|$|Knitting, Looping, and {{crocheting}} involve interlacing {{loops of}} yarn, which are formed either on a knitting needle, needle, or on a crochet hook, {{together in a}} line. The processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while Looping and crocheting never {{have more than one}} active <b>loop</b> on the <b>needle.</b> Knitting can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.|$|R
50|$|A needle {{threader}} is {{a device}} {{for helping to}} put thread through {{the eye of a}} needle. Many kinds exist, though a common type combines a short length of fine wire bent into a diamond shape, with one corner held by a piece of tinplate or plastic. The user passes the wire <b>loop</b> through the <b>needle</b> eye, passes the string through the wire loop, and finally pulls both the loop back through the needle by the handle, which pulls the thread through. The typical needle threader of this type has the image of a woman in profile stamped into the plate handle.|$|R
5000|$|The Basic Chain stitch is made {{by first}} sending the needle down through the material. Then, as the needle rises upward, the {{friction}} of the thread against the fabric is sufficient to form a small loop {{on the underside of}} the material. That loop is caught by a circular needle which is beneath the work. The machine then moves the material forward projecting the loop on the underside from the previous stitch. The next drop of the needle goes through the previous <b>loop.</b> The circular <b>needle</b> then releases the first loop and picks up the new loop and the process repeats.|$|R

5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread <b>loops</b> for the <b>needle</b> to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} of arthroscopic {{rotator cuff repair}} using a spinal <b>needle</b> and suture <b>loop.</b> Methods With the arthroscope laterally, a spinal <b>needle</b> <b>looped</b> with PDS is inserted percutaneously into the shoulder posteriorly and penetrated through the healthy posterior cuff tear margin. Anteriorly, another spinal needle loaded with PDS is inserted percutaneously to engage the healthy tissue at the anterior tear margin. The suture in the anterior needle is then delivered into the suture loop of the posterior needle using a suture retriever. The posterior <b>needle</b> and <b>loop</b> are then pulled out carrying the anterior suture with it. The two limbs of this suture are then retrieved through a cannula for knotting. The same procedure is then repeated for additional suturing. Suture anchors placed over the greater tuberosity are used to complete the repair. Conclusion This is an easy method of rotator cuff repair using simple instruments and lesser time, hence can be employed at centers with less equipment and at reduced cost to the patient. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Provisional cast-on : Also {{known as}} an [...] "invisible cast-on," [...] since the waste yarn used can be pulled out later to allow the knitter to {{continue}} the knitting in the opposite direction. This cast-on is also the best method for double-knit fabrics, since the knitting has no boundary; the knitting is continuous {{from one side of}} the fabric to the other. Holding the ends of a waste yarn and the working yarn, make an overhand knot. Place a needle held in the left hand between the two yarns, with the knot below, the waste yarn held underneath and parallel to the needle out to the right, and the working yarn up and in front of the needle. Bring the working yarn down behind the needle and in front of the waste yarn; up behind the waste yarn and over-and-up then down in front of the needle; down behind the waste yarn; then up in front of the needle. Repeat for each two stitches. When desired number of stitches is reached, loosely fasten the waste yarn and work as usual with the working yarn. To take out the provisional cast-on, unfasten the end of the waste yarn and carefully pull it out, picking up the now loose <b>loops</b> on a <b>needle</b> and working from the opposite direction of previous work.|$|R
30|$|The surface {{equipment}} for monitoring surface parameters {{consists of a}} Coriolis flow meter, pressure transducer, P 2, a flow in the choke manifold, and a conductivity sensor. A pressure transducer (P 2) located downstream of the pressure cell and upstream of the Coriolis flow meter, as shown in Fig.  1 b, is {{used to measure the}} pressure in the return mud entering the surface monitoring equipment. The Coriolis flow meter is equipped with Elite flow sensor to provide good measurement sensitivity and stability when measuring multi-phase flow and it has tolerance for drill cuttings. The Coriolis flow meter is installed such that the tube is in the up orientation or flag up position to allow an effective drainage of cuttings and mud from the sensor. The choke manifold consists of three valves: a pressure relief valve installed on the pressure relief <b>loop</b> (line), a <b>needle</b> (or backpressure) valve to adjust backpressure in the downhole pressure in the pressure cell and a manual pressure control valve. In the event of a surge in the pressure cell, a pressure relief valve (PRV), installed upstream of the Coriolis flow meter, diverts flow to the pressure relief (bypass) line. The pressure control and needle valves are mainly used to control the downhole pressure. The conductivity sensor measures the electrolytic conductivity changes in the drilling mud return; however, was not monitored t due the sensor’s incompatibility with drill cuttings.|$|R
