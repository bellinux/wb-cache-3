5000|$|The Sola Hevi SCP {{series is}} a typical {{switching}} supply with approximately similar output specifications to the Lambda above. The family has a load regulation of ≤ 0.5% at [...] "10…90…10%" [...] nominal Iout. Defining the <b>load</b> <b>change</b> in terms of current is strictly the same as defining <b>load</b> <b>change</b> in resistance change. The [...] "10…90…10%" [...] specification states that the minimum load is 10% of maximum current and the full load is 90% and the specification test includes taking the load back to 10%. If we take the SCP 30D312, which has a 5 V, 3 A output equivalent to the Lambda example above, 10% of maximum load is 10% × 3 A = 300 mA minimum load, and 90% × 3 A = 2.7 A for full load. At 5 V output, full load is 5 V / 2.7 A = 1.85 Ω and minimum load is 5V / 300 mA = 16.7 Ω. The voltage will change {{by no more than}} 25 mV when changing the load from 16.7 Ω to 1.85 Ω (or 88% <b>load</b> <b>change).</b>|$|E
50|$|Eddy current (EC) dynamometers are {{currently}} {{the most common}} absorbers used in modern chassis dynos. The EC absorbers provide a quick <b>load</b> <b>change</b> rate for rapid load settling. Most are air cooled, but some are designed to require external water cooling systems.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the load}} {{regulation}} specifies 50% <b>load</b> <b>change</b> {{and since the}} nominal and full load must be within the operating range of the supply (maximum 3 A), the heaviest full-load condition at which we can test load regulation is [...] and the heaviest nominal load is [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between amplitude of <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> and Pst is linear, i.e. halving the switched load results {{in half the}} Pst. The {{relationship between}} number of <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> per time (n/ Tp) and Pst is non-linear. A halving of <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> reduces Pst by only about 20%. In order to have half the Pst, the number of <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> must be reduced {{by a factor of}} 9.|$|R

50|$|Flicker is {{generated}} by load changes. Only the amplitude of the <b>load</b> <b>change</b> is relevant, not the absolute value. A reduction in flicker can be attained through making less frequent load changes, or smaller load changes. If the load is changed gradually (for example, by the help of power electronics) instead of step fashion, this also makes flicker less perceptible.|$|E
50|$|The old Lambda H Series {{power supply}} {{is a typical}} linear design and has a load {{regulation}} specification of ±0.05% for a 50% <b>load</b> <b>change.</b> Consider an H Series model HSB5-3-OVP supply, which has a single 5 V, 3 A output, with a load of 3.7 Ω. If the load changed to 1.85 Ω, this power supply would have a maximum voltage change of 0.05% × 5 V = 2.5 mV.|$|E

The PAU braking load applied to the prime mover can be manually controlled or determined by a computer. Most systems employ eddy current, oil hydraulic, or DC motor produced loads because of their linear and quick <b>load</b> <b>change</b> abilities.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{power flow}} (OPF) problem {{has already been}} {{attempted}} as a static, optimization problem by adopting gradient based methods and more recently, no conventional ones, such as evolutionary algorithms. However, as the loads, generation capacities and network connections in a power system are always in a changing status, these static methods are of limited use. This paper presents a new algorithm dynamic bacterial forging optimization, for solving the optimal power flow problem in wireless networks in which the systems <b>load</b> <b>changes.</b> The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm can more rapidly adapt to <b>load</b> <b>changes,</b> and more closely adapt to <b>load</b> <b>changes,</b> and more closely trace the global optimum of the system fuel cost...|$|R
50|$|The {{filling process}} {{takes place at}} the {{overpressure}} phase, using a mechanical gas compressor and a throttle for the purpose of regulation.The <b>load</b> <b>change</b> is assisted by a four stroke piston, working as a dynamic boosting system and allowing the good scavenging of working space. There is a possibility of changing the relative piston positions during the engine work, that gives the possibility of changing the compression ratio depending on the temporary level of the load. This suggests the possibility of different fuels combustion (low octane petrol, bio-fuels with high levels of vegetable components).|$|E
50|$|Other useful {{properties}} of vanadium flow batteries are their very fast response to changing loads and their extremely large overload capacities. Studies by the University of New South Wales {{have shown that}} they can achieve a response time of under half a millisecond for a 100% <b>load</b> <b>change,</b> and allowed overloads {{of as much as}} 400% for 10 seconds. The response time is mostly limited by the electrical equipment. Sulfuric acid-based vanadium batteries only work between about 10 to 40 °C. Below that temperature range, the ion-infused sulfuric acid crystallizes. Round trip efficiency in practical applications is around 65-75 %.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} brake system {{consists of a}} hydraulic pump (usually a gear-type pump), a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the pumps outlet is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest <b>load</b> <b>change</b> ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Elevator {{is widely}} used in our daily lives to carry {{passengers}} or transport belongings in the rising buildings. However, the motion performance of the elevator is strongly affected by <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> and nonlinear air damping. In this paper, to address these issues, {{the design of a}} digital acceleration control method is described. First, a dynamic model of an elevator is derived with consideration of <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> and nonlinear air damping. Then, a digital controller is designed based on the derived dynamics, and the parameter of the elevator is identified by using the control torque and the output acceleration signal. The digital acceleration controller is a special controller to deal with the <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> and nonlinear air damping for its control force contains the gravity force of the load and the nonlinear air damping. Finally, simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed control method...|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that the 24-hour {{circadian}} clock also influences cognitive performance {{in a wide variety of}} paradigms, including serial search, verbal reasoning, working memory tasks, suppressing wrong answers, and manual dexterity. Performance on these tasks varies over the course of a day, with each type of task having a unique daily rhythm. For example, the best time to perform a working memory task tends to be midday, while immediate memory is best in the morning, and simple processing is ideally performed in the evening. In addition, individual differences among participants can have an effect on daily rhythms in performance. Studies have found that children perform mental math exercises most successfully in the morning, but young adults' performance peaks in the evening. This variation in the performance of various tasks is attributable to a number of factors, including relative working memory <b>load,</b> <b>change</b> in strategy, hemispheric dominance, ability to suppress wrong answers, age, level of practice, and morningness-eveningness, many of which fluctuate according to time of day. Based on these findings, researchers conclude that factors that disturb circadian rhythms can also affect cognitive performance.|$|E
50|$|The M4+2 engines {{have much}} in common with the Beare-head engines, {{combining}} two opposed pistons in the same cylinder. One piston works at half the cyclical rate of the other, but while the main function of the second piston in a Beare-head engine is to replace the valve mechanism of a conventional four-stroke engine, the M4+2 takes the principle one step further. The double-piston combustion engine's work is based on the cooperation of both modules. The air <b>load</b> <b>change</b> takes place in the two-stroke section of the engine. The piston of the four-stroke section is an air load exchange aiding system, working as a system of valves. The cylinder is filled with air or with an air-fuel mixture. The filling process takes place at overpressure by the slide inlet system. The exhaust gases are removed as in the classical two-stroke engine, by exhaust windows in the cylinder. The fuel is supplied into the cylinder by a fuel-injection system. Ignition is realized by two spark plugs. The effective power output of the double-piston engine is transferred by two crankshafts. The characteristic feature of this engine is an opportunity of continuous change of cylinder capacity and compression rate during engine work by changing the piston's location. The mechanical and thermodynamical models were meant for double-piston engines, which enable to draw up new theoretical thermodynamic cycle for internal combustion double-pistons engine.|$|E
50|$|The M4+2 engine {{took its}} name from a {{combination}} of the two working modes of the known engines, that is from the Two-stroke engine and Four-stroke engine. The two-stroke combustion engine is characterized by a simple construction and system of air <b>load</b> <b>change</b> as well as bigger index of power output. Unfortunately, its filling ratio is worse than in four-stroke engine. The ecological index of two-stroke engine is also unfavorable. The system of valves of the four-stroke engine is its disadvantage. The cylinders of both modules of double pistons engine have been joined along one axis with common cylinder head - in the form of the ring. The pistons are moved with different speed and with appropriate stage displacement. There are two crankshafts, which are connected with special transmission in shown solution. The four-stroke crankshaft is rotated with twice a speed of two-stroke crankshaft. The engine is named double pistons because of its construction - double pistons and crankshafts. In the M4+2 the advantages of both engines being connected are obvious; the pistons of the engine working in one combustion cylinder are set oppositely to each other, but in different modes. Although the projects of connecting two stroke modes in one cylinder were tried already a long time ago in the Opposed piston engine, the combination of the two different cycles had never been tried before. It turned out that the engine is not only able to work, but that the effects are very promising. The engine has a far greater efficiency over the break-even value known to combustion engines (ca 35%) and closer to the one associated with steam turbines or electric engines (ca 70%).|$|E

50|$|In a {{synchronous}} grid all the generators must {{run at the}} same frequency, and must stay very nearly in phase {{with each other and}} the grid. For rotating generators, a local governor regulates the driving torque, maintaining constant speed as <b>loading</b> <b>changes.</b> Droop speed control ensures that multiple parallel generators share <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> in proportion to their rating. Generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid, because energy is consumed as it is produced. Energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of the present paper is designing 8051 microcontroller based temperature control system to study the reaction of controlled variable with respect to <b>load</b> <b>changes.</b> The process temperature under control is measured using RTD. Then using a microcontroller and suitable software, this instantaneous value of temperature is compared with the desired temperature. The resulting error {{has been used by}} the microcontroller to control the firing angle of a TRIAC for controlling the power applied to the heater. The trigger pulse for the TRIAC is delayed by the microcontroller to provide the required voltage to be fed to the heater to get the desired temperature. Thus a continuous closed loop temperature monitoring and control has been achieved. The proportional control scheme has been described in the present paper. The behavior of the process temperature has been studied with respect to <b>load</b> <b>changes.</b> Experimental results have been presented to study the reaction of controlled variable or process temperature with respect to <b>load</b> <b>changes.</b> Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|R
40|$|This paper mainly {{presents}} the AC impedance {{characteristics of a}} 2 kW PEMFC stack under different operating conditions and <b>load</b> <b>changes.</b> The AC impedances of the fuel cell stack are examined by a fuel cell impedance meter. Air stoichiometry, air humidity, and operation temperature are shown to have significant effects on the AC impedance of stack. When air stoichiometry decreases, the mass transfer resistance of stack increases obviously, but the influences on other resistances are very slight. The air humidity and operation temperature mainly influence the charge transfer resistance of stack. The influences of <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> on the AC impedance of stack are also investigated, {{and the results of}} which show that it is quite necessary to adjust the humidity of reactant gas according to the fuel cell <b>load</b> <b>changes</b> during fuel cell running.
