5|$|There {{had been}} {{criticism}} of MIS companies generally, and Great Southern Group (as the largest {{company in the}} sector) in particular, suggesting that their appetite for land for plantations and agribusiness was driving up <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in some regions, and distorting some commodity markets. In 2004, Great Southern's leading competitor Timbercorp reported a rise in plantation <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> from around A$3,000 to around A$6,000 per hectare in just five years. The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land, with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations. Some farmers claimed that MIS were driving up prices in agricultural water markets. Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing shrinkage of towns or was, conversely, stimulating employment.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower <b>land</b> <b>prices,</b> a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E

This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>price</b> {{contains}} the comprehensive characteristics of urban space, representing {{the social and}} economic features of the city. Accordingly, <b>land</b> <b>price</b> can be utilized as an indicator, which can identify the changes of spatial structure and socioeconomic variations caused by urban development. This study attempted to explore the changes in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> by a new road construction. Methodologically, it adopted Space Syntax, which can interpret urban spatial structure comprehensively, to identify the relationship between the forms of road networks and <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> The result of the regression analysis showed the ‘integration index’ of Space Syntax is statistically significant and has a strong correlation with <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> If the integration value is high, <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increases proportionally. Subsequently, using regression equation, it tried to predict the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> changes of each of the lots surrounding the roads that are newly opened. The research methods or study results have the advantage of predicting the changes in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in an easy way. In addition, it will contribute to planners and project managers to establish relevant polices and smoothing urban regeneration projects through enhancing residents’ understanding by providing possible results and advantages in their <b>land</b> <b>price</b> before the execution of urban regeneration and development projects...|$|R

One of the original drafts, which called for building the line along Leipziger Straße, had to be scrapped because of overly high <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> The moat of the 17th century Berlin Fortress was filled up between Hackescher Markt and Jannowitzbrücke stations and, since it was public land, was used for building the railway line.

5|$|Jennings's {{personal}} finances {{suffered from}} the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings {{was never able to}} recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 personal loan from the Harmonists {{in a letter to his}} political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting mortgages on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves {{as well as}} horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the {{brothers}} worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped {{to take advantage of}} its rising <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{the concepts of}} land rent {{from the standpoint of}} modern economics and accounts for the contributing factors {{in the formation of the}} agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> during the pre-war and the post-war periods. It can be said the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in the later Taisho period was conditioned by farm rent and as far as the pure farming region is concerned, the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in the post-war period is also explained considerably by net returns per 10 ares of land, which is capitalized by an 8 percent interest rate. Furthermore, the increase in agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price,</b> based on the premises of constant return to scale and the supported price of farm products, has demonstrated that the rise in the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is sufficiently explained by technological progress in rice production. Though various factors are considered important in the contribution to the formation of the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in this paper the main emphasis is based upon the fact that the interior factors of agriculture considerably elucidate its formation throughout the pre-war and the post-war period. This is especially applicable to the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in pure farming regions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>price</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in guiding land resource allocation for urban planning and development, particularly in big cities of fast developing countries where infrastructures and populations change frequently. Therefore, detecting spatially implicit information in the spatial pattern of relationships between <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and related impact factors is critical. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis was conducted in this study for the purpose in Wuhan, China, by using a 10 -year panel data set of residential <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> Based on twelve factors in three aspects (land attributes, location factors and neighborhood attributes), an evaluation index system of resident <b>land</b> <b>price</b> was established. The spatial distributions of estimated coefficients and pseudo t-values of three major explanatory variables (floor area ratio, distance to nearest center business district (CBD) and distance to nearest lake), obtained from GWR analysis, indicated that their relationships of the impact factors with <b>land</b> <b>price</b> are spatially non-stationary. The positive impact of floor area ratio on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is more significant in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Conversely, the negative impact of distance to nearest CBD on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is larger in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Moreover, wealthier dwellers may be willing to pay a higher price for a good lake view (especially views of small lakes), but infrastructure barriers (near some large lakes) cause negative effect [...] The outputs of this study, which provide detailed information on the relationships between <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and impact factors in local areas, are promising for urban planners to scientifically evaluate <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and make area-specific strategies.

Most importantly, however, the $750 million platform supporting much of Hudson Yards was built starting in January 2013; subway construction for a station that could potentially carry up to 27,000 daily passengers necessitated the construction of more buildings, as 70% of tenants are expected to come to Hudson Yards via the 7 subway extension. Additionally, new restaurants, luxury condominiums, and stores have appeared near the station and along the extension's route, and residential prices along the extension have also increased.
