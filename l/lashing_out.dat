5|$|Qualification for Euro 1988 meant {{winning a}} group {{containing}} Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Scotland. The campaign opened with Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, and though Ireland contained danger man Nico Claesen, {{they had to}} settle for a 2–2 draw after conceding twice from corner-kicks; Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady scored the goals for Ireland. They then dominated Scotland at Lansdowne Road, but failed to find the net and instead drew 0–0. In the return fixture at Hampden Park Mark Lawrenson scored an early goal and another clean sheet won the Irish their first win of qualification. The campaign faltered with a 2–1 loss in Bulgaria, though Charlton was furious with referee Carlos Silva Valente as he felt that both of Lachezar Tanev's goals should not have counted as Nasko Sirakov allegedly pushed Mick McCarthy in the build-up to the first and he felt that Sirakov was outside the penalty box when he was fouled by Kevin Moran – Valente instead gave a penalty. They picked up another point after a 0–0 draw with Belgium in Dublin. Despite not particularly impressing Ireland then picked up six points with two victories over Luxembourg. They ended the campaign with a 2–0 home win over Bulgaria, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran the scorers, though Liam Brady (an ever-present in qualification) picked up a two match suspension after <b>lashing</b> <b>out</b> late in the game after being kicked by a Bulgarian. Despite the victory the Irish had to rely on a favour from the Scots in order to qualify, who duly obliged with a 1–0 victory in Sofia to keep Bulgaria one point behind Ireland in the table.|$|E

He also repeatedly advocated for mandatory funding of police by provincial and local governments from their own budgets. His advocacy was successful, and in October won executive approval for a one-off 10% pay rise for police. In the same month, he announced that women would form half of the next intake of police recruits in an attempt to improve gender parity in the police force. In November 2004, he initiated a bill to regulate the security industry in Papua New Guinea, which was passed unanimously by parliament, successfully separated the pay structure for police from the other uniformed forces, permitting the police union to negotiate their own pay, and won executive support {{for the establishment of a}} gun control committee headed by former PNGDF commander Jerry Singirok.|$|E
25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that {{it was as if}} the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water in an attempt to save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, <b>lashing</b> <b>out</b> at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to be loved and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E
