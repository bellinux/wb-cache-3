The video for the song served as the closing clip for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, and was filmed on Super 8 mm film in Miami. Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video.

She concluded: [...] "It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now." [...] During an interview with Teen Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she loved the perfume because it featured notes of orchid, her favorite flower.

In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / <b>Like</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything.

2500|$|Benaderet also gained notoriety for the {{complexity}} of her surname, which has been misspelled as Benadaret or Benederet. She first resisted requests to change it when she began performing at twelve years old: [...] "They told me no one could remember it, no one could pronounce it, no one could spell it." [...] When she was introduced to Orson Welles in 1936, he remarked that her name [...] "sounded <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> ad lib in a mob scene," [...] and it was misspelled in a 1946 press release created specifically about its proper spelling. Radio Life wrote in 1947: [...] "If someone were to conduct a survey to decide the radio personality with the most frequently misspelled name, Bea Benaderet would probably win hands down." [...] Early in the first season of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, her full name appeared as Bee Benadaret in the closing credits.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel.

6000|$|MARY sat musing on the lamp-flame at {{the table}} [...] Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step, [...] She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage [...] To meet him in the doorway with the news [...] And put him on his guard. [...] "Silas is back." [...] She pushed him outward with her through the door [...] And shut it after her. [...] "Be kind," [...] she said. [...] She took the market things from Warren's arms [...] And set them on the porch, then drew him down [...] To sit {{beside her on the}} wooden steps. [...] "When was I ever {{anything}} but kind to him? [...] But I'll not have the fellow back," [...] he said. [...] "I told him so last haying, didn't I? [...] 'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.' [...] What good is he? Who else will harbour him [...] At his age for the little he can do? [...] What help he is there's no depending on. [...] Off he goes always when I need him most. [...] 'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, [...] Enough at least to buy tobacco with, [...] So he won't have to beg and be beholden.' [...] 'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay [...] Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.' [...] 'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.' [...] I shouldn't mind his bettering himself [...] If that was what it was. You can be certain, [...] When he begins like that, there's someone at him [...] Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,-- [...] In haying time, when any help is scarce. [...] In winter he comes back to us. I'm done." [...] "Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," [...] Mary said. [...] "I want him to: he'll have to soon or late." [...] "He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove. [...] When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, [...] Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, [...] A miserable sight, and frightening, too-- [...] You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him-- [...] I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed. [...] Wait till you see." [...] "Where did you say he'd been?" [...] "He didn't say. I dragged him to the house, [...] And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. [...] I tried to make him talk about his travels. [...] Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off." [...] "What did he say? Did he say anything?" [...] "But little." [...] "Anything? Mary, confess [...] He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me." [...] "Warren!" [...] "But did he? I just want to know." [...] "Of course he did. What would you have him say? [...] Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man [...] Some humble way to save his self-respect. [...] He added, if you really care to know, [...] He meant to clear the upper pasture, too. [...] That sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> have heard before? [...] Warren, I wish you could have heard the way [...] He jumbled everything. I stopped to look [...] Two or three times--he made me feel so queer-- [...] To see if he was talking in his sleep. [...] He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember-- [...] The boy you had in haying four years since. [...] He's finished school, and teaching in his college. [...] Silas declares you'll have to get him back. [...] He says they two will make a team for work: [...] Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! [...] The way he mixed that in with other things. [...] He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft [...] On education--you know how they fought [...] All through July under the blazing sun, [...] Silas up on the cart to build the load, [...] Harold along beside to pitch it on." [...] "Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot." [...] "Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. [...] You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger! [...] Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him. [...] After so many years he still keeps finding [...] Good arguments he sees he might have used. [...] I sympathise. I know just how it feels [...] To think of the right thing to say too late. [...] Harold's associated in his mind with Latin. [...] He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying [...] He studied Latin like the violin [...] Because he liked it--that an argument! [...] He said he couldn't make the boy believe [...] He could find water with a hazel prong-- [...] Which showed how much good school had ever done him. [...] He wanted to go over that. But most of all [...] He thinks if he could have another chance [...] To teach him how to build a load of hay----" [...] "I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment. [...] He bundles every forkful in its place, [...] And tags and numbers it for future reference, [...] So he can find and easily dislodge it [...] In the unloading. Silas does that well. [...] He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests. [...] You never see him standing on the hay [...] He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself." [...] "He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be [...] Some good perhaps to someone in the world. [...] He hates to see a boy the fool of books. [...] Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, [...] And nothing to look backward to with pride, [...] And nothing to look forward to with hope, [...] So now and never any different." [...] Part of a moon was falling down the west, [...] Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. [...] Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw [...] And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand [...] Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, [...] Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, [...] As if she played unheard the tenderness [...] That wrought on him beside her in the night. [...] "Warren," [...] she said, [...] "he has come home to die: [...] You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time." [...] "Home," [...] he mocked gently. [...] "Yes, what else but home? [...] It all depends on what you mean by home. [...] Of course he's nothing to us, any more [...] Than was the hound that came a stranger to us [...] Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail." [...] "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, [...] They have to take you in." [...] "I should have called it [...] Something you somehow haven't to deserve." [...] Warren leaned out and took a step or two, [...] Picked up a little stick, and brought it back [...] And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. [...] "Silas has better claim on us you think [...] Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles [...] As the road winds would bring him to his door. [...] Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. [...] Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, [...] A somebody--director in the bank." [...] "He never told us that." [...] "We know it though." [...] "I think his brother ought to help, of course. [...] I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right [...] To take him in, and might be willing to-- [...] He may be better than appearances. [...] But have some pity on Silas. Do you think [...] If he'd had any pride in claiming kin [...] Or anything he looked for from his brother, [...] He'd keep so still about him all this time?" [...] "I wonder what's between them." [...] "I can tell you. [...] Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him-- [...] But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. [...] He never did a thing so very bad. [...] He don't know why he isn't quite as good [...] As anyone. He won't be made ashamed [...] To please his brother, worthless though he is." [...] "I can't think Si ever hurt anyone." [...] "No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay [...] And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. [...] He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. [...] You must go in and see what you can do. [...] I made the bed up for him there to-night. [...] You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken. [...] His working days are done; I'm sure of it." [...] "I'd not be in a hurry to say that." [...] "I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. [...] But, Warren, please remember how it is: [...] He's come to help you ditch the meadow. [...] He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him. [...] He may not speak of it, and then he may. [...] I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud [...] Will hit or miss the moon." [...] It hit the moon. [...] Then there were three there, making a dim row, [...] The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.
