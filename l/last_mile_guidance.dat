Only through demonstrated interoperability can component vendors, network equipment manufacturers, and service providers bring optical <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> technologies and services to the subscriber in the most effective, efficient, and successful manner. The University of New Hampshire’s InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL), with 15 years of experience in interoperability, compliance testing, and usage have helped to contribute to the methodologies and metrics by which these technologies should be judged. The knowledge gained from testing these technologies is applied to the development of interoperability testing strategies for <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> optical technologies including point-to-point optical subscriber access networks and passive optical networks (PON). A particular emphasis is placed on how interoperability applies to Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM). Interoperability is necessary at all layers, including component-to-component, system-to-system, and vendor-to-vendor. Strategies and suggestions for successful testing and implementation of these tests are presented.

5000|$|The <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> or <b>last</b> {{kilometer}} is a colloquial phrase {{widely used}} in the telecommunications, cable television and internet industries {{to refer to the}} final leg of the telecommunications networks that deliver telecommunication services to retail end-users (customers). More specifically, the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> refers to the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user's premises. Examples are the copper wire subscriber lines connecting landline telephones to the local telephone exchange; coaxial cable service drops carrying cable television signals from utility poles to subscribers' homes, and cell towers linking local cell phones to the cellular network. The word [...] "mile" [...] is used metaphorically; the length of the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> link may be more or less than a <b>mile.</b> Because the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> of a network to the user is conversely the first mile from the user's premises to the outside world when the user is sending data (sending an email, for example), the term first mile is also alternately used.|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) The <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> {{distribution}} {{is the final}} link of successful supply chain operations. The high demand for products, lead time uncertainties and replenishment time complicate the distribution task. In order to achieve a competitive business edge, suppliers need to work at developing and improving their <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> distribution link. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> wine distribution in Lagos Island, Nigeria, and to determine appropriate improvement strategies that can be recommended to wine suppliers. A qualitative research design was used in order to address the key research questions. Wine suppliers in Lagos Island, Nigeria were sampled for the study and mainly surveyed using open-structured interviews. The results of the research suggest that human resources factors influence the effectiveness of the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> distribution. In addition, management-related factors also affect it. It was also noted that the effectiveness of <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> distribution for the wine suppliers is hampered by supply chain and logistics limitations. However, the findings indicate that the suppliers were able to contend with these challenges by applying some logistics strategies and personal initiatives to keep making profit. The study is expected to not only add value to current wine suppliers in Lagos Island, Nigeria, but also to potential investors interested in the Nigerian wine market.

Therefore, this paper aims to identify, through a systematic literature review, the main types of vehicles addressed in the literature {{that could be used}} in the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> of urban freight distribution in order to increase the sustainability of this type of operation. The results indicate a trend for the implementation of smaller and lighter vehicles for <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> deliveries in urban areas: 47 % of the studies suggest, among other alternatives, the use of bicycles and tricycles; while 53 % of the articles support the use of light commercial vehicles.

40|$|Compared to {{the highly}} {{developed}} logistics industry in USA, the Chinese logistics industry is still underdeveloped {{because of poor}} infrastructure and ineffective management capability. In terms of these realities, the most important bottleneck of the Chinese logistics industry is the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> delivery problem, which holds the highest cost in the whole logistics process. To find ways {{to solve the problems}} with <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> delivery has become significant and urgent for Chinese logistics service providers. The purpose of the study is to deepen and enrich the knowledge on <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> logistics in China. This is carried out {{with the help of the}} case companies SF Express and Property Management Company together with an investigation of <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> delivery alternatives in China. Related to the research question, a case study was carried out focusing on one business process. The data collection methods used include: interview, telephone or email contact, and survey. Intelligent locker and the pick-up delivery solution could solve <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> logistics problems by different ways, especially with specific limitations in Chinese market. These delivery alternatives are highly possible to be adopted and generalized by different logistics service providers in China if not concerned about the cost or density of orders. The current business mode of supermarket in China cannot fulfill the demand from an overwhelming number of customers. Costs for both pick-up stations are acceptable, and the cost is a positive factor for pick-up station mode. The higher density of orders, the higher possibility of different time-window may require, and high competitive advantage of intelligent locker can be achieved. The high density of orders for intelligent locker is a positive factor. The cost for intelligent locker is a very negative factor, which seriously limits the popularization of this delivery alternative.

40|$|The <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> in {{a public}} {{transport}} trip appears {{to be one of}} the main deterrents in public transport to be competitive with other modes of transport. The reason for this bad performance of the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> can be related to the slow and inflexible character of the <b>last</b> <b>mile.</b> Where PRT systems aspire to deliver an on demand, direct service to a passenger, they are bound to fixed separated infrastructure and would therefore face high investment costs for the application of PRT systems on the <b>last</b> <b>mile.</b> As automated vehicles can make use of any kind of road that is available the investment costs are considerably lower. The system presented in this thesis is a <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> transportation service operated by automated vehicles on existing infrastructure. Multiple operational strategies have been simulated using an agent based simulation model in AnyLogic. This simulation model has been applied on the case study Delft Zuid - Technological Innovation campus. For this case study a travel demand survey has been conducted, from which the results serve as one of the main inputs of the simulation model. The outcomes of the simulations indicate that relocating empty vehicles, intermediate charging have a positive effect on the performance of the system on the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> without compromising any other system performance parameter. Pre-booking of vehicles (via a smartphone app) showed to be very beneficial with regard to the average waiting time for a passenger. However, as vehicles are locked for a longer period the system capacity decreases. The speed of the vehicles appeared one of the main determinants for the energy use of the vehicles and therefore the available system capacity. Speed variations have shown large reductions in the average travel time for a passenger. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
