25|$|The Miami area {{is known}} for its high level of {{automobile}} dependency and lack of public transportation, which has led to an increasing traffic problem throughout the county. Nearly 20% of household income is spent on transportation and Miami had the most decentralized office space of any metropolitan area in the United States, according to a study in 2000. Despite overwhelming support for public transportation to be funded in place of several new highways in the 1970s, Miami's Metrorail system was not functional until 1984 and as of 2014 has failed to reach the scope which was promised over 30 years ago. Ridership was very low in the early years, averaging less than 10,000 riders per day. The system was not finished, even after nearly US$1 billion in federal subsidies, meaning that approximately US$100,000 was spent for each passenger. This led to criticism from then President Ronald Reagan, who stated {{that it would have been}} a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> to buy everyone a limousine. Those supporting mass transit argued that the low ridership was due to the system being incomplete and not going where people needed it to, and noted that within a few years ridership was nearing 50,000 per day. Many of Miami and Florida's politicians have not been advocates of alternative transportation. For example, both state governors Jeb Bush and Rick Scott denied funding for an intercity high-speed rail system in Florida. Two state senators tried to force Scott to accept the funding, but the Florida Supreme Court denied the case and the funding was later directed to several other rail projects across the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{walls of}} the {{building}} are faced with blue tiles from Kittanning. Mr. Clifford McNees, who {{was the president of}} the Kittanning Tile and Brick Company at the time when Mt. St. Peter bought the tile, sold the tiles for a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than normal price. He felt {{that it would not be}} fair to take advantage of a church by charging high prices. Another man who helped save the parish money in the constructing of the school was parishioner Luigi Valle. He advised the workers on how to set the tiles for many days while refusing to be paid for his services. Valle died in his early 40s, before the tile laying was completed. His place was taken by Bruno Regoli and two of his sons, Bruno, Jr. and John. [...] (John would later become a priest of Mt. St. Peter Parish.) [...] The three men faced the entire third floor with tile, a job that took them more than a month to complete.|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs {{moved to}} Lawrence, Kansas in 1981, taking up {{residence}} at 1927 Learnard Avenue {{where he would}} {{spend the rest of}} his life. He once told a Wichita Eagle reporter that he was content to live in Kansas, saying, [...] "The thing I like about Kansas is that it's not nearly as violent, and it's a helluva <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper.</b> And I can get out in the country and fish and shoot and whatnot." [...] In 1984, he signed a seven-book deal with Viking Press after he signed with literary agent Andrew Wylie. This deal included the publication rights to the unpublished 1952 novel Queer. With this money he purchased a small bungalow for $29,000. He was finally inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 after several attempts by Allen Ginsberg to get him accepted. He attended the induction ceremony in May 1983. Lawrence Ferlinghetti remarked the induction of Burroughs into the Academy proved Herbert Marcuse's point that capitalistic society had a great ability to incorporate its one-time outsiders.|$|E

If they'd asked about wages for drivers, an' about horse-shoein' prices, I'd a-had to come down; because, you see, they ain't no teamsters' union in the country, an' no horseshoers' union, an' rent is low, an' them two items come a whole <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper.</b> Huh! This {{afternoon}} I got a word bargain with the blacksmith {{across from the}} post office; an' he takes my whole bunch an' throws off twenty-five cents on each shoein', though it's on the Q. T. But they didn't think to ask, bein' too full of bricks." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jodenkoeken are big {{but very}} flat, {{making it a}} cheap product to produce. A <b>lot</b> of <b>cheap</b> {{products}} got the prefix Jewish in the past. A lot of Jews were poor, making it likely that they bought cheaper things because it was necessary.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} get {{from one place to}} another, people can either use a service or taxis. A [...] "service" [...] is a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a [...] "taxi" [...] as the {{passenger}} would be sharing the cab in the first place unlike the latter, where he would have the cab to himself.|$|E
5000|$|In Argentina {{this form}} of robbery {{increased}} by 118% between the years 2008 and 2009, possibly because motorbikes have become a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> and more accessible to the public. In that country, the perpetrators are called motochorros, a neologism from the words moto (motorcycle) and chorro (a vulgar term for [...] "thief").|$|E
50|$|In many {{science fiction}} stories, there are {{artificial}} gravity generators {{that create a}} gravitational field based on a mass that does not exist. It helps the story by creating a more Earth-like spaceship, {{and in the case}} of a movie or television program, it helps the production because it is a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than the special effects needed to simulate weightlessness.|$|E
50|$|Victory Avenue is a road in Mong Kok, Kowloon. It {{begins at}} Argyle Street, and ends at Waterloo Road. There {{are a lot}} of pet shops along the road, and also a <b>lot</b> of <b>cheap</b> {{restaurants}} due to the large number of schools around the area.|$|R

It's a whole <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than starting a war, and I don’t think any oil shipments will stop.|$|E
5000|$|During {{its heyday}} [...] "Nero" [...] {{was the most}} popular Flemish comic strip, second only to Suske en Wiske. The albums sold well, also because they were a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than their main rival. From the late 1940s until the early 1960s all the stories were {{published}} on cheap paper and often smelt of fresh ink. During the 1960s Jef Nys' Jommeke overshadowed [...] "Nero"'s sales among children.|$|E
50|$|In {{the seventh}} one, {{a man should}} leave his pet called a Grox home when he travels by air. However, if he takes him with him, they doubly charge costs, and he must pack up and lock up the Grox in a Grox box which costs much, much more than any fox boxes. So, to fly with his foxes, it's a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than {{spend a lot of}} money on boxes for Groxes.|$|E
6000|$|... "All that I've had {{out of it}} so far," [...] he declared, [...] "is free {{quarters}} here. The rent's paid {{up to the end}} of the year. I've had to {{sell the}} furniture bit by bit to keep alive. It was a <b>cheap</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>cheap</b> and showy, and it fetched jolly little. Morry always did like to have things that looked worth more than he gave for them. Even his jewellery was sham--every bally bit of it. There wasn't a real pearl or a real diamond amongst the lot. But there's no doubt about the money. I've had the bank-book. He was worth a cool two thousand a year was Morry--that's five hundred each quarter day, you understand, and somewhere or other there must be the bonds or securities from which this money came. He never kept them here. I'll swear to that. Therefore they must be somewhere that you ought to know about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It WAS a mistake," [...] {{admitted}} Miss Cornelia. [...] "But {{they got}} the <b>lot</b> <b>cheap.</b> And no other manse children ever thought of playing there. Mr. Meredith shouldn't allow it. But he has always got his nose buried in a book, when he is home. He reads and reads, or walks about in his study in a day-dream. So far he hasn't forgotten to be in church on Sundays, but twice he has forgotten about the prayer-meeting {{and one of the}} elders had to go over to the manse and remind him. And he forgot about Fanny Cooper's wedding. They rang him up on the 'phone and then he rushed right over, just as he was, carpet slippers and all. One wouldn't mind if the Methodists didn't laugh so about it. But there's one comfort--they can't criticize his sermons. He wakes up when he's in the pulpit, believe ME. And the Methodist minister can't preach at all--so they tell me. I have never heard him, thank goodness." ...|$|R
50|$|Harnett painted musical instruments, hanging game, and tankards, {{but also}} painted the {{unconventional}} Golden Horseshoe (1886), a single rusted horseshoe shown nailed to a board. He painted a casual jumble of second-hand books set {{on top of}} a crate, Job <b>Lot,</b> <b>Cheap</b> (1878), as well as firearms and even paper currency. His works sold well, but {{they were more likely to}} be found hanging in a tavern or a business office than in a museum, as they did not conform to contemporary notions of high art. Harnett spent the years 1880 - 1886 in Europe, staying in Munich from 1881 until early 1885. Harnett's best-known paintings, the four versions of After The Hunt, were painted between 1883 and 1885. Each is an imposing composition of hunting equipment and dead game, hanging on a door with ornate hinges at the right and keyhole plate at the left. These paintings, like the horseshoe or currency depictions mentioned earlier, are especially effective as trompe-l'œil because the objects occupy a shallow space, meaning that the illusion is not spoiled by parallax shift if the viewer moves.|$|R
50|$|The radio {{spectrum}} scope (also radio panoramic receiver, panoramic adapter, pan receiver, pan adapter, panadapter, panoramic radio spectroscope, panoramoscope, panalyzor and band scope) {{was invented by}} Marcel Wallace and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more radio bands - e.g. shortwave bands. A spectrum scope is normally a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a spectrum analyzer, because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the American {{equivalent}} (Florida Cow Whip {{which is}} made of inexpensive nylon) an Australian stockwhip is usually made of redhide or sometimes greenhide leather but can also be made of kangaroo hide. Because a kangaroo is a native animal, and cattle are a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> and abundant, kangaroo hide stockwhips are more expensive. Only the most expensive whips are made from kangaroo hide and they often have a fully plaited handle. Kangaroo hide allows the whip maker to produce the fine plaits for which the kangaroo leather stockwhip is renowned.|$|E
5000|$|The Calguns Foundation, a gun rights group, paid {{to extend}} the lapsing patent on the {{technology}} to further delay the law from taking effect. Gene Hoffman, chairman of the group said, [...] "It was a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> to keep the patent in force than to litigate over the issues." [...] Hoffman added that he believed the law amounted to a gun ban in California. Todd Lizotte, the engineer who developed the technology, said he wanted the patents to lapse and the technology {{to be in the}} public domain.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is close}} to the large south Asian {{communities}} of Brampton and Rexdale. The accessible area with large <b>cheap</b> <b>lots</b> has become home to several Hindu temples, most notably the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto.|$|R
6000|$|At last Therese put a dish {{of fruit}} on the table, a small {{collection}} of oranges, raisins, and nuts. No doubt she had bought that <b>lot</b> very <b>cheap</b> {{and it did not}} look at all inviting. Captain Blunt jumped up. “My mother can’t stand tobacco smoke. Will you keep her company, mon cher, while I take a turn with a cigar in that ridiculous garden. The brougham from the hotel will be here very soon.” ...|$|R
50|$|I have a <b>lot</b> of <b>cheap,</b> little {{keyboards}} {{and this}} octagon - optigan thing and this synth module {{that has a}} zillion different sounds in it. A lot of the keyboards I got at thrift stores. I have a little Casio SK-1 that has a built in sampler. My favorite microphone I found at the landfill. It was on a CB base station. I've got these wireless intercoms from the '50s from an auction from a dentist's office.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} {{of the first half of}} the 20th century the {{shipping}} companies faced growing competition from the railways and especially the truck. Owning and operating a truck is a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a steam (later motor) vessel. Also, ships need additional last mile transportation, which a truck does by itself. The competitive edge of the truck became painfully clear during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After 1933 the number of shipping companies and shipping lines were declining fast. Some of them started to offer trucking services, even in competition with their own shipping lines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of Dexters has been fuelled {{by a desire}} for organic food, health concerns over factory farming, and soaring food prices. [...] "The government {{has no interest in}} where our food comes from or how it tastes, so it's nice to set your own welfare and quality standards,” said poet and songwriter Pam Ayres, who has a small herd of Dexters on her 20 acre Cotswolds property. [...] "If you've got a bit of land, a breed like the Dexter can work out a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper</b> than the supermarket, plus they do {{a pretty good job of}} mowing the lawn." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mazumdar-Shaw dislikes {{the term}} [...] "philanthropy", believing that it often {{provides}} temporary fixes rather than changing underlying conditions. She prefers the term [...] "compassionate capitalist", believing that properly applied business models {{can provide an}} ongoing foundation for sustainable social progress. [...] "Innovation and commerce are as powerful tools for creating social progress as they are for driving technological advancement... when they are put to use for social progress, the implementation is a <b>lot</b> <b>cheaper,</b> {{a lot more people}} benefit, and the effect is more lasting." [...] In 2015, she joined The Giving Pledge, promising that at least half of her wealth will be dedicated to philanthropy.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 2,000 {{cars and}} trucks were {{reported}} towed from the disaster area following Gaston. Consequently, the flooded-out {{cars and trucks}}, known as [...] "flood cars," [...] were sold on used car <b>lots</b> at a <b>cheap</b> price. There were also isolated reports of scamming.|$|R

In the National Railway Network of Ethiopa, the main line, shown in red, goes into this area, where 50% of all Ethiopian cities {{with a population of}} 80.000 inhabitants and more are in immediate reach of the proposed main line. The main line connects them with the port of Djibouti and with the world economy - with one railway.|$|R
5000|$|Many Afghan rugs bear {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to Turkmen rugs. Afghanistan produces a <b>lot</b> of relatively <b>cheap</b> and coarse rugs, mainly for export, {{and many of}} those are in a [...] "Bokhara" [...] design. However, there are also some very fine Afghans including many using Turkmen designs.|$|R
