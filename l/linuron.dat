40|$|The {{abundance}} of libA, encoding a hydrolase that initiates <b>linuron</b> degradation in the <b>linuron</b> metabolizing Variovorax sp. SRS 16, was previously found to correlate well with <b>linuron</b> mineralization in various environments, {{but not in}} all. Recently, an alternative <b>linuron</b> hydrolase HylA was identified in Variovorax sp.

The discovery of alternative <b>linuron</b> hydrolases poses questions about the respective contribution and competitive character of hylA and libA carrying bacteria {{as well as the}} role of <b>linuron</b> mineralizing consortia versus single strains in <b>linuron</b> exposed settings. Therefore, dynamics of hylA as well as dcaQ as a marker for downstream catabolic functions involved in <b>linuron</b> mineralization, in response to <b>linuron</b> treatment in agricultural soil and on-farm biopurification systems (BPS), were compared with previously reported libA dynamics. The results suggest that (i) organisms containing libA and hylA both contribute simultaneously to <b>linuron</b> biodegradation in the same environment albeit to a varying extent, (ii) that environmental <b>linuron</b> mineralization depends on multispecies bacterial food webs and (iii) initiation of <b>linuron</b> mineralization can be governed by currently unidentified enzymes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Phenyl urea {{herbicides}} {{are among the}} most widely used herbicides in agriculture, resulting in important contamination of both surface water and groundwater. In this study we tried to isolate new <b>linuron</b> degrading bacteria and investigated whether complete <b>linuron</b> mineralization is commonly performed by a consortium or rather by a single primary degrader. Enrichment experiments with <b>linuron</b> were set up starting from two agricultural soils which had been treated previously with <b>linuron</b> and other pesticides. Subcultures fed with the metabolites 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine (N,O-DMHA) were set up from the <b>linuron</b> fed enrichment cultures. 16 S rDNA PCR-DGGE showed that the <b>linuron</b> degrading communities enriched from the two soils were different and were both complex in composition. The enrichment cultures were able to mineralize <b>linuron</b> efficiently as shown by 14 C-labeled <b>linuron</b> mineralization experiments. One <b>linuron</b> mineralizing strain was isolated from soil DKE. Additionally we found seven unique 3, 4 -DCA degraders in this soil (based on BOX-PCR). From soil BEH we retrieved five unique <b>linuron</b> degrading strains, of which three are able to mineralize <b>linuron</b> completely. Variovorax spp. specific FISH showed that one of these isolates belongs to this genus. In this soil three unique 3, 4 -DCA degrading strains were found. In both soils we found Hyphomicrobia which are known for their N,O-DMHA degrading capabilities (Dejonghe et al., 2003).

40|$|It was {{examined}} whether biofilm growth on {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) of a three-species consortium whose members synergistically degrade the phenylurea herbicide <b>linuron,</b> affected the consortium’s integrity and subsequent linuron-degrading functionality. Citrate as a model DOM as well as three environmental DOM (eDOM) of different quality were used. Biofilms developed with all DOM formulations and the three species were retained in the biofilm. However, biofilm biomass, species composition, architecture and co-localization of member strains depended on DOM and its biodegradability. To assess the linuron-degrading functionality, biofilms were subsequently irrigated with <b>linuron</b> at 10 mg L- 1 or 100 µg L- 1. Instant <b>linuron</b> degradation, {{the time needed to}} attain maximal <b>linuron</b> degradation and hence the total amount of <b>linuron</b> removed depended on both the DOM used for growth and the <b>linuron</b> concentration. At 10 mg L- 1, final <b>linuron</b> degradation efficiency was as high as previously observed without DOM except for biofilms fed with humic acids which did not degrade <b>linuron.</b> At 100 µg L- 1 <b>linuron,</b> DOM grown biofilms degraded <b>linuron</b> less efficient than without DOM. The amount of <b>linuron</b> removed was more correlated with biofilm species composition than with biomass or structure. Based on visual observations, co-localization of consortium members in biofilms after the DOM feed appears essential for instant linuron-degrading activity and might explain the differences in overall <b>linuron</b> degradation. The data show that DOM quality determines biofilm structure and composition of the pesticide-degrading consortium in periods with DOM as main C-source and can affect subsequent pesticide-degrading activity; especially at micropollutant concentrations. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{involvement}} of the genus Variovorax and the <b>linuron</b> hydrolase gene libA in in situ <b>linuron</b> degradation in agricultural fields, changes in Variovorax community size and composition, in libA abundance and in <b>linuron</b> mineralization capacity were monitored in field soil plots either treated or not with a linuron-containing herbicide mixture. Changes in Variovorax community composition and increases in libA gene copy numbers corresponded to increases in <b>linuron</b> mineralization capacity in the plot treated with the herbicide mixture, suggesting that Variovorax and libA proliferated as a response to <b>linuron</b> in the field and their contribution to in situ <b>linuron</b> degradation. The response of the Variovorax community composition was especially due to the proliferation of a Variovorax phylotype (phylotype D) that differed from Variovorax phylotypes previously associated with <b>linuron</b> degradation and libA abundance in the same soil, suggesting the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer of libA in the examined field. The involvement of Variovorax phylotype D and libA in <b>linuron</b> degradation in the examined soil was supported by lab soil microcosm experiments that showed further increase or decrease of both the population size of phylotype D and libA numbers when <b>linuron</b> was added or omitted, respectively. Attempts to enrich in suspended cultures and isolate the corresponding organism from the soil were unsuccessful. In those enrichments, Variovorax phylotype D was replaced by other Variovorax phylotypes showing that linuron-degrading strains isolated by liquid enrichment cultures are not always representatives of those responsive to <b>linuron</b> in the field, although the genus specificity of <b>linuron</b> degradation was retained. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Pesticides are {{detected}} {{worldwide in}} surface- and groundwater {{as a result}} of their use in agriculture. After application on the field, leaching and percolation are the main routes of their dissipation into non-target environments. Microbial degradation determines for a large part the extent of these processes. Although several bacteria which degrade specific pesticides have been isolated from pesticide-contaminated soils, till today it is unclear whether enrichment techniques provide a correct picture of the organisms responsible for in situ pesticide degradation. Nonetheless, certain types of organisms seem to be specialized in the degradation of specific pesticides. For example, enrichment of linuron-degrading strains predominately results into strains belonging to the genus Variovorax. It can be hypothesized that these organisms also play a crucial role in in situ degradation of the respective compounds but currently no data exists which subscribe this hypothesis. The overall objective was to determine whether Variovorax actually contributes to in situ <b>linuron</b> biodegradation by analyzing the dynamics of Variovorax and its <b>linuron</b> degradation genes in agricultural soils and pesticide biopurification systems as a response to <b>linuron</b> supply and in relationship to <b>linuron</b> degradation. A first objective was to develop cultivation-independent tools to monitor the Variovorax community size and composition in environmental samples. Real-time PCR and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approaches that specifically target the Variovorax 16 S rRNA gene were developed to estimate the number and diversity of Variovorax in environmental ecosystems. DGGE allowed the grouping of PCR amplicons according to the phylogenetic grouping within the genus Variovorax. The toolbox was used to assess the Variovorax community dynamics in agricultural soil microcosms (SMs) exposed to the phenylurea herbicide <b>linuron.</b> Exposure to <b>linuron</b> resulted in an increased abundance within the Variovorax community of a subgroup previously linked to <b>linuron</b> degradation through cultivation-dependent isolation. SMs that were treated only once with <b>linuron</b> reverted to the initial community composition 70 days after <b>linuron</b> exposure. In contrast, SMs irrigated with <b>linuron</b> on a long-term base showed a significant increase in Variovorax number after 70 days. These data support the hypothesis that the genus Variovorax is involved in <b>linuron</b> degradation in linuron-treated agricultural soils. In order to be able to develop a molecular tool to monitor <b>linuron</b> catabolic gene abundance in environmental samples, genes involved in <b>linuron</b> degradation were identified in linuron-mineralizing Variovorax sp. SRS 16. The proposed pathway initiates with hydrolysis of <b>linuron</b> to 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine, followed by conversion of DCA to Krebs cycle intermediates. Differential proteomic analysis showed a linuron-dependent up-regulation of several enzymes that fit into this pathway including an amidase (LibA),a multicomponent chloroaniline dioxygenase and enzymes associated with a modified chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway. Purified LibA is a monomeric <b>linuron</b> hydrolase of ~ 55 kDa with a KM and Vmax for <b>linuron</b> of 5. 8 µM and 0. 16 nmol min- 1, respectively. This novel member of the Amidase Signature family is unrelated to phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and lacks activity towards other tested phenylurea herbicides. Orthologues of libA were present in all other tested linuron-degrading Variovorax strains with the exception of strains Variovorax WDL 1 and Variovorax PBS-H 4, suggesting divergent evolution of the <b>linuron</b> catabolic pathway in different Variovorax strains. The organization of the <b>linuron</b> degradation genes identified in the draft SRS 16 genome sequence indicates that gene patchwork assembly is at the origin of the pathway in SRS 16. Transcription analysis suggests that a catabolic intermediate, rather than <b>linuron</b> itself, acts as effector in activation of the pathway. These data provide the first report on the genetic organization of a bacterial pathway for complete mineralization of a phenylurea herbicide and the first report on a <b>linuron</b> hydrolase in Gram-negative bacteria. In order to assess the contribution of this novel type of <b>linuron</b> hydrolase gene, libA, to <b>linuron</b> degradation in environmental settings, libA abundance was monitored in response to the application of <b>linuron.</b> It was monitored in agricultural soil microcosms and microcosms simulating the matrix of on-farm biopurification systems and in a field experiment. The libA copy number was measured by real-time PCR and linked to data of Variovorax community composition and <b>linuron</b> mineralization capacity. In the soil microcosms, the field experiment and one biopurification system set-up, libA copy numbers responded to the application of <b>linuron</b> and environmental changes in congruency with the modulation of <b>linuron</b> mineralization capacity and the occurrence of a particular phylotype within the Variovorax community. However, in another biopurification system set-up, no such correlation was found between libA abundance, Variovorax community composition and <b>linuron</b> mineralization potential. These data suggest that in the environmental settings, occurrence of libA can be linked to the <b>linuron</b> mineralization capacity and that libA is primarily hosted by specific Variovorax strains in those settings. However, the results also show that, apart from libA, other yet unknown isofunctional genes occur and can contribute to <b>linuron</b> degradation in the environment. It would be interesting to analyze, instead of libA gene copy number dynamics, libA activity dynamics in these systems which might show a more direct relationship with <b>linuron</b> mineralization. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} use {{of pesticides}} to secure food production has resulted into the contamination of surface water and groundwater bodies. Microbial biodegradation is considered as a major process {{that contributes to the}} removal of pesticides from the environment. Bacteria have been isolated which display specialized catabolic pathways that enable them to use pesticides as sole source of energy and carbon. In natural ecosystems, pesticides are considered micropollutants which are pollutants present in water at trace concentrations in the pg L- 1 to µg L- 1 range and are often only temporarily available. It has been questioned whether such concentrations can sustain pesticide degrading populations and whether degradation of pesticides at micropollutant concentrations still occurs. Natural environments contain dissolved organic matter (DOM) at concentrations of 1 - 20 mg L- 1 and is considered as the major source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic communities. The DOM is a supplementary source of nutrients and energy for residing pesticide degrading populations. However, DOM can also have negative effects on pollutant biodegradation, for instance by exerting catabolic repression. Up till now, the net effects of natural DOM on pesticide biodegradation are scarcely explored especially in case of the biodegradation of pesticides occurring at relevant micropollutant concentrations of pesticides The overall aim of this research was to explore the effects of {{the quantity and quality of}} DOM on pesticide degradation at macro- and micropollutant concentrations. The DOM quantity in European surface waters is measured at a median concentration of 5 mg L- 1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOM quality is determined by the molecular properties of the occurring organic compounds (e. g. spectroscopic properties) and is related to its biodegradability. As an experimental system, the degradation of the phenylurea herbicide <b>linuron</b> was examined by members of the genus Variovorax and/or by a triple-species bacterial consortium. This consortium consists of three strains which synergistically mineralize <b>linuron.</b> Variovorax sp. strain WDL 1 initiates <b>linuron</b> mineralization by transforming <b>linuron</b> to 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine (N,O-DMHA). Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 lives on excreted 3, 4 -DCA while Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL 6 feeds on N,O-DMHA. In a first part of the research, the metabolic capabilities of the <b>linuron</b> degrading bacteria were explored. By determining C-source utilization profiles in Biolog GN 2 microtiter plate assays, it was found that the consortium displays an extended metabolic capability compared to individual <b>linuron</b> degrading strains and its members. This was due to the respiration of C-sources by the consortium for which respiration was unobtainable by the individual members. The data suggest that the consortium members cooperate in the utilization of C-sources other than <b>linuron.</b> This feature can contribute in consolidating community composition in the presence of micropollutant concentrations of <b>linuron</b> or in its absence. By examining the biodegradable DOC in environmental DOM (eDOM) by the consortium and its members and concomitant growth, we observed that this cooperation extends towards the utilization of eDOM as carbon source. The data suggest that for both DOM of low and high recalcitrance, cooperation existed within the consortium. All consortium members benefited from the cooperation, however the balance of benefits for each strain shifted according to DOM recalcitrance. All together, the results show that compared to individual heterotrophic pesticide degrading bacteria, consortia can benefit to a greater extent of dissolved carbon resources available in an environment due to metabolic cooperation and that consortia have to be included to evaluate the effect of DOM on pesticide degradation. In a second part of the research, the activity of bacterial cultures towards the degradation of <b>linuron</b> at concentrations ranging from 10 mg L- 1 to 1 µg L- 1 was explored in batch experiments. Several <b>linuron</b> degrading pure Variovorax strains and the consortium were tested. All cultures tested were able to degrade <b>linuron</b> at initial concentrations as low as 1 µg L- 1 and that degradation proceeded beyond the detection limit of 1 ng L- 1. Degradation rates however varied up to a factor 70 between the different strains and were concentration dependent. Inclusion of strain WDL 1 in the consortium did not dramatically improve the degradation of <b>linuron</b> at concentrations lower than 100 µg L- 1. In addition, the effect of supplementary C-substrates including eDOM of varying quality and quantity on <b>linuron</b> degradation was assessed. Effects of supplementary C-sources on <b>linuron</b> degradation were especially noted at a concentration of 10 mg L- 1 <b>linuron.</b> In case of pure cultures, citrate as a supplementary C-source repressed <b>linuron</b> degradation and increased accumulation of 3, 4 -DCA. eDOM, even when only 20 % biodegradable, increased the <b>linuron</b> degradation rate 2 -fold. At micropollutant concentrations a 2 -fold increase in <b>linuron</b> degradation rates was observed with strain WDL 1 for eDOM, suggesting that eDOM can stimulate <b>linuron</b> degradation by pure cultures at micropollutant concentrations. However, with the consortium, the magnitude of both negative and positive effects of eDOM obtained with pure cultures diminished greatly. Bacteria grow in the environment as a community on surfaces and form so-called biofilms. That is why in the last part of the research we explored the effects of eDOM on <b>linuron</b> degradation in continuously irrigated biofilm setups with focus on the consortium. It was first shown that the consortium was able to form biofilms in flow chambers irrigated with eDOM of both low and high quality at environmentally relevant concentrations of 5 mg L- 1 DOC. The structure and composition of the biofilms clearly depended on the DOM formulation applied. The biofilms were afterwards irrigated with <b>linuron</b> at a concentration of either 10 mg L- 1 or 100 µg L- 1. Clearly, the <b>linuron</b> degrading activity of the biofilm depended on the DOM used for growing the biofilm and the <b>linuron</b> concentration. In case of a <b>linuron</b> feed of 10 mg L- 1, for some DOM complete failure of <b>linuron</b> degradation was observed. The ability of these biofilms to degrade <b>linuron</b> correlated with the relative abundance and co-localization of WDL 1 and WDL 7, while the <b>linuron</b> degrading activity correlated with biomass. Moreover, degradation of 100 µg L- 1 <b>linuron</b> was maximally 30 % for all biofilms. Second, the effect of eDOM on <b>linuron</b> degradation at concentrations of 10 mg L- 1 was explored. Easily degradable DOM like citrate inhibited <b>linuron</b> degradation and was accompanied with the accumulation of 3, 4 -DCA. More recalcitrant DOM stimulated <b>linuron</b> degradation as the effluent concentrations of <b>linuron</b> decreased. After changing the feed to only <b>linuron,</b> both positive and negative effects of the DOMs were rapidly lost and degradation occurred with an efficiency similar to this recorded for control biofilms which had never been in contact with DOM. In a final experimental setup, the effect of DOM on <b>linuron</b> degradation of concentrations as low as 10 µg L- 1 in biofilms was explored. While the consortium was shown to form biofilms on <b>linuron</b> concentrations of 1000 µg L- 1, 100 µg L- 1 and 10 µg L- 1 with removal efficiencies going from 80 % to 30 %, no significant effect of DOM of both low and high quality was recorded, despite changes in biofilm structure and composition. It can be concluded that at high <b>linuron</b> concentrations, the presence of DOM as supplementary C-source affects <b>linuron</b> degradation by pure bacterial cultures positively at high <b>linuron</b> concentrations. In microbial communities, smaller effects of DOM on <b>linuron</b> degradation were found than with isolates, likely related to the robustness of communities. Microbial communities are the rule rather than the exception in natural ecosystems. All previously isolated <b>linuron</b> degrading cultures showed the ability to degrade <b>linuron</b> at micropollutant concentrations. The effect of DOM did however no longer apply at these concentrations. On the other hand, biofilm experiments suggest that growth on DOM in periods of absence of <b>linuron</b> can significantly affect subsequent <b>linuron</b> degradation. nrpages: 223 status: publishe...|$|E

Instead, organic carbon present in environmental dissolved organic matter (eDOM) constitutes the main carbon source in nature. Information on how natural organic carbon affects degradation of pollutants and micropollutants in particular, is however poor. <b>Linuron</b> degrading Variovorax sp. strains SRS 16, WDL 1 and PBLH 6 and a triple-species bacterial consortium from which WDL 1 originated, were examined {{for their ability to}} degrade <b>linuron</b> at micropollutant concentrations and the effect hereon of different eDOM formulations of varying biodegradability as supplementary C-source was explored. Individual strains and the consortium degraded <b>linuron</b> at initial concentrations as low as 1 µg L- 1 till concentrations below 4 ng L- 1. Degradation kinetics differed among strains with rates that differed up to 70 -fold at the lowest <b>linuron</b> concentrations and with lag phases ranging from 0 to 7 days. <b>Linuron</b> biodegradation by the individual strains was inhibited by an easily biodegradable compound such as citrate but stimulated by eDOM at a <b>linuron</b> concentration of 10 mg L- 1. Effects were strongly reduced or became non-existent at micropollutant <b>linuron</b> concentrations. Effects of eDOM on degradation at 10 mg L- 1 <b>linuron</b> by WDL 1 were reduced when WDL 1 was incubated together with its original consortium members.

40|$|The soil {{bacterial}} isolate Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16 mineralizes the phenylurea herbicide <b>linuron.</b> The proposed pathway initiates with hydrolysis of <b>linuron</b> to 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine, {{followed by}} conversion of DCA to Krebs cycle intermediates. Differential proteomic analysis showed a linuron-dependent up-regulation of several enzymes that {{fit into this}} pathway including an amidase (LibA), a multicomponent chloroaniline dioxygenase and enzymes associated with a modified chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway. Purified LibA is a monomeric <b>linuron</b> hydrolase of ∼ 55 kDa with a K(M) and V(max) for <b>linuron</b> of 5. 8 μM and 0. 16 nmol min(- 1), respectively. This novel member of the Amidase Signature family is unrelated to phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and lacks activity towards other tested phenylurea herbicides. Orthologues of libA are present in all other tested linuron-degrading Variovorax strains {{with the exception of}} strains Variovorax WDL 1 and Variovorax PBS-H 4, suggesting divergent evolution of the <b>linuron</b> catabolic pathway in different Variovorax strains. The organization of the <b>linuron</b> degradation genes identified in the draft SRS 16 genome sequence indicates that gene patchwork assembly is at the origin of the pathway in SRS 16. Transcription analysis suggests that a catabolic intermediate, rather than <b>linuron</b> itself, acts as effector in activation of the pathway.

40|$|Phenyl urea {{herbicides}} {{are among the}} most widely used herbicides in agriculture, resulting in contamination of surface water and groundwater. The topsoil is considered as a biological filter which determines the extent of pesticide degradation and groundwater contamination. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the role of a solid surface on the organization and activity of commensal pollutant degrading communities of natural origin. Recently, several multispecies microbial communities mineralizing phenyl {{urea herbicides}} such as <b>linuron</b> have been isolated from treated agricultural soils, indicating that bacteria adapt to the contamination (Dejonghe et al., 2003). In this study we tried to isolate new <b>linuron</b> mineralizing bacteria to study whether complete <b>linuron</b> mineralization in soil is commonly performed by consortia or by single strains. Additionally the structural organization of a <b>linuron</b> metabolizing multispecies consortium on a solid surface was studied. Enrichment cultures degrading <b>linuron</b> were obtained from two <b>linuron</b> treated agricultural soils (DKE and BEH). DNA fingerprint analysis showed that cultures from the two soils were different and complex in composition. Complete mineralization of <b>linuron</b> was proven by 14 C-labeled <b>linuron</b> mineralization experiments. One and five <b>linuron</b> metabolizing strains were isolated from soil DKE and soil BEH, respectively. Although some of those isolates also grow on 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA), together with N,O-DMHA the primary degradation product of <b>linuron,</b> unique 3, 4 -DCA degraders could be isolated from both soils. In addition, Hyphomicrobia which are known for their N,O-DMHA degrading capabilities, could be identified. These results indicate that <b>linuron</b> is metabolized in soil by a consortium rather than by a single pollutant mineralizing strain. The structural interactions between the <b>linuron</b> degrading consortium members (Variovorax sp. WDL 1, Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 and Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL 6) grown as mixed biofilms were studied in flow chambers by means of CLSM. Under selective conditions with <b>linuron</b> as sole source of carbon and nitrogen, the consortium members formed a heterogeneous biofilm with mushroom-like structures. These structures consisted mainly of associated Comamonas and Variovorax cells with very few Hyphomicrobia. However, more downstream, mushroom-like structures consisted almost exclusively of Hyphomicrobium cells. On the other hand, when the consortium was fed with a non-selective carbon source, i. e. citrate, the synergistic association between the bacteria was lost and Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 became the dominant member forming a homogeneous multilayered biofilm. It shows that different nutrient conditions such as carbon substrate have a profound effect on both structure and organization of a synergistic pollutant degrading biofilm. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{environmental}} {{dissolved organic matter}} (eDOM) that consists of various low concentration carbonic compounds on pollutant biodegradation by bacteria are poorly understood, especially when it concerns synergistic xenobiotic-degrading consortia where degradation depends on interspecies metabolic interactions. This study examines {{the impact of the}} quality and quantity of eDOM, supplied as secondary C-source, on the structure, composition and pesticide-degrading activity of a triple-species bacterial consortium in which the members synergistically degrade the phenylurea herbicide <b>linuron,</b> when grown as biofilms. Biofilms developing on 10 mg L− 1 <b>linuron</b> showed a steady-state <b>linuron</b> degradation efficiency of approximately 85 %. The three bacterial strains co-localized in the biofilms indicating syntrophic interactions. Subsequent feeding with eDOM or citrate in addition to <b>linuron</b> resulted into changes in linuron-degrading activity. A decrease in linuron-degrading activity was especially recorded in case of co-feeding with citrate and eDOM of high quality and was always associated with accumulation of the primary metabolite 3, 4 -dichloroaniline. Improvement of <b>linuron</b> degradation was especially observed with more recalcitrant eDOM. Addition of eDOM/citrate formulations altered biofilm architecture and species composition but without loss of any of the strains and of co-localization. Compositional shifts correlated with <b>linuron</b> degradation efficiencies. When the feed was restored to only <b>linuron,</b> the linuron-degrading activity rapidly changed to the level before the mixed-substrate feed. Meanwhile only minor changes in biofilm composition and structure were recorded, indicating that observed eDOM/citrate effects had been primarily due to repression/stimulation of <b>linuron</b> catabolic activity rather than to biofilm characteristics. status: publishe...|$|E

The fluxes calculated for <b>linuron</b> support this interpretation. At the experimental start, several pathways played a role, i. e. <b>linuron</b> fl uxes from pore water to overlying water and from pore water to roots. The flux from pore water to overlying water decreased later, while the translocation fl uxes from roots to shoots increased. Hence, eff ects on macrophytes in this type of sediment toxicity test should be expressed in terms of pore water concentrations.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} use {{of organic}} xenobiotics ultimately {{leads to the}} contamination {{of a wide range}} of water bodies like rivers, lakes and aquifers with organic micropollutants. The concentrations at which these contaminants are detected in water bodies are in the µg to ng per liter range. Bacterial strains and consortia able to degrade xenobiotic compounds like pesticides have been isolated from various ecosystems and are considered catalysts of interest for pollutant removal from water. However the situation of the extremely low concentrations at which they occur has been suggested to pose a challenge for efficient biodegradation of the pollutant. In this study, we examined in which way the degradation activity of a multi-species microbial consortium, consisting of three bacterial strains which synergistically mineralize the phenylurea herbicide <b>linuron</b> and other <b>linuron</b> degrading bacterial strains, are affected when grown with <b>linuron</b> provided at micropollutant concentrations. The cultures were grown either in suspension or as a biofilm in continuous flow chambers. <b>Linuron</b> degrading strains and consortia showed in both systems the resilience to remove low concentrations of <b>linuron.</b> The <b>linuron</b> degrading consortium was able to form biofilms on low <b>linuron</b> concentrations down till 10 µg/L.

40|$|On-farm biopurification systems (BPS) treat pesticide-contaminated {{wastewater}} {{of farms}} through biodegradation. Adding pesticide-primed soil {{has been shown}} to be beneficial for the establishment of pesticide-degrading populations in BPS. However, no data exist on the response of pesticide-degrading microbiota, either endogenous or introduced with pesticide-primed soil, when BPS are exposed to expected less favorable environmental conditions like cold periods, drought periods, and periods without a pesticide supply. Therefore, the response of microbiota mineralizing the herbicide <b>linuron</b> in BPS microcosm setups inoculated either with a linuron-primed soil or a nonprimed soil to a sequence of such less favorable conditions was examined. A period without <b>linuron</b> supply or a drought period reduced the size of the linuron-mineralizing community in both setups. The most severe effect was recorded for the setup containing nonprimed soil, in which stopping the <b>linuron</b> supply decreased the <b>linuron</b> degradation capacity to nondetectable levels. In both systems, <b>linuron</b> mineralization rapidly reestablished after conventional operation conditions were restored. A cold period and feeding with a pesticide mixture did not affect <b>linuron</b> mineralization. The changes in the linuron-mineralizing capacity in microcosms containing primed soil were associated with the dynamics of a particular Variovorax phylotype that previously had been associated with <b>linuron</b> mineralization. This study suggests that the pesticide-mineralizing community in BPS is robust in stress situations imposed by changes in environmental conditions expected to occur on farms. Moreover, it suggests that, in cases where effects do occur, recovery is rapid after restoring conventional operation conditions. status: publishe...|$|E

The enzyme {{is distinct from}} the <b>linuron</b> hydrolase LibA enzyme recently identified in other linuron-mineralizing Variovorax strains and from phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes (PuhA, PuhB) found in Gram-positive bacteria. The dimeric enzyme belongs to a separate family of hydrolases and differs in Km, temperature optimum and phenylurea herbicide substrate range. Within the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily, HylA and PuhA/PuhB belong to two distinct protein families while LibA {{is a member of}} the unrelated Amidase Signature family. The hylA gene was identified in a draft genome sequence of strain WDL 1. The involvement of hylA in <b>linuron</b> degradation by strain WDL 1 is inferred from its absence in spontaneous WDL 1 mutants defective in <b>linuron</b> hydrolysis and its presence in linuron-degrading Variovorax strains that lack libA. In strain WDL 1, the hylA gene is combined with catabolic gene modules encoding the downstream pathways for DCA degradation which are very similar to those present in Variovorax sp.

Our results show that the expansion of a DCA catabolic pathway towards <b>linuron</b> degradation in Variovorax can involve different but isofunctional <b>linuron</b> hydrolysis genes encoding proteins that belong to evolutionary unrelated hydrolase families.
