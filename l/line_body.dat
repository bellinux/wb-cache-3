40|$|Epithelial cells <b>line</b> <b>body</b> surface {{tissues and}} provide a {{physicochemical}} barrier to the external environment. Frequent microbial and non-microbial challenges such as those imposed by mechanical disruption, injury or exposure to noxious environmental substances including chemicals, carcinogens, ultraviolet-irradiation or toxins cause activation of epithelial cells with release of cytokines and chemokines as well as alterations in the expression of cell surface ligands. Such display of epithelial stress is rapidly sensed by tissue resident immunocytes, which can directly interact with self-moieties on epithelial cells and initiate both local and systemic immune responses. Epithelial cells are thus key drivers of immune surveillance at body surface tissues. However, epithelial cells have a propensity to drive type 2 immunity (rather than type 1) upon non-invasive challenge or stress – a type of immunity whose regulation and function still remain enigmatic. Here we review the induction and possible role of type 2 immunity in epithelial tissues and propose that rapid immune surveillance and type 2 immunity are key regulators of tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis...|$|E

Percentage of skin decreased with increasing of body weight. In both lines females had a higher percentage of total fat than males.

40|$|Complex Vascular Lesions, (CVL) are {{a common}} {{vascular}} change associated with idiopathicpulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). CVL have been characterized in studies using animal models involving, but not limited to, Sprague-Dawley rats and poultry (Abe et al., 2010; Wideman et al., 2011). IPAH has been documented in poultry although no connection has been made with CVLs. The current study characterizes CVL in the lungs from broilers derived from lines divergently selected for 15 generations for ascites susceptibility under conditions of simulated high altitude. The ascites RES and SUS lines were sampled for CVL incidence over time. Both lines were reared in a common environment and provided feed and water ad libitum. At ages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks post hatch, five males andfive females from each line were sampled and lung tissue fixed, sectioned and stained for microscopy. Lung sections were then scored for CVL incidence by two independent researchers. CVL data were analyzed based on age post-hatch, gender, <b>line,</b> <b>body</b> weight, lung volume and CVL location in the lung. Findings indicate the SUS line exhibited a generally higher CVL incidence than the RES line at all ages when reared at local altitude. Also the RES line had a greater lung volume to body weight ratio,throughout {{the latter part of}} the study (56 2 ̆ 6 ge days of age). This may suggest that improved lung volume to body weight ratio, may result in a decrease in CVL incidence. These broiler lines are potentially valuable in future animal model research...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Selection {{of poultry}} for fast growth rate is often {{accompanied}} by a reduction in specific immune responses or increased disease susceptibility. In this study, 17 -wk-old male turkeys from each of four closed genetic lines, a randombred control (RBC) line and its subline (F) selected for increased 16 -wk BW, and another RBC line and its subline (E) selected for increased egg production, were tested for in vivo response to toe web inoculation with phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P), in vitro response of lymphocytes in whole blood to PHA-P and concanavalin A (Con A), hemolytic complement activity, differential white blood cell counts, hematology, and serum chemistry values. Fifteen male turkeys from each of two commercial lines, Com A and Com B, were also tested. The large-bodied F line birds had a lower toe web response to PHA-P, lower lymphocyte counts, and lower relative spleen weights than their smaller parent <b>line.</b> <b>Body</b> weights, total erythrocyte counts, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and in vitro mitogenic response to PHA-P and Con A {{were higher in the}} F line birds. Line E had lower hemolytic complement levels, lower relative spleen and relative bursal weights, and a higher in vitro mitogenic response to PHA-P than its parent line. The Com B line had a lower toe web response to PHA-P, and lower serum levels of g-glutamyltransferase and bilirubin than Com A. Line Com B had higher total RBC counts and higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) than Com A. These results support the concept that some changes in the cell-mediated immune response, as well as other physiological changes that may potentially affect immune response, appear to accompany selection for faster growth...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} Chr 15 {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) Fob 3 b in lines of mice selected for high (Fat line) and low (Lean <b>line)</b> <b>body</b> fat content that represent an unique model of polygenic obesity. Here we genetically dissected the Fob 3 b interval by analyzing the phenotypes of eight overlapping congenic lines and four F[down] 2 congenic intercrosses and prioritized candidates by bioinformatics approaches. Analyses revealed that the Fob 3 b QTL consists {{of at least two}} separate linked QTLs Fob 3 b 1 and Fob 3 b 2. They exhibit additive inheritance and are linked in coupling with alleles originating from the Lean line, decreasing obesity-related traits. In further analyses, we focused on Fob 3 b 1 because it had a larger effect on obesity-related traits than Fob 3 b 2. e. g., the difference between homozygotes for adiposity index (ADI) percentage was 1. 22 and 0. 77 % for Fob 3 b 2, respectively. A set of bioinformatics tools was used to narrow down positional candidates from 85 to 4 high-priority Fob 3 b 1 candidates. A previous single Fob 3 b QTL was therefore resolved into another two closely linked QTLs, confirming the fractal nature of QTLs mapped at low resolution. The interval of the original Fob 3 b QTL was narrowed from 22. 39 to 4. 98 Mbp for Fob 3 b 1 and to 7. 68 Mbp for Fob 3 b 2, which excluded the previously assigned candidate squalene epoxidase (Sqle) as the causal gene because it maps proximal to refined Fob 3 b 1 and Fob 3 b 2 intervals. A high-resolution map along with prioritization of Fob 3 b 1 candidates by bioinformatics represents an important step foward to final identification of the Chr 15 obesity QTL...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: OJUS Medical Institute in {{collaboration}} with Women & Child development department of Nashik District, Maharashtra conducted a target oriented pilot project study to see the improvement in body weight gain of SAM children, supplemented with nutritionally enriched diet and micronutrients. The Egg-DOT project is a target vertical intervention study that involved both Anganwadi workers and Community health workers to bring a fruitful result by working hand-in-hand. Rationale: ICDS {{is one of the}} best supplementary nutrition programs to address and eliminate malnutrition from the country. To make it more comprehensive and result oriented the pilot project study is formulated and executed to see if the addition in existing system could eradicate malnutrition in an effective manner and strengthen the Govt. health machinery. Objective: The study aimed at working along with the Govt. to reduce severity of malnutrition. It shouted for a healthy public-private relationship to bring optimum result from the existing Govt. project in reducing burden of malnutrition, spreading health education and behavioural modification in the community members by adopting a systematic micronutrient-diet-health education  intervention strategy. Materials & methods: Along with existing nutritional intervention, a small modification in diet is introduced to fulfill the deficit of 300 Kcal approximately. Good quality fat and protein are added to the Anganwadi meal with daily micronutrient supplementation. The supplementation is continued for 30 days in 25 SAM children of 3 to 5 years. The baseline and end <b>line</b> <b>body</b> weight measurements are taken and compared to see the improvement. Result: After 30 days of intervention the supplemented SAM children showed statistically significant increased body weight (P< 0. 01) with an overall healthy nutritional status. Conclusion: The study showed that public-private collaborative systematic strategy with proper monitoring and evaluation can actually eliminate malnutrition in an effective manner by improving linear growth of the SAM children. </p...|$|E
