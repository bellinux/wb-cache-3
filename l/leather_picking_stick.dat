40|$|Clopidogrel Bisulphate is an oral, thienopyridine class {{antiplatelet}} agent used {{to inhibit}} blood clots in coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Immediate release tablet of clopidogrel bisulphate (form II) was prepared by using direct compression technique. Clopidogrel Bisulphate is very hygroscopic and show rapid degradation when processed with alkali salt as Mg++, Ca++ etc <b>picking,</b> <b>sticking,</b> or {{other kind of}} surface irregularities are other processing problems associated with it so, selection of excipients were done for preparation of stable dosage form which was free from any surface irregularities.

50|$|The {{thread that}} is woven through the warp {{is called the}} weft. The weft is {{threaded}} through the warp using a shuttle. The original hand-loom was limited in width by the weaver's reach, {{because of the need}} to throw the shuttle from hand to hand. The invention of the flying shuttle with its fly cord and <b>picking</b> <b>sticks</b> enabled the weaver to pass the shuttle from a box at either side of the loom with one hand, and across a greater width. The invention of the drop box allowed a weaver to use multiple shuttles to carry different wefts.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the past}} few days, Team Claw have been working well as a team and have been winning the recent challenges. But the Island became restless and decided to shock them. When Millie woke up, she found a message in a skull on the ground telling {{her to go to}} the <b>picking</b> <b>sticks.</b> She went up and {{selected}} one of the bamboo poles. She snapped it open and got a message. The message read, [...] "You are mine.". She screamed and was captured in the Island's clutches. Millie {{was going to be the}} prize for whoever won The Eliminator.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the song is an {{instrumental}} classical guitar solo. Interestingly, it is not widely known who played it: In several interviews, David Gilmour has said that he tried to perform it, and was not satisfied with the final result ("I could play it with a <b>leather</b> <b>pick</b> but couldn't play it properly fingerstyle"). Accordingly, session musician Joe DiBlasi was brought in by Michael Kamen to play {{with the rest of the}} orchestra. He was ultimately wrongly credited as [...] "Ron DiBlasi" [...] on the album sleeve because Roger Waters only remembered that it was a three-letter name; Ron was the closest name he could remember to Joe when creating the record.|$|R

25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to throw back the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver jerked the two hammers or pickers with a <b>picking</b> <b>stick</b> held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.|$|R

50|$|Hand weavers {{could only}} weave a cloth {{as wide as}} their armspan. If cloth needed to be wider, two people would do the task (often {{this would be an}} adult with a child). John Kay (1704-1779) {{patented}} the flying shuttle in 1733. The weaver held a <b>picking</b> <b>stick</b> that was attached by cords to a device {{at both ends of the}} shed. With a flick of the wrist, one cord was pulled and the shuttle was propelled through the shed to the other end with considerable force, speed and efficiency. A flick in the opposite direction and the shuttle was propelled back. A single weaver had control of this motion but the flying shuttle could weave much wider fabric than an armâ€™s length at much greater speeds than had been achieved with the hand thrown shuttle.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} boys gather around a tree. A circle with a {{diameter}} of 2 1/2 feet is drawn. A short stick {{is placed in the}} circle. One boy is selected to <b>pick</b> the <b>stick</b> and throw it as far possible, by swinging it under his leg. Another boy is selected to collect the stick during which time all the boys run up the tree. The boy who has collected the stick places it in the circle. The other boys try to get the stick before being caught by the boy who placed it there. If the boy who placed the stick tags another player before anyone <b>picks</b> up the <b>stick,</b> the boy who has been tagged is the one who has to stay on the ground and try to tag another player. If a player <b>picks</b> up the <b>stick</b> before the original player on the ground who collected the stick tags another, the game ends and a new game start but the original player has to tag another player.|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{of sound}} from vibrating cylindrical beams is analyzed {{based on the}} frequency of the beam vibrations and the physical characteristics of the beam and its surroundings. A statistical analysis of random beam vibrations allows this result to be independent of the boundary conditions at the ends of the beam. The acoustic power radiated by the beam can be determined from a knowledge of the frequency band vibration data without a knowledge of the individual modal vibration amplitudes. A practical example of the usefulness of this technique is provided by the application of the theoretical calculations to the prediction of the octave band acoustic power output of the <b>picking</b> <b>sticks</b> of an automatic textile loom. Calculations are made of the expected octave band sound pressure levels based on measured acceleration data. These theoretical levels are subsequently compared with actual sound pressure level measurements of loom noise...|$|R

KRS released <b>Pick</b> Up <b>Sticks</b> on June 5, 2007. Both full-length albums were recorded by Colin Stewart at the Hive, in Burnaby, BC. The self-titled EP was recorded by Jesse Gander, also at the Hive.|$|R
50|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, weaving was {{a manual}} craft and wool was the {{principal}} staple. In the great wool districts a form of factory system had been introduced but in the uplands weavers worked from home on a putting-out system. The wooden looms of that time might be broad or narrow; broad looms were those too wide for the weaver to pass the shuttle through the shed, so that the weaver needed an expensive assistant (often an apprentice). This ceased to be necessary after John Kay invented the flying shuttle in 1733. The shuttle and the <b>picking</b> <b>stick</b> sped up the process of weaving. There was thus a shortage of thread or a surplus of weaving capacity. The opening of the Bridgewater Canal in June 1761 allowed cotton to be brought into Manchester, an area rich in fast flowing streams {{that could be used}} to power machinery. Spinning was the first to be mechanised (spinning jenny, spinning mule), and this led to limitless thread for the weaver.|$|R

50|$|Church {{security}} guard (and Stanford Police officer) Steve Crawford found Arlis Perry's body around 5:45 a.m. October 13th, in the church's east transept, near the altar. She was found face-up; an ice <b>pick</b> was <b>sticking</b> {{out of the}} back of her head. There were also signs of strangulation. Police noted Perry was naked from the waist down. A three-foot-long altar candle was in her vagina, and another between her breasts.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: By using five {{different}} sieve sizes of ascorbic acid granules, affects of granule sizes on tablet properties, i. e. tablet weight and hardness {{have been studied}} with standard methods. Affects of lubricant types and concentrations on tablet properties, i. e. tablet hardness and disintegration time have also been studied by using magnesium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate as the lubricants for producing tablets from mixed sizes granules of ascorbic acid. Moreover, affects of high, moderate or medium and low compression forces on tablet hardness and disintegration time have been studied by using the mixed sizes granules of ascorbic acid. The result reveals that medium sized granules are better than smaller or larger granules to produce tablets within the specificity. Tablet weight variation has been found as higher during the production of tablets from smaller or larger granules. Production of tablets without lubricants has been complicated due to the difficulties in tablet ejection, resulting in <b>picking,</b> <b>sticking,</b> capping and cracking of tablets, higher tablet hardness and lower disintegration time. With increasing concentration o...|$|R
