5|$|The canal {{passes through}} a region which is largely rural, much of which is drained artificially. For most of its length, it is flanked by the North Soak Drain and the South Soak Drain, because it {{disrupted}} the established drainage scheme. Thorne Moors <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and Hatfield Chase lies to the south. Until its demise in 1966, the canal was crossed by the Axholme Joint Railway at Ealand. The swing bridge was retained for several years after closure, so that stators from the nearby Keadby Power Station could be taken away for repairs, as there were no road bridges which could support the weight.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, the {{men from}} Palembang <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police, leading to Noesa Brama's arrest for planning a rebellion; the men then persuade Retna Sari and her mother to follow them to Sumatra. Learning of this, Moelia arranges for Noesa Brama's release. The priest returns home to find that {{his wife and daughter}} have gone– seemingly willingly– with {{the men from}} Palembang, while Moelia takes a steamboat and chases the kidnappers.

5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} includes residential neighborhoods, agriculture, the airport, open spaces, 54schools, interstate highways, railways, commercial businesses, {{and heavy}} and light industry.

He rushes to confront Fat Tony at the bar. When the police burst in, Fat Tony blames Principal Skinner's disappearance on Bart, who is put on trial. During the trial, Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court, saying that Bart is Principal Skinner's murderer {{and the leader of}} the Springfield Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right of the production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly {{to the left of the}} curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} {{an area of}} 489 km2, making it the tenth largest island in Norway.

Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and east between Skye and the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Excluding Kingston upon Hull {{there are}} several areas of {{settlement}} in the East Riding, each giving rise to distinctive types of small to medium-sized towns and villages.
