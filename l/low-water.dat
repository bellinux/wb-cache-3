30|$|We {{found that}} reduced {{photosynthetic}} rate, transpiration rate and increased water-use efficiency were physiological {{responses of the}} four species to drought, and the responses varied among the species. All larch seedlings appeared no leaf shedding, survived through the drought treatment and showed a longer duration and high tolerance to drought. In <b>low-watered</b> conditions, survival rate, biomass, shoot height, root collar diameter, total leaf area, total root area and chlorophyll concentration of birch seedlings were significantly decreased. The response of seedlings to water deficits also differed according to the seed origins. Xeric origin of Prince Rupprecht’s larch was more affected than mesic origin of eastern larch, mainly because Prince Rupprecht’s larch originated in a narrower range of mountainous regions, resulting in lower adaptation of this species to water deficits, whereas eastern larch was distributed widely along coastal regions, contributing to higher phenotypic plasticity to variable soil conditions. Similarly, higher plasticity of paper birch {{may be responsible for}} its better performance in the <b>low-watered</b> treatment than white birch.|$|R

30|$|The four indexes {{of biomass}} {{allocation}} calculated were all significantly different between species (P[*]<[*] 0.01, Table  2). Biomass allocation of seedlings differed {{between the two}} water treatments, with root biomass ratio and root-to-shoot ratio being significantly different (P[*]<[*] 0.05, Table  2). In the <b>low-watered</b> treatment, root biomass allocation of Prince Rupprecht’s larch seedlings increased from 24.2 to 27.5 %, and eastern larch increased from 21.1 to 23.6 %. Root biomass ratio of Prince Rupprecht’s larch and eastern larch seedlings was increased by 13.7 and 12.1 %, respectively. These increases corresponded to decreased allocation to the leaves. Leaf biomass allocation of Prince Rupprecht’s larch reduced from 50.4 to 48.0 % and eastern larch reduced from 51.0 to 49.6 %. While the two birch species responded differently, both increased leaf biomass allocation, from 54.0 to 59.0 % for white birch and from 58.2 to 60.1 % for paper birch, but with a little change of root biomass allocation. Root-to-shoot ratio of Prince Rupprecht’s larch and eastern larch was increased by 21.9 and 14.8 %, respectively; that of two birch species changed slightly. These results might indicate that both of larch species allocated more biomass in root than broad-leaved species in <b>low-watered</b> conditions.|$|R

30|$|We {{conducted}} a controlled experiment {{to evaluate the}} responses of the species origins and species traits to water deficit in a greenhouse at Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario. In late October 2013, seeds were soaked for 48  h and sown in 50  cm[*]×[*] 25  cm[*]×[*] 5  cm bedding trays, filled with peat moss and vermiculite (3 : 1 by volume). Most seedlings emerged about 15 – 20  days later. In December, seedlings were transplanted in 12  cm[*]×[*] 12  cm[*]×[*] 15  cm containers, uniformly filled with an equal weight of above growing medium. On 1 January 2014, healthy 6 -week-old seedlings of similar sizes were randomly selected for the experiment. We used a completely randomised design with four different species and two moisture regimes ending up with eight experimental treatments. We had 30 replicates (experimental units) for each species and water regime combination. Half of the seedlings of each species were assigned to a well-watered treatment (WW) and the other half to a <b>low-watered</b> treatment (LW). All the seedlings were watered with tap water using a 150 mL beaker to allow the water to permeate into peat moss slowly and thus minimising gravimetric water loss. Well-watered seedlings were watered every 3  days to container capacity, the actual water content (AWC, %) of the substrate was restored to 75 % of the water holding capacity (WHC, %) (Fini et al. 2013), whereas <b>low-watered</b> seedlings were watered every 6  days to keep AWC near 35 % WHC {{until the end of the}} drying cycle (Wu et al. 2010; Ambebe and Dang 2010). During the experiment, relative humidity was approximately 50 % and temperature fluctuated from 20  °C (night) to 25  °C (day). Supplemental light was provided to maintain photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) above the seedlings at 1000  μmol m− 2  s− 1. Fifty millilitres of mixed nutrient solution (N:P:K, 15 : 15 : 10) at a concentration of 5  g L− 1 was added to the water once every 2  weeks. The containers were randomly moved periodically to reduce edge effects.|$|R
30|$|Seedlings showed varied {{responses}} to water deficit {{according to the}} species origins and the species traits. Birch seedlings are more sensitive to water deficit than larch. In <b>low-watered</b> condition, no mortality is occurred in larch seedlings, whereas survival rate of birch seedlings is reduced by 35.4 %. Biomass, shoot height, root collar diameter, total leaf area, total root area, and chlorophyll concentration of two birch species were all significantly decreased. Contrary to common opinion, species pairs of xeric origins are more affected by water deficit than those of mesic origins, probably because the narrower range in mountainous regions of Prince Rupprecht’s larch results in lower adaptation to water deficits, while larger distribution along coastal regions of eastern larch contributes to its higher phenotypic plasticity of variable soil conditions. Better performance of paper birch might also {{be a result of}} higher adaptation due to its larger range than white birch. That is, plasticity or adaptation of seedlings outweighs seed origins in determining their drought responses.|$|R

40|$|To {{test whether}} {{the impact of}} an enriched-CO 2 {{environment}} on the growth and biomass allocation of first-season Quercus suber L. seedlings can modify the drought response under shade or sun conditions, seedlings were grown in pots at two CO 2 concentrations x two watering regimes x two irradiances. Compared to CO 2, light and water treatment had greater effects on all morphological traits measured (height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, biomass fractions). Cork oak showed particularly large increases in biomass in response to elevated CO 2 under <b>low-watered</b> (W-) and high-illuminated conditions (L+). Allocation shifted from shoot to root under increasing irradiance (L+), but was not affected by CO 2. Changes in allocation related to water limitation were only modest, and changed over time. Relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were significantly greatest in the L+/W+ treatment for both CO 2 concentrations. Changes in RGR were mainly due to NAR. Growth responses to increased light, water or CO 2 were strongest with light, medium with water availability and smallest for CO 2, in terms of RGR. The rise in NAR for light and water treatments was counterbalanced by a decrease in SLA (specific leaf area) and LMF (leaf mass fraction). Results suggest that elevated CO 2 caused cork oak seedlings to improve their performance in dry and high light environments {{to a greater extent}} than in well-irrigated and low light ones, thus ameliorating the effects of soil water stress and high light loads on growth...|$|R

Significant effects of genotype and treatments on Δ of leaf (L) and grain (ΔG), BY, GY, HI, WUEB, WUEG, HD, NT, PH, NGPS, TGW and SL were observed. Genotype x treatment interaction {{had a significant effect}} on HI, PH, SL, TGW, HD and MD, but the effect was non-significant on other traits. In all these genotypes L and ΔG showed a variation of 1. 3 and 0. 91 ‰, respectively. All genotypes exhibited higher L than ΔG under different water regimes. Water stress reduced both L and ΔG and highly significant correlation (0. 946 **) was found between L and ΔG. GY showed a wide variation among these genotypes and water stress resulted in a marked decrease in GY. Genotype Sitta produced highest mean GY (4. 4 Mg ha- 1) with highest WUEG (16. 99 kg ha- 1 mm- 1) averaged across the treatment. GY showed significant positive correlations with L (r= 0. 779 *) and ΔG (r= 0. 753 *). GY was also strongly and positively correlated with HI (r= 0. 845 **), SL (r= 0. 779 **) and TGW (r= 0. 899 **). GY had a significant negative correlation with NT (r=- 0. 884 *) and HD (r=- 0. 708 *).

25|$|In 1915, {{ownership}} of the newly created land became an issue in a lawsuit.

The Virginia retrocession of 1846-1847 returned {{a portion of the}} District of Columbia on the Virginia site of the Potomac River to the state of Virginia. This left in doubt the exact position of the District's border with Virginia. In Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196 (1899), the Supreme Court of the United States held that land built in the Potomac River not only belonged to the District of Columbia but to the federal government (contrary to the claims of private landowners, who believed the property belonged to them). In Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1 (1910), the U.S. Supreme Court again affirmed that Maryland's southern border extended to the <b>low-water</b> mark {{on the far side of}} the Potomac River. The issue arose again in 1915, when the Washington Steel & Ordnance Company claimed it owned the newly created land in the Anacostia River created by the dredging operation. The District of Columbia Supreme Court held on December 29, 1915, that the federal government held title to the land. But this decision was overturned on technical grounds by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Washington Steel & Ordnance Company v. Martin, 45 App. 600 (1917). Nonetheless, in dicta in Washington Steel & Ordnance Company, the court of appeals made note of the Supreme Court's ruling in Morris v.
