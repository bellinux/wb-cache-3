To compare its effectiveness with conventional quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units, the microhardness of two composites (Z 100 and Tetric Ceram) that had been <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> by the PAC or QTH units, were compared according to the depth from the composite surface. In addition, linear polymerization shrinkage was compared using a custom-made linometer between composites which were <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> by PAC or QTH units. Measuring polymerization shrinkage for two resin composites (Z 100 and Tetric Ceram) was performed after polymerization with either QTH or PAC units. In the case of curing with the PAC unit, the composite was <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> with Apollo 95 E for two (Group 1), three (Group 2), six (Group 3) or 2 x 6 (Group 4) seconds. For <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> with the QTH unit, the composite was <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> for 60 seconds with Optilux 500 (Group 5). The linear polymerization shrinkage of composites was determined in the linometer. Two resin composites were used to measure microhardness. Two-mm thick samples were <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> for three seconds (Group 1), six seconds (Group 2) or 12 (2 x 6) seconds (Group 3) with Apollo 95 E or they were conventionally <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> with Optilux 500 for 30 seconds (Group 4) or 60 seconds (Group 5). For 3 mm thick samples, the composites were <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> for six seconds (Group 1), 12 (2 x 6) seconds (Group 2) or 18 (3 x 6) seconds (Group 3) with Apollo 95 E or they were conventionally <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> with Optilux 500 for 30 seconds (Group 4) or 60 seconds (Group 5). Twenty samples were assigned to each group. The microhardness of the upper and lower surfaces was measured with a Vickers hardness-measuring instrument under load. The difference in microhardness between the upper and lower surfaces in each group was analyzed by paired t-test. For the upper or lower surfaces, one-way ANOVA with Tukey was used. For Tetric Ceram, the amount of polymerization shrinkage was lower when cured with the Apollo 95 E for two or three seconds than when cured for six and 12 (2 x 6) seconds, or for 60 seconds with Optilux 500 (p< 0. 05). For Z 100, the amount of linear polymerization shrinkage was lower when cured with the Apollo 95 E for two, three and six seconds than for 12 (2 x 6) seconds with Apollo 95 E or for 60 seconds with the Optilux 500 (p< 0. 05). The results of the microhardness test indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in microhardness between groups for the upper surface. However, for the lower surface, when the composites were <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> with Apollo 95 E for three seconds as recommended by the manufacturer, microhardness of the lower surface was usually lower than that of the upper surface and did not cure sufficiently.

Study design: Seven cylindrical discs of each material (Grandio ®, Voco; Filtek ? Z 250, 3 M ESPE; Clearfil ? AP-X, Kuraray Co. Ltd.; Aelite ? LS, Bisco Inc. and Simile ®, Pentron) were cured. For curing, soft-up mode of quartz-tungsten-halogen, exponential mode of light emitting diode for 20 s, and ramp-curing mode of plasma arc <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units for 6 s were used. The curing tip distances were determined as 2 and 9 mm and controlled via the use of metal rings. After ageing the samples for 24 and 72 hours in Dulbecco?s Modified Eagle Medium/Ham?s F 12 (DMEM/F 12), cytotoxicity of the extracts to cultured fibroblasts (L 929) was measured by using MTT (tetrazolium salt 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The degree of cytotoxicity for each sample was determined according to the reference value represented by the cells in a pure culture medium.

The results demonstrate that Orthodontists knowledge about the properties of <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units that are important for orthodontic bonding and safety is low. Blue light hazard decreases as distance from the eye increases. Current <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units a-re unlikely to reach maximal daily exposure for blue light at normal working distances. • Orthodontic bracket materials do affect reflected light but the differences are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Continued use of current dental <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units does not lead to problems with colour discrimination. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the first <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> resin {{composites}} were developed. [...] This {{led to the}} development of the first <b>curing</b> <b>light.</b> The first dental <b>curing</b> <b>light,</b> called Nuva Light, was developed by Dentsply/Caulk in the 1970s. Nuva Light used ultraviolet <b>light</b> to <b>cure</b> resin composites; it was discontinued due to this requirement, as well as the fact that the shorter wavelengths of UV lighting used did not penetrate deeply enough into the resin to adequately cure it.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{ascertain}} {{whether or not}} the less porous surface associated with visible <b>light</b> <b>cure</b> appliances and the absence of free monomer had any measurable affect upon mucosal erythema, and to assess the durability of such appliances in a clinical context. DESIGN: A prospective randomized trial of visible <b>light</b> <b>cure</b> (Triad VLC) and autopolymerizing (Orthoresin) acrylic resin used as orthodontic base plate materials. SETTING: University Dental Hospital and School. SUBJECTS: Fifty subjects from a consecutively enrolled sample of 69 (19 drop outs) for removable appliance therapy (23 VLC, 27 AP). OUTCOME MEASURES: Erythema meter scores and appliance breakages. RESULTS: No statistical difference in mucosal erythema between the two materials was found. Fifty-two per cent of VLC appliances broke during a 6 -month period, as opposed to 7 per cent of AP appliances. CONCLUSIONS: VLC appears to have no clinically beneficial effect on the oral mucosa compared with AP. VLC appliances are currently not sufficiently durable to make them a viable alternative to AP appliances...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{orthodontic}} therapy,different {{materials are}} used and {{their presence in}} oral cavity may modify their properties. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the direct and indirect biocompatibility of three orthodontic composite resins on culture of human oral fibroblasts. Methods: This was an interventional experimental study. The biocompatibility of three orthodontic composite resins including two kinds of self cure composite resins(Unite, 3 M and Fantastic,Zar Dent) and one kind of <b>light</b> <b>cure</b> composite resin (Transbond, 3 M) were studied. After a releasing period of each material in the culture medium for 20 days, the viability of oral cultivated fibroblasts was compared to negative control(Teflon) and together with MTT assay(3 -(4, 5 dimethylthiazolyl- 2) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide). In order to evaluate the direct biocompatibility, after direct contacting of composite resins with cell culture,the viability of oral cells was evaluated with invert phase contrast microscope. Results: The results of MTT assay showed the biocompatibility of <b>light</b> <b>cure</b> composite (P. V= 0. 114) In comparison to control group. There were significant differences between biocompatibility of self cure composite resins and control group(P. V= 0. 029). On the other hand, significant statistical difference was not seen between biocompatibility of three composites. The results of direct method showed grade 0 for <b>light</b> <b>cure</b> composite, grade 1 for fantastic and grade 2 for unite(3 M). Conclusion: This study suggested that under these experimental conditions, chemically cured(no-mix) composite resins were more cytotoxic than light cured ones in both direct and indirect methods. Further investigations into the influence of the modes of polymerization and biologic effects of primers on cytotoxic effect and animal studies are warranted to verify its clinical implication...|$|E
30|$|The ARI {{score in}} all six groups {{was in the}} range of 3 to 4, {{indicating}} a minimum amount of adhesive that remained on the debonded tooth surface. When the etched surface was observed under SEM, group A and group B showed more roughened surface compared to group C. This increased bond surface area may be the reason for the increased bond strength of the <b>light</b> <b>cure</b> group.|$|E
40|$|The {{stresses}} generated {{during the}} <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> of resin composites {{and the effect}} of the stress relaxation after the polymerization has been investigated using a micro-strain technique. Three different classes of composites were tested: traditional composites, condensable composites and flow composites. For each material six samples were <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> with an halogen light at constant power (500 mW/ cm 2) and six samples were <b>light</b> <b>cured</b> in two steps with a plasma source light: the first step at medium power and the second at high power. A composite sample was positioned on an aluminum plate; a strain gauge positioned under the aluminum plate measured the deformation of the plate during <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> {{and the effect of}} strain relaxation in the following time. Maximum interfacial stress was evaluated by using mathematical model of simply supported beam. The strain and stress relaxation time was evaluated by long time strain measurement and model fitting. The experimental results show that the plasma cure induces a lower shrinkage stress than the halogen cure and the relaxation time of the condensable materials were shorter than the traditional ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units (LCU) and energy doses on the {{chemical}} and physical properties of a dental composite were investigated. Methods: The effects on {{the chemical and}} physical properties of a bisphenol A diglycidylether methacrylate (Bis-GMA) based dental restorative material were evaluated through photospectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry, and mechanical measurements. Results: The <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> conditions associated with direct and indirect restorations were replicated in vitro using optical investigation techniques. A slight attenuation resulted independently of the LCU and a strong attenuation was measured for the cement luting a thick inlay, {{as well as for}} the deepest layer of a composite filling increment. Calorimetric measurements indicated that the curing degree is very sensitive to the light energy dose rather than to the LCU. Mechanical testing showed a transient phase during which properties increased. The delay of the composite in reaching adequate properties is strongly dependent on the energy dose. Conclusions: It is recommended that composites subject to unfavorable <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> conditions undergo a prolonged <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> process...|$|R
40|$|There {{exists a}} {{constant}} {{need for a}} dental <b>curing</b> <b>light</b> that works reliably and conveniently in the general practitioner's office {{and can be used}} effectively for all the different curing procedures. Due to the need for improved physical properties of resin based composites (RBCs) and less stress at the marginal interface, <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units (LCUs) experienced significant advances in the past years. The dental industry has focused on reducing the curing time by developing higher intensity <b>curing</b> <b>lights</b> and by altering the resin composition and photo-initiator concentration. As a result the dentist can now choose from a vast variety of <b>curing</b> <b>lights,</b> <b>light</b> intensities and <b>curing</b> methods. This article presents a review of the advances in <b>light</b> <b>curing</b> units and curing techniques, as well as the scientific principles that guided past developments and that will influence future advances.
