5000|$|... #Caption: The {{bones and}} joints of the equine forelimb distal to the wrist (or carpus): The fetlock (metacarpophalangeal joint) is located between the cannon bone (third metacarpal) and the <b>long</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> (proximal phalanx). The pastern joint (proximal {{interphalangeal}} joint) is located between the <b>long</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> {{and the short}} pastern bone (middle phalanx). The coffin joint (distal interphalangeal joint) is located between the short pastern bone and the coffin bone(distal phalanx).|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{the bones}} of the joint will become involved, causing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and periostitis (new bone growth). The fibers of the joint capsule will also {{increase}} in size. The <b>long</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> may also eventually chip at its front edge, which will leave bone fragments in the joint.|$|E
50|$|Many {{theories}} arose as to {{the cause}} of the accident, though none have been confirmed. Barbaro broke his right hind leg in more than 20 places: a broken cannon bone above the pastern, a broken sesamoid bone behind the fetlock and a broken <b>long</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> below the fetlock. The fetlock joint was dislocated, and his foot was left dangling loosely. Veteran jockey Edgar Prado immediately pulled Barbaro up, and brought him to a gentle stop. He dismounted and leaned his shoulder into the horse's shoulder to support Barbaro until track attendants could arrive. Bernardini {{went on to win the}} race.|$|E
2500|$|Ringbone can be {{classified}} by its location, with [...] "high ringbone" [...] occurring on {{the lower part of}} the large <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> or the upper part of the small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> [...] "Low ringbone" [...] occurs on {{the lower part of the}} small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> or the upper part of the coffin bone. High ringbone is easier seen than low ringbone, as low ringbone occurs in the hoof of the horse. However, low ringbone may be seen if it becomes serious, as it creates a bony bump on the coronet of the horse.|$|R
5000|$|Distal sesamoidean ligaments: {{run from}} the sesamoid bones to the two <b>pastern</b> <b>bones.</b> Important in the stay apparatus.|$|R

5000|$|The pastern {{is a part}} of the leg of a horse {{between the}} fetlock and the top of the hoof. It {{incorporates}} the <b>long</b> <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> (proximal phalanx) and the short pastern bone (middle phalanx), which are held together by two sets of paired ligaments to form the pastern joint (proximal interphalangeal joint). Anatomically homologous to the two largest bones found in the human finger, the pastern was famously mis-defined by Samuel Johnson in his dictionary as [...] "the knee of a horse". When a lady asked Johnson how he came to do so, he gave the much-quoted reply: [...] "Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance." ...|$|E
50|$|JJ Babu was {{destroyed}} in April 1989 {{at the age of}} 15, after he fractured a <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> at the Fair Hill Horse Trials.|$|R
25|$|Trauma to the {{periosteum}} {{can cause}} bone growth on the <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> However, {{this is usually}} not progressive unless nearby soft tissue was also harmed and thus the joint instability was affected.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspensory}} apparatus, {{including the}} superficial and deep digital flexor tendons {{along with the}} proximal and distal check ligaments. [...] The distal sesamoidean ligaments run from the sesamoid bones to the two <b>pastern</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{delay time}} to get the feet off the ground to accelerate, and thus <b>long</b> <b>pasterns</b> make the horse poor for speed events.|$|R
50|$|Osselets usually {{occur in}} the front legs of the horse, because there is more strain and {{concussion}} on the fetlock there than in the hind legs. The arthritis will occur at the joint between the cannon <b>bone</b> and large <b>pastern</b> <b>bone,</b> {{at the front of}} the fetlock.|$|R
50|$|In horses, sesamoiditis is {{generally}} caused by excess {{stress on the}} fetlock joint. Conformation that promotes sesamoiditis include <b>long</b> <b>pasterns,</b> or horses with long toes and low heels.|$|R
5000|$|The second, {{probably}} derivative, form of {{the game}} was one of pure chance, the stones being thrown upon a table, either from the hand or from a cup, and {{the values of the}} sides upon which they fell were counted. The shape of the <b>pastern</b> <b>bones</b> used for astragaloi {{as well as for the}} tali of the Romans, with whom knucklebones was also popular, determined the manner of counting.The <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> of a sheep, goat, or calf has two rounded ends upon which it cannot stand and two broad and two narrow sides, one of each pair being concave and one convex. The convex narrow side, called chios or [...] "the dog", was counted as 1, the convex broad side as 3, the concave broad side as 4, and the concave narrow side as 6.|$|R
50|$|After his recovery, Mill Reef {{was trained}} for an autumn {{campaign}} {{and a return}} to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October. During a routine training gallop, however, he stumbled and shattered his foreleg. Charles Allen, a veterinary specialist, was flown in. Mill Reef's fracture was complicated. A triangularly shaped piece of bone {{about two and a half}} inches long was broken from the lower end of the cannon bone and was considerably displaced. The inner sesamoid bone was completely shattered, and the rim of the top of the main <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> was damaged. It seemed likely that the inner sesamoid bone was the first to break, with the result on the next step that the fetlock was not braced and the foot and the pastern were pointing outwards. The sheer pressure of the horse's weight caused the crumbling of the rim of the <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> and the breaking of the cannon bone.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Radiograph {{of a horse}} hoof showing {{rotation}} of the coffin bone and evidence of sinking, a condition often associated with laminitis. The annotation P2 stands for the middle phalanx, or <b>pastern</b> <b>bone,</b> and P3 denotes the distal phalanx, or coffin bone. The yellow lines mark {{the distance between the}} top and bottom part of the coffin bone relative to the hoof wall, showing the distal (bottom) of the coffin bone is rotated away from the hoof wall.|$|R
25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of the}} coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|R
50|$|Fetlock is {{the common}} name for the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints (MCPJ and MTPJ) of horses, large animals, and {{sometimes}} dogs. It is formed by the junction of the third metacarpal (forelimb) or metatarsal (hindlimb) bones (common name: the cannon bones) proximad and the proximal phalanx distad (common name: the <b>pastern</b> <b>bone).</b> Paired proximal sesamoid bones articulate with the palmar or plantar distal surface of the third metacarpal or metatarsal bones and are rigidly fixed to the proximo-palmar/-plantar edge of the proximal phalanx.|$|R

50|$|Retired to stud duty {{at first}} in Canada, {{where he had}} a major Impact on the Canadian Racing Industry, and later {{for many years in}} the State of Washington, Son of Briartic proved a good {{stallion}} who produced more than forty stakes winners. Pensioned at age twenty-two in 2001, following a fracture of a <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> he was humanely euthanized in 2003.

5000|$|Medical {{problems}} that are more common in horses with <b>long,</b> sloping <b>pasterns</b> include: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Long</b> <b>pasterns</b> {{have been}} favored {{because they can}} diffuse impact, giving a more {{comfortable}} ride. However, excess length puts extreme tension on the tendons and ligaments {{of the back of}} the leg, predisposing the horse to a bowed tendon or suspensory ligament injury. The suspensory is strained because fetlock is unable to straighten as horse loads the limb with weight.|$|R
50|$|The Equine Dynasplint {{systems are}} also being {{integrated}} into treatments for laxity and suspensory ligament injuries. Suspensory ligament injuries are common in athletic horses. The suspensory apparatus includes the suspensory ligament that extends down {{from the back of}} the knee to the fetlock joint, the two sesamoid bones at the back of the fetlock joint, and the various ligaments connecting these bones to each other and to the <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> These structures are crucial for supporting the horse's weight and acting as shock absorbers for the leg.|$|R

25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b> Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes.|$|R
50|$|Careful {{examination}} of the collateral cartilages by palpation can give a good indication that they are solid and bony rather than firm, springy cartilage. Usually, however, sidebone is found accidentally when the foot is radiographed, as sidebone has few outward signs in most cases. In mild cases, there are small areas of calcification; more advanced cases will have ossification of the entire cartilage. Rarely, severe lameness {{can be caused by}} fracture of an ossified cartilage, or by ossification which deviates enough to impinge on the short <b>pastern</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|R

A fracture to her <b>pastern</b> <b>bone</b> cut short her two-year-old season shortly before the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, a race she would have been favored to win. Dr. Bramlage inserted five screws in her left hind leg. Many people were sure her racing career was over.|$|R

50|$|<b>Long,</b> sloping <b>pasterns</b> are {{commonly}} seen in Thoroughbreds and Saddlebreds. A nicely sloped pastern {{increases the likelihood}} of a long career. It improves the animal's ability to travel on uneven terrain, helps it withstand the rigors of a competition or race, and makes the gait more comfortable for the rider. They are desired in a riding horse because they increase the shock-absorption ability of the leg, making the horse's gait smoother and more comfortable for the rider. However, this flexibility also increases the risk of certain connective tissue injuries that are not seen in horses with more upright pasterns. This is because many of the tendons and ligaments that go down the back of the leg continue under the back of the fetlock joint, and attach to either the <b>pastern</b> <b>bones</b> or the coffin bone. When the horse puts weight on his leg, the fetlock sinks closer to the ground, which is a needed response as it helps to absorb the shock of the footfall. However, when the <b>pasterns</b> are too <b>long</b> or sloping it does not support the fetlock enough, and the fetlock may hyper-extend, possibly {{to the point where the}} ergot touches the ground. This stresses the soft tissues that run under the fetlock because they are stretched longer. If stretched too much, they may tear or rupture.|$|R
