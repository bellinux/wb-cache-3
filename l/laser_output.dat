25|$|The {{technique}} {{is limited to}} imaging 1 to 2mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering {{is too small to}} be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained ‘non-contact’ or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also {{important to note that the}} <b>laser</b> <b>output</b> from the instruments is low – eye-safe near-infra-red light is used – and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.|$|E
25|$|Transmissivity is {{determined}} by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or <b>laser</b> <b>output</b> couplers, the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used must also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as zinc selenide or synthetic sapphire may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E
500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} produce a system that could be shipped in a conventional semi-trailer truck to the power plant, providing laser energy with 18% end-to-end efficiency, 15 {{times that of the}} NIF system. This reduces the required fusion gains into the 25 to 50 area, within the predicted values for NIF. The consensus was that this [...] "beam-in-a-box" [...] system could be built for 3 cents per Watt of <b>laser</b> <b>output,</b> and that would reduce to 0.7 cents/W in sustained production. This would mean that a complete LIFE plant would require about $600million worth of diodes alone, significant, but within the realm of economic possibility.|$|E

5000|$|The lasing {{threshold}} {{is the lowest}} excitation level at which a <b>laser's</b> <b>output</b> is dominated by stimulated emission rather than by spontaneous emission. Below the threshold, the <b>laser's</b> <b>output</b> power rises slowly with increasing excitation. Above threshold, the slope of power vs. excitation is orders of magnitude greater. The linewidth of the laser's emission also becomes orders of magnitude smaller above the threshold than it is below. Above the threshold, the laser {{is said to be}} lasing. The term [...] "lasing" [...] is a back formation from [...] "laser," [...] which is an acronym, not an agent noun.|$|R

50|$|The slope {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} property of a laser. It is obtained by plotting the <b>laser</b> <b>output</b> power against the input pump power. Above the lasing threshold, the resulting curve is usually close to a straight line. The slope {{efficiency is}} the slope of this line. Slope efficiency can similarly be {{defined in terms of}} output and input energies instead of powers. This makes it applicable to pulsed lasers.|$|E

50|$|If {{multimode}} fiber bandwidth is measured using {{a laser diode}} directly coupled to its input, the resulting measurement can vary {{by as much as}} an order of magnitude. This measurement variability is due to the combination of differences in <b>laser</b> <b>output</b> characteristics (emitted mode power distribution) and the differential mode delay of the fiber. Differential mode delay is the difference in the time delays amongst the fiber's propagating modes caused by imperfections or nonideality of the fiber refractive index profile.|$|E
