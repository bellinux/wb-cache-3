5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. <b>Like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot {{tolerate}} his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems {{to be only a}} nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

50|$|Many {{stories are}} satirical {{and take on}} the real world {{political}} divide between the Italian Roman Catholic Church and the Italian Communist Party, not to mention other worldly politics.

He joined the trade union movement, first with a union of {{unemployed}} workers and then with the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union in 1934. The union later joined the International Woodworkers of America (IWA) and he became a leader in the movement rising to the position of president of Local 1-80 in 1948.

25|$|John Duff {{was born}} in China in 1895. <b>Like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in the British Empire, Canadians were {{subjects}} of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff {{can be found on}} the Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for “Nationality”. In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Ferrari {{hosted a}} press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher {{admitted}} that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgement rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve. [...] "I am human <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> and unfortunately I made a mistake," [...] he said. [...] "I don't make many but I did this time." [...] In their respective books on Schumacher, James Allen and Swiss motorsports author Luc Domenjoz have both since expressed the view that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast, and without Schumacher turning into him would have overshot the turn.|$|E

My electricity, <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's</b> connected to the UK's national grid, still comes mainly from whatever the closest power station is ... So what is happening?

She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot.

500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic.

500|$|While his {{performance}} of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] was {{a tradition of}} his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, [...] "It's not the time or place to do it," [...] {{even though it was}} the number-one request of his audiences. Another was his naturalness; the man that viewers saw on television every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times {{as a result of the}} frustrations of daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 to 1963 said, [...] "Perry has a temper <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does. When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it." ...|$|E

50|$|To nourish {{his work}} with an {{experience}} of the world, {{the status of the}} reporter he had acquired enabled him to travel and to plunge into situations {{that would not have been}} open to him as an artist. It also offered him the opportunity of experimenting an economy based on demand, and as such, in opposition with anonymous exchange models which in the field of the arts are typically the ones of an economy based on offer. If, he thought, this mode of anonymous exchange was indeed historically necessary, since the autonomy and the freedom of artists had now been acquired, <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's,</b> they may no longer remain alone in responding to the creative needs of their society in a political economy of art that, furthermore, no longer responded to the demands of a democracy.|$|R
5000|$|While admirable that ABC {{has decided}} to feature a sitcom about a Chinese-American family on primetime television, there have been {{concerns}} about the subliminal messaging that {{the writing of the}} show produces. [...] "It means that there are real conversations being had about Asian American identity in addition to acknowledging the lack of inclusivity Asian Americans have had in the nation's cultural and entertainment dialogue." [...] Ester Suh, writing for the Huffington Post, felt that many characterizations in the show misrepresented the Asian-American experience, but acknowledged that [...] "our experience as Americans, <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else’s,</b> is varied, and to say that a single show can exemplify all our experiences, would be a disfavor. I see Fresh as a sound board for future shows with Asian American casts, helping make television a more diverse and inclusive cultural platform." ...|$|R
500|$|Forbidden Planet {{became an}} instant success, and roles in other MGM {{films such as}} Ransom! (1956), The Opposite Sex (1956) and Hot Summer Night (1957) followed. In 1957 he won the lead role {{opposite}} Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy Tammy and the Bachelor, which, as a Chicago Tribune critic wrote in 1998, made people consider Nielsen a dramatic actor and handsome romantic lead. However, dissatisfied with the films he was offered, calling the studios [...] "a Tiffany, which had forgotten how to make silver", Nielsen left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd got the role. After leaving the studios, Nielsen landed the lead role in the Disney miniseries The Swamp Fox, as American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. In a 1988 interview he reflected on the series, saying, [...] "That was a great experience, because the Disney people didn't do their shows <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> knocking out an episode a week. ... We only had to do an episode a month, and the budgets were extremely high for TV at that time. We had location shooting rather than cheap studio backdrops, and very authentic costumes."

500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E
