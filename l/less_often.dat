50|$|Caroline is {{attributed}} with discovering playwright Gotthold Ephraim <b>Lessing,</b> <b>often</b> considered by historians {{to be the}} first dramaturg. After meeting Caroline, his interest in theatre grew. He translated several French plays for her and eventually wrote his first play, The Young Scholar which Neuber produced for him in 1748.|$|R

5|$|A {{statement}} {{that can be}} made, however, is that most Americans will marry {{at least once in}} their lifetime with the first marriage most commonly ending in divorce. Today a little over half (52.3%) of US household include a married couple, showing a significant decrease since 1970 when 70.6% of households included a married couple. Current trends indicate that people in the US are marrying later and <b>less</b> <b>often</b> with higher divorce rates.|$|E
5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower maintenance costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much <b>less</b> <b>often</b> than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. <b>Less</b> <b>often,</b> they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E
50|$|The range has {{the highest}} summits in the Eastern Alps and is the most glaciated. In the {{transition}} zone between the East und West Alps its peaks clearly dominate the region to the west (Piz d'Err, Piz Roseg).

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} 2008–09 season, Henrik began {{to expand his}} {{skill-set}} by scoring more goals. His increased tendency to shoot was given an extra push when Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career early in the 2009–10 season, forcing Henrik to play without his brother and consequently pass <b>less</b> <b>often.</b> He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons {{of his career in}} 2008–09 and 2009–10, and increased his shot totals.|$|E
5|$|Deputies term {{of office}} was set for 6 years, with {{elections}} for the half of the deputies held every three years. For the first renewal election the to-be-replaced or reelected members had been chosen by lot.

5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and <b>less</b> <b>often</b> from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E

5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in {{the canopy of}} trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and <b>less</b> <b>often</b> from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and <b>less</b> <b>often</b> chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{are usually}} built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, {{although}} sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may {{be built in}} a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for compactness. Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but these records may reflect confusion with the Spanish sparrow. The average clutch contains three to five eggs. Both sexes incubate the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males incubate for shorter periods and <b>less</b> <b>often.</b> Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and brings it to their nestlings, he <b>less</b> <b>often</b> brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.|$|E

5|$|Stereotyped and {{repetitive}} motor {{behaviors are}} a core {{part of the}} diagnosis of AS and other ASDs. They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements. These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than tics, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and <b>less</b> <b>often</b> symmetrical.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. <b>Less</b> <b>often,</b> it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground.

5|$|The {{remainder}} of their diet {{is made up}} of plant material such as pollen, berries, nectar, from such species as grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) and scarlet gum (Eucalyptus phoenicea), and cultivated crops such as bananas or particularly grapes. In general, birds prefer feeding at cup-shaped sources such as flowers of the Darwin woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata), Darwin stringybark (E. tetrodonta) and long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia polycarpa), followed by brush-shaped inflorescences, such as banksias or melaleucas, gullet-shaped inflorescences such as grevilleas, with others <b>less</b> <b>often</b> picked.|$|E

5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (<b>less</b> <b>often)</b> as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but <b>less</b> <b>often</b> and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings <b>less</b> <b>often</b> {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
