25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for <b>lithographic</b> <b>printing,</b> intaglio printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|E
