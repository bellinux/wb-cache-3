It is the King's {{highway that}} we are in, and in His way it is that thou hast placed thy lions; but these women and these children, though weak, shall hold on their way in spite of thy lions. And with that he gave him again a downright blow, and brought him upon his knees. With this blow he also broke his helmet, and with the next he cut off an arm. Then did the giant roar so hideously, that his voice frighted the women, and yet they were {{glad to see him}} lie {{sprawling}} upon the ground. Now the lions were chained, and so of themselves could do nothing.[125] Wherefore, when old Grim, that intended to back them, was dead, Mr. Great-heart said to the Pilgrims, Come now, and follow me, and no hurt shall happen to you from the lions. They therefore went on, but the women trembled as they passed by them; the boys also looked as if they would die, but they all got by without further hurt.[126] Now then they were within sight of the Porter's Lodge, and they soon came up unto it; but they made the more haste after this to go thither, because it is dangerous travelling there in the night. So when they were come to the gate, the guide knocked, and the Porter cried, Who is there? But as soon as the guide had said, It is I, he knew his voice, and came down (for the guide had oft before that, come thither, as a conductor of pilgrims). When he was come down, he opened the gate, and seeing the guide standing just before it (for he saw not the women, for they were behind him), he said unto him, How now, Mr. Great-heart, what is your business here so <b>late</b> <b>tonight?</b> I have brought, said he, some pilgrims hither, where, by my Lord's commandment, they must lodge; I had been here some time ago, had I not been opposed by the giant that did use to back the lions; but I, after a long and tedious combat with him, have cut him off, and have brought the Pilgrims hither in safety.[127] ...|$|E

50|$|Asian Americans {{are often}} {{represented}} as affluent, well educated {{individuals with a}} high work ethic, and tend to feature more often in advertising that promotes technology and business than African American or Latino models. Asian Americans were shown in the workplace in 50% of the print ads that they featured in, whilst African Americans and Latinos were more diversely featured {{in a variety of}} activities such as outdoor and sporting pursuits or at leisure. Ads that Asian American men feature in often perpetuate a stereotype of success and sacrifice to achieve financial rewards, such Paek and Shah's (2003) example of a print ad, in which an Asian man talking to his wife tells her he will have to work <b>late</b> <b>tonight.</b> The ad suggests that the man is already at work and ready to make his company's goals a reality, whilst being prepared for his personal life to come as a secondary commitment. Many may argue that the stereotype of hard work and affluence may be a positive one and {{does not appear to be}} problematic. To be wealthy and successful is surely a benefit in American society, however passive viewing of television and print advertising goes a long way towards shaping viewers' perceptions of minorities, and this representation of Asian Americans in the media can be damaging in so far as presenting an inaccurate picture of Asia as a whole, and an incorrect defining point for each individual within that culture.|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] Friday {{afternoon}} 10 / 20 / 44 My dearest darling [...] Thought I’d start {{a letter}} to you during the children’s nap period, because I’ll be coming home <b>late</b> <b>tonight</b> 2 ̆ 6 I don’t {{know whether or not}} I’ll get around to writing you. Tomorrow I work from 8 - 12 [...] but that means I have to get up at 6 : 15 to make a 7 : 12 Rapid. Yep, it sure is hard to get around from where I reside. We’re not having a teachers’ meeting today after all, because we haven’t got a volunteer who can come in early enough in the aft. to be with the children during their rest hour. However, Mrs. Bennett 2 ̆ 6 I had a nice talk this a. m. ! Also, we’re {{going to try to make}} out a schedule for a month at the [sic] time [...] good idea, so then, I’ll have an idea on how to plan my time. Still feel pretty weak today from “the curse” [...] sure wish you could rub my tummy! Gosh hon [...] when I had a normal sex life, I don’t think I felt as sick, or, am I rationalizing!?! Gosh, I have the nicest thoughts sometimes. Today, as I was walking to get the Rapid, I kept seeing you at the breakf. table with me, 2 ̆ 6 then, we both went upstairs to the nursery so you could say “good by” before you went to work to your little son and daughter. Pleasant thoughts, en what? Mom just called me to tell me to call Amy Embry. Also, she said Sadie got a letter from you from England. As yet, however, I haven’t heard from you, but then, I’m looking forward to the aft. mail (at 4 : 30) to bring me mail from you. (At home 11 p. m.) Sweetheart [...] At 2 : 45 p. m. I felt a terrific “quake” 2 ̆ 6 when we turned the radio on, we learned that there was a fire at the E. A. Gas Co. When we looked out of the window, we could see the flames. To make the long, gruesome story short, it seems, so the rumor goes, that sabotage was working again. Anyhow, hundreds of people are injured or homeless, 2 ̆ 6 there are quite a number of dead. From E 40 Euclid-Lake Shore to E. 79 Euclid-Lake Shore, they have asked people to evacuate as the fire seems to be in the gas lines. Also, almost the whole N. E. section have [sic] been asked to turn off their gas. I worked <b>late</b> <b>tonight</b> as some of my kids turned out to be “evacuees” [...] one or two, I believe, are now homeless. Then I went to do my volunteer work at 71 st 2 ̆ 6 Hough. Well, we got little or nothing done in dramatics so we tried to keep the kids off the street, anyhow, by having social dancing. Then, we were more of a receiving station than anything else [...] directing people where to go for food, housing, etc. It is pathetic 2 ̆ 6 the poor, of course, bear the “blunt” [sic] of it. I am exhausted. Met Dad 2 ̆ 6 Mom at the Sovereign. (They were visiting [the] Weingartens whose gas is also off) 2 ̆ 6 they took me home. I am upset, dear! But I guess that’s life [...] 2 ̆ 6 life can be brutal! Called your Mom [...] she got panicky thinking I was in the critical area. Then, she asks me if she can help. Gosh, if she can’t control herself, how can she control others? Well, your folks got mail from you, too! Why not me? [...] But I’m sure I’ll hear tomorrow. Amy, also, had mail from Earl. She told Mom. As yet, however, I haven’t been able to contact her! Bubsie, I got good hrs. at work, I think. Every day 10 - 6, except Tues. 8 : 30 - 4 : 30 2 ̆ 6 Sat. 8 - 12 : 30. Not bad, eh what?
