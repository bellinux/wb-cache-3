They, however, usually give a too <b>low</b> <b>level</b> <b>picture</b> of the executed program. Opium, our extendable trace analyser for Prolog, is connected to a "standard" tracer. Opium is programmable and extendable. It provides a trace query language and abstract views of executions which {{solve the problems of}} low-level traces. Opium has shown its capabilities to build abstract tracers and automated debugging facilities. This article describes the trace query mechanism, from the model to its implementation. Characteristic examples are detailed. Extensions written so far on top of the trace query mechanism are listed. Two recent extensions are presented: the abstract tracers for the LO (Linear Objects) and the CHR (Constraint Handling Rules) languages. These two extensions were specied and implemented within a few days. They show how to use Opium for real applications...|$|R

This paper proposes a novel resynchronization method for the scalable video with combined temporal and quality (SNR) scalability.

A novel resynchronization method is proposed where joint group of <b>picture</b> (GOP) <b>level</b> and <b>picture</b> <b>level</b> insertion of resynchronization marker approach is applied to insert different amount of resynchronization markers in different enhancement layer units for reliable transmission of the video over error-prone channels.

This task is considerably more challenging than general front-view road detection, as the associated challenges widely range from <b>low</b> <b>picture</b> quality, fisheye distortion and large objects, to the ab-sence of useful priors such as vanishing points and road struc-ture. Regarding the challenges, we propose a feature that can simultaneously capture local appearance and context infor-mation. In addition, the task suffers from strong appearance variations such as shadows and ground markers. Therefore, we propose a novel conditional random field (CRF) model which includes hidden states indicating confident nodes and propagate their confidence to neighboring nodes. We show that our proposed feature and model can jointly achieve ro-bustness against large objects and shadows/markers, showing excellent detection performance under low quality inputs.

However, streaming video in wireless environments is often subject to frequent periods of rebuffering and characterized by <b>low</b> <b>picture</b> quality. In particular, achieving smooth and quality-adaptive streaming of live video poses a big challenge in mobile scenarios. Building on the observation that the subjective video experience on mobile devices decreases when quality changes are more frequent than every 1 to 2 seconds, we present a client-side scheduler that retrieves segments of several video encodings over heterogeneous network interfaces simultaneously. By extending the DAVVI streaming platform with support for multihoming, the proposed scheduler’s performance is experimentally evaluated. The results show that our scheduler reduces the video interruptions and achieves a higher and more stable average quality over multiple, truly heterogeneous wireless interfaces.
