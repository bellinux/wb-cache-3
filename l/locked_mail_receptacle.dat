2500|$|Since 1923, {{in order}} to promote uniformity, as well as the {{convenient}} and rapid delivery of the mail, the United States Post Office Department (later the USPS) has continued to retain authority to approve the size and other characteristics of all <b>mail</b> <b>receptacles,</b> whether mailboxes or mail slots, for use in delivery of the mails. The USPS continues to issue specifications for curbside mailbox construction for use by manufacturers. Approved mailboxes from the latter are always stamped [...] "U.S. Mail" [...] and [...] "Approved by the Postmaster General". These standards have resulted in limitations on product diversity and design, though new materials, shapes, and features have appeared in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Registered {{mail that}} would be carried in a mail pouch is mail that is within a certain length and width, {{regardless}} of thickness. Registered mail can be insured up to $25,000 for a certain premium fee. There is no limit {{on the value of}} an item sent in by registered mail. Registered mail is closely guarded and given maximum security like in handling with a <b>locked</b> <b>mail</b> pouch.|$|R
50|$|An {{analogy to}} public key {{encryption}} {{is that of a}} <b>locked</b> <b>mail</b> box with a mail slot. The mail slot is exposed and accessible to the public - its location (the street address) is, in essence, the public key. Anyone knowing the street address can go to the door and drop a written message through the slot. However, only the person who possesses the key can open the mailbox and read the message.|$|R

5000|$|Movement {{formation}} followed {{disagreement over}} {{support of the}} 2012 Belgrade Pride parade. Pirate Party leader Aleksandar Blagojević promoted support for the Pride Parade {{in the name of}} Pirate party, without consulting members, resulting in 6 out of 8, forum and Core team members voting against explicit support of Pride parade. Blagojević argued that the vote to not support the parade ran contrary to the party principles which included human rights (and including by he's own opinion same-sex marriages). Opinions escalated in sites takeovers, <b>locking</b> <b>mailing</b> lists and existence of 2 separate sites and web forums. Blagojević blocked access to site and mailing list, unformally expelling majority of the Core Team members, referring to Pirate Party members as (at he's opinion): [...] "conservative right-wingers" [...] and [...] "intolerant of minorities". Pirate movement showed their own explanation of events, regarding Blagojević for despotism, lies, threats and blocking and corrupting of the decision process.|$|R
50|$|Some {{directory}} operations (including unlink(2)) are not synchronous on ReiserFS, {{which can}} result in data corruption with applications relying heavily on file-based <b>locks</b> (such as <b>mail</b> transfer agents qmail and Postfix) if the machine halts before it has synchronized the disk.|$|R
50|$|Registered {{mail service}} {{is offered by}} the United States Postal Service as an extra service for First Class or Priority Mail shipments. Registered Mail {{provides}} end-to-end security in <b>locked</b> containers. Registered <b>Mail</b> custody records are maintained, but are not normally provided to the customer, unless a claim is filed.|$|R
50|$|A {{mail pouch}} or mailpouch is a {{container}} for mail, designed to transport first-class, registered mail, domestic mail and military mail. It {{is made of}} a stronger material (e.g., canvas) than mail sacks (e.g., plastic) and is designed to lock at the top with a mechanism system consisting of special closely spaced eyelets and a strong strap to secure the top where access into the bag is closed off and <b>locked,</b> where a <b>mail</b> sack does not have these features.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mail sack}} {{is not a}} locked bag since they need little security. In {{contrast}} to a similar mailbag [...] {{referred to as a}} mail pouch (for more sensitive mail such as personal letters and military mail) that employs a locking mechanism {{on the top of the}} bag. A mail pouch has special closely spaced eyelets and a strong strap to secure the top where access into the bag is closed off and <b>locked,</b> where a <b>mail</b> sack has none of these features.|$|R
40|$|Background: To update {{community-based}} prevalence {{values for}} Polymyalgia Rheumatic (PMR) and Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) using case record review supplemented by population survey and subsequent clinical review. Methods: Clinical {{data were obtained}} from case records of a large primary care practice in Norfolk, UK and reviewed for diagnoses of GCA and PMR. In addition postal survey was carried out to capture potentially undiagnosed cases within the practice population. Those screening positive for potential diagnoses of GCA and PMR were invited for clinical review. A cumulative prevalence estimate was subsequently calculated on those diagnosed within the GP practice and subsequently on those fulfilling the various published classification criteria sets. The date of the database <b>lock</b> and <b>mail</b> merge was March 2013. Results: Through detailed systematic review of 5, 159 GP case records, 21 patients had a recorded diagnosis of GCA and 117 had PMR. No new cases were identified among 2, 227 completed questionnaires returned from the population survey of a sample of 4, 728. The resulting cumulative prevalence estimate in those aged ≥ 55 years meeting the ACR classification criteria set for GCA was 0. 25 % (95 % CI 0. 11 % to 0. 39 %) and for five published criteria sets for PMR ranged from 0. 91 % to 1. 53 % (95 % CI ranges 0. 65 %, 1. 87 %). The prevalence of both conditions was higher in women than in men and in older age groups. Conclusion: This study provides the first UK prevalence estimate of GCA and PMR in over 30 years and {{is the first to}} apply classification criteria sets...|$|R
5000|$|Bernard Chanticleer (Peter Kastner), called [...] "Big Boy" [...] by his parents, is 19 {{but still}} {{lives with his}} overbearing, {{clinging}} mother (Geraldine Page) and his commanding, disapproving father (Rip Torn), who is Curator of Incunabula at the New York Public Library. Bernard also works as a low-level assistant at the library, where his father is constantly monitoring and admonishing him. His father decides it's time he grew up and {{moved out of the}} family home in Great Neck and into his own Manhattan apartment. His mother is not happy about letting him go, but acquiesces to her husband and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing (Julie Harris). Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room. Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks girls, especially young pretty girls, to which Bernard's mother responds that her son isn't interested in girls yet, but arranges that Miss Thing will spy on Bernard and report any [...] "female" [...] activity. Bernard's mother also constantly <b>mails</b> <b>locks</b> of her hair to Bernard at his new residence.|$|R
