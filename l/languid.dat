5|$|Before and After Science is {{the fifth}} studio album by British {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it was originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany helped with the album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and jagged to more <b>languid</b> and pastoral.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a <b>languid</b> fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|The introduction's {{keyboard}} fantasia gradually {{opens the}} band's <b>languid,</b> expansive interplay. The song's groove is established {{with the introduction}} of a bass guitar ostinato at 4:50. Rhythm and tenor guitars and a horn section are played in the next two minutes. During the bridge, Allen's drumming intensifies within the song's seven-minute mark, which leads to a fully developed Afrobeat section; Afrobeat is a type of loose funk music embellished with African syncopation, R-styled horn instrumentation, and improvisatory solos. Confusions extended mid-tempo section has complex arrangements of danceable grooves, multiple solos, and Allen's polyrhythms. In this section, Kuti plays tenor saxophone, which he had learned after the 's original tenor player, Igo Chico, left in 1973. The music is complemented by his outspoken call-and-response vocal passages. The song's final 10 minutes comprise raucous trumpet, tenor saxophone solos, and Kuti's lead vocals. Its closing section revisits the abstract interplay of the introduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{descriptions}} of the title character in Carmilla and of Lucy in Dracula are similar, and have become archetypes for {{the appearance of the}} waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being rosy-cheeked, slender, <b>languid,</b> and with large eyes, full lips, and soft voices. Additionally, both women sleepwalk.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} the Sages said that {{inspiration}} {{does not come}} to a prophet when the prophet is sad or <b>languid.</b> Thus Moses did not receive any revelation {{when he was in}} a state of depression that lasted from the murmurings of the Israelites upon the evil report of the spies until the death of the warriors of that generation.|$|E
25|$|Vettori's {{captaincy}} had a rocky start, {{losing a}} Test series in England first up. Vettori also attracted some {{criticism in the}} following ODI series when he engaged in angry shouting from the balcony at The Oval, regarding a controversial run out that had occurred. He then refused {{to shake hands with}} the England team after the match. This contrasted with Fleming's more <b>languid,</b> laid back style.|$|E
25|$|She {{began her}} maiden voyage to Miami that same year, amidst {{speculation}} about her {{future in the}} cruise industry. The France had been built as an ocean liner: for speed; long, narrow, with a deep draft, {{as well as an}} array of cabin shapes and sizes designed in a compact manner more for purpose travel than <b>languid</b> cruising. But the Norway proved popular, and made the notion of the ship being a destination in itself credible. Her size, passenger capacity, and amenities revolutionized the cruise industry and started a building frenzy as competitors began to order larger ships.|$|E
25|$|Alma-Tadema {{was among}} the most financially {{successful}} painters of the Victorian era, though never matching Edwin Henry Landseer. For over sixty years he gave his audience exactly what they wanted: distinctive, elaborate paintings of beautiful people in classical settings. His incredibly detailed reconstructions of ancient Rome, with <b>languid</b> men and women posed against white marble in dazzling sunlight provided his audience with a glimpse of a world of the kind they might one day construct for themselves at least in attitude if not in detail. As with other painters, the reproduction rights for prints were often worth more than the canvas, and a painting with its rights still attached may have been sold to Gambart for £10,000 in 1874; without rights it was sold again in 1903, when Alma-Tadema's prices were actually higher, for £2,625. Typical prices were between £2,000 and £3,000 in the 1880s, but at least three works sold for between £5,250 and £6,060 in the 1900s. Prices held well until the general collapse of Victorian prices in the early 1920s, when they fell to the hundreds, where they remained until the 1960s; by 1969 £4,600 had been reached again (the huge effect of inflation must of course be remembered for all these figures).|$|E
500|$|Despite his ability, Samaras has {{performed}} inconsistently throughout his career. His mazy runs often go nowhere and he frequently gets caught in possession when {{a pass to}} a team-mate is available. [...] His <b>languid</b> manner exacerbates supporters' frustrations and has often led to accusations of him being [...] "lazy".|$|E
500|$|With its chunky backbeat, gentle {{strings and}} funky guitar motif, 'Secret' is both <b>languid</b> and tense {{at the same}} time. The song has the air of quiet revelation and a {{relaxation}} of spirit. Madonna insisted later that the song wasn't just about love but also about spiritual self-empowerment. [...] brought out a new warm, soulful tone in her voice, and making her swoony humming sound a central feature of the track.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{criticism}} that Balan's character might evoke, Luthria clarified, [...] "I wanted Vidya to know that what she's doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner {{with a touch of}} class. What her character does, is not cheap." [...] As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's <b>languid</b> body language.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Andy Gill from The Independent criticized Scott's lyrics as [...] "a sticky {{puddle of}} self-regard" [...] and found its songs [...] "developed much beyond a <b>languid</b> souljazz vamp". Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan gave the album {{three out of}} five stars and called her [...] "trademark" [...] musical style [...] "warm and inviting, if rarely thrilling, neo-soul". Daryl Easlea of BBC Online wrote that it [...] "at times [...] veers towards self-indulgence, {{and some of its}} ideas are not fully {{followed}} through", but complimented its [...] "freewheeling vibe" [...] and called it [...] "a lovely, bittersweet album that celebrates the joy of life".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Experimental Jet Set, {{which is}} often {{described}} as difficult and claustrophobic, Washing Machine was considerably more open-ended and contains some of the band's longest songs. It was also the first Sonic Youth album on which Gordon almost exclusively played guitar instead of bass, resulting in a three-guitar and drums lineup. Trouser Press remarked that the album contains musical references to the Shangri-Las and the Byrds and described its style as [...] " [...] between trance-guitar experiments and more concise statements." [...] Entertainment Weekly described it thus: [...] "These songs unfold over even-tempered rhythms and guitars that linger rather than attack. A splatter of distortion may enter, but the effect is mostly <b>languid</b> and wonderfully hypnotic".|$|E
500|$|Shadows In the Night {{received}} favorable reviews, scoring 82 on {{the critical}} aggregator Metacritic, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and Dylan's singing, saying that the material had elicited his best vocal performances in recent years. Bill Prince in GQ commented: [...] "A performer who's had to hear his influence in virtually every white pop recording made since he debuted his own self-titled album back in 1962 imagines himself into the songs of his pre-rock'n'roll early youth." [...] In The Independent, Andy Gill wrote that the recordings [...] "have a lingering, <b>languid</b> charm, which... help to liberate the material from the rusting manacles of big-band and cabaret mannerisms." [...] The album debuted at {{number one in the}} UK Albums Chart in its first week of release.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of [...] "The Wave" [...] was generally positive. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly named {{it one of}} the best tracks on Happy to You, while Will Salmon of Clash and Amber Genuske of The Huffington Post called it a standout. Exclaim! Ashley Hampson deemed it [...] "incredibly catchy", writing that it [...] "capitalize on the falsetto musings of vocalist Andrew Wyatt". Andy Baber of musicOMH described the track as [...] "much more like the Miike Snow that many came to know and love". The writer praised the piano and marching drums for [...] "giving the song a sense of direction that the opener lacked". Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, commented that [...] "a martial beat, contrastingly <b>languid</b> vocals and a snaggy hookline give 'The Wave' a toothsome kick", and Slant Magazine's Kevin Liedel wrote that the beat [...] "succeeds".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot in bright, primary colors rather than the {{black-and-white}} of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual <b>languid</b> pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as [...] "intuitive". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of Reverse Shot as [...] "giving {{the impression of a}} failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis’s glamor and try it on for size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} OK Computer {{coincided with the}} decline of Britpop. Through OK Computers influence, the {{dominant}} UK guitar pop shifted toward an approximation of [...] "Radiohead's paranoid but confessional, slurry but catchy" [...] approach. Many newer British acts adopted similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements; for example, the post-Britpop band Travis worked with Godrich to create the <b>languid</b> pop texture of The Man Who, which became the fourth best-selling album of 1999 in the UK. Some in the British press accused Travis of appropriating Radiohead's sound. Steven Hyden of AV Club said that by 1998, starting with The Man Who, [...] "what Radiohead had created in OK Computer had already grown {{much bigger than the}} band," [...] and that the album went on to influence [...] "a wave of British-rock balladeers that reached its zenith in the '00s".|$|E
500|$|Not all {{critics were}} as {{enthusiastic}} in their reviews of [...] "The Long Bright Dark". Hale, despite commending the flashback narrative, believed the dialogue devolved into [...] "a <b>languid</b> character study and {{a vehicle for}} long-winded exchanges about religion and responsibility that are writerly in the worst way." [...] Chris Cabin from Slant Magazine agreed that the writing too readily [...] "defers to an earnest, rote view of bad religion", but wrote that Pizzolatto and Fukunaga [...] "smartly embrace the pulpiness of their material". Hank Stuever, writing for The Washington Post, observed [...] "mumbly, bloodshot fatigue" [...] in the story, and felt the series fell short of its ambitions. [...] "In its better moments, True Detective feels like a fever dream, but mostly it’s just groggy," [...] Stuever concluded. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker was especially critical of the show and claimed it relished in [...] "macho nonsense".|$|E
500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Babyface, {{and is a}} midtempo pop ballad with Japanese musical influences, like that of Kyu Sakamoto's 1961 song, [...] "Sukiyaki". It begins with sounds of oriental pentatonic strings, giving the impression of Chinese or Japanese opera. The verses consist of a descending chord sequence, containing twists at the end. Madonna's vocals are in a [...] "sleepy <b>languid</b> mood" [...] that is characteristic of the songs from Bedtime Stories. The lyrics during the chorus talk about Madonna saying goodbye to a lover, who had taken her for granted. The title plays upon the verse in the song [...] "all {{the world is a}} stage and everyone has their part", a reference to a line by William Shakespeare in his play As You Like It, [...] "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women mere players".|$|E
500|$|Fears {{that the}} contest {{would be a}} {{mismatch}} proved to be unfounded, with Leicester playing in a more attacking manner than anticipated. The Observers Hugh McIvanney wrote: [...] "Suggestions that Leicester would attempt to minimise the discrepancy in talents by a concentration on defensive spoiling were exposed as unjust…offering the deceptively <b>languid</b> dribbles of Clarke, the thoughtful passes of Roberts and Gibson and the thrustful running of Lochhead as proof that the skills were not all on one side." [...] Neil Young and Tony Coleman both had early scoring chances for Manchester City, but missed the target. For Leicester City, a dribbling run by Clarke ended in a shot that was saved by Dowd, and a mishit shot by Len Glover was cleared off the goal-line by a defender. Manchester City scored midway through the first half. Mike Summerbee crossed the ball from wide on the right, and Young hit a left footed shot high into Peter Shilton's net. Few further chances occurred in the first half.|$|E
500|$|... "Madness" [...] is an {{electronic}} rock, synthpop, soft rock, and R song. According to NME, [...] "Madness" [...] draws influences from Queen's [...] "I Want to Break Free", George Michael's [...] "Faith" [...] and some instrumental elements {{of his other}} hit [...] "I Want Your Sex". During a preview of The 2nd Law on French site Jeuxactu, the song was said to resemble Depeche Mode and described as [...] "calm, <b>languid</b> and sweet". Matthew Bellamy stated that the song started as a personal reflection after a fight with his girlfriend Kate Hudson, and how, after {{she had gone to}} her mother's house, he began to realise [...] "yeah, she was right, wasn't she?" [...] In a separate interview, Bellamy stated the song was the band's attempt to strip down the sound of the album, and that the song has its roots in 12 bar blues with gospel, soul and R influences. He went on to conclude that, [...] "It's the song I'm probably most proud of on the album for sure." ...|$|E
500|$|Morris' {{next four}} singles [...] "Only We Can Hear", [...] "Rhythm and Flow", [...] "In Too Deep", and [...] "What Do I Do Now", were {{released}} over eighteen months, from mid-1994 to early 1996. Salvation Jane {{was released in}} July 1995, nearly four years after her last album, and featured some of her strongest vocal work, including the <b>languid</b> [...] "Rhythm and Flow," [...] with its Aboriginal influences. Issued on the rooArt label, it was produced by Andrew Farriss and Moffatt, together with Electric Hippies' duo Steve Balbi and Justin Stanley. The album featured songs from a song writing retreat held at Miles Copeland's castle in Bordeaux, France. Here, Morris co-wrote a number of songs with other international songwriters. Also in 1995, Morris became a non-executive writer director on the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Board and as of 2009 {{is still on the}} Board. Morris made an appearance in the television drama, Water Rats, in 1997 she continued her gigs, worked for environmental causes and maintained her family life.|$|E
500|$|While not commercially released, [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] {{has been}} lauded with a {{widespread}} acclaim, {{becoming one of}} the album's best-received tracks, with music critics complimenting its instrumentation and vocals. Rolling Stone stated that, [...] "Afanasieff cowrote his one of strongest tunes yet, the sweet, bouncy 'Underneath the Stars.'" [...] Chris Nickson, author of Mariah Carey Revisited: Her Story (1998), said the song was as [...] "strong as any slow jam released in the nineties, and one that would find a lot of flavor late at night with dancers." [...] Chris Dickinson from St. Louis Post-Dispatch called the song one of Carey's best compositions, and wrote [...] "it easily evokes a <b>languid</b> dreamy sensuality with its throbbing bass-line and synthetic record scratches." [...] Writer and journalist Christopher John Farley from Time described [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] as [...] "cool and blissfully nostalgic," [...] while Cheo H. Coker called it [...] "dynamic but subtle." [...] The song received a limited number of pressings in the United States, where it charted weakly on the Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at number sixty-nine.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "Love On Top" [...] is mainly {{written in the}} key of C major with a tempo of 94 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of A♭3 to the high note of B5. [...] "Love on Top" [...] is set as [...] "both a sweet love song and an expression of girl power" [...] as stated by Georgette Cline of AOL Music. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club and David Amidon of PopMatters noted that [...] "Love on Top" [...] features [...] "mature lyrics" [...] alongside Beyoncé [...] "sounding vocally giddy and aggressive while portraying the message." [...] Lyrically, the song finds Beyoncé as the female protagonist expressing the happiness she feels to have her love interest in her life. [...] "The <b>languid,</b> synth-soul smoocher allows for enjoyably euphoric tone" [...] before she chimes in with [...] "Bring the beat in!", introducing [...] "a mid-album interlude of mid-80s pop", as stated by Andy Gill of The Independent as well as Hamish MacBain of NME.|$|E
500|$|This {{rendition}} of [...] "Carolina in My Mind" [...] had a slower tempo than the original, and accompanying Taylor on acoustic guitar were experienced LA session musicians Dan Dugmore on pedal steel guitar (highlighted in the descending note sequences at the song's conclusion), Lee Sklar on bass, Russ Kunkel on drums, Clarence McDonald on piano, Andrew Gold on harmonium, and Byron Berline on fiddle. [...] Backing vocals were handled by Gold and Taylor. [...] Greatest Hits became a diamond record, selling more than 11 {{million copies in}} the United States by 2001, [...] {{and this is the}} version of [...] "Carolina in My Mind" [...] that became best known. [...] The remake earned even more critical praise than the original. [...] Bill Janovitz of Allmusic said of the 1976 recording that it [...] "accent the <b>languid,</b> plaintive and wistful country melancholy of the song," [...] while in the 1979 Rolling Stone Record Guide, critic Stephen Holden said that the [...] "stunning" [...] remake showed how much Taylor's singing had strengthened in the intervening years. Biographer White believed that the song benefited from the removal of the original's orchestration.|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a <b>languid</b> rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|During the chorus, Kiedis sings [...] "Give it away, {{give it away}}, give it away now" [...] {{repeatedly}} over a {{more rapid}} guitar riff before Frusciante provides, according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, a [...] "sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity {{in the form of}} a <b>languid</b> solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track." [...] The solo was recorded in one take because Frusciante had developed a preference towards speedy execution and a raw feeling; according to Flea, [...] "We did very little fix-up stuff. John's philosophy was that he would only play a solo twice. He'd play it once, and if he didn't like it or we didn't like it, he'd play it again—completely different. And that was it." [...] "Give It Away" [...] also makes use of other instruments like the jew's harp, which was played by band friend Pete Weiss. The song continues through several verses and choruses before reaching a bridge that introduces the outro, which consists of [...] "a hard-rocking riff" [...] that, according to Huey, strongly resembles the main riff from Black Sabbath's [...] "Sweet Leaf" [...] from their 1971 record Master of Reality. Kiedis repeats [...] "Give it away now" [...] for several measures before the guitar, bass and drums drop out.|$|E
500|$|Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku {{said that}} the game's low {{barriers}} to entry and similarity to Agar.io explained Slither.io popularity. She noted the game's fast pace. Boing Boing compared the game's core mechanic {{to that of the}} 2009 game Osmos. Brandt Ran, writing for Business Insider, said that [...] "despite running into some technical hiccups—the game can lag heavily at times—I doubt Slither.io will be leaving my home screen anytime soon." [...] Harry Slater, writing for Pocket Gamer, defined the game as [...] "interesting"; the gameplay as a [...] "compulsive experience"; and the structure as simple and similar to Agar.io, although it did not have a large replay value. TechCrunch Felicia Williams praised the designs, getting [...] "pleasantly surprised" [...] with the variety of skins for customization. Lian Amaris of Gamezebo found the game to be [...] "far more interesting than Agar.io" [...] because it involved [...] "an ever-growing <b>languid</b> body rather than just a flat circle," [...] and praised [...] "the dark environment with neon worms," [...] which gave the game a [...] "retro arcade feel." [...] Amaris also compared the concept of Slither.io to that of Agar.io and stated that Slither.io was reminiscent of the classic arcade game Snake.|$|E
500|$|A Southern hip hop album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{incorporates}} analog {{elements such}} as Southern-styled guitar licks, <b>languid</b> soul melodies, and mellow 1970s funk grooves. It also features digital hip hop production {{elements such as}} programmed snare beats, booty bass elements, including Roland TR-808 clave rhythms, and old school hip hop elements, including E-mu SP-1200-styled drums and turntable scratches. Music writers characterize the album's music and beats as [...] "clanky" [...] and [...] "mechanical". Roni Sarig of Rolling Stone comments that the music shows [...] "clear debts to East Coast bohos like the Native Tongues and a West Coast level of attention to live instruments and smooth, irresistible melodies". In Oliver Wang's Classic Material, music writer Tony Green delineates the album's release [...] "at {{the tail end of}} a second hip-hop 'golden age,' a two-year period (1993–94) that spawned Wu-Tang's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle, De La Soul's Buhloone Mindstate, Nas's Illmatic, and A Tribe Called Quest's Midnight Marauders", and comments that [...] "like many albums released during that period, Southernplayalistic alluded to its roots... while clearing the way for a new direction that used the peach cobbler soul funk of the Organized Noize production crew as a starting point." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "controversial" [...] in their 2008 book, The Complete X-Files. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, writing that [...] "this episode vividly demonstrates that what Carl Sagan once called 'the burden of skepticism' is no longer being shouldered by anyone in the series. Why else would Mulder's assertion that a necromancer has successfully raised the dead provoke such a <b>languid</b> response {{in a room full}} of FBI agents?" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, noting that the episode's premise felt, [...] "stylistically wrong for Millennium." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson argued the episode was [...] "a terrible X-File" [...] because, instead of featuring Mulder and Scully solving a mystery, the plot revolved around the two saving the world from Armageddon, which caused [...] "the thin credibility upon which hangs the series [...]" [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris noted that, despite the teaser and first act being [...] "promising enough", the episode [...] "slides downhill rapidly with a storyline that crosses the border into ludicrous." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some <b>languid</b> storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
500|$|Later reviews {{have been}} positive. Jess Harvell of Pitchfork opined that Quique [...] "still sounds timeless." [...] Glenn Swan of AllMusic gave the album {{four and a}} half stars out of five, stating [...] "this is Seefeel at their most ornate. They squint by staring into the {{geometric}} refractions of light and record the results." [...] Jason Ferguson of Harp described Quique as [...] "shimmered with a futuristic ethereality that was far more substantial than the electro-ambience of the era, but also much less assaultive than the shoegazers Seefeel was affiliated with early on." [...] and that the 2007 re-issue was [...] "a fitting tribute to a very unique sound." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "underrated" [...] and [...] "that even 20 years later sounds like nothing else." [...] The Sunday Times gave the Redux edition a positive review, referring to Quique as the group's [...] "finest moment" [...] and [...] "If you like music to have structure, Quique will drive you barmy; but if you consider the presence of the word [...] "texture" [...] in an album review to be a positive, you might well enjoy this <b>languid</b> landmark." [...] Cam Lindsay wrote in Exclaim! that [...] "While it doesn't feel like a timely release, the re-discovery of Seefeel (no word yet on a reunion) certainly verifies their relevance in today's music, especially in light of neo-gazers like Ulrich Schnauss and Tim Hecker." [...] In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 34 on his list of [...] "The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties". In 2016, Pitchfork placed Quique at number 13 on its list of [...] "The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time".|$|E
500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its <b>languid</b> pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian writer Alexis Petridis was {{confident}} that [...] "there's clearly an interesting pop star" [...] emerging from Diamandis, but suggested that her creativity was restricted by the heavy integration of alter egos and an implied determination for commercial success, which he commented failed to reflect Diamandis' inventiveness. Simon Price from The Independent accepted that the record was [...] "too professional to be truly terrible", although noted that Diamandis' revamped public image as a [...] "British Katy Perry" [...] lacked ingenuity. NME columnist Priya Elan summarised the album as an [...] "expensive-sounding failure" [...] that suffered from its lack of decisiveness. Writing for Pitchfork, Laura Snapes questioned the decision of creating the [...] "Electra Heart" [...] character for the record, and suggested that it was unnecessary. She elaborated that [...] "duller and more unbearable" [...] tracks were unavoidable, and expressed particular disappointment because she thought that Electra Heart could have become [...] "one of the year's most acclaimed pop albums." [...] Representing The Observer, Kitty Empire assumed that Diamandis' collaborations with Dr. Luke and Greg Kurstin were evidence of [...] "a big label push". She compared the disc to the works of Perry and Britney Spears, although felt that Lana Del Rey was more successful in embodying the themes of [...] "love, identity, femininity and America" [...] than Diamandis' generic production values allowed. Emily Mackay from The Quietus criticised the songs' titles for being lacklustre, which she sarcastically stated caused listeners [...] "physical pain", and was disappointed that the character [...] "Electra Heart" [...] was a scapegoat for expressing [...] "all the worst parts of Marina Diamandis that she didn't want to become." [...] The harshest review came from Clash magazine, with George Boorman writing, [...] "'Electra heart' is an ingloriously <b>languid</b> statement of Marina's demise, the final stamp of disapproval on her flailing excuse of a musical career. There is actually a song called 'Bubblegum Bitch' on this album. 'nuff said." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often <b>languid</b> and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge", {{which became}} a {{breakout}} song for the band, {{was considered to be}} a highlight of the album by several critics. Allmusic reviewed the song individually and called it a [...] "...poignant sentiment... it is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo", and ultimately [...] "has {{become an integral part of}} the 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the rough-hewn and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers' own oeuvre." [...] However, Entertainment Weekly criticized the seriousness that the Red Hot Chili Peppers explored as being [...] "disapproving of the band's usual Red Hot antics", and [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had [...] "fancy-shmancy touches". The song ended up peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1992. [...] "Give It Away" [...] was also praised, though as [...] "...a free-associative mixture of positive vibes, tributes to musical heroes, and free love", with Frusciante [...] "...adding the song's two most unpredictable change-ups: a sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity in the form of a <b>languid</b> solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track, and a hard-rocking riff which is not introduced until the song's outro..." [...] Tracks such as [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy", however, were criticized for being overly explicit. Devon Powters of Pop Matters said that [...] "Eight minutes of 'Sir Psycho Sexy' will turn RHCP's young listeners into quivering masses of hormonal jello. Oversexed lines sneak their way into 'Apache Rose Peacock'; 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik', simply, sounds like fucking. Even the purest virgin comes away from Blood Sugar Sex Magik with a degree of sexual maturity; even the slickest playa can learn a couple of new moves." [...] In contrast, [...] "Suck My Kiss", according to Amy Hanson of Allmusic, [...] "completely flew in the face of the established pecking order of alternative rock." [...] With the song, the Chili Peppers [...] "fully allied themselves with the very few genre-bending bands that were able to make a radical impact on the sonic landscape that was dominated, it seemed, from every minute angle by grunge." ...|$|E
