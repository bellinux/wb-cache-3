40|$|The {{improvement}} {{of the dynamics of}} flexible manipulators like log cranes often requires advanced control methods. This thesis discusses the vibration problems in the cranes used in commercial forestry machines. Two control methods, adaptive filtering and semi-active damping, are presented. The adaptive filter uses a part of the lowest natural frequency of the crane as a filtering frequency. The payload estimation algorithm, filtering of control signal and algorithm for calculation of the lowest natural frequency of the crane are presented. The semi-active damping method is basedon pressure feedback. The pressure vibration, scaled with suitable gain, is added to the control signal of the valve of the <b>lift</b> <b>cylinder</b> to suppress vibrations. The adaptive filter cuts off high frequency impulses coming from the operatorand semi-active damping suppresses the crane?s oscillation, which is often caused by some external disturbance. In field tests performed on the crane, a correctly tuned (25 % tuning) adaptive filter reduced pressure vibration by 14 - 17 % and semi-active damping correspondingly by 21 - 43 %. Applying of these methods require auxiliary transducers, installed in specific points in the crane, and electronically controlled directional control valves...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} and investigate reference times for regularmaintenance work activities at the department responsible for maintenance ofunderground loaders at company LKAB:s mine in Kiruna, Sweden. The study is athesis of 15 credits at Uppsala University and {{has been carried out}} over 10 weeksduring the spring 2016. The majority of the work has been carried out on site. For a long time the underground loaders department has been struggling withrecurring breakdowns. Which affect the production in the mine and is a burden forthe maintenance personal. To live up to the expectations of the customer and be ableto plan the work procedures with better precision the department now wants to geta better picture of how much the planning of the maintenance work affects thedepartment, both in time and costs. The goal with the study is to proposeimprovements of how to minimize the time for maintenance work. The study has looked at internal statistics from 2015 and used it to map out whichactivities that have the biggest influence on the department. The first selectionresulted in six procedures which are carried out on the two types of loaders from SANDVIK that the company uses. The chosen activities are bucket replacement, tiltcylinder replacement, <b>lift</b> <b>cylinder</b> replacement and front and rear axle replacement. Due to the limitation of time for the study one of these six activities were chosen fora deeper analysis. The choice, after discussion with the mentor Sandy Doull at LKAB,fell on front and rear axle replacement. The conclusion after the study is that there are big opportunities for improvementsfor the department responsible for the underground loaders at LKAB. Workingactively with follow ups and implementing the Lean tool 5 S they can reduce waste,variation and to improve productivity for all the work procedures.

40|$|Forests {{represent}} one of {{the biggest}} terrestrial ecosystems of Earth, that can produce important raw renewable materials such as wood with the help of sun, air and water. To efficiently extract these raw materials, the tree harvesting process is highly mechanized in developed countries, meaning that advanced forestry machines are continuously used to fell, to process and to transport the logs and biomass obtained from the forests. However, working with these machines is demanding both mentally and physically, which are known factors to negatively affect operator productivity. Mental fatigue is mostly due to the manual operation of the on-board knuckleboom crane, which requires advanced cognitive work with two joystick levers, while the most serious physical strains arise from cabin vibrations. These vibrations are generated from knuckleboom crane vibrations as a result of aggressive manual operation. To enhance operator workload, well-being, and to increase productivity of the logging process, semi-automation functions are suggested, which are supervised automatic executions of specific work elements. Some of the related issues are addressed in the current thesis. Therefore, the content is divided into: (1) the design and development of a semi-automation function focused only on the base joint actuator (slewing actuator) of a knuckleboom crane, and (2) active vibration damping solutions to treat crane structure vibrations induced by the main <b>lift</b> <b>cylinder</b> (inner boom actuator). The considered reference machine is a downsized knuckleboom crane of a forwarder machine, which is used to pick up log assortments from a harvesting site. The proposed semi-automation function presented in the first part could be beneficial for operators to use during log loading/unloading scenarios. It consists from a closed-loop position control architecture, to which smooth reference slewing trajectories are provided by a trajectory planner that is automated via operator commands. The used trajectory generation algorithms are taken from conventional robotics and adapted to semi-automation context with proposed modifications that can be customizable by operators. Further, the proposed active vibration damping solutions are aimed to reduce vibrations of the knuckleboom crane excited by the inner boom actuator due to aggressive manual commands. First, a popular input shaping control technique combined with a practical switching logic was investigated to deal with the excited payload oscillations. This technique proved to be useful with a fixed crane pose, however it did not provide much robustness in terms of different link configurations. To tackle this problem an H 2 -optimal controller is developed, which is active in the pressure feedback-loop and its solely purpose is to damp the same payload oscillations. During the design process, operator commands are treated and explained from input disturbance viewpoint. All of the hypothesis throughout this thesis were verified with extensive experimental studies using the reference machine...|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} model was proposed {{to describe the}} overall relationship among hand postures, motions, forces, factors, memory, and feedback. Second, logistic regression models were developed based on a study of 10 male and 10 female subjects that showed relative hand load greater than 34 % of maximal strength motivated subjects to reach and grasp cylinders using underhand posture (rather than overhand), and relative hand load as low as 24 % motivated subjects to hold the objects (for about 8 s) using palm grip at shoulder height (vs. hook grip at mid-thigh height). The relative hand load threshold increased to 53 % for selecting underhand over overhand posture for placing the objects. Third, a study of relative finger loads for 6 male and 6 female subjects <b>lifting</b> <b>cylinders</b> showed that selection of hand posture {{is related to the}} preference of reducing thumb and fingertip forces and joint loads. Subjects demonstrated strong preferences of underhand over overhand grasp, and hook grip over pinch to <b>lift</b> <b>cylinders,</b> while thumb tip and sum of fingertip forces can be reduced up to 60 % by selecting the preferred postures. Biomechanical models predicted overhand thumb and finger normal forces similar to data if friction was considered, while predicting about 2 times of measured normal forces if friction force was assumed zero. Fourth, finger force distribution and placement were determined for 6 males and 6 females holding unbalanced plate objects. The thumb and finger center-of-force (CoF) locations were generally aligned with the load moment arm. The distance between thumb and finger CoF locations increased by 39 % as load moment increased from 0. 98 Nm to 2. 35 Nm, and reduced by 17 % as hand length increased from 16. 2 cm to 21. 1 cm when the plate was held horizontally. Previous studies showed that posture selection is related to effort (Rosenbaum et al. 2006). This work shows that effort can be described quantitatively by relative joint loads, and that posture predictions based on biomechanical analysis of relative finger forces and joint loads account for 45 %- 87 % of variance. The unexplained variance may be due to mechanical inter dependencies among finger motions and finger force measurement errors...|$|R

The wheel loader is modeled as a system with five states and three control inputs including torque converter nonlinearities. The torque converter is modeled with no lockup enabling power transmission in both directions. The geometry of the wheel loader boom and the demanded force in the <b>lift</b> <b>cylinders</b> during <b>lifting</b> are used {{to ensure that the}} in-cylinder pressure remains below component’s limits. The lift-transport section of the short loading cycle is divided into four phases due to discontinuities in the gearbox ratios and fuel consumption is calculated in each phase. Time optimal and fuel optimal transients of the system and the power consumption in each and every component is presented showing the dominance of the torque converter losses compared to the other components especially in the time optimal solutions. It is shown that introducing path constraints on the maximum lifting speed of the bucket due to limitations in hydraulic pumping speed moves the diesel engine operation towards higher speeds {{in order to maintain the}} lifting speed. Trade-off between fuel optimal and time optimal transients is calculated which is found to be in agreement with the results of experimental studies...|$|R

The contact shoe pushes against the contact wire with adjustable pressure of between 70 and 120 N. The driver controls the pantograph via a push {{button on the}} driver's desk (Up, Down, and Down + Sanding for emergency cases are the settings). The choice of which pantograph to use can be left up to the locomotive by the driver, which would automatically use the back pantograph {{in the direction of}} travel, or, in double heading, where two locomotives are coupled, it would be the front pantograph on the front locomotive, and the back pantograph on the back locomotive. Otherwise the driver, using a switch located on the battery control table in driver's cab 1, may raise one or the other, or both together. This is primarily an advantage during shunting/switching operation, where otherwise the change from one driver's cab to the other would mean the automatic switching from one pantograph to the other. In cases where the pantograph is being switched, the unit that was in the down position is lifted first, and once it is successfully pushed up against the contact wire, the pantograph that was in service is lowered.|$|R

The result of the simulationshows that {{the energy of the}} pressure ripple is reduced when the paralleled hydraulicpumps are phase shifted and reduces each others pump pulsations. The aim of the masterthesis is to investigate if the reduction in pulsations also reduces the hydraulic sound. The test has been made on a wheel loader, model L 180 F, by measuring the pressure pulsationsin the hydraulic system and sound in the drivers cabin. The machine is equipped withtwo nine pistons hydraulic pumps in parallel to the main hydraulic actuators. The measurementshas been made when the sound is highest from the hydraulic system, which is whenthe <b>lifting</b> <b>cylinders</b> has maximum speed. The measurements has been made for differentangels in a range from 0 to 16 degrees phase shift. The result of the master thesis shows that the pulsations in the hydraulic system is reducedbut the sound does not improve with reduced pulsations. The cause to the resultshould be that the pulsations can not be reduced in the entire hydraulic system. The partof the hydraulic system that can not be affected is close to the drivers cabin floor and hastherefor a big contribution to the sound level in the cabin. Volvo is not recommended to introduce the concept because the lack of result in the soundreduction.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by airframe noise in aircraft and blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise in helicopters. In this thesis, the sound generated by vortical disturbances in a subsonic flow around solid surfaces, using different vortex velocity formulations, was investigated by numerically solving the linearized or non-linearized Euler equations. Analytical solutions for this general case are not available because the wavelength of the generated acoustic wave {{is comparable to the}} vortex size, which is at variance to the compact source assumption of the acoustic analogy. Numerical errors associated with the discretization and boundary conditions were kept small using a high-order scheme with accurate non-reflecting boundary conditions. Stagnation flow on a flat plate, flow around a stationary and rotating cylinder, and that about two cylinders were taken as prototypes of real-world flows with strong gradients of mean pressure and velocity. Single and periodic vortices were taken into consideration. In addition, the effect of vortex core size, the street distance, street frequency, and the Mach number of the mean flow on sound generation and propagation were examined. The sound wave strength was found to be proportional to the vortex strength. If the acoustic pressure is normalized by the vortex strength, then all the distinct acoustic pressure profiles will collapse into single curve. Sound generation by vortex interaction with a solid surface, as well as its propagation, were found to be totally different between the Taylor's and Vatistas's vortices. The vortex core size and vortex street distance have minor influences on the acoustic pressure profile for sound waves radiated by the Vatistas vortex. Nevertheless, the change of the core size or the distance between the vortex rows significantly affects the sound pressure profile and sound directivity radiated by a Taylor vortex. The effects of the non-linear terms on sound wave properties were also investigated. The non-linear influence was found to increase with the vortex strength. A <b>lifting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is shown not only to increase the sound wave amplitude, but also to shift its directivity.
