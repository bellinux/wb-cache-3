40|$|Recently, highly {{functional}} biosensors {{have been}} developed in preparation for possible large-scale terrorist attacks using chemical warfare agents. Practically applicable sensors are required to have various abilities, such as high portability and operability, the capability of performing rapid and continuous measurement, as well as high sensitivity and selectivity. We developed the detection method of capsaicinoids, {{the main component of}} some <b>lachrymators,</b> using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor as an on-site detection sensor. Homovanillic acid, which has a vanillyl group similar to capsaicinoids such as capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, was bound to Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (CCH) for use as an immunogen to generate polyclonal antibodies. An indirect competitive assay was carried out to detect capsaicinoids using SPR sensor chips on which different capsaicin analogues were immobilized. For the sensor chip on which 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzylamine hydrochloride was immobilized, a detection limit of 150 ppb was achieved. We found that the incubation time was not required and the detection can be completed in five minutes...|$|R

50|$|There are a {{range of}} similar enzymes that can react with the cysteine-derived sulfoxides present in {{different}} species. In onions, an isomer of alliin, isoalliin, is converted to 1-propenesulfenic acid. A separate enzyme, the lachrymatory factor synthase or LFS, then converts this chemical to syn-propanethial-S-oxide, a potent <b>lachrymator.</b> The analogous butyl compound, syn-butanethial-S-oxide, is found in Allium siculum species.|$|E
50|$|Benzyl {{chloride}} is an alkylating agent. Indicative of {{its high}} reactivity (relative to alkyl chlorides), benzyl chloride reacts with water in a hydrolysis reaction to form benzyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid. In contact with mucous membranes, hydrolysis produces hydrochloric acid. Thus, benzyl chloride is a <b>lachrymator</b> and {{has been used in}} chemical warfare. It is also very irritating to the skin.|$|E
5000|$|MSF is a clear, colorless to {{yellowish}} {{hygroscopic liquid}} (attracts and holds water by absorption or adsorption). It is corrosive and highly toxic. It is an oxydiaphoric inhibitor (acid-transferring inhibitor) of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. MSF, {{which is a}} liquid at room temperature, has a vapor pressure of 19.2 mmHg, slightly more volatile than water which has a vapor pressure of 18.8 mmHg at 21 °C. This vapor has an LCt50 (lethal concentration, 50% death rate in a given time) in rats of between 4 and 5 parts per million (ppm) during one hour of exposure or between 1 and 1.2 ppm during 7 hours of exposure. MSF produced no subtle biological effects from direct action of MSF independent {{of its ability to}} inhibit cholinesterase. Repeated exposures to 1/10 of the LCt50 did not produce overt systemic toxicity or significant pathology. [...] MSF can also cause severe skin burns and serious eye damage, if contact is made. It is a <b>lachrymator</b> and its vapor causes tears in eyes.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{procedure}} for {{the synthesis of}} n-butyl naphthyl ether is presented. This procedure represents an easy method {{for the production of}} an aryl ether by an SN 2 reaction, uses ethanol as an environmentally friendly solvent, and does not require the use of a <b>lachrymator.</b> Product isolation is done by pouring the reaction mixture over ice and collecting the solid by suction filtration. Students typically recover from 7 – 95 % of the ether...|$|E
40|$|Environmentally {{benign and}} {{biodegradable}} lactic acid {{is identified as}} alternative solvent and catalyst for the tandem one-pot synthesis of Hantzsch 2 -aminothiazole derivatives (4) from readily available aralkyl ketones (1) through in situ regioselective α-bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (2) followed by heterocyclization using thiourea (3) at 90 – 100 °C. The major advantages of the present method include short reaction times (10 – 15  min), practical, simple to perform, easy work-up, good yield of products (up to 96 %), productive for large-scale applications, free from apply of α-bromoketones (<b>lachrymator)</b> as substrates, avoids column purification. Hence, the present method meets with the concepts of both Wender’s “ideal synthesis” and sustainable chemical process...|$|E
40|$|Yield {{refers to}} {{isolated}} pure acetate Protection of alcohol as corresponding acetate ester {{is one of}} the most fundamental and widely used strategies in contem-porary organic chemistry. 1 Usually acetyl chloride and acetic anhydride are employed as the acylating agents in the presence of a convenient acidic or basic catalyst. 2 However, both the rea-gents are corrosive and <b>lachrymator</b> and involve the use of ter-tiary amines such triethylamine, pyridine and DMAP and there-fore are not always ideal. Several catalytic systems involving Lewis acids 3 - 7 and metal triflates 8 - 13 have been explored for the esterification of alcohols using acetic anhydride. Recently acetic acid, which is the precursor of acetic anhydride, was used as acylating agent in presence of ferric perchlorate, 14 however perchlorates are potentially explosive. Therefore, development of simple and environmentally friendly method for acetylatio...|$|E
40|$|When certain {{hazardous}} {{chemicals are}} stored or mixed together, violent reactions may occur because the chemicals are unsuitable for mixing, or are incompatible. Classes of incompatible chemicals should be segregated {{from each other}} during storage, according to hazard class. Refer to the suggested shelf storage patterns for guidance. No single method of determining chemical compatibility is perfect. The reasons for this are varied and include: • Many chemicals belong {{to more than one}} hazard class. This can lead to confusion as to which class is appropriate for the chemical in question. Examples: Nitric acid is both an acid and an oxidizer; Benzoyl chloride is a combustible liquid, a corrosive, and a <b>lachrymator.</b> • The hazard class that is most important can change depending on factors such as quantity of material, and other chemicals in the storage area. • Not all chemicals in a given class are compatible. For example, sodium dichloroisocyanurate and calcium hypochlorite are both oxidizers and belong to no other class of chemical, yet the mixing of these two materials can lead to the formation of nitrogen trichloride, a shock sensitive explosive...|$|E
40|$|A novel lachrymatory factor synthase (LFS) was {{isolated}} and purified from {{the roots of}} the Amazonian medicinal plant Petiveria alliacea. The enzyme is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein comprised of two α-subunits (68. 8 kD each), one γ-subunit (22. 5 kD), and one δ-subunit (11. 9 kD). The two α-subunits are glycosylated and connected by a disulfide bridge. The LFS has an isoelectric point of 5. 2. It catalyzes the formation of a sulfine <b>lachrymator,</b> (Z) -phenylmethanethial S-oxide, only in the presence of P. alliacea alliinase and its natural substrate, S-benzyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide (petiveriin). Depending on its concentration relative to that of P. alliacea alliinase, the LFS sequesters, to varying degrees, the sulfenic acid intermediate formed by alliinase-mediated breakdown of petiveriin. At LFS:alliinase of 5 : 1, LFS sequesters all of the sulfenic acid formed by alliinase action on petiveriin, and converts it entirely to (Z) -phenylmethanethial S-oxide. However, starting at LFS:alliinase of 5 : 2, the LFS is unable to sequester all of the sulfenic acid produced by the alliinase, with the result that sulfenic acid that escapes the action of the LFS condenses with loss of water to form S-benzyl phenylmethanethiosulfinate (petivericin). The results show that the LFS and alliinase function in tandem, with the alliinase furnishing the sulfenic acid substrate on which the LFS acts. The results also show that the LFS modulates the formation of biologically active thiosulfinates that are downstream of the alliinase in a manner dependent upon the relative concentrations of the LFS and the alliinase. These observations suggest that manipulation of LFS-to-alliinase ratios in plants displaying this system may provide a means by which to rationally modify organosulfur small molecule profiles to obtain desired flavor and/or odor signatures, or increase the presence of desirable biologically active small molecules...|$|E
