IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride dissolves freeze dried banana pulp and with an additional 15% DMSO, lends itself to Carbon-13 NMR analysis. In this way the entire complex of starch, sucrose, glucose, and fructose can be monitored as a function of banana ripening.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lyocell</b> shares many {{properties}} {{with other}} cellulosic fibres such as cotton, linen, ramie and viscose rayon. Some main characteristics of <b>lyocell</b> fibres {{are that they}} are soft, absorbent, very strong when wet or dry, and resistant to wrinkles. <b>Lyocell</b> fabric can be machine washed or drycleaned, it drapes well, {{and it can be}} dyed many colors, and can simulate a variety of textures such as suede, leather, and silk.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>Lyocell</b> is more {{expensive}} to produce than cotton or viscose rayon. It is used in many everyday fabrics. Staple fibres are used in clothes such as denim, chino, underwear, casual wear, and towels. Filament fibres are used in items that have a silkier appearance such as women’s clothing and men’s dress shirts. <b>Lyocell</b> can be blended {{with a variety of}} other fibres such as silk, cotton, rayon, polyester, linen, nylon, and wool. <b>Lyocell</b> is also used in conveyor belts, specialty papers, and medical dressings.|$|E
50|$|Fibers {{manufactured}} {{from natural}} materials include: <b>Lyocell</b> and polylactic acid (PLA).|$|E

50|$|The <b>Lyocell</b> process {{relies on}} {{dissolution}} of cellulose products in a solvent, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide. The process starts with woody sources of cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning. It was {{developed at the}} now defunct American Enka and Courtaulds Fibres. As of 2013, Lenzing's Tencel brand {{is perhaps the most}} widely known <b>lyocell</b> fiber producer.|$|E
50|$|Modal and Tencel {{are widely}} used forms of rayon {{produced}} by Lenzing AG. Tencel, generic name <b>lyocell,</b> is made by a slightly different solvent recovery process, and is considered a different fiber by the US FTC. Tencel <b>lyocell</b> was first produced commercially by Courtaulds' Grimsby plant in England. The process, which dissolves cellulose without a chemical reaction, was developed by Courtaulds Research.|$|E

5000|$|At the <b>Lyocell</b> mill, {{rolls of}} pulp are broken into one-inch squares and {{dissolved}} in N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, giving a solution called [...] "dope." [...] The filtered cellulose solution is then pumped through spinnerets, devices {{used with a}} variety of manmade fibres. The spinneret is pierced with small holes rather like a showerhead; when the solution is forced through it, continuous strands of filament come out. The fibres are drawn in air to align the cellulose molecules, giving the <b>Lyocell</b> fibres its characteristic high strength. The fibres are then immersed into a water bath, where desolvation of the cellulose sets the fibre strands; the bath contains some dilute amine oxide in a steady state concentration. Then the fibers are washed with de-mineralised water. The <b>Lyocell</b> fibre next passes to a drying area, where the water is evaporated from it.|$|E
50|$|Its rayon-grade pulp {{can be used}} in viscose and <b>lyocell</b> fibers used in textiles; {{non-wovens}} including baby wipes, cosmetic masks; and {{viscose filament}} used in textiles and tissues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lyocell</b> is a {{synthetic}} fabric derived from wood pulp. It {{is often described}} as {{a synthetic}} silkequivalent; it is a tough fabric that is often blended with other fabrics - cotton, for example.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} wet {{spinning}} is dry jet-wet spinning, where {{the solution is}} extruded into air and drawn, and then submerged into a liquid bath. This method is used in <b>Lyocell</b> spinning of dissolved cellulose.|$|E
50|$|Because rayon is {{manufactured}} from {{naturally occurring}} polymers, {{it is considered}} a semi-synthetic fiber. Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and <b>lyocell,</b> each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product.|$|E
50|$|The use of viscose is declining, in {{part because}} of the {{environmental}} costs of its production. Instead, rayon may be manufactured using the <b>Lyocell</b> process, which uses N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide as the solvent and produces little waste product, making it relatively eco-friendly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lyocell</b> process uses {{a direct}} solvent rather than {{indirect}} dissolution like the xanthation/regeneration route in the viscose process. <b>Lyocell</b> fiber is produced from dissolving pulp, which contains cellulose in high purity with little hemicellulose and no lignin. Hardwood logs (such as oak and birch) are chipped into squares {{about the size}} of postage stamps. The chips are digested chemically either with the prehydrolysis-kraft process or with sulfite process to remove the lignin and hemicellulose. The pulp is bleached to remove the remaining traces of lignin, dried into a continuous sheet and rolled onto spools. The pulp has the consistency of thick posterboard paper and is delivered in rolls weighing some 500 lb (230 kg).|$|E
50|$|Lenzing AG is {{a company}} based in Lenzing, Austria, whose main {{business}} is textile and nonwovens cellulose fibers (such as modal and <b>lyocell),</b> and which also makes some polymer plastics. Lenzing Group is an international group of companies with its headquarters in Austria, and production sites in all major markets.|$|E
50|$|Lenzing's {{economy is}} partly based on tourism, but {{the town is}} much more known as an {{industrial}} site; it is the world headquarters of Lenzing AG, which is the world leader {{in the production of}} cellulose-based fiber such as viscose and <b>Lyocell.</b> , it manufactures one-fifth of the world's cellulose fiber.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lyocell</b> {{is a form}} of rayon which {{consists}} of cellulose fibre made from dissolving pulp (bleached wood pulp) using dry jet-wet spinning. It was developed beginning in 1972 by a team at the now defunct American Enka fibers facility at Enka, North Carolina. This development was recognised by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) in 2003 by the awarding of their Henry E. Millson Award for Invention. The operating name for the fibre inside the Enka Organization was [...] "Newcell", and the development was carried through pilot plant scale before the work was halted. The fibre was developed further as Tencel in the 1980s by Courtaulds Fibres in Coventry, UK and at the Grimsby, UK pilot plant. The process was first commercialised at Courtaulds rayon factories at Mobile, Alabama (1990) and at the Grimsby plant (1998). In 1998 Courtaulds was acquired by Akzo Nobel, who combined the Tencel division with other fibre divisions under the Acordis banner, prior to selling them off to private equity (CVC Partners). However the structure of <b>Lyocell</b> isn't very apparent online (SM). In 2004 CVC sold the Tencel division to Lenzing AG, who combined it with their [...] "Lenzing Lyocell" [...] business but maintained the brand name Tencel [...] , Lenzing's Tencel brand is perhaps the most widely known <b>lyocell</b> fiber producer throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|Coex is a {{biopolymer}} with flame-retardant properties {{derived from}} the functionalization of cellulosic fibers such as cotton, linen, jute, cannabis, coconut, ramie, bamboo, raffia palm, stipa, abacà, sisal, nettle and kapok. The treatment effectiveness was also proven on wood and semy-synthetic fibers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, viscose, modal, <b>lyocell</b> and cupro.|$|E
50|$|In {{the textile}} {{industry}} regenerated cellulose {{is used as}} fibers such as rayon, (including modal, and the more recently developed <b>Lyocell).</b> Cellulose fibers are manufactured from dissolving pulp. Cellulose-based fibers are of two types, regenerated or pure cellulose such as from the cupro-ammonium process and modified cellulose such as the cellulose acetates.|$|E
5000|$|The US Federal Trade Commission defines <b>Lyocell</b> as a fibre [...] "composed of {{cellulose}} precipitated from an organic solution {{in which no}} substitution of the hydroxyl groups takes place and no chemical intermediates are formed". It classifies the fibre as a sub-category of rayon. The fibre is used to make textiles for clothing and other purposes.|$|E
50|$|World War II {{interrupted}} the silk trade from Asia, and silk prices increased dramatically.

Synthetic silks have also been made from <b>lyocell,</b> a type of cellulose fiber, and are often difficult to distinguish from real silk (see spider silk for more on synthetic silks).|$|E
50|$|Cotton {{and cotton}} blends {{dominate}} the market. The most common blend being cotton and polyester. Cotton provides absorbency {{and a soft}} hand, while polyester adds durability and wrinkle resistance. Other common fibers used in the manufacturing of bed sheets include linen, silk, Modal and bamboo rayon, <b>lyocell,</b> and polypropylene. Polypropylene (olefin) is a hypoallergenic spun-bound material produced at a low cost and typically used in emergency shelters or hospitals as disposable sheeting.|$|E
50|$|N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (more {{correctly}} 4-methylmorpholine 4-oxide), NMO or NMMO is {{an organic}} compound. This heterocyclic amine oxide and morpholine derivative {{is used in}} organic chemistry as a co-oxidant and sacrificial catalyst in oxidation reactions for instance in osmium tetroxide oxidations and the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation or oxidations with TPAP. NMO is commercially supplied both as a monohydrate C5H11NO2·H2O and as the anhydrous compound. The monohydrate {{is used as a}} solvent for cellulose in the <b>Lyocell</b> process to produce cellulose fibers.|$|E
5000|$|Fibers: Cellulose is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of textiles made from cotton, linen, and other plant fibers. It {{can be turned into}} rayon, an important fiber that has been used for textiles {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. Both cellophane and rayon are known as [...] "regenerated cellulose fibers"; they are identical to cellulose in chemical structure and are usually made from dissolving pulp via viscose. A more recent and environmentally friendly method to produce a form of rayon is the <b>Lyocell</b> process.|$|E
50|$|Dissolving pulp {{is used in}} {{production}} of regenerated cellulose. In the regenerated cellulose process the cellulose is converted to cellulose xanthate which dissolves easily in caustic soda. The resulting viscous liquid can be extruded through spinnerettes and regenerated as man-made fibres. Cellulose can also be dissolved in some organic solvents directly and processed to regenerate the cellulose fibres in different forms. The <b>lyocell</b> process uses an amine oxide to dissolve cellulose and Tencel is the only commercial example of this direct-dissolution process, which unlike the viscose process is pollution-free.|$|E
5000|$|A fiber, {{a single}} {{filament}} of natural material, such as cotton, linen or wool, or artificial material such as nylon, polyester, metal or mineral fiber, or man-made cellulosic fibre like viscose, Modal, <b>Lyocell</b> or other rayon fiber {{is measured in}} terms of linear mass density, the weight of a given length of fiber. Various units are used to refer to the measurement of a fiber, such as: the denier and tex (linear mass density of fibers), super S (fineness of wool fiber), worsted count, woolen count, cotton count (or Number English (Ne)), Number metric (Nm) and yield (the reciprocal of denier and tex).|$|E
50|$|NMMO {{monohydrate}} {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} in the <b>Lyocell</b> process to produce Tencel fiber. It dissolves cellulose to form a solution called dope, and the cellulose is reprecipitated in a water bath to produce a fiber. The process is similar but not analogous to the viscose process. In the viscose process, cellulose is made soluble by conversion to its xanthate derivatives. With NMMO, cellulose is not derivatized but dissolves to give a homogeneous polymer solution. The resulting fiber is similar to viscose; this was observed, for example, for Valonia cellulose microfibrils. Dilution with water causes the cellulose to reprecipitate, i.e. the solvation of cellulose with NMMO is a water sensitive process.|$|E
50|$|Dissolving pulp, {{also called}} {{dissolving}} cellulose, is bleached wood pulp or cotton linters {{that has a}} high cellulose content (> 90%). It has special properties including {{a high level of}} brightness and uniform molecular-weight distribution. This pulp is manufactured for uses that require a high chemical purity, and particularly low hemicellulose content, since the chemically similar hemicellulose can interfere with subsequent processes. Dissolving pulp is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or <b>Lyocell),</b> or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such cellulose triacetate, a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener.|$|E

50|$|Manufacture then {{follows the}} same route as with other kinds of fibers such as viscose. The strands pass to a {{finishing}} area, where a lubricant, which may be a soap or silicone or other agent depending on the future use of the fibre, is applied. This step is basically a detangler, prior to carding and spinning into yarn. The dried, finished fibres are {{at this stage in}} a form called tow, a large untwisted bundle of continuous lengths of filament. The bundles of tow are taken to a crimper, a machine that compresses the fibre, giving it texture and bulk. The crimped fibre is carded by mechanical carders, which perform an action like combing, to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are cut and baled for shipment to a fabric mill. The entire manufacturing process, from unrolling the raw cellulose to baling the fibre, takes about two hours. After this, the <b>Lyocell</b> may be processed in many ways. It may be spun with another fibre, such as cotton or wool. The resulting yarn can be woven or knitted like any other fabric, and may be given a variety of finishes, from soft and suede-like to silky.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} fibrillation in dyeing, non-fibrillated <b>lyocell</b> fabrics and fibrillated <b>lyocell</b> fabrics were dyed with different types of reactive dyes. Their exhaustion, fixation and K/S values were measured and compared. It was observed that fibrillated <b>lyocell</b> shows lower visual colour yield than non-fibrillated <b>lyocell,</b> independent of the exhaustion and fixation. It was also observed that some bifunctional reactive dyes, because of the location of reactive groups and flexibility of their structure, reduced fibrillation of <b>lyocell</b> through crosslinking. It was shown that defibrillating fibrillated <b>lyocell</b> with a cellulase enzyme increased the visual colour yield. Non-fibrillated <b>lyocell</b> fabrics after dyeing were subjected to a hydroentanglement treatment to create a fibrillation effect. These properties suggest that the lower visual colour yield of fibrillated <b>lyocell</b> is not mainly attributed to any change in fibre properties of the fibrils, {{but as a result}} of the light scattering from the fibrillated fabric surface...|$|E
