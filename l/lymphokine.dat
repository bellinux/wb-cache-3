40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of cervical {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) infection {{is influenced by}} the host's immune response.

To examine whether cervical cells enhance immune-responsiveness, secretion of <b>lymphokines</b> by cultures of normal cervical cells, HPV-immortalized cervical lines, and carcinoma lines was compared. Normal cervical cells constitutively secreted interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha), IL- 1 beta, IL- 1 receptor antagonist, IL- 6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. <b>Lymphokines</b> were also produced by exo- and endocervical epithelia in vivo.

Interferon-gamma induced major histocompatibility class I and II proteins and intercellular adhesion molecule-I in normal cells, but results in immortal or carcinoma lines were variable. These results suggest that cervical epithelial cells have the potential to influence inflammation and immunity in the cervical mucosa. Furthermore, decreased expression of <b>lymphokines</b> and histocompatibility molecules by HPV-immortalized cervical cells suggests that similar alterations might accompany persistent HPV infections in vivo...|$|R

The combination of TNFβ with either FMLP or PMA produced enhancement of neutrophil adherence which exceeded that of either agent alone.

Fusion of macrophages to form multinucleate giant cells (MGCs) accompanies the loss of tumoricidal activity and the onset of resistance to activation by <b>lymphokines,</b> but the fusion process is not responsible for these changes, since unfused macrophages are similarly affected.

Pharmacological studies suggest that functional potassium channels are required in the activation of T- and B-cells. KV channel blockers inhibit activation, gene expression, killing by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, <b>lymphokine</b> secretion and proliferation.

50|$|T {{lymphocytes}} {{regulate the}} growth and differentiation of T cells and certain B cells through the release of secreted protein factors. These factors, which include interleukin 2 (IL2), are secreted by lectin- or antigen-stimulated T cells, and have various physiological effects. IL2 is a <b>lymphokine</b> that induces the proliferation of responsive T cells. In addition, it acts on some B cells, via receptor-specific binding, as a growth factor and antibody production stimulant. The protein is secreted as a single glycosylated polypeptide, and cleavage of a signal sequence is required for its activity. Solution NMR suggests that the structure of IL2 comprises a bundle of 4 helices (termed A-D), flanked by 2 shorter helices and several poorly defined loops. Residues in helix A, and in the loop region between helices A and B, are important for receptor binding. Secondary structure analysis has suggested similarity to IL4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF).|$|E

Addition of small numbers of T cells to B-cell cultures resulted in significant production of a monocyte chemotactic factor. T cells could be replaced by supernates of antigen-stimulated T cells, demonstrating both that the chemotactic factor was B-cell-dervied and that T-cell help was mediated by a soluble factor.

IFN-gamma and IL- 4 increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced TNF-alpha production by different mechanisms because IL- 4, unlike IFN-gamma, failed to overcome the LPS-hyporesponsiveness in C 3 H/HeJ mice. Moreover, only IFN-gamma synergized with LPS to induce nitric oxide production and blocked eicosanoid-mediated down-regulation. These differential effects of IFN-gamma and IL- 4 on the select efferent cytolytic activities {{may be the result of}} an altered or different signal transduction pathway. Because potentiation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by IFN-gamma has been previously documented, we next studied the role of IFN-gamma and IL- 4 in alteration of enzymatic activity of PKC. Two <b>lymphokines</b> caused translocation of PKC from cytosol to membrane with different levels, providing a biochemical basis for explaining how two <b>lymphokines</b> lead to different phenotypic responses. Although treatment of macrophages with IFN-gamma and IL- 4 gave rise to a similar enhancing effect on macrophage TNF-alpha production, these two <b>lymphokines</b> appeared to differentially regulate the overall functional state of macrophages for tumour cell killing capability.

Concerning the transient of immunological parameters after more than six months’ treatment in two cases of the terminal cancer, a memorable finding was that T lymphocyte activity increased remarkably in both cases.

50|$|Tolypocladium inflatum {{has long}} been of {{interest}} in biotechnology due to its production of a relatively non-cytotoxic, natural 11 amino acid cyclic peptide named Ciclosporin A. Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant drug used {{in the management of}} autoimmune diseases and the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation. Ciclosporin A works by targeting and binding with human ciclophilin A. This ciclosporine-ciclophilin binding inhibits calcineurin and effectively inhibits the human immune system. Without calcineurin, the activity of nuclear factor of activated T-cells and transcription regulators of IL-2 in T-lymphocytes is blocked. Ciclosporin A considerably alters the nuclear morphology of in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from ovoid to a radially splayed lobulated structure. The expression levels of alanine racemase affects the level of cyclosporine production by T. inflatum. Ciclosporin A was first introduced in medical use in the 1970s after an organ transplant to reduce graft rejection. This use was based on cyclosporin’s ability to interfere with <b>lymphokine</b> biosynthesis. Ciclosporin A also has anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antiparasitic abilities. It has been recommended for autoimmune diseases as well as potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and HIV-1.

However, the precise molecular distinctions among these factors and the exact role that each plays in B cell function remains unclear. Many important questions regarding the biology and chemistry of these <b>lymphokines</b> are unanswered, in part because sufficient quantities of purified proteins have not been available.

However, investigations related to BCGF have lagged behind those of other <b>lymphokines</b> because of several major problems. First, it has been difficult or impossible to completely separate IL- 2 from BCGF when both are present in the same culture supernatant (19). Second, the currently available assay systems for BCGF, which depend on costimulation of normal B cells with antigen (20) or surface membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking agents such as Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) (21), are time consuming and insensitive. Third, monoclonal antibodies have been invaluable in the purification of certain <b>lymphokines.</b> In the purification of IL. 2, Smith et al.

Clinical investigations have shown that immune activation can be quantified by measurements of soluble immune activation products in serum. Most in vitro studies of these immune activation products have focused on single products. In this study the specific cell sources and the major <b>lymphokines</b> inducing multiple activation products were investigated. In vitro addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or IL- 2 stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} to produce neopterin, beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 -M) and soluble IL- 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R). These two <b>lymphokines</b> can act independently, because neutralizing antibodies to one of the <b>lymphokines</b> did not block the inducing activity of the other. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also investigated and shown to be a less powerful inducer than IL- 2 or INF-gamma. Separated lymphoid subpopulations responded differently to specific <b>lymphokines.</b> Monocytes produced only neopterin and only in response to INF-gamma. T cells released beta 2 -M and sIL- 2 R in response to IL- 2. B cells, however, were capable of producing all three immune activation products. Neopterin production in B cells was induced by either INF-gamma of IL- 2, indicating that B cells have additional mechanisms for responding to <b>lymphokines.</b> To investigate whether these in vitro findings also occur in vivo, sera from patients who had received either rIL- 2 or INF-gamma treatment were tested. INF-gamma administration led to substantial increases in serum neopterin but only a moderate beta 2 -M increase and no increase in the serum sIL- 2 R levels. rIL- 2 administration caused a substantial increase of all three serum immune activation products, consistent with our in vitro findings.
