"Sit down," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to a big <b>lounge</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "I'll send somebody to look after you, and, unless you look a good deal better than you do now, you'll stay right here to-morrow. In the meanwhile, you'll excuse me. There are one or two folks I have {{to see in the}} city." ...|$|E

6000|$|Merril, who {{lay in a}} big <b>lounge</b> <b>chair,</b> little, portly, and immaculately dressed, {{looked up}} at him quietly. [...] "If it's any {{consolation}} to you, I'm holding as much stock as the rest of you put together. The thing hits me rather hard, but, as you say, we can only stand up under it--that is, if the appropriation grants are thrown out by the House." ...|$|E
60|$|There was no {{furniture}} in the room except the wooden bunk in which he lay, and a deerhide <b>lounge</b> <b>chair</b> he had made. The stove-pipe from the kitchen led across part of one corner, and then up again into the room beneath the roof above. It {{had been one of}} Sproatly's duties since the accident to rise and renew the fire soon after midnight, and when Sally arrived he was outside the house, whip-sawing birch-logs and splitting them, an occupation he profoundly disliked.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, it {{happened}} that a little very dapper gentleman who was largely interested in the land-agency and general mortgage business was spending the evening with Hawtrey in Wyllard's room at the Range. He had driven round by Hawtrey's homestead earlier in the afternoon, and had deduced a good deal {{from the state of}} it, though this was a point he kept to himself. Now he lay in a <b>lounge</b> <b>chair</b> beside the stove smoking one of Wyllard's cigars and unobtrusively watching his companion. There was a roll of bills in his pocket which the latter had very reluctantly parted with.|$|E

60|$|The {{color was}} a little plainer in her face than usual when {{she entered the room}} where he lay, pipe in hand, in a <b>lounge</b> <b>chair.</b> His {{attitude}} of languid ease irritated her. She had seen that there were several things outside which should have had some claim on his attention. A litter of letters and papers lay upon a little table at his side, but the fact that he could not reach them as he lay was suggestive. He did not notice her entrance immediately. He rose, when he saw her, and came forward with outstretched hand.|$|E

60|$|There was no {{furniture}} in it whatever, beyond the wooden bunk he lay in, and a deerhide <b>lounge</b> <b>chair</b> {{he had made}} during the winter; but the stovepipe from the kitchen led across part of it, and then up again into the room beneath the roof above. It {{had been one of}} Sproatly's duties during the past two weeks to rise and renew the fire when the cold awakened his comrade soon after midnight. At present he was outside the house, whipsawing birch-logs and splitting them into billets, which was an occupation he cherished a profound dislike for.|$|E
60|$|A {{fortnight}} {{had passed}} away, {{and the special}} boat which had been placed {{at the disposal of}} the rescued tourists was already far north of Assiout. Next morning they would find themselves at Baliani, where one takes the express for Cairo. It was, therefore, their last evening together. Mrs. Shlesinger and her child, who had escaped unhurt, had already been sent down from the frontier. Miss Adams had been very ill after her privations, and {{this was the first time}} that she had been allowed to come upon deck after dinner. She sat now in a <b>lounge</b> <b>chair,</b> thinner, sterner, and kindlier than ever, while Sadie stood beside her and tucked the rugs around her shoulders. Mr. Stephens was carrying over the coffee and placing it on the wicker table beside them. On the other side of the deck Belmont and his wife were seated together in silent sympathy and contentment.|$|E
60|$|He had, in fact, not {{altogether}} recovered his customary good-humor {{when he sat}} on the veranda of Austerly's house some hours later. The meal which Austerly insisted on calling dinner, though he had found it impossible to get anybody to prepare it later than seven o'clock in the evening, was over, {{and the rest of the}} few guests were scattered about the garden. Valentine, who had arrived in the Sorata a day or two earlier, sat at the foot of the short veranda stairway close by the <b>lounge</b> <b>chair</b> where Nellie Austerly lay looking unusually fragile, but listening to the bronzed man with a quiet smile. Austerly leaned on the balustrade, and Anthea sat not far from Jordan. She was, as it happened, looking out through a gap in the firs which afforded her a glimpse of the shining Inlet. A schooner crept slowly across the strip of water, on her way to the frozen north with treasure-seekers.|$|E

60|$|Following her, Bob {{found himself}} on a flat terrace, {{extending}} over {{the whole of the}} house. Several orange trees--in tubs--and many flowers, and small shrubs in pots stood upon it; and three or four light cane-work <b>lounging</b> <b>chairs</b> stood apart.|$|R
