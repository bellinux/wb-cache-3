5|$|The Legend of Zelda: A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective. Players control {{a young boy}} named Link, who embarks on an adventure to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga, the game's primary antagonist. The game is set in two kingdoms—Hyrule and Lorule—both of which bear an open world structure and similar layout, but contrast in style and tone. A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects. The worlds of Hyrule and Lorule in A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds are analogous to A Link to the Pasts depiction of Hyrule and the Dark World. A number of items, enemies, and audio tracks featured in A Link to the Past return in A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds.|$|E

5|$|Through {{ecological}} {{modeling and}} retrospective studies, {{research has shown}} a <b>link</b> <b>between</b> bee colony collapse and climate change. Although the shifting weather conditions themselves negatively affect bees, the <b>link</b> <b>between</b> colony collapse and climate change is also {{closely tied to the}} interaction between bees’ climatic niches and food-plant reductions. Climate change affects the floral environment by stunting flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen and sustain themselves.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E

30|$|Community 3 shows a {{significant}} positive sector homophily (0.41), indicating that firms from the same sector {{are more likely to}} be connected. However, in communities 1 and 3, {{a significant}} negative sector homophily is observed. As seen from Table  3, community 1 has 600 <b>links</b> <b>between</b> firms from the same sector, community 2 has 1073 <b>links</b> <b>between</b> firms from the same sector, and community 3 has 322 <b>links</b> <b>between</b> firms from the same sector. These statistics represent densities of sector homophily of 10 %, 25 % and 5 %, respectively, in each community. Thus, we cannot conclude that sector heterophily exists in communities 1 and 2. However, link saturation may be present, as explained in the previous section, which would decrease the probability of the emergence of new <b>links</b> <b>between</b> suppliers and customers from the same industrial sector. By contrast, in some other communities with a negative sector homophily, we find a low density of <b>links</b> <b>between</b> firms from the same industrial sector (fewer than 0.5 %). In these cases, we can confirm the presence of sector heterophily.|$|R
