40|$|Land-use {{change in}} the {{riparian}} zones has lead to flow of sediments and nutrients into Lake Victoria. Using net present value (NPV) and sensitivity analysis techniques, economic viability of Paspalum, <b>lemon,</b> and elephant <b>grasses</b> as sediment filters under maize production are determined. Findings reveal that grass strips in maize production generates NPVs of 1, 620 Cha− 1, 1, 736 Cha− 1, and 1, 766 Cha− 1 for maize + Paspalum, maize + lemon and maize + elephant grass, respectively, at 5 % discount rate. Sensitivity analyses show, NPVs are stable to varying discount rates but not to yield declines in maize and grasses. Overall, integrated land use to reduce sediment and nutrient fluxes is a more acceptable solution to land-constrained farmersstatus: publishe...|$|R
