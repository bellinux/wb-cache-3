25|$|Mixed {{models are}} widely used to analyze linear {{regression}} relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as <b>longitudinal</b> <b>data,</b> or data obtained from cluster sampling. They are generally fit as parametric models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as normal random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares. Fixed effects estimation is an alternative approach to analyzing this type of data.|$|E
25|$|The Preston {{curve is}} a {{relationship}} found in cross-country data - that is, it holds for a sample of countries taken at a particular point in time. Some research however suggests that a similar relationship does not hold in time series and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>data</b> within individual countries. In particular, per capita incomes between countries have generally diverged over time, while life expectancies, and other health indicators such as the infant mortality rates, have converged (this trend was interrupted in the 1990s with {{the outbreak of the}} AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa). This suggests that over time changes in income may have no impact on health or even be negatively related.|$|E

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} assumed that as people age {{they will become}} less internal and more external, but data here have been ambiguous. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>data</b> collected by Gatz and Karel (cited in Johnson et al., 2004) imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter. Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman's claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be orthogonal. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) (for example, Heckhausen and Schulz (1995) or Ryckman and Malikosi, 1975) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.|$|E
25|$|EPI has {{developed}} several software products to support educators. In 2006, EPI developed the Institutional Student Retention Assessment (ISRA), {{which serves as}} a web-based campus audit system focused on student retention. The ISRA was developed with funding from Lumina Foundation for Education. That same year, with support from TG, EPI created the Effective Practices in Student Success (EPSS) database. The EPSS currently includes 141 programs from across the US and Canada with evidence-based strategies for postsecondary access and success. In 2007, EPI created the Retention Calculator, which calculates the benefit-cost of saving or losing students in higher education institutions and systems. EPI unveiled the EPI-DAS in 2009, a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>data</b> management system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with GEAR UP and other education initiatives to track individual students, collect and analyze data, and generate reports based on findings. EPI-DAS is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the federal government under the No Child Left Behind Act.|$|E
25|$|Jean Macfarlane {{founded the}} University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, {{formerly}} called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute {{was instrumental in}} initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development {{of children in the}} Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather <b>longitudinal</b> <b>data</b> on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.|$|E

Our approach is applied to analyze quality of life data from a recent colorectal cancer clinical trial. Dropout occurs at a high rate and is often due to tumor progression or death. To deal with events due to progression/death, we used a mixture model for the joint distribution of longitudinal measures and progression/death times and use principal stratification to draw causal inferences about survivors.

2500|$|The {{prevalence}} of shyness in some {{children can be}} linked to day length during pregnancy, particularly during the midpoint of prenatal development. An analysis of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>data</b> from children living at specific latitudes in the United States and New Zealand revealed a significant relationship between hours of day length during the midpoint of pregnancy and the {{prevalence of}} shyness in children.

[...] In their analysis, scientists assigned conception dates to the children relative to their known birth dates, which allowed them to obtain random samples from children who had a mid-gestation point during the longest hours of the year and the shortest hours of the year (June and December, depending on whether the cohorts were in the United States or New Zealand).|$|E

2500|$|Shyness is {{most likely}} to occur during {{unfamiliar}} situations, though in severe cases it may hinder an individual in their most familiar situations and relationships as well. Shy people avoid the objects of their apprehension in order to keep from feeling uncomfortable and inept; thus, the situations remain unfamiliar and the shyness perpetuates itself. [...] Shyness may fade with time; e.g., a child who is shy towards strangers may eventually lose this trait when older and become more socially adept. This often occurs by adolescence or young adulthood (generally around the age of 13). In some cases, though, it may become an integrated, lifelong character trait. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>data</b> suggests that the three different personality types evident in infancy easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult tend to change as children mature. Extreme traits become less pronounced, and personalities evolve in predictable patterns over time. What has been proven to remain constant is the tendency to internalize or externalize problems. This relates to individuals with shy personalities because they tend to internalize their problems, or dwell on their problems internally instead of expressing their concerns, which leads to disorders like depression and anxiety. Humans experience shyness to different degrees and in different areas.|$|E
