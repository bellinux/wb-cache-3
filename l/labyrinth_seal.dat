40|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> {{have been}} widely used in {{rotating}} machines. In this paper, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with rectangular tooth used in seawater pump with axial flow distribution were studied. The effects of structure parameters of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> on sealing performance were numerically studied by the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The sealing length was considered as a constant, while the cavity width, cavity depth, tooth width and pressure ratio were varied. A large number of models were calculated to study the effects of various variables on leakage of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals.</b> Firstly, the results show that the effects of the cavity depth on leakage could be ignored compared with that of the cavity width and sealing length. Secondly, the optimal <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with lowest leakage can be obtained with the appropriate values of cavity widths. Furthermore, for a certain pressure ratio, the optimal cavity widths resulting in the lowest leakage were demonstrated to be stable irrespective of the values of cavity depth and sealing length. Finally, increasing pressure ratio gives rise to an increase in the optimal cavity width. It reveals that the higher the pressure ratio is, the longer the cavity width is needed to reduce the leakage...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> may be {{composed}} of many grooves that press tightly inside another axle, or inside a hole, so that the fluid has to pass through a long and difficult path to escape. Sometimes screw threads exist on the outer and inner portion. These interlock, to produce the long characteristic path which slows leakage. For labyrinth seals on a rotating shaft, a very small clearance must exist between {{the tips of the}} labyrinth threads and the running surface. The [...] "teeth" [...] of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> may be on the rotating shaft (Teeth On Rotor - TOR) or on the stator (TOS), or both, in an interlocking configuration.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> {{is a type}} of {{mechanical}} seal that provides a tortuous path to help prevent leakage. An example of such a seal is sometimes found within an axle's bearing to help prevent the leakage of the oil lubricating the bearing.|$|E

50|$|Many {{gas turbine}} engines, having high {{rotational}} speeds, use <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> {{due to their}} lack of friction and long life. Because liquid-filled <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> still generate heat due to the viscosity of the seal oil, and because seal oil can contaminate the process fluids, modern high-performance gas turbines use dry gas seals which use spring-loaded rings with an inert gas in between {{the faces of the}} rings to provide the seal. This creates even lower friction and provides a fluid-free seal.|$|R

Leakage and power loss test results are compared for these competing seals for operating conditions up to 922 K (1200 F) inlet air temperature, 517 KPa (75 psid) across the seal, and surface velocities up to 366 m/s (1200 ft/s) ...|$|R

The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread seal tape or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope.

Detailed results comparing the rotordynamic coefficients and leakage parameters of a slanted-tooth see-through <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> and a straight-tooth see-through <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> are presented. The straight-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> used in this research was originally tested by Arthur Picardo. The slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> was designed and fabricated to be identical to the straight-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> in terms of pitch, depth, {{and the number of}} teeth. The angle of inclination of the teeth in the slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> was chosen to be 65 ? from the normal axis. The seals were tested at an inlet pressure of 70 bar-a (1015 psi-a), pressure ratios of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6, rotor speeds of 10, 200, 15, 350, and 20, 200 rpm, and a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm (8 mils). The experiments were carried out at zero, medium, and high inlet preswirl ratios. The experimental results show only minute differences in the rotordynamic coefficients between the two seals. But, the slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> leaked approximately 10 % less than the straight-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> A study of prediction versus experimental data was done. XLlaby was used for prediction.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a force induced by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> on the {{stability}} of rotor systems and the factors of the seal which affect the stability are investigated. In the analysis, {{it is assumed that}} the fluid in the seal is steady and that the rotor is set vertically {{in order to avoid the}} effects of gravity force. The force induced by the seal is expressed in terms proportional to the velocity and displacement of the rotor and is deduced to that expression for the oil film force in journal bearings. That force is taken into account in the equations of motion; then the stability of the system is discussed by energy concept. The force induced by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> always makes the rotor system unstable, and the tendency is marked when seal leakages are small. The resonance point of the rotor system is also affected by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> (the resonance point of the rotor system is removed by the seal leakages). The force induced by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> was measured by using a water-tunnel experimental system which was designed to measure the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> force by using the similarity between gas and liquid flow theory...|$|E
50|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> on {{rotating}} shafts provide non-contact sealing {{action by}} controlling {{the passage of}} fluid {{through a variety of}} chambers by centrifugal motion, {{as well as by the}} formation of controlled fluid vortices. At higher speeds, centrifugal motion forces the liquid towards the outside and therefore away from any passages. Similarly, if the labyrinth chambers are correctly designed, any liquid that has escaped the main chamber becomes entrapped in a labyrinth chamber, where it is forced into a vortex-like motion. This acts to prevent its escape, and also acts to repel any other fluid. Because these <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> are non-contact, they do not wear out.|$|R
40|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> {{are widely}} used in jet engines to control the air leakage and thus reduce the {{specific}} fuel consumption. The mechanical and thermal interaction of the leakage flow and the rotor/stator has strong influences {{on the performance of}} <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals.</b> In previous numerical studies, such fluid–structure interaction (FSI) effects are usually treated by decoupling the fluid and solid fields. However, fully coupled FSI modeling is indeed required due to the tightly coupled physics. This thesis aims at investigating various mechanical and thermal FSI effects in <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> by means of numerical simulations. In particular, an implicit partitioned approach is applied to study the rotor vibration induced by fluid forces, the fluid–solid heat transfer, and the impact of centrifugal growth. The results show that, periodic oscillations of the rotor can be induced by fluid forces, and the amplitude is linearly dependent on the pressure ratio and mass flow. In the study of thermal and centrifugal effects, the difference between FSI and CFD simulations is discussed in depth, which provides guidelines on the choice of models for future research. Moreover, the influences of various operating conditions on the seal performance are thoroughly investigated in terms of primary dimensionless numbers. Finally, the heat transfer across the fluid–rotor/stator interfaces is discussed in detail. By introducing fully coupled FSI simulations, the current research of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> is enriched in respect of: 1) studying FSI effects that are beyond the scope of individual CFD/CSM simulations; 2) reducing potential errors introduced by single field approximations; 3) obtaining additional information and more accurate predictions of fluid and solid fields...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Leakage resistance measurements were conducted on stepped labyrinth seals using a 4 - 1 scale, two-dimensional, non-rotating test apparatus, with water as the working fluid. By sequentially varying the dimensions of a labyrinth sea], changes in geometrical design parameters were evaluated for their effects on the leakage resistance characteristics of a typical <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> Specific design parameters evaluated were <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> clearance gap, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> step height, and stator annular groove width. All three parameters were tested for a variety of dimensions and flow rates. Each parameter evaluated produced a significant effect on leakage resistance, both acting alone and in conjunction with the other design variables. Non-dimensionalized plots were prepared using the results of the experimental process to show the effects of geometry changes on the performance of labyrinth seals. Beneficial results were gained by the judicious positioning of an annular groove on the stator portion of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> and by increasing the value of the step height. Reduction of seal clearance was confirmed as a means of increasing <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> leakage resistance...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the flow through the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with the shaft of the rotor can {{have an effect on}} the stability of turbomachines. Thus, the excited forces, so-called cross forces or nonconservative forces, arise, which act perpendicular to the rotor eccentricity. This effect is caused by an unsymmetrical pressure distribution within the labyrinth cavities. Experimental studies were carried out for different types of labyrinth geometries: two staggered labyrinths with teeth on the stator and grooved rotor as well as a full and a convergent stepped labyrinth. These labyrinths can be found on the tip shrouding of bladings in steam or gas turbines. The following parameters were varied in the test facility: geometry of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> (number of cavities, inlet region), shaft rotation, pressure difference on the seal, entry swirl and eccentricity of the rotor. The results are presented for stiffness coefficients of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals,</b> leakage flow and circumferential flow in each cavity which was measured with special probes. Generally, the inlet swirl has the greatest influence on the coefficients of the seals. The experimental results were compared with theoretical results and were in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|A {{wave energy}} plant {{based on the}} {{patended}} Seawave Slot-Cone Generator (SSG) is under development by the Norwegian company WAVEenergy AS. The concept {{is based on the}} principle that the incoming waves will run uphill on a structure slope and on their return downhill they will flow into multiple reservoirs at different levels. A turbine with multiple stages is being designed to handle the conversion of the potential energy from the different reservoirs. One critical design element of the so-called Multi Stage Turbine (MST) is the choice of labyrinth seals. The labyrinth seals need to be designed in a way that prevents air from leaking into the suction side of the turbine stages. The company Mechanica AS has suggested a design where the labyrinth seals are pressurized by leading water from above the turbine through orifices to the lower <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> A model has been made and the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> has been tested. The model does not include the turbine, but only the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> with appropriate pressure conditions. Additionally, a CFD model of the seal was made, and the calculated results were compared with the test results. Seing that the CFD results showed relatively good correlation with the test results, the CFD model was used to make some further simulations of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> performance. The most important conclusion of both model and CFD results is that the orifices appear to sufficiently pressurize the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> It is not known if this will still be the case when the seal is implemented in the turbine. And although the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> should meet the requirement to prevent air leakage, it may still reduce the efficiency of the turbine by causing disturbances in the turbine flow. This must be considered when deciding upon the final MST design, where eventually manufacture practicality and cost are the main regulators. </p...|$|E
