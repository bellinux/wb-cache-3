We study a {{weakening}} {{of the notion of}} <b>logical</b> <b>relations,</b> called pre-logical relations, that has many of the features that make <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> so useful as well as further algebraic properties including composability.

Pre-logical relations are the minimal weakening of <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> that gives composability for extensional structures and simultaneously the most liberal definition that gives the Basic Lemma. The use of pre-logical relations in place of <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> gives an improved version of Mitchell’s representation independence theorem which characterizes observational equivalence for all signatures rather than just for first-order signatures.

Then the gloomy station, the shadowy blanketed Mexican, the empty room, the dim lights across the square, the tramp of the dancers and vacant laughs and discordant music, the door flung wide and the entrance of the cowboy. She did not recall how he had looked or what he had done. And the next instant she saw him cool, smiling, devilish--saw him in violence; the next his bigness, his apparel, his physical being were vague as outlines in a dream. The white face of the padre flashed along in the train of thought, and it brought the same dull, half-blind, indefinable state of mind subsequent to that last nerve-breaking pistol-shot. That passed, and then clear and vivid rose memories of the rest that had happened--strange voices betraying fury of men, a deadened report, a moan of mortal pain, a woman's poignant cry. And Madeline saw the girl's great tragic eyes and the wild flight of the big horse into the blackness, and the dark, stalking figure of the silent cowboy, and the white stars that seemed to look down remorselessly.|$|E

However, most of current numeric ANNs are not good at representing <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> because these models still try to represent <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> in the form of ratio based on functional approximation. On the other hand, researchers have been trying to design novel neural network models to make neural network model represent <b>logical</b> <b>relations.</b> In this work, a novel neural network model specified for representing <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> is proposed and applied. New neurons and multiple kinds of links are defined. Inhibitory links are introduced besides exciting links. Different from current numeric ANNs, one end of an inhibitory link connects an exciting link rather than a neuron. Inhibitory links inhibit the connected exciting links conditionally to make this neural network model represent <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> correctly. This model can simulate the operations of Boolean logic gates, and construct complex <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> with the advantages of simpler neural network structures than recent works in this area. This work provides some ideas to make neural networks represent <b>logical</b> <b>relations</b> more directly and efficiently, and the model could be used as the complement to current numeric ANN to deal with logical issues and expand the application areas of ANN...|$|R
