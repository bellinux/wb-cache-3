40|$|Snow-driven {{mountain}} {{systems in}} the American West may be particularly sensitive sentinels of regional climate change as manifested by altered snowcover and hydrologic characteristics, changes in plant communities and biogeochemical fluxes, and seasonal shifts in energy budgets. Integrated monitoring could reveal to resource managers early evidence of emerging trends, and nearer-term disturbances, in local and regional mountain processes and the ecosystem services they provide. Modelers benefit from field verification of their forecasts, and mountain system process researchers can also utilize monitoring infrastructure. The Senator Beck Basin Study Area has been developed in the western San Juan Mountains near Silverton, Colorado by the Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies. The San Juan Mountains are a significant contributor to the Colorado River Basin and are the primary headwater of the Rio Grande River. SBBSA is a 290 ha catchment spanning elevations from 3353 to 4118 m and contains alpine tundra at the highest elevations, sub-alpine forest at the lowest, and a krumholz ecotone between.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the airborne electromagnetic (AEM) system {{operated by the}} Joint Airborne geoscience Capability (JAC), a partnership between the Finnish and British Geological Surveys. The system is a component of a 3 -in- 1, fixed-wing facility acquiring magnetic gradiometer and full spectrum radiometric data alongside the wing-tip, frequency-domain AEM measurements. The AEM system has recently (2005) been upgraded from 2 to 4 frequencies and now provides a bandwidth from 900 Hz to 25 kHz. The fixed-wing configuration of 4 dual vertical coplanar coils, offers a high signal/noise {{by virtue of the}} wingspan separation of the sensors. This unique configuration allows 3 -in- 1 surveys to be successfully performed at a variety of survey elevations when regulatory conditions are imposed. Its deployment on a twin-engine aircraft also permits low altitude surveying in countries, such as the UK, where this is a requirement. The development of the new AEM- 05 system has been incremental and its history can be traced back over five decades. The AEM data acquired in the Finnish National Mapping project, and across northern Europe, have been used extensively in mineral exploration. More recent projects have investigated the application of the data to environmental, hydrogeological and land quality issues. These studies have been enhanced by reducing the flight line separation from 200 m (the national high-resolution scale) to 50 m. Our surveys also increasingly involve the application of AEM across populated areas often with extensive infrastructure. Additional secondary instrumentation has been introduced to provide an increased understanding of the data and the AEM responses observed. The secondary systems include an accurate, high sampling rate laser altimeter, a downward-looking digital camera to record the flight path, a 50 / 60 Hz power <b>line</b> <b>monitor</b> and a GPS gyroscope. The paper is intended as an overview and provides descriptions of the new AEM system, the secondary systems now employed and some of the software used to provide accurate and levelled AEM data. Recent applications of the system are reviewed and the challenging nature of the new subsurface information being revealed is demonstrated. ...|$|E

50|$|Tents must {{register}} with the <b>line</b> <b>monitors</b> (students in charge of overseeing and enforcing K-ville rules and regulations) prior to setting up. There are three types: Black registration, which is the longest and most intense option in which the use of actual tents was forbidden in the past. In addition to this, all 12 tenters used to sleep in K-ville during black tenting. Today, however, tents are allowed during Black registration and only 10 people must sleep in the tent. Blue registration is the next period, in which a tent can register at any time before approximately two weeks prior to the game; after this, White registration goes into effect, which is significantly more complicated. For Blue registration, a tent group need only give their names to the <b>line</b> <b>monitors</b> and start tenting. However, for White registration, students must meet the <b>line</b> <b>monitors</b> at a location on campus that is disclosed on a website at a specified time; {{this results in a}} hectic dash to the location once it is made public.

40|$|Generally, federal {{agencies}} tasked to oversee power grid reliability {{are dependent on}} data from grid infrastructure owners and operators {{in order to obtain}} a basic level of situational awareness. Since there are many owners and operators involved in the day-to-day functioning of the power grid, the task of accessing, aggregating and analyzing grid information from these sources is not a trivial one. Seemingly basic tasks such as synchronizing data timestamps between many different data providers and sources can be difficult as evidenced during the post-event analysis of the August 2003 blackout. In this project we investigate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of deploying a network of wireless power line monitoring devices as a method of independently monitoring key parts of the power grid as a complement to the data which is currently available to {{federal agencies}} from grid system operators. Such a network is modeled on proprietary power line monitoring technologies and networks invented, developed and deployed by Genscape, a Louisville, Kentucky based real-time energy information provider. Genscape measures transmission line power flow using measurements of electromagnetic fields under overhead high voltage transmission power lines in the United States and Europe. Opportunities for optimization of the commercial power line monitoring technology were investigated in this project to enable lower power consumption, lower cost and improvements to measurement methodologies. These optimizations were performed in order to better enable the use of wireless transmission line monitors in large network deployments (perhaps covering several thousand power lines) for federal situational awareness needs. Power consumption and cost reduction were addressed by developing a power <b>line</b> <b>monitor</b> using a low power, low cost wireless telemetry platform known as the ''Mote''. Motes were first developed as smart sensor nodes in wireless mesh networking applications. On such a platform, it has been demonstrated in this project that wireless monitoring units can effectively deliver real-time transmission line power flow information for less than $ 500 per monitor. The data delivered by such a monitor has {{during the course of the}} project been integrated with a national grid situational awareness visualization platform developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Novel vibration energy scavenging methods based on piezoelectric cantilevers were also developed as a proposed method to power such monitors, with a goal of further cost reduction and large-scale deployment. Scavenging methods developed during the project resulted in 50 % greater power output than conventional cantilever-based vibrational energy scavenging devices typically used to power smart sensor nodes. Lastly, enhanced and new methods for electromagnetic field sensing using multi-axis magnetometers and infrared reflectometry were investigated for potential monitoring applications in situations with a high density of power lines or high levels of background 60 Hz noise in order to isolate power lines of interest from other power lines in close proximity. The goal of this project was to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of using small form factor, highly optimized, low cost, low power, non-contact, wireless electric transmission line monitors for delivery of real-time, independent power line monitoring for the US power grid. The project was divided into three main types of activity as follows; (1) Research into expanding the range of applications for non-contact power line monitoring to enable large scale low cost sensor network deployments (Tasks 1, 2); (2) Optimization of individual sensor hardware components to reduce size, cost and power consumption and testing in a pilot field study (Tasks 3, 5); and (3) Demonstration of the feasibility of using the data from the network of power line monitors via a range of custom developed alerting and data visualization applications to deliver real-time information to federal agencies and others tasked with grid reliability (Tasks 6, 8) ...|$|E
