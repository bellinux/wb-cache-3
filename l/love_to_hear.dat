500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in <b>love.</b> <b>To</b> <b>hear</b> the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Perfection" [...] {{began as}} an {{instrumental}} track by the Soul Seekerz that samples [...] "Turn The Beat Around (<b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hear</b> Percussions)", which was originally performed by disco singer Vicki Sue Robinson. [...] Simon Langford decided to sample the song after watching the end credits for the film The Specialist. Langford excited by his song idea phoned his writing partner Julian Napolitano. Two days later, Napolitano had completed close to {{seventy percent of the}} song, much to the surprise of Langford, who had been preoccupied with paper work. After completing the instrumental track, the group were approached by All Around the World Records, who wanted to use the track for a song by Minogue. Minogue, Rob Davis and Therese Grankvist then wrote lyrics to accompany the music composed by the Soul Seekerz.|$|E
500|$|Music critics met the {{recording}} with positive reviews. Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix described the song as [...] "full of summer sunshine" [...] and praised Stan and Muñiz's voices for [...] "effortlessly compliment one another", {{and the use}} of the Spanish language. He further wrote that he [...] "can totally see DJs around the world remixing to no end. [...] <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this song in Ibiza as [...] part the day and the night away". An editor from Antena 1 noted the song's commercial appeal. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] debuted at number 43 on Billboard Mexico Espanol Airplay on the week ending 13 May 2017, reaching its peak position at number six on 29 July 2017. On 22 July, the song also peaked on the Mexico Airplay compiled by the same magazine at position 16.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would {{have to put up}} the shutters... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.|$|E
500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that anyone knew about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in the hell do you know about that? It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E
2500|$|Syndicated radio {{personality}} Dr. Demento regularly features Jones' {{music on}} his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in The Band's song, [...] "Up on Cripple Creek". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: [...] "I can't take {{the way he}} sings, but I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him talk.") Novelist Thomas Pynchon is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, Spiked! (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy I.Q. shows a man demonstrating {{the sound of his}} new stereo to Meg Ryan's character by playing a record of Jones' music.|$|E

2500|$|On the November 26, 2005 {{episode of}} Impact!, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett {{was shocked and}} frightened by Gayda's {{unexpected}} appearance and soon ordered her backstage. He was heard saying, [...] "It's not what you think." [...] After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, {{the same thing happened}} in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there {{had nothing to do with}} a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, she turned on the television to see Kim in her place. She said she had a big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> but did not reveal what it was.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{some of his}} contemporaries, Jones {{stuck with}} country music with a vengeance. [...] Jones never reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and almost never had any of his music played on {{mainstream}} popular music stations in his career. Ironically, without even trying, Jones' unabashed loyalty to strictly country arrangements attracted the admiration of musicians and songwriters {{from a wide range}} of genres. [...] In an often-quoted tribute, Frank Sinatra called Jones [...] "the second best singer in America". [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, [...] "George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'," [...] and in his autobiography Chronicles, Dylan states that in the early 1960s he was largely unimpressed by what he heard on the radio and admits [...] "Outside of maybe George Jones, I didn't listen to country music either." [...] Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons was an avid George Jones fan and covered Jones' song [...] "That's All It Took" [...] on his first solo album. [...] In the documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Pamela des Barres recalls seeing Parsons singing Jones' song [...] "She Once Lived Here" [...] at an empty Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles: [...] "It was my peak, peak moment, not sitting on Jimmy Page's amp...that was my peak moment." [...] Parsons reignited Keith Richards' interest in country music in the early seventies and after Jones' death in 2013 the guitarist wrote, [...] "He possessed the most touching voice, the most expressive ways of projecting that beautiful instrument of anyone I can call to mind. [...] You heard his heart in every note he sang." [...] Richards recorded [...] "Say It's Not You" [...] with Jones for The Bradley Barn Sessions in 1994 and recalls in his autobiography hearing him sing for the first time when the Rolling Stones and Jones were on the same show in Texas in 1964: [...] "They trailed in with tumbleweed following them, as if tumbleweed was their pet. [...] Dust all over the place, a bunch of cowboys. But when George got up, we went whoa, there's a master up there." [...] In the documentary The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Mick Jagger also cites Jones as one of his favorite country singers. [...] John Prine mentions Jones in his song [...] "Jesus the Missing Years". [...] Jones fan Elvis Costello had a surprise hit in the UK when he covered [...] "A Good Year For The Roses" [...] in 1981. [...] Elliott Smith told an interviewer about his idea of Heaven: [...] "George Jones would be singing all the time. [...] It would be like New York in reverse: people would be nice to each other for no reason at all, and it would smell good." [...] In a 2001 interview with Mark Binelli from Rolling Stone, Leonard Cohen asked, [...] "Have you heard George Jones' last record Cold Hard Truth? [...] I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> an old guy lay out his situation. [...] He has the best voice in America," [...] and the day Jones died, Cohen performed [...] "Choices" [...] on stage in Winnipeg, Canada as a tribute to the country legend. [...] In 2013, Robbie Robertson told Uncut, [...] "He was the Ray Charles of country music - the one who could make you cry with his voice...We wouldn't listen to country music, the guys in The Band, but we'd listen to George Jones..." [...] Robert Plant told Uncuts Michael Bonner in 2014, [...] "I now have to listen to George Jones once a day. [...] Amazing singer. [...] What a singer." [...] James Taylor, who wrote [...] "Bartender's Blues" [...] with Jones in mind and sang background vocals with him on the recording, told Rolling Stone, [...] "He sounds like a steel guitar. [...] It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. [...] The dynamic of it is very tight and very controlled - it's like carving with the voice." [...] Other disparate artists who recorded with Jones include Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook, Mark Knopfler, the Staples Singers, Leon Russell, B.B King, Blackberry Smoke and Linda Ronstadt. [...] In 1995, Burt Reynolds wrote, [...] "He is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies." ...|$|E
