25|$|The IBM Selectric {{typewriter}} was {{a highly}} successful model line of electric typewriters introduced in 1961. Expensive Typewriter, written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch, was a text editing program that ran on a DEC PDP-1 computer at MIT. Since it could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printer),</b> it may be considered the first word processing program, but the term word processing itself was only introduced, by IBM's Böblingen Laboratory in the late 1960s.|$|E
50|$|A <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printer</b> {{was a form}} of {{computer}} impact printer that was able to print with the quality typically expected from a business typewriter such as an IBM Selectric.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printer</b> {{operates}} {{in much the}} same fashion as a typewriter. A metal or plastic printwheel embossed with letters, numbers, or symbols strikes an inked ribbon, depositing the ink (or carbon, if an expensive single-strike ribbon was installed) on the page and thus printing a character.|$|E
5000|$|Daisy wheel {{printers}} {{operate in}} much the same fashion as a typewriter. A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the [...] "daisy wheel", each petal containing a letter form at its tip. The letter form strikes a ribbon of ink, depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character. By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing. These printers were also referred to as <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printers</b> because they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter. The fastest <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printers</b> printed at 30 characters per second.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Letter-quality</b> impact <b>printers,</b> however, were slow, noisy, {{incapable}} of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and {{limited to a}} fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer [...] "Near Letter Quality" [...] (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel printers, could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than [...] "letter quality". Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printers</b> in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old <b>letter-quality</b> impact <b>printers</b> (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).|$|R
50|$|The {{hard copy}} {{delivery}} service was later discontinued {{due to the}} high operating cost, the increasing availability of <b>letter-quality</b> home <b>printers,</b> and {{the increased use of}} email.|$|R

It was written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch. In the spirit of an earlier editor, named [...] "Colossal Typewriter", it was called [...] "Expensive Typewriter" [...] {{because at the time}} the PDP-1 {{cost a lot of money}} (approximately 100,000 USD).|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{the older}} 9-pin models, a new 24-pin impact printer not only {{produced}} better-looking NLQ text, it printed the page more quickly (largely due to the 24-pin's ability to print NLQ with a single pass). 24-pin printers repeated this feat in bitmap graphics mode, producing higher-quality graphics in reduced time. While the text-quality of a 24-pin was still visibly inferior to a true <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printer</b> - the daisy wheel or laser-printer, the typical 24-pin impact printer printed more quickly than most daisy-wheel models.|$|E
50|$|Messages {{destined to}} postal {{addresses}} were laser printed at an MCI Mail print site, {{placed in an}} envelope and mailed via the U.S. Postal Service. The cost was $1 to $2 per page. The service was attractive because there were few affordable <b>letter-quality</b> laser <b>printers</b> available to consumers at the time. Most consumers could only afford low quality dot matrix printers, which were not suitable for business correspondence. It also saved {{a trip to the}} post office.|$|R
5000|$|Specialized editing {{functions}} are provided using the terminal keypad. A few functions can be commanded simply by pressing a keypad key, but a far {{wider range of}} functions can be commanded by prefixing them with the [...] "Gold Key" [...] (the PF1 key on the keypad, colored gold on systems equipped with the WPS-8 custom keycaps). This style of [...] "gold key" [...] editing also became standard at Digital, later showing up in mainstream general-purpose text editors such as KED and EDT {{as well as the}} [...] "ALL-IN-1" [...] office system. The editing facilities include making a selection and then using cut and paste (much like today's word processors, but using keys marked for cut and paste, rather than a mouse). Printing is to any of several different <b>letter-quality</b> daisy wheel <b>printers</b> including a DEC variant of the Diablo 630.|$|R
40|$|This is {{an example}} of a NURP Congress Paper. Use a single column format in A 4 paper (21 Ox 297 mm). Type the title of the paper in upper and lower case with 14 point bold typeface. The author’s name(s) (in order of last name and initials) with 14 point typeface. L For author(s) from a {{different}} institution, start with a new line. Do not use titles (i. e. Prof, Ph. D., Mr., etc.). Title(s) of author(s) may be given as a footnote at the bottom of the first page of the paper e. g. Student, Senior Lecturer, etc. The affiliation of the author(s) should be printed with 12 point italic typeface below the list of author(s). The title, list of authors and affiliation(s) should be centered. Your paper should begin with an abstract of about 200 words (or within 10 lines). Do not include references or equations in the abstract. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS You may type directly on A 4 size sheets. Use a <b>LETTER-QUALITY</b> or LASER <b>PRINTER</b> but avoid using a dot matrix printer. Use the following margins: 33 mm top margin, 38 mm bottom margin, 26 mm left margin, 20 mm right margin. T e text should be justified and typed in BLACK using TIMES ROMAN font (or similar font if not possible) with 12 poin...|$|R
50|$|In its favor, the Adam {{had a large}} {{software}} library from the start. It was derived from and compatible with the ColecoVision's software and accessories, and, in addition, the popular CP/M operating system was available as an option. Its price gave a complete system: an 80 kB RAM computer, tape drive, <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printer,</b> and software including the Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom video game. The IBM PCjr sold for $669 but included no peripherals, and although the popular Commodore 64 sold for around $200, its price was not much lower after {{the purchase of a}} printer, tape or disk drive, and software.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston Phoenix, {{observing that}} Adam's $600 price was {{comparable}} to the lowest price for a <b>letter-quality</b> <b>printer</b> alone, stated [...] "a nice trick {{if they can do}} it!" [...] It was a trick; the computers were shown behind tinted glass that hid {{the fact that they were}} hand-made and had non-working tape drives. In June Coleco promised to ship the computer by August. In August it promised to ship a half million Adams by Christmas, but missed shipping dates of 1 September, 15 September, 1 October, and 15 October. Ahoy! reported that Coleco had not shipped by early October because of various problems. Each month of delay could mean losing the opportunity to sell 100,000 units, the magazine reported, adding that missing the Christmas season would result in [...] "inestimable losses". CEO Arnold Greenberg promised in late September to ship by [...] "mid-October", but claimed that Adam was [...] "not, primarily, a Christmas item". The printer was the main cause of the delays; after it failed to function properly at demonstrations, by November InfoWorld reported on [...] "growing skepticism" [...] about its reliability, speed, and noise.|$|E
