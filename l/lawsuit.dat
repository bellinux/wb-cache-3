5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a <b>lawsuit</b> was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the <b>lawsuit</b> to be destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. The <b>lawsuit</b> was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations. A new <b>lawsuit</b> was filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that <b>lawsuit</b> was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 an Australian {{non-profit}} organisation called Australia for Dolphins (featured {{in the documentary}} The Killing Cove) launched a world-first <b>lawsuit</b> against the brokers of the drive hunts, the Taiji Whale Museum. The <b>lawsuit,</b> known as the Action for Angel case, alleges that the museum illegally refused entry to dolphin welfare observers, and aims to open the museum up to public scrutiny. The <b>lawsuit,</b> which is ongoing, {{is expected to reach}} an outcome in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, a $100 million <b>lawsuit</b> {{was filed}} against Tarantino by filmmakers Oscar Colvin Jr. and Torrance J. Colvin, {{who claimed that}} the script for Django Unchained bears {{extensive}} similarities to their film, titled Freedom. The <b>lawsuit</b> was filed in a federal court in Washington, DC. On January 24, 2017, the <b>lawsuit</b> was dismissed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lawsuits</b> are {{a fact of}} {{life for}} most major corporations, organizations, and agencies. Over the course of a typical year, they may be {{involved}} in dozens of <b>lawsuits</b> over a wide variety of issues. Customers and users sue over products or services. Employers sue over workplace issues. Suppliers sue–or get sued–over contract issues. Or they initiate <b>lawsuits</b> to protect their products, services, employers or suppliers. <b>Lawsuits</b> are a fairly routine cost of doing business. However, some <b>lawsuits</b> have an impact that is far beyond the routine. They may start quietly or with a splash of headlines, but the results may impact the life or bottom line of a company, its products, services or practices, or the industry as a whole. Some companies survive such <b>lawsuits,</b> as Microsoft survived after the Justice Department’s antitrust <b>lawsuits</b> in the 1990 's. Other companies don’t, as witnessed by the original Napster...|$|R
50|$|The film {{itself has}} been the subject of two <b>lawsuits.</b> Relativity Media has {{concluded}} that due to these <b>lawsuits,</b> the film will never be profitable. Both of these <b>lawsuits</b> have to do with songs used within the film not being attributed to their creators.|$|R
40|$|My study {{examines}} why some <b>lawsuits</b> {{against the federal}} government involve multiple states while others involve single states. I compare two multi-state <b>lawsuits</b> against two single-state <b>lawsuits.</b> For each case, I examine public opinion, the state attorneys general (SAGs) who represent {{the states in the}} <b>lawsuits,</b> and the SAGs’ political ambition. The results indicate that on the one hand, in multi-state court cases, a majority of the national public opposes the federal law. On the other hand, in single-state <b>lawsuits,</b> a majority of the national public supports the federal law. In multi-state <b>lawsuits,</b> states join the litigation only if the members of the SAGs’ political party oppose the federal law. SAGs join multi-state <b>lawsuits</b> to obtain political capital because of their ambition to run for reelection or for another political office. My thesis suggests that courts are being used for a partisan political game and states are suing because of public opinion, not because the federal government is violating the law...|$|R
5|$|On November 21, the California <b>lawsuit</b> {{was dropped}} {{in order to}} merge with the Minnesota <b>lawsuit.</b> Boies hoped that the move would {{speed up the process}} since the courts will likely merge the suits as they are similar {{complaints}} seeking the same outcome.|$|E
5|$|The ResCap RMBS {{were issued}} before the sub-prime {{mortgage}} crisis, and the <b>lawsuit</b> dates from 2008. The <b>lawsuit</b> {{alleged that the}} prospectuses and registration statements issued by UBS, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs did not adequately disclose the risks of the RMBS and were, in fact, misleading to investors, who sustained heavy losses. The <b>lawsuit</b> alleged that {{the behavior of the}} three defendants violated securities laws.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lawsuit</b> demands {{monetary}} {{compensation for}} the lawyers the start-up had to hire, {{as well as for}} damages. They are also asking Apple to immediately stop producing dual-lens cameras systems. The iPhone X is not included in the <b>lawsuit,</b> despite having a dual-lens camera.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} seven <b>lawsuits</b> {{have been filed}} against the commission. Five of the plaintiffs in the {{different}} <b>lawsuits</b> are non-profit organizations that include: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU v. Trump and Pence), the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, NAACP (NAACP v. Trump), Public Citizen, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The <b>lawsuits</b> by the first two groups involve the lack of transparency of the commission’s meetings, whereas the <b>lawsuits</b> by the last two groups involve the collection by the commission of personal private data. In addition to the <b>lawsuits,</b> complaints have been filed with federal agencies against two of the commission's members.|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, Hood filed <b>lawsuits</b> {{against a}} number of {{pharmaceutical}} companies. In the <b>lawsuits,</b> Hood alleged that the companies were engaging in an unlawful scheme to [...] "force the state to pay for drugs that were not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement." [...] Overall, Hood filed six separate <b>lawsuits</b> against the 18 defendant companies.|$|R
5|$|Trump University {{was also}} the subject of two class action <b>lawsuits</b> in federal court. The <b>lawsuits</b> {{centered}} around allegations that Trump University defrauded its students by using misleading marketing practices and engaging in aggressive sales tactics. The company and the <b>lawsuits</b> against it received renewed interest due to Trump's candidacy in the 2016 presidential election. Despite repeatedly insisting {{that he would not}} settle, Trump settled all three <b>lawsuits</b> in November 2016 for a total of $25 million after being elected to the presidency.|$|R
5|$|ABC News denied BPI's claims, {{and called}} the <b>lawsuit</b> without merit. ABC News sought to have the case removed from South Dakota state court to federal court. In June 2013, a federal judge sent the <b>lawsuit</b> back to state court. On March 27, 2014, South Dakota state court Judge Cheryle Gering {{rejected}} ABC's motion to dismiss, and allowed the defamation suit to move forward. Diane Sawyer's motion for summary judgment was granted and she was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|After Kaga left Nintendo, {{he founded}} a studio called Tirnanog and began {{development}} on a game titled Emblem Saga, a strategy role-playing {{game for the}} PlayStation. The game bore multiple similarities to the Fire Emblem series, and Nintendo filed a <b>lawsuit</b> against Tirnanog for copyright infringement. The first suit failed, and the court ruled in Tirnanog's favor. Nintendo filed a second <b>lawsuit,</b> and this time was awarded a cash settlement of ¥76 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the title, though they {{changed its name to}} Tear Ring Saga, and eventually developed a sequel. Nintendo attempted taking a third <b>lawsuit</b> to the Japanese Supreme Court in 2005, but the second ruling was upheld.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>lawsuit</b> {{was filed}} by a South Carolina {{resident}} {{who said he}} was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown Columbia, with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver. The <b>lawsuit</b> also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases and removed from Internet video sites.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason is}} risk of <b>lawsuits.</b> Some bloggers have faced multimillion-dollar <b>lawsuits</b> (although they were later dropped completely); {{anonymous}} blogging provides protection against such risks.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2008 the Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that the RIAA had dropped its program of mass <b>lawsuits</b> in favor of cooperative enforcement agreements {{with a number of}} ISPs. The RIAA still reserves the right to file <b>lawsuits</b> against 'particularly flagrant' offenders, but the article predicted these <b>lawsuits</b> would [...] "slow to a trickle." ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{frequently}} cited {{criticism of the}} RIAA's <b>lawsuits</b> is that they use an assembly line approach to <b>lawsuits,</b> {{trying to get the}} same result in every case no matter the evidence, trying to carry out the <b>lawsuits</b> and settlements in the most efficient way, and acting as if <b>lawsuits</b> are a standard part of business. This case is somewhat notable because the judge, the Honorable Colleen McMahon, appears to agree with some of those criticisms in a dialog with Mike Maschio, an RIAA attorney: ...|$|R
5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a <b>lawsuit</b> against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The <b>lawsuit</b> followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The <b>lawsuit</b> was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain. On June 12, 2008, Atlantic Records filed a <b>lawsuit</b> against Weiland and Eric Kretz, {{claiming}} the two had threatened to terminate their contract unless changes were made. Stone Temple Pilots had delivered six albums (five studio records and the compilation, Thank You) and Atlantic wanted a seventh album with an option for two more. In a statement made by email, the band said they were surprised and disappointed by the <b>lawsuit.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the $14 million production, a <b>lawsuit</b> {{was filed}} by several extras who alleged {{that they were}} told to strip naked during a shower scene, but the <b>lawsuit</b> was {{determined}} to be without merit. The film was released in the United States and Canada in October 1998 to mixed reviews and made under $9 million. The main actors won several minor awards for their performances.|$|E
50|$|The {{book was}} finally {{published}} in paperback in 1992 after <b>lawsuits</b> alleging libel were dismissed {{by the various}} courts and their decisions affirmed upon appeal. The <b>lawsuits</b> and their attendant rulings have become important and oft-cited cases {{in the areas of}} 'media law' and 'freedom of speech'. After publicity generated by the <b>lawsuits,</b> the book became a bestseller.|$|R
5000|$|Civil <b>lawsuits</b> {{against the}} Crown in its public {{capacity}} (that is, <b>lawsuits</b> against the government) are permitted; however, <b>lawsuits</b> against the Monarch personally are not cognisable. The Sovereign, {{and by extension}} the Governor General, also exercises the [...] "prerogative of mercy," [...] and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial.|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{decision}} in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain {{to keep the}} door ajar for <b>lawsuits</b> alleging violations of international law under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) {{has important implications for}} the U. S. government 2 ̆ 7 s prosecution of the war on terrorism. Unlike 2 ̆ 2 first wave 2 ̆ 2 ATS <b>lawsuits</b> against other aliens, or 2 ̆ 2 second wave 2 ̆ 2 ATS <b>lawsuits</b> against multinational corporations, what I call the 2 ̆ 2 third wave 2 ̆ 2 of ATS <b>lawsuits</b> are directed at the U. S. government itself. This third wave has already manifested itself in ATS <b>lawsuits</b> arising out of U. S. mistreatment of prisoners held in Iraq, alleged mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, and the rendition of suspected terrorists to third countries. My goal in this symposium essay is neither to celebrate nor to condemn this coming wave of ATS litigation. Rather, my more modest task is to describe examples of these new ATS <b>lawsuits,</b> explain why the Sosa decision will not prevent such <b>lawsuits,</b> and to suggest how these <b>lawsuits</b> will highlight the role of the executive branch in the administration of international law by U. S. courts. As a doctrinal matter, the executive branch has a crucial, yet unexplored, role to play in the application of international law by domestic courts. The third wave ATS <b>lawsuits</b> will test the importance of this role...|$|R
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust <b>lawsuit</b> against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the <b>lawsuit</b> only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Chen filed {{a class-action}} <b>lawsuit</b> {{on behalf of}} women from Linyi against the city's family {{planning}} staff. And in June, he traveled to Beijing to file the complaint and meet with foreign reporters to publicize the case. Although there had been prior instances of Chinese citizens filing complaints about abuses under the one-child policy, Chen’s initiative was the first class-action <b>lawsuit</b> to challenge its implementation.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, a <b>lawsuit</b> by the Alliance Defense Fund, a {{conservative}} Christian {{group in the}} United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the <b>lawsuit,</b> {{the decision was made}} to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.|$|E

5|$|In April 1949, Northwest Airlines {{sued the}} Glenn L. Martin Company, {{manufacturers}} of the Martin 2-0-2, for $725,000. The <b>lawsuit</b> {{claimed that the}} company had sold the airline five defective aircraft, including the aircraft lost in Flight 421. Glenn Martin, president of the aircraft manufacturing corporation, dismissed the <b>lawsuit</b> as a mere formality, a bit of meaningless legal maneuvering to appease disagreeing insurance companies.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} most <b>lawsuits</b> were kept {{confidential}} but one attorney estimated that Ford settled 1,500 cases regarding {{the safety of}} the Explorer. Ford's own financial statements indicate that it spent $590 million to settle personal injury and class action <b>lawsuits.</b> Firestone set aside $800 million to handle <b>lawsuits</b> related to the recalled tires. In 2000 Firestone was served with 413 individual <b>lawsuits</b> in state and federal courts. By July of 2002 Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone had settled more than 600 cases. By late 2003 Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford had settled 1,300 cases.|$|R
