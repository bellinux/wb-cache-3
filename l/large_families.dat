5|$|Over {{the coming}} years, an {{additional}} 13 supplementary laws were promulgated that further marginalised the Jewish community in Germany.

5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form <b>large</b> <b>families</b> {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} women {{of her class}} and era, Lady Rosebery patronised {{a great number of}} charities. Her chief causes appear to have all been {{connected}} specifically to the assistance and welfare of women. She was president of the Scottish Home Industries Association, a charity which encouraged Scottish women to work profitably from home making plaid or other items of needlework and the like. In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained in their homes able to care for their often <b>large</b> <b>families</b> while still earning an income.|$|E

30|$|Households, {{who have}} <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size, have a {{significant}} {{and at the same}} time negative relationship with Prosopis invasion. This means that <b>larger</b> <b>family</b> size contributes <b>large</b> <b>family</b> labour to use Prosopis as source of income or more labour is available in the house for fuel wood collection. Therefore, households who have <b>larger</b> <b>family</b> sizes have a lower probability to be invaded by Prosopis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Large</b> <b>family</b> {{cars were}} usually around 4.50 m in length {{by the early}} 1990s, but are now {{shifting}} to 4.80 m or more in length. Examples of <b>large</b> <b>family</b> cars include the Ford Mondeo, Opel/Vauxhall Insignia, Peugeot 508, and Volkswagen Passat. <b>Large</b> <b>family</b> cars can also be flagships such as the Citroen C5, Honda Accord, Luxgen S5, Mazda6, Mitsubishi Galant and the Škoda Superb.|$|R
5|$|Stews {{are basic}} fare {{for every day}} family cooking and are always served with {{vermicelli}} rice or plain rice. They are popular because they provide {{a wide range of}} nutrients from the meat, the vegetables and the rice. The extra liquid is also essential in such dry climate. Stews are also economically beneficial, as they provide relatively small amount of meat into feeding <b>large</b> <b>families,</b> especially within the poorer population.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} <b>large</b> <b>families</b> by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. <b>Large</b> <b>families</b> received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to the Dominican Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order; and several <b>large</b> <b>families.</b> Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E
30|$|Family size {{measured}} in terms of adult equivalent is an indicator of labor availability, and it has a positive influence to participate in off-farm activities. This is consistent with the results by Tassew et al. (2000) {{in such a way that}} <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size increases the households’ participation in off-farm works since a <b>larger</b> <b>family</b> size requires relatively higher marginal income. This means that participation in off-farm activities can maintain the burden of <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size. Thus, households with <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size would have abundant labor and send some of the family members to off-farm activities.|$|R

5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. <b>Large</b> <b>families</b> of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E
