In this study, the load-carrying behavior of connected foundations for transmission tower structures was investigated focusing {{on the effect of}} the <b>load</b> <b>direction</b> based on the field experimental testing program. Improved performances of connected foundations were observed for <b>load</b> <b>directions</b> of both θ= 0 ° and 45 ° considered in this study. The downward settlements at the compressive side for θ= 45 ° were larger than those for θ= 0 °, while the upward displacements were similar. For both vertical and lateral displacements, the use of connected foundations was more effective for θ= 45 °, and the effectiveness became more pronounced as the connection-beam stiffness increased. However, the lateral load-carrying capacities for θ= 0 ° and 45 ° were not significantly different for all connection-beam conditions. From the prototype-scaled model load tests, it was confirmed that the use of connected foundations for transmission tower structures is similarly effective for different <b>load</b> <b>directions.</b> Based on the test results, it was suggested that a unified design methodology is applicable for the stability analysis of transmission tower structures subjected to different <b>load</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R

40|$|A primary {{function}} of external fixator is {{to stabilize the}} fracture site after fracture reduction. Conventional fracture reduction method would result in fixator configurations deviated from its neutral configuration. How the non-neutral configurations would affect the biomechanical performance of unilateral external fixators is still not well-documented. We developed a finite element model to predict the fixation stiffness of the Dynafix unilateral external fixator at arbitrary configurations under compression, torsion, three-point, and four-point bending. Experimental testing was done to validate the model using six Dynafix unilateral external fixators in neutral and particular non-neutral configurations. Effects of <b>loading</b> <b>directions</b> on bending stiffness were also studied. It appeared that the model succeeded in revealing the relative stiffness of the neutral and non-neutral configuration in all the loading conditions. Our results also demonstrated that bending stiffness could vary substantially for different <b>loading</b> <b>directions</b> and the principle <b>loading</b> <b>directions</b> could be very different for different fixator configurations. Therefore, a more logical way to compare the bending stiffness is to identify the principle <b>loading</b> <b>directions</b> of each fixator configuration and used their maximum and minimum bending stiffness as comparison criteria. Given that fixator configurations could substantially change the stiffness properties of the bone-fixator system, computer simulation with finite element modeling of this kind will provide useful clinical information on the rigidity of certain configurations in stabilizing the fracture site for bone healing.

40|$|The complex tri-layered {{structure}} of the aortic valve (AV) results in anisotropic quasi–static mechanical behaviour. However, its influence on AV viscoelasticity remains poorly understood.

This study attempts to characterise the time-dependent behaviour of the AV at different strain and load increments, and to gain insight into {{the contribution of the}} microstructure to this behaviour. Uniaxial incremental stress-relaxation and creep experiments were undertaken, and the experimental data analysed with a generalised Maxwell model, to determine the characteristic time-dependent parameters. Results showed that the time dependent response of the tissue differed with the <b>loading</b> <b>direction,</b> and also with the level of applied load or strain, in both stress-relaxation and creep phenomena.

Before yielding, the strain was mainly accommodated between horizontal lamellae. Nevertheless, some vertical lamellae were stretched to break when the material approached yielding. At the yield point, many melt spots and deformation bands across vertical lamellae emerged. Some vertical lamellae became highly stretched and their thickness reduced significantly while the neighboring horizontal lamellae rotated towards the <b>loading</b> <b>direction.</b> At the upper shoulder of neck, the melt spots near the poles of spherulites enlarged and elongated in the stress direction, meanwhile, strain-induced crystals appeared in the melt spots. Furthermore, many vertical lamellae were broken into short fragments and some horizontal lamellae were sheared in the <b>loading</b> <b>direction</b> when the adjacent vertical lamellae were stretched heavily. In the tapered section of the neck, the original beta-spherulites were shattered due to excessive crazing and deformation bands and some highly drawn material domains were formed. In rum, more shear bands were generated roughly along the <b>loading</b> <b>direction.</b> The horizontal lamella fragments rotated towards the <b>loading</b> <b>direction</b> and fed into the material flow continually. Finally, the lamella-spherulite structure was converted into an oriented fibril structure in the cold drawn material.
