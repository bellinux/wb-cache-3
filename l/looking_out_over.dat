Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked {{the positions of the}} three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lifestream, Tifa helps Cloud {{reconstruct}} his memories. Cloud {{was never}} accepted into SOLDIER, instead becoming a low-ranking infantryman. The SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud was injured, but fatally wounded Sephiroth, who only survived due to Jenova. Cloud and Zack were then taken for experiments by Hojo, with Zack escaping {{four years later}} with a catatonic Cloud. The two were eventually cornered by Shinra soldiers, and Zack was killed; the combined trauma of his experience, the experiments and Zack's death triggered an identity crisis, with Cloud constructing a false persona around Zack's stories and his own fantasies. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud recovers and together with Tifa reunites with the party. It is revealed that Aerith's prayer to the Planet was successful: the Planet had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor's impact, but Sephiroth blocked Holy. After killing Hojo {{when he tries to}} aid Sephiroth, who is revealed to be Hojo's biological son, the party descends into the Planet's core and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and Holy is summoned, attempting to block Meteor as it descends on Midgar. As Meteor is too close, Holy cannot block it, but the Lifestream rises from the planet and aids Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.|$|E

25|$|Pridelands and African Savannah – Giraffes, zebras and {{ostriches}} are all {{found in}} one large enclosure which is first viewed from above on a boardwalk, while springbok and white rhino share the opposite enclosure. An expansive walk-through aviary located {{next to the}} giraffe enclosure is home to masked lovebirds, meerkats and leopard tortoises. This area also offers ground level views <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> a watering hole to the giraffes and zebras, and is themed to resemble a rocky escarpment tumbling down onto the savannah. Continuing along the path, is the lion enclosure which is home to four female lions. The Pridelands area of the zoo also features Greater flamingos, Hamadryas baboons, two cheetah brothers and servals. An African themed cafe named 'The Watering Hole', is located in this precinct next to the lions and flamingos.|$|E
25|$|The fictional {{history of}} Westeros {{stretches}} back some twelve thousand years. The Ice and Fire story {{can be considered}} to be set in a post-magic world where people no longer believe in dragons and the Others. The characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but the magical elements like the Others are not within their understanding. Coming from an impoverished family background of former wealth, Martin always felt attracted to stories of fallen civilizations and lost empires. The lost empire of Valyria in Ice and Fire was once a high civilization similar to Rome before the Dark Ages. These elements may give the story a poignant sadness. The Wall, which Martin believes to be unique in fantasy, was inspired by Martin's visit to Hadrian's Wall in the North of England close to the border with Scotland. <b>Looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the hills, Martin wondered what a Roman centurion from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north. The size, length and magical powers of the wall were adjusted for genre demands. Similarly the Titan, an extremely large statue in the city of Braavos, is comparable to the real life Colossus of Rhodes.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} David Scarpa started writing {{a draft of}} the script in 2005, Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox and felt a {{responsibility}} to remake the film. Scarpa felt everything about the original film was still relevant, but changed the allegory from nuclear war to environmental damage because [...] "the specifics of [...] we now have the capability to destroy ourselves have changed." [...] Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay. He scrapped Klaatu's speech {{at the conclusion of the}} story because [...] "audiences today are willing to tolerate that. People don't want to be preached to about the environment.

500|$|... "To The Last Man" [...] {{was filmed}} {{alongside}} [...] "Adam" [...] {{as part of}} Block 1 of production. It was originally intended to be the fourth episode transmitted. The scenes featuring Toshiko and Tommy on the Penarth Pier were recorded, in between heavy rainfall, on 9 May 2007 and marked the first significant location shoot for the second series. Scenes set in Toshiko's flat were also filmed this day at a house in Palace Road, Cardiff. The episode's final scene, showing Toshiko and Owen <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> Cardiff Bay was recorded 10 May. Cardiff Royal Infirmary provided the interior locations for scenes set in the fictional St Teilo's military hospital which were filmed between 12 and 18 May. The pub where Toshiko and Tommy play pool was the Eli Jenkins on Bute Street, Cardiff. The Red Cross emblem is used throughout the episode; the closing credits include the attribution: [...] "Thanks to the British Red Cross for {{permission to use the}} Red Cross emblem." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{four-year}} {{association with}} Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius's early career. The {{first of the}} major works was the orchestral A Song of Summer, based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of A Poem of Life and Love. In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to [...] "imagine that we {{are sitting on the}} cliffs in the heather, <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the sea". This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking. The other major work, a setting of Walt Whitman poems with the title Songs of Farewell, was an even more alarming prospect to Fenby: [...] "the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings..." [...] combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work—yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932. Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its [...] "hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in A Mass of Life". Payne describes the work as [...] "bracing and exultant, with in places an almost Holstian clarity".|$|E
