He pitched the film {{at the start of}} 2007 and began production <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> completing it in May 2008. Prestos gag based format was heavily influenced by classic cartoons. Looney Tunes cartoons directed by Tex Avery were a major influence, with Alec being easily compared to Bugs Bunny. Other influences include Tom and Jerry, the Marx Brothers, and Charlie Chaplin. The character design for Presto was based on William Powell.|$|E
5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete. He was replaced <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, {{who used a}} clever ploy {{to get through the}} blockade: waiting until winter, when the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand troops with many provisions on them, and sailed unmolested to Crete.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 1894 the ship, {{now under}} the command of Captain Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was ordered back to the Mediterranean.

25|$|While light snowfalls are {{not unusual}} on {{the peaks of}} the Porongurup and Stirling Range, it is very unusual for snow to fall to ground level {{anywhere}} in Western Australia. However, snow has been recorded in Mount Barker on several occasions. On 28 August 1992, with a maximum temperature of 7.2 degrees Celsius, two falls of snow were recorded. That same year, on 19 November, a light snowfall was recorded just two weeks before summer, this was <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> snow had been recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole of Western Australia.|$|R

In November, the band brought Gigantour to Australia with a lineup including Static-X, DevilDriver and Lacuna Coil.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a granivore {{and adapted}} for {{the consumption of}} seedheads, with a conical beak {{to remove the seeds}} and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> for a finch. This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, Delaware was initially tasked with readiness training off the East Coast. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> she was deployed to Europe {{as part of the}} US Navy's Battleship Division Nine, under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman. The force arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. In July 1918, Delaware was withdrawn from overseas service and returned to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1945, {{cities and}} {{industrial}} {{facilities in the}} Japanese home islands were under sustained attack from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers based in the Mariana Islands. Attacks by Allied submarines and surface ships had also cut most of the country's trade routes, and US Navy aircraft carrier task groups had raided locations in the home islands on several occasions. Shortages of fuel had confined most of the Imperial Japanese Navy's surviving ships to port and forced them and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to hold its air units in reserve against the Allied invasion that {{was expected to be}} launched <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Prior to the war, the Japanese military had assessed that coastal artillery was no longer suited to the country's circumstances. As a result, only a few strategic ports were protected by artillery capable of engaging enemy warships, and most of these guns were of relatively small calibers.|$|E
5|$|Encounter {{was badly}} damaged while {{refitting}} at Malta {{a few weeks}} after arriving in the Mediterranean and was briefly reassigned to Force H after her repairs were completed before rejoining the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> the ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet at Singapore and spent several months in early 1942 on convoy escort duties under the control of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM). She was one of the Allied ships retasked to intercept Japanese invasion convoys during the Dutch East Indies Campaign in February 1942 and participated in the Battle of the Java Sea. Encounter was sunk a few days later in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and most of her crew was rescued by a Japanese ship the next day. About a quarter of them died in captivity {{before the end of the}} war in 1945. The ship's wreck was discovered in 2007 and had been almost totally destroyed by illegal salvagers by 2016.|$|E

40|$|Coincident with {{developments}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temporal-cortical {{explicit memory}} network, long-term recall abilities are newly emer-gent <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>year</b> of human life.

5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln about 14 April 1209, after a papal command to the cathedral chapter to elect a new bishop, as Lincoln had again been without a bishop since 1206. During the summer of 1209, Hugh, along with his brother, was one of the councilors of King John urging the king to settle with Pope Innocent III before the pope excommunicated the king. However, {{negotiations}} with papal representatives got nowhere, and the king was excommunicated on 8 November 1209. Hugh and his brother Jocelin had continued to support King John until this, two years after many of their fellow bishops had deserted the king, but by <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> Hugh left the king's service and went into exile.|$|E
