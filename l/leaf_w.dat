A precise estimation of the biomass is necessary for evaluation {{and management of the}} plantation. Therefore, through assessing forest structure, this study would address on estimation of biomass of young mangrove plantations. Study plots were set up in 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 year old Kandelia candel (L.) Blanco plantations in Thai Binh River Mouth, Northern Vietnam. Twenty six tree individuals in the plots were harvested. Tree height (H); diameter at 0. 3 m in height (D), D*H; D 2 and D 2 *H were used as variables for estimate plan parts, <b>leaf</b> (<b>w</b> L), branch-stem (w BS), propagules (w P) and total dry weight (w T).

40|$|Mango is an {{important}} fruit crop that is extensively grown in India and in many other tropical countries. The crop is attacked by about 492 species of insec ts, 17 species of mites and 26 species of nematodes in the world level of which 188 species have been reported from India (Tandon and Verghese, 1985; Srivastava, 1998). Among the insect pes ts, mango <b>leaf</b> <b>w</b> ebber, Orthaga euadrusalis and O. exv inacea Hampson, (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a major pest responsible for low productivity. The heavily infested trees present a burnt look and severe infes tation results in complete failure of f low ering (Verghese, 1998). It is widely distributed in different agro-climatic zones of India and has gained the status of serious pest in UP, Uttarachchal and AP (Singh et al., 2006). The mango leaf webber is a major pes t in intensively cropped areas of Andhra Pradesh and heavy infestation by this pest adversely affects the flower {{as well as the}} growth of new flush (Kavita et al., 2005). Ninety percent of the completely defoliated/skeletonized shoots dried and did not fruit in coming season (Gajendra Singh, 1988).

40|$|Sisal (Agave sisalana Perrine) {{accounts}} for about {{one half of the}} world's production of hard fibers. In spite os its economic importance pratically no research work has been carried out on this plant. Very {{little is known about the}} agronomic problems of its cultivation, while the physiological and genetic problems are nearly unknown. This is perhaps due to the fact that A. sisalana is a perennial plant with a life cycle of 5 - 8 years and the carrying out of field research work requires a great deal of time and is very expensive. This paper, the first of a series to be published on the agronomic problems of sisal cultivation, presents the data obtained from field trials on distance of planting and its relation to weight and number of leaves produced. The experiments were carried out at the Ribeirão Preto and Pindorama Experiment Stations of the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas. Sisal bulbils about one year old were planted in the latter part of 1939 in 4 randomized blocks of 9 plots each where different distances between and within the rows were used. Production data were obtained by cutting the leaves at one year intervals begining 2 ½ years from date of planting in the field. Only those leaves that were attached to the plant at an angle greater than 45. ° in relation to the main axis of the plant were cut each year. Only in the trial at Ribeirão Preto the leaves were counted and weighted by plants. In the poling plants all leaves than existing were taken off, even the youngest ones adjacent to the pole (flower stalk). Descorticator machine for fiber extraction was not available, so that reliable data on fiber yield could not be obtained. A "probable" fiber yield was obtained by using 3 % of <b>leaf</b> <b>w</b> r eight as a basis for calculations. This percentage is recognised as an average fiber content usually obtained from sisal leaves. From the data obtained from the spacing trials described in this paper the following conclusions can be drawn : 1. The life cycle from date of field planting to poling stage of most of the sisal plants in these trials varied from 5 to 8 years. A very small number of plants however had not poled even after 8 years when the present experiments were ended. 2. The life cycle of the sisal plants showed a close relationship to planting distances. At the greater planting distances the plants tended to pole much earlier than at closer planting distances. 3. It was observed that there was a marked seasonal incidente of poling. The flower stalk of almost all plants have appeared during the period of January to March. 4. A marked effect to the distance os planting on plot yields, as measured by total leaf weight, was observed. The greater the density of plants per unit area the greater the leaf production. 5. Under present leaf cutting practice, e. g., to cut yearly only the leaves at an angle greater than 45. ° in relation to the main axis of the plant, the shorter distances between the rows are not recommended. The narrow spacing between rows not only restricts the passage of workers, but also hinders adequate cultivation (weeding and sucker growth control). 6. The planting distances of 2 x 2 meters (2500 plants per hectare) was the worst spacing tried. Besides giving a low plant density per unit area it prevents ingress to the planting from any direction. 7. To increase plant density per unit area the closing up of plants within rows is more indicated than closing up the distance between rows. 8. The advantages of the distances of planting between rows of 2. 40 or 3. 00 meters and 1. 20 meters within rows, under present leaf cutting practice, are many. It facilitates weeding, control of suckers growth, and leaf cutting operations...|$|E
