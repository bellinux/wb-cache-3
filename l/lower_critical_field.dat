40|$|Domains in non-centrosymmetric {{materials}} represent {{regions of}} different crystal structure and spin-orbit coupling. Twin boundaries separating such domains display unusual properties in non-centrosymmetric superconductors (NCS), where magneto-electric effects influence the local <b>lower</b> and upper <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>fields.</b> As a model system, we investigate NCS with tetragonal crystal structure and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), and with twin boundaries parallel to their basal planes.

40|$|We {{investigate}} both numerically and analytically the behaviour of a spin- 1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) isotropic Heisenberg {{chain in}} an external magnetic field. Extensive DMRG studies of chains up to N= 80 sites extend previous analyses and exhibit the well known {{phenomenon of the}} closure of the Haldane gap at a <b>lower</b> <b>critical</b> <b>field</b> H_c 1. We obtain an estimate of the gap below H_c 1. Above the <b>lower</b> <b>critical</b> <b>field,</b> when the correlation functions exhibit algebraic decay, we obtain the critical exponent {{as a function of the}} net magnetization as well as the magnetization curve up to the saturation (upper critical) field H_c 2. We argue that, despite the fact that the SO(3) symmetry of the model is explicitly broken by the field, the Haldane phase of the model is still well described by an SO(3) nonlinear sigma-model. A mean-field theory is developed for the latter and its predictions are compared with those of the numerical analysis and with the existing literature. Comment: 11 pages, 4 eps figure...|$|E
