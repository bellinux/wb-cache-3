50|$|As was {{expected}} {{in such an}} agricultural region, the bulk of traffic came from shipping agricultural produce. On the MVR this included watercress, wheat, fruit (especially strawberries and apples), milk and cattle. The LSWR put on special market-day trains, with both passenger carriages and <b>livestock</b> <b>cars,</b> allowing farmers to accompany their livestock. There were local 'pick-up/set-down' goods services along the line, which called at every station to deliver and pick up any waiting goods. No shunting engines were stationed on the MVR, so the locomotive working the train had to uncouple at each station and marshal wagons {{into and out of}} the train as required- standard practice for a rural line. Heavier freight services were often powered by locomotives such as the Drummond 700 Class.|$|R

25|$|Although {{diamonds}} were {{a significant}} motivating and sustaining factor, {{there were other}} means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming {{through the use of}} forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, <b>livestock,</b> <b>cars,</b> and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But the most important reason why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.|$|R

50|$|Belding’s ground {{squirrels}} are prey {{for various}} predators such as coyotes, bobcats, weasels, eagles and badgers. Ground squirrels will also perceive humans, <b>livestock</b> and <b>cars</b> as threats. Ground squirrels have two specific alarm calls used to warn others of predators. One call, {{known as the}} churr call or the trill, is made {{of a series of}} more than five notes given rapidly. These calls are given for predators that pose less immediate threats, usually terrestrial predators. Individuals that are close to the alarm caller will respond by standing on their back legs (posting), running on a rock {{to get a better view}} of the predator or by returning to their core area.|$|R
2500|$|John Bonham {{was shot}} {{with his wife}} Pat and son Jason Bonham on their country estate, Old Hyde Farm in Worcestershire. It is {{interesting}} to note that part of his fantasy includes him spending time at home with his family. Bonham was known for falling into deep depressions while on tour away from his family. His heavy drinking, which ultimately resulted in his death, is partly attributed to his homesickness. The sequence also shows Bonham doing various work around his farm, showing off his <b>livestock</b> and <b>cars,</b> and jamming with his 5-year-old son while he plays a miniature drum kit. The game of snooker was shot at The Old Hyde Hotel and the Triumph riding near Blackpool. His fantasy sequence is the most straightforward of all the members—according to the Led Zeppelin biography Hammer of the Gods, Bonham simply chose to [...] "be himself". The sequence ends with Bonham drag racing an AA Fueler at 260mph at Santa Pod Raceway, Wellingborough, Northants, UK, in October 1973, and its thematic music is the instrumental [...] "Moby Dick." ...|$|R
40|$|This Other {{comprises}} a 10 minutes {{film that}} narrates {{the story of}} the research project - the aim of which is to establish links between people livestock and wildlife in the Kenyan Maasai Mara. It is produced by ILRI and Colorado State University. The kenyan Maasai Mara is home to the Maasai people who herd their livestock across the open plains. These plains also sustain a wide variety of wildlife, as well as forming the venue for a huge yearly East African migration of Animals. Maasai, wildlife and livestock have lived together for centuries. However recent population growth, shrinking pastures and other resources, and changes in land laws means the Maasai might soon have to plant crops to survive. If that happens, it will be the end of wildlife - and the Maasai way of life. Dr. Robin Reid, a scientist from ILRI, leads a team of community members and researchers. Their project has taken them across the Mara plains, day and night, throughout the seasons and years, to count anything that moves there - wildlife, <b>livestock,</b> people, <b>cars</b> and even dogs. They want {{to find out more about}} the relationship between all the parts of this complex eco-system, so that they can make a difference - before it is too late...|$|R
40|$|Ramiro Solis {{was born}} on December 28, 1922 in Tekax Yucatán, México {{attended}} school and learned to read and write, however, after his father passed away, {{everyone in the family}} had to start working. Ramiro left school to work with his father’s former Chinese countrymen who paid Ramiro $ 0. 02 cents a row for harvesting herbs and he would earn $ 0. 10 -$ 0. 12 cents a day for his work. He went on to work as a roper (one who makes ropes) in Mérida, Yucatán. Then there was a decline in jobs, and the Mexican government began pushing for unemployed men to enter the Bracero Program. In 1957 he entered the Bracero Program. At that time he was already married with five children, two boys and three girls, so Ramiro entered the program to support his family. To enter the program, Ramiro had to show that he worked in agriculture for at least five years, had the calloused hands to prove it. He was hired into the Ranchers Association and traveled into the United States via trains, in <b>livestock</b> <b>cars.</b> At the reception center, workers were left without money or food and they had to sell water to try to buy food. Shortly after, he was sent to the Rosie Labor Camp to pick strawberries for $ 0. 57 cents an hour. When he worked with the Association of Watsonville he was paid $ 0. 57 cents per hour and he was pressured to work like other local workers who got paid by the box whereas the Ramiro and other braceros were earning $ 0. 57 cents per hour. The amount that a local worker earned a week was roughly between $ 14. 00 to $ 14. 75. Ramiro states that they (braceros) could work hard all day and never fill one box. He describes himself and other braceros being treated as animals because the bosses wanted the braceros to work just as hard and fast as the local workers. Ramiro states that one could work on Saturday and Sunday because there was always work. Ramiro developed friendships with the cooks on the labor camps and through these relationships he was able to get jobs more easily. In a typical day, the braceros in the labor camp that Ramiro worked would wake up at 5 a. m., eat breakfast and take their bag lunch to the field. At noon, they would break for lunch for half an hour and then work until 3 p. m. If there were more strawberries to harvest, then they would work longer until 5 p. m., otherwise, they only worked eight hours. At the end of the day, the braceros were told by the bosses that they were required under contract to clean the tools used in harvesting the strawberries. The braceros cleaned what they had to, sometimes for six hours without pay. The Braceros ate Mexican food at the camp and they were charged $ 1. 75 a day for food. The boss would deduct the cost of food from their earnings. Although the food was not always good, the braceros were given enough food to eat. Ramiro describes the housing to be a barrack with a hundred beds in rows. The braceros would place their clothing under the bed. The shower had 10 to 15 showers line up next to another and the braceros showered together. The braceros washed their clothes in machines, however Ramiro states that he did not wash his clothes, but rather purchased second hand clothing inexpensively. Personal toiletries were not provided by the bosses. Checks were issued out the 15 th and 30 th of each month. Ramiro sent the bulk of his check and usually kept $ 5 -$ 6 for himself. He did have instances where he had issues with being paid or the having deductions, however he was always able to work out the issue. Ramiro left {{at the end of the}} season and in the following year he was unable to return as a bracero because he had tuberculosis. Ramiro stayed in México working and submitting paper work so he could move to the United States legally; it took five years. Ramiro describes the experience of being a bracero as a time where they were exploited. Ramiro states that they were worked hard for very little money and that he didn’t realize this until he began working outside of the Bracero Program and found that one could be paid based off of how hard one worked. Ramiro feels that the bosses took advantage of the workers. For Ramiro, the Bracero Program was not a positive experience...|$|R
