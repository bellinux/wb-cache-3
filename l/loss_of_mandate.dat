This research studied thirty-one mandates in six Canadian subsidiaries of U. S. -owned multinational corporations.

First, it was shown {{that there is a}} risk in having a full-scope world product mandate, because it is possible to become marginal to the corporate strategy. Second, it was observed that the engine of subsidiary growth is its distinctive capabilities, and that for a mandate to be effective it must be built on those capabilities.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of enhancement or depletion of subsidiary charters {{is driven by}} {{two different types of}} organizational units and the environment. (1) The parent is ultimately responsible for the establishment of subsidiaries and will greatly impact its evolution by involvement. (2) Evolution is also largely contingent on the subsidiary’s choice. (3) The environment is critical in the evolutionary process as changes in the environment will influence the parent and subsidiary in their choices (Birkinshaw, 1996; Birkinshaw and Hood, 1998; Cantwell and Mudambi, 2005). The thesis sets out to investigate the drivers and effects <b>of</b> <b>mandating</b> on subsidiary evolution within the MNE. The departure in this thesis from the literature is its specific focus on how mandates are lost in complex networked Multinational Enterprise’s (MNE) and the effect this has on subsidiary resources and relationship development. This thesis bases its empirical analysis on data collected from two qualitative rounds of interviews collected in two Swedish multinational enterprises, Alfa and Beta, and 36 of their foreign subsidiaries based in Europe, China, India and N. America. This yielded 112 interviews, the first round of interviews investigates the headquarters drivers <b>of</b> <b>mandating</b> and the network characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mandated</b> subsidiaries. It became apparent during this first round that mandates were lost by subsidiaries quite often and that they continued operating. These counterfactuals informed the second round of interviews, here the focus zooms in on the consequences <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> R&D <b>mandates</b> on subsidiary evolution. Specifically, the thesis examines the resource and relationship characteristics of the focal subsidiaries and the impact <b>of</b> <b>mandate</b> <b>loss.</b>   The study builds on four essays that taken together suggests if the MNE relocates mandates with the purpose of accessing resources, efficiency seeking, or as a response to endogenous and/or exogenous pressures, the process <b>of</b> <b>mandating</b> presents subsidiaries, that are not wound-down, spun-off or closed, with the opportunity and space to evolve its charter. This has far-reaching possible consequences for both the subsidiary and the MNE not least in resource and relationship combinations and orchestration and managing capabilities. Secondly, the thesis calls into question the importance <b>of</b> <b>mandates</b> and that researchers should {{pay more attention to the}} formal and informal tenets <b>of</b> <b>mandates</b> i. e. the combinations <b>of</b> <b>mandate</b> relationships and resources. The mandate is a well established indicator of the subsidiaries formal activities and responsibilities, however, it is not indicative of the informal behavior of a subsidiary which in this thesis is shown to be important in equal parts for the subsidiary’s evolution...|$|R

25|$|As {{the supply}} {{situation}} worsened for the Greeks, things improved for the Turks. After the Armistice of Mudros, the Allies had dissolved the Ottoman army, confiscated all Ottoman weapons (rifles, machine guns, artilleries, aeroplanes and warships) and ammunition, hence the Turkish National Movement {{which was in}} the progress of establishing a new army, was in desperate need of weapons. In addition to the weapons not yet confiscated by the Allies, they enjoyed Soviet support from abroad, in return for giving Batum to the Soviet Union. The Soviets also provided monetary aid to the Turkish National Movement, not {{to the extent that they}} promised but almost in sufficient amount to make up the large deficiencies in the promised supply of arms. One of the main reasons for Soviet support was that Allied forces were fighting on Russian soil against the Bolshevik regime, therefore the Turkish opposition was much favored by Moscow.

40|$|From Kate Edgerton-Tarpley (3 / 27 / 09, 4 : 03 p. m.) : Attending Panel 44, “Visualizing Order: Images and the Construction of Legal Culture in Ming and Qing China” {{inspired}} me to continue Paul Katz’s discussion of religion — as well as law and ritual — for a moment. Both Katz’s paper on representations of underworld justice in late imperial China and Yanhong Wu’s paper on legal order in Ming case stories and illustrations provided fascinating examples of ghosts, spirits, birds, and leaves entering courtrooms to either exonerate an innocent person or condemn a guilty one. Katz argued that Underworld justice was seen as less corrupt than the law system for the living, so women and others who had trouble getting justice often turned to it. The discussant, Edward Farmer, then {{made the point that}} there was a need for this alternative justice system because imposing and upholding hierarchy, rather than bringing about justice, was the main concern of the official legal system. I thought, however, that some of the examples offered in the papers, both Yanhong’s and Thomas Buoye’s, did show a real concern with justice in the official courts. Perhaps the degree of concern for justice in official courts could be a topic for future discussion. Panel 44, as well as comments made by Keith Knapp during his presentation on “Magistrates and Miracles” in panel 118 on “The <b>Mandate</b> <b>of</b> Heaven at the Local Level in Imperial China,” both highlighted the need to acknowledge how real, important, and powerful the religious aspects of Confucianism (not to mention Daoism and Buddhism) were for official as well as everyday life in imperial China. These panels demonstrated a fascinating degree of interplay or, as Katz termed it – a continuum between official duties and religious duties, between official courts and underworld courts, between human plaintiffs and ghost/spirit plaintiffs, between the human and the supernatural. In the Great Leap Famine panel tomorrow morning (# 139), I plan to touch upon the impact — in terms of official responses to famine — that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Mandate</b> <b>of</b> Heaven idea and religious constructions of famine and drought had in 1959 - 61...|$|R
