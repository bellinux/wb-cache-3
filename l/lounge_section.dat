50|$|The Class of 1968 was {{the first}} to {{graduate}} from the current campus on Cervantes Street. In the fall of 1967, the modern complex of cinder blocks, tile floors and recessed lighting opened its doors to an estimated 800 sophomores, juniors and seniors. The new building was able to offer educational opportunities which were not available at the old THS because of cramped conditions. Among the improvements mentioned were a cafeteria and library located within the building, a student <b>lounge,</b> departmental <b>sections</b> and a landscaped patio.|$|R
2500|$|Passenger service {{became an}} issue in Florida {{during the early years}} of the labor strike, which {{essentially}} lasted 14 years, from 1963 to 1977. At the insistence of the City of Miami – which had long fought to get rid of the tracks in the downtown section just north of the county courthouse – Miami's wooden-constructed downtown passenger terminal was demolished by November 1963. Although a new station was planned at NE 36th Street and NE 2nd Avenue, it was never built. Further, while freight trains were operated with non-union and supervisory crews, passenger runs were not reinstated until August 2, 1965, after the City of Miami sued and the Florida courts ruled that the FEC corporate charter required both coach and first class passenger services to be offered. In response, FEC sold [...] "parlour car seating" [...] for first class accommodations in the rear <b>lounge</b> <b>section</b> of a tavern-lounge-observation car. [...] This new state-mandated passenger service consisted of a single diesel locomotive and two streamlined passenger cars, which, in addition to the operating crew, were staffed by a passenger service agent and a coach attendant, who were [...] "non-operating." [...] The mini-streamliner operated all of the way across three previously observed crew districts (Jacksonville to New Smyrna Beach to Fort Pierce to Miami). [...] Following the letter of the law, the train carried no baggage, remains, mail or express; honoured no inter-line tickets or passes; and the only food service was a box lunch (at Cocoa-Rockledge in 1966). On-board beverage service was limited to soft drinks and coffee. [...] Without a station in Miami, the 1950s era station in North Miami became the southern terminus. [...] The service operated six days a week until it was finally discontinued on July 31, 1968.|$|E

5000|$|Right Now! is a 1966 studio album by Mel Tormé.

50|$|Within cars, Dreyfuss applied several {{techniques}} {{to break up}} the space and make it less linear.

Similarly, in the sixth, a parlor car, he broke the seating into two sections with a small private compartment, seating six, in between them. The dining room had three sections. Two of them were conventional seating, but the middle section was made up of tables for two people seated side-by-side, facing the center aisle.

In Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the formal parades are held in specially constructed arenas called Sambadromes (Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí in Rio, and the Anhembi Sambadrome in São Paulo) designed by influential architect, Oscar Niemeyer. The Sambadromes are designed to accommodate all social classes, with VIP <b>lounges,</b> tourist <b>sections,</b> and various types of seating right down to cheapest seats for poorest sections of the community. Those who choose to only watch the parade may also be charged for the best seats.

The [...] "alas" [...] represent different components of the school's theme, or [...] "enredo", as they act out a homage to a myth, historic event or figure, or express their view on a social, environmental or international issue. The [...] "alas" [...] display distinct costumes or [...] "fantasias" [...] and also reflect traditional samba school roles developed years ago. Thus, each samba school parade has the [...] "comissao de frente"; individuals who open the parade by walking in social attires, saluting the crowds; the [...] "ala das Baianas", or the traditional segment of Bahian African-Brazilian ladies with impressive round dresses spinning through the avenue; the [...] "puxadores" [...] (lead singers) singing the [...] "samba-enredo" [...] or theme-song while they play the [...] "cavaquinho" [...] or other string instruments; the [...] "velha guarda", or veterans who made history in the school; the [...] "bateria", or samba band with drums, [...] "cuicas" [...] and other instruments, preceded by the [...] "madrinha da bateria", or band godmother who is often a sexy female celebrity. The [...] "porta-bandeira", or the female flag holder, and the [...] "mestre-sala", or male cortsy, display and salute the school's flag, as they dance and strive to show harmony and samba expertise, as their performance is carefully observed and scored by the judges.|$|R
50|$|The arena's main {{concourse}} {{wraps around}} the entire arena, with two separate concourses {{for the upper}} levels on {{the north and south}} sidelines. The main entrance is at a lower level, with the Monarchs Pro Shop, offices and ticket offices located here. The entry level also provides a direct access to a club <b>lounge</b> deck above <b>section</b> 101, which is often used for in-event performances and promotions. The club lounge is located directly above the deck, in lieu of luxury suites. The arena has several luxury boxes, with a second level of boxes on the east and west sides of the interior. The arena has two levels, with the upper deck being curved along the top. The second level of luxury suites on the sidelines raise the upper decks on either side above the level of the end zone upper decks, and as such the four quadrants of the upper deck are essentially separate. The wall above the upper deck is painted tan, with the seats being either tan or red. The arena has a standard four-sided scoreboard, with four video boards and a combination of dot matrix and seven-segment displays. There are also several video ribbons, both in dot-matrix and LED, located along the facades of the end zone upper decks, which serve as alternate scoreboards and occasionally display out-of-town scores. The arena floor level is expandable for larger events by movable seats, and events using an end zone staging area typically use the eastern end zone for the stage.|$|R

Celebrity chefs will occasionally make appearances at the ballpark's restaurants and help prepare food for fans in premium seating {{over the course of}} the season. Above Monument Park in center field is the Mohegan Sun sports bar, whose tinted black glass acts as the ballpark's batter's eye. After the 2016 season, the Yankees began doing updates to Yankee Stadium including the Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck and Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace. The Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck above the Mohegan Sun sports bar is an outdoor gathering space in center field with clear full views of the playing field available to all ticketed guests. The Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace overlook the visitors' and Yankees' bullpens respectively.
