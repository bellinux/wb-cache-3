In awarding the prize to Rabindranth, the Nobel committee stated: [...] "because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West" [...] The Nobel committee recognized him as [...] "an author who, in conformity with the express wording of Alfred Nobel's last will and testament, had during the current year, written the finest poems «of an idealistic tendency." [...] The Nobel Committee finally quoted from Song Offering and stated that Rabindranath in thought-impelling pictures, has shown how all things temporal are swallowed up in the eternal:Time is endless in thy hands, my lord.There is none to count thy minutes.Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait.Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.We have no time to lose, and having no time, we must scramble for our chances.We are too poor to be late.And thus it is that time goes try, while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.At {{the end of the day}} I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; but if I find that yet there is time.(Gitanjali, No. 82) ...|$|E

Although many interpolation techniques are known from the <b>literature,</b> <b>evaluations</b> of these techniques for the specific task of applying geometrical transformations to medical images are still lacking. In this paper we present such an evaluation. We consider convolution-based interpolation methods and rigid transformations (rotations and translations).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a pragmatic approach for egovernance evaluation by constructing a methodology built over two streams of literature i. e. e-governance and evaluation. In the available <b>literature,</b> e-governance <b>evaluation</b> approaches are mostly discussed from only e-governance perspective. The paper will investigate {{the use of}} exploiting both streams of literature in designing the e-governance evaluation. The fundamentals concepts from both streams of literature mutually contribute to build an e-governance evaluation framework e. g. e-government development models, e-governance dimensions, delivery models and e-governance evaluation modes are extracted from e-governance streams while evaluation processes and evaluation methods and techniques are adopted from the evaluation stream. The paper {{presents a}}n e-governance evaluation process spanning five phases (pre-evaluation development, manipulation, action, and outcome utilization). The use of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>literature</b> in e-governance <b>evaluation</b> framework enable the approach result-oriented and pragmatic i. e. outcome utilization phase that is added in the egovernance evaluation process ensures that the evaluation outcomes trigger learning process in the government body and are not dispensed for merely benchmarking...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to test a scaffolded {{instructional}} model in a complex Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) lesson where students evaluated three different medical studies (RCT, case-control, and cohort) on the same topic and used those studies to reach an evidence-based conclusion. The hypothesis was that the students’ <b>literature</b> <b>evaluation</b> skills and subsequent application of the literature to address a clinical question would more closely approximate the experts following implementation of the model. The results do not fully support the hypothesis. The conclusions were: (1) third-year doctor of pharmacy students at the college have a limited ability to evaluate medical literature of varying qualities and types and conflicting conclusions; (2) prior to reading the RCT, students’ initial clinical conclusions more closely resembled the experts’, potentially indicating an unbalanced influence of the RCT, either from RCT bias/preconceptions or a lack of skills transfer in evaluating the RCT; and (3) the instructional model needs further development by adding explicit instructional scaffolding around the Medical <b>Literature</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (MLE) Rubric, vocabulary, and directly addressing student preconceptions/biases.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of an interactive student response (ISR) system on student learning, interest, and satisfaction. Methods. Students enrolled in 3 courses, Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Medical <b>Literature</b> <b>Evaluation,</b> and Pathophysiology and Therapeutics, were taught using either a traditional lecture format (study year 1) or an ISR system format (study year 2). Primary outcomes of interest were performance on examinations and student attitudes. Results. Students using the ISR system had better scores on the Clinical Pharmacokinetics examination questions (mean scores, 82. 6 % ± 9. 6 % vs 63. 8 % ± 8. 3 %, p < 0. 001), on the cumulative final examination for Medical <b>Literature</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (82. 9 % ± 11. 5 % vs 78. 0 % ± 12. 2 %, p = 0. 016), and on the evaluable “analysis type ” examination questions in the Pathophysiology and Therapeutics course (82. 5 % ± 8. 7 % vs 77. 4 % ± 12. 5 %, p = 0. 0002).
