He lost his first four starts of the season, extending his <b>losing</b> <b>streak</b> to nine consecutive starts dating back to 2010.

Latos had a no-decision in his next start after the bullpen blew a save opportunity, preventing him from earning a win. He lost another decision for a 10-game <b>losing</b> <b>streak</b> that was one less than the club record held by Gary Ross.

40|$|This is {{the final}} {{published}} version. It first appeared at [URL] choice under uncertainty is influenced by erroneous beliefs about randomness. In simple binary choice tasks such as red/black predictions in roulette, long outcome runs (e. g. red, red, red) typically increase the tendency to predict the other outcome (i. e. black), an effect labelled the ‘gambler’s fallacy’. In these settings, participants may also attend to streaks in their predictive performance. Winning and <b>losing</b> <b>streaks</b> are thought to affect decision confidence, although prior work indicates conflicting directions. Over three laboratory experiments involving red/black predictions in a sequential roulette task, we sought to identify the effects of outcome runs and winning/losing streaks upon color predictions, decision confidence and betting behavior. Experiments 1 (n = 40) and 3 (n = 40) obtained trial-by-trial confidence ratings, with a win / no win payoff and a no loss / loss payoff, respectively. Experiment 2 (n = 39) obtained a trial-by-trial bet amount on an equivalent scale. In each experiment, the gambler’s fallacy was observed on choice behavior after color runs and, in experiment 2, on betting behavior after color runs. Feedback streaks exerted no reliable influence on confidence ratings, in either payoff condition. Betting behavior, on the other hand, increased {{as a function of}} <b>losing</b> <b>streaks.</b> The increase in betting on <b>losing</b> <b>streaks</b> is interpreted as laboratory loss-chasing; these data help clarify the psychological mechanisms underlying loss chasing, and caution against the use of betting measures (‘post-decision wagering’) as a straightforward index of decision confidence...|$|R
