40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 This thesis {{examines}} the three films that constitute director Ingmar Bergman's first trilogy, Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, and The Silence. In the thesis I take a multidisciplinary approach to analyzing the films' treatments of <b>language,</b> <b>trauma,</b> and God. Drawing on the Old Testament {{and work of}} psychoanalysts dealing with trauma, I argue for the similarities and reciprocity between trauma and communion with God {{and the ways in}} which the three films illustrate these relationships. Each film functions on a reflexive level to criticize the tools of filmmaking [...] images, dialog, and narrative [...] and points to discordance between symbols and reality. Bringing in Jacques Lacan's model of the imaginary and symbolic orders, I analyze the treatment of language and trauma in the trilogy and the potential for recovery suggested by the end of each film. The thesis culminates by tracing the trilogy toward a new vision of God and his role in the human psyche...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{migration}} {{has resulted in}} population growth {{and contributed to the}} transformation of New Zealand. Migrant and refugee children face many adjustment factors and their ease in resettling in New Zealand is largely dependent on their ability to learn English. Migration stress, change, trauma and loss may result in psychological difficulties which in turn may affect their resettling and learning. The Ministry of Education and other professionals work together to enhance the quality of their service provision to facilitate easier adjustment, resettlement and effective learning for these children. An adequate assessment battery for speech language therapists to assess migrant and refugee children, is presently lacking in New Zealand. Therapists currently use various assessments, with the assistance of interpreters. The New Zealand Speech Therapists’ Association (NZSTA), in accordance with speech therapists in Group Special Education (GSE), strongly supports the need for research with these groups and the development of an appropriate assessment battery. This exploratory study aimed to determine an assessment battery for use in examining English language acquisition in refugee and migrant children and to highlight the benefit of using measurement tools that determine incremental change over time in contrast to the use of monolingual psychometric tests. The study explored a selected assessment battery and gathered data in five main focus areas, namely: cognition, <b>language,</b> <b>trauma,</b> classroom behaviour, developmental and birth information. Eligible children were those who did not have physiologically - impaired cognitive abilities. Eight cases, four refugee and four migrant students, were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were children selected from primary school 1 (three refugees and three migrants) and primary school 2 (one refugee and one migrant) primary schools, aged approximately (5 - 8 years). Participants included four male and four females, refugee and migrant children, and those with both high and low English ability. Based on the study’s results, recommendations were made to refine the test battery, which included test modification. For example, the use of the trauma measurement tool only if there is prior evidence of trauma, the inclusion of a larger test population who have a common primary language to allow for cost effective interpreter use and to also allow for generalisations to be made, the inclusion of an assessment of the children’s primary language {{in order to determine the}} relationship, development and acquisition of the child’s second language with reference to his/her development and skills in his native language. All of the refugee children and 3 migrant children displayed slower processing time during the administration of the tests. Migrant parents were quicker in test completion as compared to refugee parents. They displayed differences in family size, contact with extended family, socioeconomic status and educational level. Migrant children produced sentences that included correct word order and sequence whilst refugee children produced sentences that lacked adequate word order or lacked articles and determiners. The study found the proposed test battery was an effective choice for use in the assessment of both migrant and refugee children, as the battery allows for dynamic assessment of children from diverse groups and this proved to be an unbiased means of assessing their English language and cognitive skills. Recommendations are made for future, more-extensive research. These findings provide information about appropriate and reliable language acquisition tests that measure incremental change with time. This study will contribute to a developing knowledge base for speech-language therapists who work with migrant or refugee children. Effective assessment on which to base tailored language programmes will assist them to optimise their experience in New Zealand schools and enhance their English language skills...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{follows the}} many rhetorical (or persuasive) agents and {{relations in the}} act or event of murder. I ask readers to postpone blame in order {{to listen to the}} other rhetorical agents involved. I follow 4 case studies or instances of murder that happened in Pittsburgh, tracing who and what was influential or persuasive in the final act. Using new materialist theory and rhetoric, I argue that murder happens within a network [...] not necessarily only an online network, but a network of influential actors and agents—things like: Facebook, twitter, language, affect, programming <b>languages,</b> <b>trauma</b> [...] and that we must understand this rhetorical network of agents for an efficacious intervention and understanding of murder and violence. The dissertation is both practical and theoretical. It is both pubic and private. It is both about real people who lived and have lived down the street and philosophical ideas that live largely in print. Building on contemporary art movements and recent work in the digital humanities, we must attend to the production of the archive-as-method—a newly emergent practice that raises complex ethical questions about the relationality between language, networks, affects, and bodies in digital social contexts. This dissertation practices an inquiry that is not criminological or pathological but networked and new materialist. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{responds to}} some significant publications on refugee theatre and performance {{that have been}} released in the last fifteen years. Consolidating {{some of the major}} concerns and debates, the problems confronted have been conceptualized as paradoxes: (1) the paradox of trauma and neo-colonial benevolence in applied theatre and (2) the paradox of testimonial authenticity in the portrayal of refugees in staged performances. The research is an ethnographic case study of three young asylum seekers partaking in a theatre production in Canterbury. The devising process of the theatre project is set alongside the daily activities of the migrants’ lives and unfolding action of their asylum claim. The theatre monologues were featured in a community project on migration to Kent in April 2014. With an overarching objective to bear witness to the project participants, the research questions are as follows (1) how does the <b>language</b> of <b>trauma</b> come to bear on the biographies of individual asylum seekers? (2) how can refugee performance illuminate and respond to the paradox of language, narrative and representation? Using a self-reflexive ethnographic methodology, the researcher writes about her own becoming as a devised theatre practitioner and community volunteer (befriender). The collected data includes the researcher’s journal entries, the participant’s performance pieces and creative pseudo-fictions inspired by the relationships between the researcher and her participants. The study concludes that (1) refugee theatre has a tendency to presume the biases of audiences, thereby perpetuating the paradoxes of trauma and testimonial, (2) the <b>language</b> of <b>trauma</b> can be powerful in the asylum seeking procedure and that (3) migrants rely on performance in everyday life to subvert the forces of control that dictate their situations.

While trauma can be a powerful theoretical tool for revealing an ethical obligation, it creates this obligation through guilt.

Two novels that demonstrate the advantages of a shift from trauma to precarity are To the Lighthouse, by Virginia Woolf, and Ceremony, by Leslie Marmon Silko. These books raise questions about the nature of identity, consciousness, and the ethical response to traumatic experience.

By focusing on the bodies of the survivors, Lotz demonstrates the embodiment of shame, but she also suggests a corporeal challenge to silencing.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how contemporary Cuban American artists have experimented with visual <b>languages</b> of <b>trauma</b> {{to construct an}} intergenerational memory about the losses of exile and migration. It considers the work of artist Alberto Rey, and his layering of individual loss onto other, traumatic episodes {{in the history of}} the Cuban diaspora. In the series Las Balsas (The Rafts, 1995 - 99), Rey explores the impact of the balsero (rafter) crisis of 1994 by transforming objects left behind by Cuban rafters on their sometimes ill-fated journeys to the United States into commemorative relics. By playing on a memory of absence and the misplacement of objects found along the migration route of the Florida Straits, Rey’s visual language transmits the memory of grief across time, space and generational divides. Rey’s visual strategies are part of an “extended memory” tied to the aesthetics of disappearance and remembrance in contemporary Cuban American art. His use of objects as powerful memory texts that serve to bring fragmented autobiographical, family, and intergenerational testimonies of loss together, suggests how visual artists can provide us with more collective, participatory and redemptive models of memory work...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the fictional narratives of Eastern and Central European women authors writing in German and explores {{the ways in which}} historical and political trauma shapes their approach to narrative. By investigating the atrocities of the World War II era and beyond through a lens of trauma, I look at the ways in which their narrative writing is disrupted by traumatic memory, engendering a genre that calls into question official accounts of historical events. I argue that without the emergence and proliferation of these individual trauma narratives to contest, official, cemented accounts, there exists a threat of permanent inscription of official versions into public consciousness, effectively excluding the narratives of communities rendered fragile by war and/or displacement. The dissertation demonstrates how these trauma fictions i) reveal the burden of unresolved, transmitted trauma on the second generation as the pivotal generation between the repressive Stalinist era and the collapse of communism, ii) disrupt official accounts of events through the intrusion of individual traumatic memory that is by nature unmediated and uncensored, iii) offer alternative plural accounts of events by rejecting normal everyday language as a vehicle for narrative and instead experimenting with alternative modes of representation, articulating <b>trauma</b> through poetic <b>language,</b> through spaces, and through the body, and v) struggle against theory, while paradoxically often succumbing to the very same institutionalized <b>language</b> of <b>trauma</b> that they seek to contest. Trauma fiction therefore emerges as a distinct genre that forestalls the threat of erasure of alternative memories by constantly challenging and exposing the equivocal nature of official narratives, while also pointing to the challenges faced in attempting to give a voice to groups that have suffered trauma in an age where the term has become embedded and overused in our everyday language.

40|$|Witnessing, {{as it is}} {{currently}} conceived in theatre and performance studies, is a mode of &# 147;active&# 148; and/or &# 147;ethical&# 148; spectatorship. However, such definitions neglect the insights of trauma studies scholars, who suggest that witnessing is neither active nor especially ethical. Instead, trauma studies theorists argue that witnessing is temporally belated, {{which is to say}} an after effect of spectatorship as well as a mode. Drawing on the <b>language</b> of <b>trauma</b> studies, and through an analysis of testimonial theatres made by, with, and about asylum seekers in Australia from 2000 to 2005, this thesis develops a theory of &# 147;performing witness. &# 148; Such a theory considers both the figure of the performing witness, defined as someone who testifies and retestifies in public whether on behalf of themselves or an absent other, and the function of performing witness, which is to say the process of producing, reproducing, representing, and responding to testimony. In order to elucidate this theory, the thesis proceeds through a series of &# 147;scenes. &# 148; The first two chapters focus on theoretical &# 147;scenes,&# 148; one from theatre and performance studies (Bertolt Brecht&# 146;s &# 147;Street Scene&# 148;) and another from trauma studies (Shoshana Felman&# 146;s &# 147;Classroom Scene&# 148;), in order to ask: &# 147;How have these fields theorised witnessing and how might they illuminate one another?&# 148; The next four chapters pursue a single question across a series of sites: &# 147;What forms of witnessing do we find in performance?&# 148; These performance &# 147;scenes&# 148; include the interviews conducted by immigration officials (Chapter 3), a verbatim play based on interviews with refugees in which a refugee was cast as himself (Chapter 4), an autobiographical play devised and performed by that same refugee (Chapter 5), and a tribunal play based on the transcripts of a parliamentary inquiry into how a boat of asylum seekers came to grief off the coast of Australia (Chapter 6). Through these analyses, many theories of witnessing emerge: ambivalent; mimetic; antiphonic; and false witnessing. These new theories not only refine our understanding of theatrical witnessing, they also shift our understanding of witnessing more generally, inviting us to rethink the relationship between spectatorship, ethics, activity, and temporality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the trauma team is to provide {{advanced}} simultaneous care from relevant specialists to the seriously injured trauma patient. When functioning well, {{the outcome of the}} trauma team performance should be greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. Trauma teams have been shown to reduce the time taken for resuscitation, as well as time to CT scan, to emergency department discharge and to the operating room. These benefits are demonstrated by improved survival rates, particularly for the most severely injured patients, both within and outside of dedicated trauma centres. In order to ensure the best possible performance of the team, the leadership skills of the trauma team leader are essential and their non-technical skills have been shown to be particularly important. Team performance can be enhanced through a process of audit and assessment of the workings of the team and the evidence currently available suggests that this is best facilitated through the process of video review of the trauma resuscitation. The use of human patient simulators to train and assess trauma teams is becoming more commonplace and this technique offers a safe environment for the future education of trauma team staff. Trauma teams are a key component of most programmes which set out to improve trauma care. This article reviews the background of trauma teams, the evidence for benefit and potential techniques of performance assessment. The review was written after a PubMed, Ovid, Athens, Cochrane and guideline literature review of English <b>language</b> articles on <b>trauma</b> teams and their performance and hand searching of references from the relevant searched articles. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since Theodor Adorno’s famous dictum that ‘to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric’, {{the issue}} of whether it is ethical to {{represent}} the Holocaust in art, and if so, the means by which it is ethical to do so, has constituted one of the major polemical discourses of our time. Prominent questions such as ‘Who has the right to try and represent the Holocaust?’, ‘How should we represent the Holocaust?’ and ‘How can we address {{the issue of}} responsibility in a post-war world?’ have motivated artistic representations and the critics who discuss these representations. In this essay, I aim to consider the success of two works which employ the somewhat controversial format of animation in dealing with aspects of testimony, <b>trauma,</b> <b>language</b> and responsibility. The first, Art Spiegelman’s 1984 comic book strip Maus, anthropomorphised Germans into cats and Jews into mice in order to narrate events experienced by Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, during the war and the postbellum father-son relationship. Although Maus was initially criticised for its use of the comic book format, traditionally viewed as adolescent, it later went on to receive the Pulitzer Prize for its literary success and as such provided a benchmark for the potential of animated formats. The second, Orly Yadin and Sylvie Bringas’s 1998 animated short film Silence, combines two styles of animation and a small amount of archival footage {{to tell the story of}} Tana Ross, a child survivor of Theresienstadt (Terezin) who, hidden by her grandmother during the war, escaped Auschwitz...|$|R

40|$|While orphan protagonists {{have long}} been a trope in western literature, Charles Dickens expands this {{tradition}} by using his orphan characters as both fictional creations and socially relevant representations. Literary theorists Baruch Hochman and Ilja Wachs posit that the "orphan condition" is a nearly universal sense of loss of self and abandonment which can result {{from a variety of}} childhood traumas. Thus, while the characters under study are bereft of parents, and are thus literal orphans, their stories speak to a broader readership through the reader's psychic identification with the orphan. Trauma theory explicates the process of bearing testimony, an act by which the survivor of trauma can redeem a sense of self by sharing the story with an auditor. David Copperfield and Great Expectations, when situated at the matrix of <b>trauma,</b> identity, and <b>language</b> formed by <b>trauma</b> theory, can reveal the sometimes limited efficacy of fiction as a form of testimony. The plethora of orphan texts published in the nineteenth century warrant particular explanation. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the changes to the conception of childhood in the early- to mid-Victorian period as well as to understand the generalized anxiety of the middle class in this period of great change. The legal, social, economic and existential context for the Victorian orphan reveals powerful factors which combined to make the working class mid-Victorian orphan both a source of fear in society and a source for sympathetic representation in literature. David Copperfield is the most obviously autobiographical of Dickens' novels, yet judged as testimony, it is a failure. This failure stems from two separate causes: first, Dickens strips Copperfield of the rage and fear inherent in the orphan condition and instead focuses his energies in the culturally normative values of diligence and earnest striving, and second, the Jack of emotional reporting in David Copperfield makes the novel a story of plot and character rather than a testimony which focuses on the self. Although Great Expectations is a far briefer and less autobiographical novel than David Copperfield, Pip's fuller investigation of his orphan state and the repercussions of that trauma allows this text to acquire the status of testimony.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Afrikaans and Dutch)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2009. When reading Henning J. Pieterse’s {{work the}} reader is confronted by a sombre central theme, that of loss. Loss manifests itself in {{different}} ways in his oeuvre, but the most notable forms of loss are as result of the ending of a love affair or death. A second noticeable theme in Pieterse’s work is art and artistry, specifically the creative writing process. In my opinion these themes are most evident in his 1998 {{collection of short stories}} Omdat ons alles is (Because we are everything). The main premise in this collection of short stories is the suicide of the beloved wife and the accompanying feelings of loss and grief. The male characters in these stories struggle with processing and accepting loss - loss due the suicide of a beloved wife or due to the ending of a relationship. Various attempts are made to forget the loss and to numb the pain. The characters turn to alcohol, drugs and sex as ways of trying to work through or process the loss, but these methods only bring temporary relief. These self-destructive methods op escapism are contrasted with the constructive act of writing. At the same time the journey to psychic recovery and the processing of trauma becomes a creative journey. By expressing trauma through writing about wounding experiences there is striven to process it. The processing of trauma by means of literary narratives is often extremely exhausting and distressing. In the act of writing about trauma, painful memories that are repressed in the psyche are brought to the surface. In this thesis Omdat ons alles is is viewed from a therapeutic perspective to establish whether the act of writing plays a part in the processing of trauma. Narrative therapy is concerned with the finding of words and <b>language</b> to communicate <b>trauma</b> by creating a story in which the meaning and coherence that trauma destroys, can be recaptured. Trauma destroys the meaning and coherence of a life story and leaves the individual powerless and confused, but by finding words to communicate trauma, there is a positive movement in the direction of dealing with and accepting loss. In Omdat ons alles is Pieterse maps the journey of working through loss and trauma, but in these stories it is also emphasised that this journey {{is by no means a}} joyride. In the end it seems that the act of writing does play a part in the processing of trauma, but to which extent, remains an open question...|$|R
40|$|Al Qaeda killings, {{posttraumatic}} stress, and the Gothic together triangulate {{a sizable}} space in recent American fiction {{that is still}} largely uncharted by critics. This thesis maps that shared territory in four novels written between 2005 and 2007 by writers who were born in America, and whose protagonists are the survivors in New York City after the World Trade Center falls. 	Published {{in the city of}} their tragedy and reviewed in its media, the novels surveyed here include Don DeLillo’s _Falling Man_ (2007), Jonathan Safran Foer’s _Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close_ (2005), Lynne Sharon Schwartz’s _The Writing on the Wall_ (2005), and Jess Walter’s _The Zero_ (2006). The thesis issues a challenge to the large number of negative and dismissive reviews of the novels under consideration, making a case that under different criteria, shaped by trauma theory and psychoanalysis, the novels succeed after all in making readers feel what it was to be alive in September 2001, enduring the posttraumatic stress for months and years later. 	The thesis asserts that 9 / 11 fiction is too commonly presented in popular journals and scholarly studies as an undifferentiated mass. In the same critical piece a journalist or an academic may evaluate narratives in which unfold a terrorist's point of view, a surviving or a dying New York City victim's perspective, and an outsider's reaction set thousands of miles away from Ground Zero. What this thesis argues for is a separation in study of the fictive strands that meditate on the burning towers, treating the New York City survivor story as a discrete body. Despite their being set {{in one of the most}} known cities of the Western world, and the terrorist attack that they depict being the most- watched catastrophe ever experienced in real-time before, these fictions have not yet been critically ordered. Charting the salient reappearing conflicts, unsettling descriptions, protagonist decay, and potent techniques for registering horror that resurface in this New York City 9 / 11 fiction, this thesis proposes and demonstrates how the peculiar and affecting Gothic tensions in the works can be further understood by trauma theory, a term coined by Cathy Caruth in Unclaimed Experience (1996 : 72). Though the thesis concentrates on developments in trauma theory from the mid 1990 s to 2015, it also addresses its theoretical antecedents: from the earliest voices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that linked mental illness to a trauma (Charcot, Janet, Breuer, Freud), to researchers from mid-twentieth century (Adler, Lindemann) who studied how catastrophe affects civilian minds not previously trained to either fight war or withstand cataclysm. 	Always keeping at the fore the ancient Greek double-meaning of trauma as both unhealing “wound” and “defeat,” the thesis surveys tenets of the trauma theorists from the very first of those who studied the effects on civilian survivors of disaster (of what is still the largest nightclub fire in U. S. history, which replaced front page coverage of World War II for a few days: the Cocoanut Grove blaze in Boston, 1942) up to those theorists writing in 2015. The concepts evolving behind trauma theory, this thesis demonstrates, provide a useful mechanism to discuss the surprising yearnings hiding behind the appearance of doppelgängers, possession ghosts, terrorists as monsters, empty coffins, and visitants that appear to feed on characters’ sorrow, guilt, and loneliness within the novels under discussion. 	This thesis reappraises the dominant idea in trauma studies of the mid- 1990 s, namely that trauma victims often cannot fully remember and articulate their physical and psychic wounds. The argument here is that, true to the theories of the Caruthian school, the victims in these novels may not remember and express their trauma completely and in a linear fashion. However, the victims figured in these novels do relate the horrors of their memory to a degree by letting their narration erupt with the unexpectedly Gothic images, tropes, visions, language, and typical contradictions, aporias, lacunae, and paradoxes. The Gothic, one might say, becomes the <b>language</b> in which <b>trauma</b> speaks and articulates itself, albeit not always in the most cogent of signs. One might easily dismiss these fleeting Gothic presences that characters conjure in the fictions under consideration as anomalous apparitions signalling nothing. However, this thesis interrogates these ghostly traces of Gothicism to find what secrets they hold. Working from the insights of psychoanalysis and its post-Freudian re-inventers and challengers, it aims to puzzle out the dimensions of characters’ mourning in its “traumagothic” reading of the texts. Characters’ use of the Gothic becomes their way of remembering, a coded language to the curious. 	This thesis holds that unexpressed grief and guilt are the large constant in this grouping of novels. Characters’ grief articulation and guilt release, or the desire for symbolic amnesia, take paths that the figures often were suspicious of before 9 / 11 : a return to organized religion, a belief in spirits, a call for vengeance, psychotherapy, substance abuse, splitting with a partner, rampant sex with nearby strangers, torture of suspects, and killing. All the earnest attempts through the above means by the characters to express grief, vent rage, and alleviate survivor guilt do so without noticeable success. True closure towards their trauma is largely a myth. No reliable evidence surfaces from the close reading of the texts that those affected by trauma ever fully recover. However, as this thesis demonstrates, other forms of recompense come from these searches for elusive peace and the nostalgic longing for the America that has been lost to them...|$|R
