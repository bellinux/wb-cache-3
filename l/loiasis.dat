50|$|Blood {{tests to}} reveal microfilaremia {{are useful in}} many, but not all cases, as one third of <b>loiasis</b> {{patients}} are amicrofilaremic. By contrast, eosinophilia is almost guaranteed in cases of <b>loiasis,</b> and blood testing for eosinophil fraction may be useful.|$|E

50|$|No vaccine {{has been}} {{developed}} for <b>loiasis</b> {{and there is little}} report on this possibility.|$|E
50|$|Endemicity {{is closely}} linked to the {{habitats}} of the two known human <b>loiasis</b> vectors, Chrysops dimidiata and C. silicea.|$|E
50|$|DEC {{continues}} to be the mainstay for treatment of patients with lymphatic filariasis and <b>loiasis.</b> DEC is also used to prevent heartworm in dogs.|$|E
50|$|There is much {{overlap between}} the {{endemicity}} {{of the two}} distinct filariases, which complicates mass treatment programs for onchocerciasis and necessitates the development of greater diagnostics for <b>loiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Onchocercidae are {{a family}} of {{nematodes}} in the superfamily Filarioidea. This family includes {{some of the most}} devastating human parasitic diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, <b>loiasis,</b> and other filariases.|$|E
50|$|DEC is {{indicated}} {{for treatment of}} individual patients with certain filarial diseases. These diseases include: lymphatic filariasis caused by infection with Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori; tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, and <b>loiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a study {{looking at}} mass Ivermectin {{treatment}} in Cameroon, {{one of the}} greatest endemic regions for both onchocerciasis and <b>loiasis,</b> a sequence of events in the clinical manifestation of adverse effects was outlined.|$|E
50|$|An area of {{tremendous}} concern regarding <b>loiasis</b> is its co-endemicity with onchocerciasis {{in certain areas}} of west and central Africa, as mass ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can lead to serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients who have high Loa loa microfilarial densities, or loads. This fact necessitates {{the development of more}} specific diagnostics tests for Loa loa so that areas and individuals at a higher risk for neurologic consequences can be identified prior to microfilaricidal treatment. Additionally, the treatment of choice for <b>loiasis,</b> diethylcarbamazine, can lead to serious complications in and of itself when administered in standard doses to patients with high Loa loa microfilarial loads.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{believe that}} geo-mapping of {{appropriate}} habitat and human settlement patterns may, {{with the use}} of predictor variables such as forest, land cover, rainfall, temperature, and soil type, allow for estimation of Loa loa transmission in the absence of point-of-care diagnostic tests. In addition to geo-mapping and chemoprophylaxis, the same preventative strategies used for malaria should be undertaken to avoid contraction of <b>loiasis.</b> Specifically, DEET-containing insect repellent, permethrin-soaked clothing, and thick, long-sleeved and long-legged clothing ought to be worn to decrease susceptibility to the bite of the mango or deer fly vector. Because the vector is day-biting, mosquito (bed) nets do not increase protection against <b>loiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Advanced {{diagnostic}} {{methods have}} been developed since the appearance the SAEs, but more specific diagnostic tests that have been or are currently being development (see: Diagnostics) must to be supported and distributed if adequate <b>loiasis</b> surveillance is to be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Human <b>loiasis</b> {{geographical}} distribution {{is restricted to}} the rain forest and swamp forest areas of West Africa, being especially common in Cameroon and on the Ogooué River. Humans are the only known natural reservoir. It is estimated that over 10 million humans are infected with Loa loa larvae.|$|E
50|$|Humans are {{the primary}} {{reservoir}} for Loa loa. Other minor potential reservoirs have been indicated in various fly biting habit studies: hippopotamus, wild ruminants (e.g., buffalo), rodents, and lizards. A simian type of <b>loiasis</b> exists in monkeys and apes but it is transmitted by Chrysops langi. There is no cross-over between the human and simian types of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of <b>loiasis</b> {{involves}} chemotherapy or, in some cases, surgical {{removal of}} adult worms followed by systemic treatment. The current {{drug of choice}} for therapy is diethylcarbamazine (DEC), though ivermectin use is not unwarranted. The recommend dosage of DEC is 6 mg/kg/d taken three times daily for 12 days. The pediatric dose is the same. DEC is effective against microfilariae and somewhat effective against macrofilariae (adult worms).|$|E
5000|$|People at {{the highest}} risk for {{acquiring}} <b>loiasis</b> are those {{that live in the}} rainforests of West/Central Africa. Furthermore, the probability of getting bitten by a deer or mango fly increases during the day and during rainy seasons. The flies are also attracted to smoke from wood fires. It is not common for these flies to enter houses, but they are attracted to the houses that are well lit and will congregate outside.|$|E
5000|$|The {{identification}} of microfilariae {{was made in}} 1890 by the ophthalmologist Stephen McKenzie. Localized angioedema, a common clinical presentation of <b>loiasis,</b> was observed in 1895 in the coastal Nigerian town of Calabar—hence the name [...] "Calabar" [...] swellings. This observation was made by a Scottish ophthalmologist named Douglas Argyll-Robertson, but the association between Loa loa and Calabar swellings was not realized until 1910 (by Dr. Patrick Manson). The determination of vector—Chrysops spp.—was made in 1912 by the British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper.|$|E
50|$|As of 2009, <b>loiasis</b> is {{endemic to}} 11 countries, all in western or central Africa, and an {{estimated}} 12-13 million people have the disease. The highest incidence is seen in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. The rates of Loa loa infection are lower {{but it is still}} present in and Angola, Benin, Chad and Uganda. The disease was once endemic to the western African countries of Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast and Mali but has since disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|Ivermectin {{has become}} the most common {{antiparasitic}} agent used worldwide but can lead to residual microfilarial load when given in the management of <b>loiasis.</b> Treat with ivermectin has shown to produce severe adverse neurological consequences in some cases. These treatment complications can be increased in co-infected individuals with onchocerciasis. Some of these patients experienced cases of coma and resultant encephalopathy, parkinsonism, and death. After about 12 hours the first signs start to appear and include fatigue, pain in joints, mutism, and incontinence. Severe disorders of the consciousness start to develop after about a day.|$|E
50|$|Antigen {{detection}} {{using an}} immunoassay for circulating filarial antigens constitutes a useful diagnostic approach, because microfilaremia can be low and variable. Interestingly, the Institute for Tropical Medicine reports that no serologic diagnostics are available. While this was once true, {{and many of}} recently developed methods of Antibody detection are of limited value—because substantial antigenic cross reactivity exists between filaria and other parasitic worms (helminths), and a positive serologic test does not necessarily distinguish between infections—up and coming serologic tests that are highly specific to Loa loa were furthered in 2008. They have not gone point-of-care yet, but show promise for highlighting high-risk areas and individuals with co-endemic <b>loiasis</b> and onchocerciasis. Specifically, Dr. Thomas Nutman and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health have described the a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay (LIPS) and the related QLIPS (quick version). Whereas a previously described LISXP-1 ELISA test had a poor sensitivity (55%), the QLIPS test is both practical, as it requires only a 15 minutes incubation, and has high sensitivity and specificity (97% and 100%, respectively). No report on the distribution status of LIPS or QLIPS testing is available, but these tests would help to limit complications derived from mass ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis or dangerous strong doses of diethylcarbamazine for <b>loiasis</b> alone (as pertains to individual with high Loa loa microfilarial loads).|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} Chrysops spp biting habits showed that C. silacea and C. dimidiata take human blood meals {{approximately}} 90% of the time, with hippopotamus, wild ruminant, rodent, and lizard blood meals {{making up the}} other 10%. The fact that no simian (ex: monkeys or apes) blood meals were taken {{suggests that there is}} no crossover between the human and simian types of Loa loa. A related fly, Chrysops langi, has been isolated as a vector of simian <b>loiasis,</b> but this variant hunts within the forest and has not as yet been associated with human infection.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there are}} no control {{programs}} or vaccines for <b>loiasis.</b> However, {{if you plan to}} be in a high-risk area where this parasite inhabits, it is suggested that you take diethylcarbamazine (DEC)—about 300 mg each week—to reduce your risk. Another way is to avoid areas where the vectors, deer and mango flies, are found. This includes swamps, bogs, and shaded areas near rivers or near wood fires. Ways in which you can minimize fly bites is by using insect repellents such as DEET (N, N-Diethyl-metatoluamide) and to wear clothing that has long sleeves and pants during the daytime. Permethrin treatment on your clothes is an additional repellent that could be used. Also, using malaria nets can also reduce the number of fly bites acquired.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, {{the only}} method of {{determining}} Loa loa intensity was with microscopic examination of standardized blood smears, {{which is not}} practical in endemic regions. Because mass diagnostic methods were not available, complications started to surface once mass ivermectin treatment programs started being carried out for onchocerciasis, another filariasis. Ivermectin, a microfilaricidal drug, may be contraindicated in patients who are co-infected with <b>loiasis</b> and have associated high microfilarial loads. The {{theory is that the}} killing of massive numbers of microfilaria, some of which may be near the ocular and brain region, can lead to encephalopathy. Indeed, cases of this have been documented so frequently over the last decade that a term has been given for this set of complication: neurologic serious adverse events (SAEs).|$|E
5000|$|While Mansonella {{infections are}} often asymptomatic, {{they can be}} {{associated}} with angioedema (similar to Calabar swellings of loaisis), recurrent pruritic subcutaneous lesions, fever, headaches, arthralgia, and neurologic manifestations. [...] Eosinophilia, headache, fever, or abdominal pain may also be present. M. perstans may also present with a condition known as kampala, or Ugandan eye worm. [...] This occurs when adult worms of M. perstans invade the conjunctiva or periorbital connective tissues in the eye. This condition was first attributed to M. perstans in Uganda, when six patients presented with nodules in the conjunctiva. [...] The adult worms were identified as adult female M. perstans in five of these six cases. The symptoms of M. perstans may be confounded with those of other filarial infections, such as onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis and <b>loiasis,</b> because coinfection often occurs.|$|E
50|$|One {{drug that}} has been {{proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} onchocerciasis is doxycycline. This drug {{has been shown to be}} effective in killing both the adult worm of O. volvulus and Wolbachia, the bacteria believed to play a major role in the onset of onchocerciasis, while having no effect on the microfilariae of L. loa. In a study done at 5 different co-endemic regions for onchocerciasis and <b>loiasis,</b> doxycycline was shown to be effective in treating over 12,000 individuals infected with both parasites with minimal complications. Drawbacks to using Doxycycline include bacterial resistance and patient compliance because of a longer treatment regimen and emergence of doxycycline-resistant Wolbachia. However, in the study over 97% of the patients complied with treatment, so it does pose as a promising treatment for onchocerciasis, while avoiding complications associated with L. loa co-infections.|$|E
5000|$|Filariasis such as <b>loiasis</b> {{most often}} {{consists}} of asymptomatic microfilaremia. Some patients develop lymphatic dysfunction causing lymphedema. Episodic angioedema (Calabar swellings) {{in the arms}} and legs, caused by immune reactions are common. Calabar swellings are 3-10 cm in surface non erythematous and not pitting. When chronic, they can form cyst-like enlargements of the connective tissue around the sheaths of muscle tendons, becoming very painful when moved. The swellings may last for 1-3 days, and may be accompanied by localized urticaria (skin eruptions) and pruritus (itching). They reappear at referent locations at irregular time intervals. Subconjunctival migration of an adult worm to the eyes can also occur frequently, {{and this is the}} reason Loa loa is also called the [...] "African eye worm." [...] The passage over the eyeball can be sensed, but it usually takes less than 15 min. Gender incidence of eyeworms have approximately the same frequency, but it tends to increase with age. Eosinophilia is often prominent in filarial infections. Dead worms may cause chronic abscesses, which may lead to the formation of granulomatous reactions and fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Loiasis</b> is a {{neglected}} tropical disease caused by infection with the filarial parasite Loa loa, transmitted by Chrysops vectors. <b>Loiasis</b> has recently {{emerged as a}} disease of public health importance when neurologic serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in individuals with high L. loa microfilaraemia after ivermectin treatment.

Methods: we report clinical and parasitological manifestations of 100 patients with imported <b>loiasis</b> seen between 1993 and 2013 at the Center of Tropical Diseases, Negrar, Italy. Results: among the 100 patients, 30 were African immigrants, 70 were Europeans (59 long-term expatriates and 11 travelers). Thirty-five patients (19 Africans and 16 Europeans) had positive microfilaremia. Calabar swellings were twice as frequent in Europeans (90 %) than in Africans (46. 7 %), while a history of "eyeworm" was recorded in a higher proportion of Africans (43. 3 %) than in Europeans (17. 4 %). The median duration of exposure in the non-endemic group was also fairly long (14. 6 years). Different drug regimens were used for treatment.
