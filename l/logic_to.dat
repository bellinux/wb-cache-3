5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this <b>logic</b> <b>to</b> forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E

40|$|Fusions are {{a simple}} way of {{combining}} logics. For normal modal logics, fusions have been investigated in detail. In particular, it is known that, under certain conditions, decidability transfers from the component <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> their fusion. Though description logics are closely related <b>to</b> modal <b>logics,</b> they are not necessarily normal. In addition, ABox reasoning in description logics is {{not covered by the}} results from modal logics. In this paper, we extend the decidability transfer results from normal modal <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> a large class of description <b>logics.</b> <b>To</b> cover di erent description logics in a uniform way, we introduce abstract description systems, which {{can be seen as a}} common generalization of description and modal logics, and show the transfer results in this general setting...|$|R

5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and <b>logic</b> <b>to</b> generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this <b>logic</b> <b>to</b> assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{legitimacy}} of CEO pay in large U. S. firms has been repeatedly challenged in {{first decade of}} the 21 st century. However, increases in CEO pay have continued to outpace corresponding changes in firm size and performance. This paper studies how large U. S. firms employ remuneration <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> legitimise CEO pay. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis is used to identify 13 remuneration logics used in the 1998 and 2007 proxy statements from the largest 50 U. S. firms as well as 18 codes of practice issued between 1994 and 2007. Findings: The remuneration policies of U. S. firms have become increasingly homogenous over time. In 2007, all firms studied used the human resources, market and pay-for-performance <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> justify CEO pay. While firms use the remuneration <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> strategically manage their legitimacy, coercive and normative pressures are driving firms towards uniformity in their remuneration policies. Originality/value: Legitimacy and institutional theory are used to understand and explain organisational discourse on executive remuneration...|$|R

A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v.

Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Robert's Sententiae, or Summa Theologica, {{was well}} known in his time, and has been {{considered}} a key connection in theology between Robert's own teachers' works and the works of Peter Lombard. Robert is the first commentator on St Paul to say that resistance to a tyrant might be vindicated by the Bible. Robert also opined that a king might be excommunicated if royal actions harmed the church. Robert used Gratian's works as sources for his own, citing the Decretum Gratiani. Although he used this work, which dealt with church law, he {{does not appear to}} have been considered a lawyer, and his training was that of a theologian. Furthermore, his years as a student predated the establishment of canon law as a distinct discipline in the European schools. Robert's views of the glossators, and their main work Glossa Ordinaria was that they had shortened their glosses to such a point that they made them unintelligible. Robert was also known as a logician, and John of Salisbury named him one of the leading disputatores, or a person who used rhetoric and <b>logic</b> <b>to</b> debate in public.|$|E

Since one our main research areas {{is related to}} robotics and manufacturing systems, we focus our attention on those logics and problems relevant to this area. We review the fundamental concepts defining paraconsistency and overcompleteness in non-classical logics and how these concepts can be helpful for problem-solving in the five subareas of Artificial Intelligence proposed in [Ros 85]: perception, planning, learning, communication, and reasoning. We also present, as an illustration, two examples of application of these <b>logics,</b> namely <b>to</b> (i) representation and combination of multiple-source evidence in uncertain reasoning, and (ii) knowledge representation for distributed systems. 1 Introduction This papers presents some ideas on using non-classical <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> represent and to reason about knowledge in Artificial Intelligence [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{optimised}} functional translation of propositional modal <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> first-order <b>logic,</b> and first-order resolution {{as a means}} for realising modal reasoning. The optimised functional translation maps modal <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> a lattice of clausal logics, called path logics. The general apparatus of inference for path logics is theory resolution. We show that satisfiability in basic path logic and certain extensions can be decided by resolution and condensing without requiring additional refinement strategies. We propose an improved theory unification algorithm for S 4, and we present a calculus of ordered E-resolution with normalisation. We show also that some essentially second-order modal <b>logics</b> convert <b>to</b> path <b>logics,</b> which can be exploited for accomodating inference for modal logics with numerical quantifiers in a calculus of resolution and simple arithmetic.

40|$|The {{class of}} Unambiguous Star-Free Regular Languages (UL) {{was defined by}} Schutzenberger as the class of {{languages}} defined by Unambiguous Polynomials. UL has been variously characterized (over finite words) by logics such as TL[X_a,Y_a], UITL, TL[F,P], FO 2 [<], the variety DA of monoids, as well as partially-ordered two-way DFA (po 2 DFA). We revisit this language class with emphasis on notion of unambiguity and develop {{on the concept of}} Deterministic Logics for UL. The formulas of deterministic logics uniquely parse a word in order to evaluate satisfaction. We show that several deterministic logics robustly characterize UL. Moreover, we derive constructive reductions from these <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> the po 2 DFA automata. These reductions also allow us to show NP-complete satisfaction complexity for the deterministic logics considered. Logics such as TL[F,P], FO 2 [<] are not deterministic and have been shown to characterize UL using algebraic methods. However there has been no known constructive reduction from these <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> po 2 DFA. We use deterministic <b>logics</b> <b>to</b> bridge this gap. The language-equivalent po 2 DFA for a given TL[F,P] formula is constructed and we analyze its size relative {{to the size of the}} TL[F,P] formula. This is an efficient reduction which gives an alternate proof to NP-complete satisfiability complexity of TL[F,P] formulas...|$|R
