5000|$|Torque steer, {{common in}} a front-wheel drive layout, is mitigated by greater front-wheel toe-out and specially-made lower front {{suspension}} arms that provide 1.5 degrees of negative camber. The 6" [...] x 13" [...] aluminium alloy wheels {{are intended for}} either Goodyear or Dunlop 165:13:60 section, HR-rated <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} features leather {{in different}} hues, along with multimedia equipment. The three-door hatchback features a panoramic glass roof, pillarless side glass, LED headlamps, high-mounted LED taillamps, integrated tailgate spoiler and dark-chrome lower diffuser with integrated center exhaust outlet. The car rides on 18-inch <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres</b> mounted on two-piece, 12-spoke alloy wheels.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{a concept}} model based on the 2002 Fiesta RallyeConcept. It {{includes}} many of the RallyeConcept Fiesta features such as the cooling vents in the front bumper, deep side rockers, white ceramic-coated brake calipers and exhaust tips, and a large rear spoiler. It also includes 18-inch alloy wheels with <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> extended wheel arches, and lowered and stiffened suspension. The engine is rated at over [...]|$|R
50|$|The Quattroporte Sport GT variant offered several {{performance}} upgrades: faster shifting {{transmission and}} firmer Skyhook suspensions thanks to new software calibrations, seven-spoke 20 inch wheels with <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> cross-drilled brake rotors and braided brake lines. Model-specific exterior trim included dark mesh front and side grilles and red accents to the Trident badges, as on vintage racing Maseratis. Inside there were aluminium pedals, a sport {{steering wheel and}} carbon fibre {{in place of the}} standard wood inserts.|$|R
2500|$|As Australian Moke {{production}} wound down, manufacturing {{was transferred}} to British Leyland's subsidiary in Portugal, which made 8,500 of the [...] "Californian" [...] Mokes in the Setúbal IMA plant between 1980 and 1984. In 1984 production {{was transferred to}} the Vendas Novas plant. Initially these Mokes were identical to late-model Australian Mokes; very soon, however, they were altered to use then-current British production Mini saloon components, including the standard-length Mini rear trailing arms and the 12–in wheels with modern <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> which the saloon had acquired during the Moke's absence from Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Available {{in short}} and long bodies, XJR {{includes}} a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine rated [...] and 680 Nm, increased top speed to 280 kph mph, eight-speed automatic transmission with a bespoke tuning for the XJR, new front splitter and aerodynamic sill section combined with an additional rear spoiler and unique 'R' bonnet louvres, Electronic Active Differential and Dynamic Stability Control systems calibrated to enhance handling characteristics, new 20-inch 'Farallon' forged alloy wheels with bespoke Pirelli <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> semi-aniline leather, a choice of veneers and contrasting stitching on the seats.|$|R
50|$|A 3-door version dubbed Astra GTC was {{introduced}} in July 2011. Externally, it retains very few design elements of the old 5-door model. It has a sportier appearance, with a much more 'sculpted' chassis. It features a HiPerStrut front suspension from the Opel Insignia OPC which helps alleviate torque steering. A Watt's linkage {{is present in the}} rear suspension, to minimize lateral movement of the axle. The wheelbase is enhanced to accommodate wider <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres.</b> Similarly to the Astra H GTC, a 'panoramic windscreen' option is available. The Astra GTC was awarded a 5 star rating for its performance under Euro NCAP safety tests. In late 2013, a new 1.6 Turbo EcoTech engine with 200PS output replaced the older 180PS engine of the same capacity, meaning the 1.6 Turbo replaces the BiTurbo Diesel as the fastest non-OPC model in the range.|$|R
5000|$|Lambrettas have {{attracted}} an eclectic following of [...] "revival" [...] Mods, collectors, scooterists, cutdown enthusiasts, and even racers. Vespa and Lambrettas both {{can be converted}} to fun and relatively fast machines with little (but relatively expensive) modification. Many owners customize these scooters with elaborate customizations and paintwork and attend well-organised scooter rallies. The Lambretta has benefitted from advances in technology in the motorcycle world. To boost performance some owners have fitted aftermarket cylinders and crankshafts that increase the swept volume to as much as 250 cc. Common modifications include a Nikasil plated aluminium barrel with radical porting, large Dell'Orto or Mikuni carburettors and bespoke expansion chambers. Hydraulic disc brakes in the front are becoming common on the more highly tuned machines, as are hydraulic clutches and rear brakes. Modern <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres</b> greatly improve handling, as do uprated front and rear suspension units.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 {{an attempt}} {{to keep pace with}} the hot {{hatchback}} market, the final version of the Alfasud Ti received a tuned 1490 cc engine developing 105 PS (77 kW). Named Quadrifoglio Verde (Green Cloverleaf), the model was also fitted with Michelin <b>low-profile</b> TRX <b>tyres</b> on metric rims (tyre size 190/55 VR 340 TRX) as well as an enhanced level of equipment.|$|R
50|$|Cutdowns {{are often}} tuned - {{much like a}} four-wheeled hot rod - by overboring the {{cylinders}} to increase engine power or adding performance exhausts, modified carburettors, or aftermarket shock absorbers. Some enthusiasts replace the standard drum front brakes with hydraulic disc brakes or add water cooling radiators. Lambretta owners may replace existing parts with a Nikasil plated aluminium barrel with radical porting, large Dell'Orto or Mikuni carburettors and bespoke (custom-made) expansion chambers, hydraulic clutches, and modern <b>low-profile</b> <b>tyres.</b> Some scooterists use aluminum Fabrizi racing barrels, because they use a rotary induction mechanism. Stock gas tanks may be replaced with increased capacity tanks, which put {{the weight of the}} fuel further forward.Some riders install a small fairing to reduce wind resistance and enable higher speeds and stability. To reduce weight, some scooterists use lighter-weight aftermarket parts, such as carbon fibre sports seats and other parts made from carbon fibre, carbon kevlar and fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|The UK {{had three}} {{models in the}} Paseo range: the base ST, the Si adding 14-inch alloy wheels, a Sony CD player, color-keyed boot spoiler with third brake light and {{anti-lock}} brakes, and the Galliano, featuring a color-keyed chin spoiler, mud guards, and yellow paintwork with aquamarine decals on the bodysides, as well as wider 15-inch alloy wheels with <b>low-profile</b> 195/50 <b>tyres.</b> The Paseo convertible was not sold in Britain. All UK models came with the 5E-FE engine producing [...] The top speed, as claimed by Toyota, is 112 mi/h km/h.|$|R
