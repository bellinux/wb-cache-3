In 1992, it started increasing {{the size of a}} number to 7 digits in Bucharest and 6 digits {{in the rest of the}} country and by changing the prefixing scheme. The <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>code</b> was changed from 9 to 0, the area code for Bucharest became 01, while to the rest of the country was temporarily given a 0 before the older area codes. For a short period, the surrounding of Bucharest (now Ilfov county) had the area code 0179, which has been eventually included into the Bucharest numbering plan as 01-79x-xxxx. The 02 code was used for calls to the Republic of Moldova.|$|E

One project {{begun in the}} late 1950s (foreshadowing artificial intelligence) linked biology and the design of electrical devices-computer programs that emulated artificial nerve cells and simulated functions such as learning ability and initiative. The intent was to construct a thinking machine, similar to a human nervous system that learned pattern recognition and avoided mistakes (e.g. programming a mobile satellite on the moon to avoid a deep precipice). Studies {{on the nature of}} speech led to more efficient use of the radio spectrum through bandwidth compression, and improved <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> and <b>coded</b> communications-other related studies focused on elimination of speech deficiencies and development of a phonetic typewriter. In medical research Melpar developed synthetic materials (tissue growth) to be compatible with the heart (later known as the Jarvik heart), and produced an electronic heart monitor (Cardiac Sentry) which detected out-of-norm variations, maintained hospital records and administered prescribed treatments. The company was a pioneer in plasma physics and developed materials for communicating with manned space vehicles reentering the atmosphere. Using solar energy, desalinization experiments were conducted to make saline and brackish water drinkable. Detection systems to measure highway curves, motions and vibrations were developed to improvemass transit systems.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWaardenburg {{syndrome}} type 4 (WS 4) {{is a rare}} {{neural crest}} disorder defined by the combination of Waardenburg syndrome (sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentation defects) and Hirschsprung disease (intestinal aganglionosis). Three genes {{are known to be}} involved in this syndrome, that is, EDN 3 (endothelin- 3), EDNRB (endothelin receptor type B), and SOX 10. However, 15 - 35 % of WS 4 remains unexplained at the molecular level, suggesting that other genes could be involved and/or that mutations within known genes may have escaped previous screenings. Here, we searched for deletions within recently identified SOX 10 regulatory sequences and describe the first characterization of a WS 4 patient presenting with a large deletion encompassing three of these enhancers. Analysis of the breakpoint region suggests a complex rearrangement involving three Alu sequences that could be mediated by a FosTes/MMBIR replication mechanism. Taken together with recent reports, our results demonstrate that the disruption of highly conserved non-coding elements located within or at a <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> from the <b>coding</b> sequences of key genes can result in several neurocristopathies. This opens up new routes to the molecular dissection of neural crest disorders...|$|R

40|$|In {{the normal}} case, a {{reflexive}} pronoun is bound within its containing clause. More exceptionally, a reflexive is instead {{related to a}} binder in a higher clause – a phenomenon known as <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding. <b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> binding {{can be found in}} Norwegian, but as I will show here, with considerable variation between speakers. Quite a few speakers accept <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding only across indefinite interveners. For those who accept <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding across definite interveners, the acceptability drops if the embedded clause has V 2 order, and in particular if the initial constituent of the embedded clause is topicalised. Other factors that influence the acceptability of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding are the logophoricity of the matrix verb, the agentivity of the embedded verb, the presence of person features in the intervening subject, and the presence of negation in the embedded clause. Some speakers reject <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding only when two ore more negative factors co-occur. This shows that <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding is a complex phenomenon, and that individual grammars can give priority to different factor...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 <b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> {{travel is}} a {{critical}} component of American life, generating immense impacts on a variety of aspects of the society. In 1995, American households took about 656 million <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> domestic trips (100 + miles, one way), which totaled 1 billion person trips. Compared to the well-studied intra-urban travel, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel needs further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts, for which the <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel data serve as a substantial basis. While MPOs periodically collect both supply and demand data to support the development of regional models, supply-side data reflecting transportation service and costs at corridor, interregional, and national level are scarce. To merge the gap, {{there is a need to}} establish a national data framework, with available datasets integrated to support implementing quantitative methods on a national highway network to resolve network loading issues for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel. This research intends to address this imperative. The research scope embraces the <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger travel on national highways within the contiguous United States. The framework developed comprises not only a data warehouse where a plethora of datasets reside and interact, but also a complete modeling methodology to infer network loading conditions of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel. Applying the national data framework approach, this research answers a pivotal question: how can we gain knowledge and insights of distributive patterns of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger travel at interregional level given existing data resources? This research elaborates the methodologies for the framework design and addresses the technical and theoretical challenges particularly in issues of travel impedance estimation and <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel network loading. Findings from this research lay a solid foundation for building the fundamental theoretical framework urgently needed for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel studies and contribute significantly to the understanding of the supply side of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel, from available infrastructure capacity and networks loading conditions to the induced environment challenges, infrastructure congestion, and investment costs, as well as facilitating policy making and evaluation pertain to <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel at national level...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that (some {{speakers}} of) Norwegian allow <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding, defined here as binding across a finite clause boundary. A number of factors that facilitate <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding have also been identified. In the study reported on here, 93 native speakers of Norwegian judged 30 sentences in a web-based questionnaire. The results show that V 2 order in the embedded clause reduces the acceptability of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding considerably, and the presence of a fronted topic in the embedded clause further adds to this effect. V 2 order involves a relatively complex C-domain, and the presence of an initial topic increases the complexity even more. It appears that even without <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding, an embedded complex C-domain reduces the acceptability for some speakers, but adding <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding increases the rejection rate considerably. There are also other factors that influence the acceptance of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding, and in addition, there is individual variation in the weighting of the factors. Moreover, for some speakers each factor in isolation does not make <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding unaccept¬able – only the interaction of two or more factors leads to ungram¬maticality. Hence, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding is a more complex phenomenon than has hitherto been assumed...|$|R
