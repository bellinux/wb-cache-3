5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply <b>line</b> (<b>Model</b> had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40Â°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly {{suffered from a}} lack of air cover and the inexperience in some of its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep thrust into Allied <b>line,</b> <b>Model</b> was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. He had failed to capture a vital road junction at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had broken down by 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January.|$|E

40|$|Software {{product line}} {{engineering}} is a proposed methodology that enables software products and software-intensive systems {{to be developed}} at lower cost, higher quality and less time to market. The structured and managed artifacts reuse among different products in development is the main target of software product line engineering. As a key-method of the product line engineering approach, the commonality and variability analysis is a technique that identifies the potential artifacts for reuse. But the reuse poses challenges for delivering safety-critical products from the product line and achieving product line functional safety. In order to analyze the product line and provide more valuable information for its safety analysis, we make use of established product <b>line</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques, which <b>model</b> the product <b>line</b> commonality and variability from different perspectives. In this report, we investigate the product <b>line</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques. The product modeling analysis process covers two aspects: 1. Study different product <b>line</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques and find the ones suitable for product <b>line</b> <b>modeling.</b> We choose the modeling techniques that can be implemented to discuss in detail. 2. We implement the industrial wheel loader product <b>line</b> with two <b>modeling</b> techniques. Comprehensive models and detailed modeling process explanation are presented. The product line functional safety analysis covers three aspects: 1. Investigate the different safety analysis techniques and choose the fault tree analysis as the main technique. 2. Extend the single system fault tree to the product line fault tree. 3. Investigate {{the contributions of the}} product <b>line</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques to the product line functional safety analysis. Specifically, we map the product <b>line</b> <b>models</b> to the product line fault tree. Furthermore, we evaluate the product <b>line</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques from their performance in domain analysis and safety analysis...|$|R

25|$|As the {{automobile}} marketplace in the U.S. was {{moving away from}} economy towards performance and luxury vehicles, American Motors began removing the historic Rambler name from its larger models. However, the American and Classic models retained their economy car marketing image, {{as well as their}} traditional nameplate. To cement this image, a Rambler American was again the overall winner in the Mobil Economy Run. The mid-trim level 330 model was dropped, leaving the top 440 and base 220 models in the lineup for 1966. The top of the <b>line</b> <b>model,</b> available only as a two-door hardtop, saw its name changed from 440-H, to Rogue.|$|E
2500|$|R2 {{is often}} {{interpreted}} as the proportion of response variation [...] "explained" [...] by the regressors in the model.

An interior value such as R2=0.7 may be interpreted as follows: [...] "Seventy {{percent of the variance in}} the response variable can be explained by the explanatory variables. The remaining thirty percent can be attributed to unknown, lurking variables or inherent variability." ...|$|E

According to the documentary Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion (1991) {{it was actually a}} recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg <b>Line</b> <b>model</b> kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: [...] "a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top."

2500|$|The Chevrolet Chevelle [...] is a mid-sized {{automobile}} {{which was}} produced by Chevrolet in three generations for the 1964 through 1978 model years. Part of the General Motors (GM) A-Body platform, the Chevelle was one of Chevrolet's most successful nameplates. Body styles include coupes, sedans, convertibles and station wagons. Super Sport versions were produced through the 1973 model year, and Lagunas from 1973 through 1976. After a three-year absence, the El Camino was reintroduced {{as part of the}} new Chevelle lineup. [...] The Chevelle also provided the platform for the Monte Carlo introduced in 1970. The Malibu, the top of the <b>line</b> <b>model</b> through 1972, replaced the Chevelle nameplate for the redesigned, downsized 1978 models.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regression}} analysis the researcher specifies an empirical model. For example, {{a very common}} model is the straight <b>line</b> <b>model</b> {{which is used to}} test if there is a linear relationship between dependent and independent variable. If a linear relationship is found to exist, the variables are said to be correlated. However, correlation does not prove causation, as both variables may be correlated with other, hidden, variables, or the dependent variable may [...] "reverse" [...] cause the independent variables, or the variables may be otherwise spuriously correlated. [...] For example, suppose there is a correlation between deaths by drowning and the volume of ice cream sales at a particular beach. Yet, both the number of people going swimming and the volume of ice cream sales increase as the weather gets hotter, and presumably the number of deaths by drowning is correlated with the number of people going swimming. Perhaps an increase in swimmers causes both the other variables to increase.|$|E

2500|$|At its launch, the Taurus was {{available}} in four models; the L, the MT-5, the GL, and the LX. The L was the base model, with only {{the most basic of}} equipment. The MT-5 was the second model, which was aimed at Japanese imports, as it was only available with a 4-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission (hence the term MT-5). The value model was the GL, which contained more equipment than the MT-5 and L, and had such interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding rear armrest, electric windows and locks. The LX was the top of the <b>line</b> <b>model,</b> which had the most standard equipment, as well as many features that were unique to this model, such as cornering lamps and side body cladding, as well as its own unique seat design, automatic climate control, light packages, luggage convenience kit, electronic cluster with onboard system scanner and fuel computer, autolamps with timer, premium amplified stereo with 6 speakers [...] "Premium Sound", 6 way electric seats with inflatable lumbar support and other equipment options at an added price.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the transmission <b>line</b> <b>models</b> requires an input signal in the frequency domain describing {{the nature of the}} transient disturbance (for example, a valve closure) and an exact solution of the linearized mass and momentum equations for unsteady pipe flow. The use of the transmission <b>line</b> <b>models</b> does not require a strict adherence to a timeâspace discretization grid governed by the Courant condition, but it does require that the input signal be discretized in the frequency domain. This paper investigates the errors induced by the discretization of the input signal and provides guidelines for the appropriate selection of discretization size for the linear transmission <b>line</b> <b>models.</b> The accuracy of the model is quantified through comparison with a finely discretisated method of characteristics (MOC) model. The results show that the transmission <b>line</b> <b>models</b> are sensitive to the timeâfrequency discretization size and unlike the MOC, the appropriate size of the discretization changes depending on the transient event being modelled as well as the energy losses in the system.
