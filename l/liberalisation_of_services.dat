40|$|Malaysia is set {{to embrace}} the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services.</b> This will pose {{strategic}} challenges to Malaysian law firms and will impact on industry competition. It is not certain as to how Malaysian law firms perceive the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services,</b> and what strategic actions will be taken by {{them in order to}} maintain their strategic position and competitiveness. Against this backdrop, this study seeks to find out the answers to the questions as to how Malaysian law firms perceive the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services</b> – whether it is perceived as a threat or an opportunity; the strengths, weaknesses and core competencies of Malaysian law firms in face <b>of</b> the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal services; and the strategic actions taken by Malaysian law firms in order to maintain their strategic position and competitiveness. The bodies of literature that were used to inform this research are the conceptual framework of Porter’s five forces and the theory of the resource-based view. Using qualitative approach, this research seeks to examine the research problem by interviewing participants who are partners of Malaysian law firms as well as a representative from the professional body which represent the largest State Bar Committee in Malaysia, i. e. the Kuala Lumpur Bar Committee. From the fieldwork, it was found out that Malaysian law firms generally perceive the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services</b> as both a threat and an opportunity. It was also found out that Malaysian law firms do have their own strengths, weaknesses and core competencies in face of the challenges that arise from the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services.</b> This research confirmed and prove the usefulness of Porter’s five forces framework to assess the attractiveness of the legal industry in Malaysia based on the strengths of five competitive forces and the resource-based view to analyse the internal asset (i. e. resources, capabilities and competencies) of Malaysian law firms.

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} origins of the {{recently}} adopted general services directives of the European Union, and addresses the question why such an important piece of internal market legislation was adopted so recently, and anyway well after the 1992 deadline for the completion of the internal market. It argues that piecemeal <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> has occurred on a regular basis ever since 1992. For each of those specific service directives, the EU institutions decided on the appropriate regulatory mix between liberalisation and targeted harmonisation. This regulatory mix was largely abandoned in the Commission’s original proposal to introduce the country-of-origin principle across all services covered by the directive. It is argued in this paper that this regulatory shift was ill-advised and explains the strong political resistance which the original ‘Bolkestein’ draft encountered from the side of other political and civil society actors, leading to a rather different outcome in {{the final version of the}} directive. harmonisation; provision of services; negative integration; positive integration; regulatory competition...|$|E

Significant scope for liberalisation under GATS mode 4 (the movement of natural persons) may remain. However, temporary migration is already promoted on a unilateral and bilateral basis within immigration policy frameworks that may provide greater flexibility than GATS mode 4. With respect to both trade and migration, the more diverse the exchanging countries are, the greater the economic benefits tend to be. However, greater diversity may also imply greater social costs. This paradox of diversity needs to be addressed through appropriate social policies accompanying enhanced temporary and permanent migration. international trade; migration; outsourcing; temporary workers; e-labour; GATS; negotiation...|$|E

40|$|Trade <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> {{environmental}} <b>services</b> {{under the}} current WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has been widely advocated {{as a means of}} increasing private sector participation in the water sector in developing countries. The <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> in lower income countries is expected to promote more efficient operation, increase investment and improve service coverage. At the same time, these proposals have been widely criticised, and there has been growing resistance to the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services.</b> This study reviews the evidence on the impact of private sector involvement in the provision <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> in developing countries. A number of reasons why water privatisation may prove problematic in lower-income countries are identified, including transaction costs and possible regulatory weaknesses. Recognising that effective regulation is needed to ensure that the potential gains from private involvement are fully realised, the paper then considers the relationship between national regulatory autonomy and GATS liberalisation. The study concludes that developing countries with limited regulatory resources should adopt a cautious approach to public services liberalisation, by sequencing market liberalisation measures to match the development of their regulatory institutional capacity. The paper also argues for improved clarity in the interpretation of the GATS provisions on the right of members to exercise national regulatory policy. water services, GATS, developing countries, privatisation., Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} several indicators {{to measure}} the extent and depth of rules governing international migration. It {{is set in the}} context of moves towards further <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> trade and associated labour mobility (Mode 4) under GATS and related regional trading arrangements. Ten Southeast Asian countries at various stages of economic development are examined as a case study, with special reference to health care and information technology. These sectors are priority sectors for regional cooperation in services trade in ASEAN, but were expected to represent opposite extremes in terms of the regulation of migration. The study finds that the more advanced countries tend to have more liberal regimes for international movements of skilled manpower, although there were smaller differences regarding general visa and work permit arrangements. Generic restrictions on mobility were related to trade policies, as well as to direct barriers (often country-specific) to migration. They included minimum salary requirement, levies on foreign workers, economic needs tests, and limitations related to language, education and job experience. Controls were more extensive in the health care sector, related to social considerations as well as professional organisational interests.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of liberalisation has been historically {{generated by the}} establishment of World Trade Organisation (WTO). Services sector was comprehensively regulated by General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Regionally, AFAS was initially established to bolster the objective of GATS.

Australia’s telecommunications sector is used as a case study of how to measure the domestic economic efficiency gains of regulatory reforms. Some important areas for future work, including the link to services trade of foreign direct investment controls, are highlighted.

40|$|Unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> {{trade in}} goods and {{services}} has been considered an important policy objective. Most trade in services liberalisation {{in the developing world}} has taken place unilaterally; but it is not common among Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Among LDCs Bangladesh is a forerunner in pursuing unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> mobile telephone <b>services.</b> There is a dearth of empirical studies on Bangladesh’s unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> mobile phone <b>services</b> and its impact on users. Furthermore, no scholarly studies are known on the influence <b>of</b> unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> on undertaking binding liberalisation obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in <b>Services</b> (GATS) framework <b>of</b> the World Trade Organisation. This study examined factors that motivated Bangladesh’s unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> mobile phone <b>service</b> and its impact on users. It also investigated how unilateral liberalisation influenced Bangladesh to undertake binding liberalisation commitments under the GATS. The study applied a qualitative research design to address the research questions. Primary data were obtained from three different sources: informants from mobile phone firms, senior managers across the six mobile phone firms, trade experts, telecommunications analysts, policy makers, the telecommunications regulator, public officials and private sector representatives. Focus group discussions with different mobile phone users were conducted to determine the impact <b>of</b> unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> mobile <b>services.</b> In the first 6 - 7 years after unilateral <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the sector, {{there was a lack of}} competition, mobile phone tariffs were high, quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> was unsatisfactory, and the diversity <b>of</b> <b>services</b> was limited, which affected the growth of the sector. The competitive landscape of the sector changed dramatically after the state-owned firm and another large private operator commenced mobile phone service operations in 2005. Stiff competition took hold, which resulted in cheap and easy accessibility, a drastic reduction in mobile phone tariffs, and improved quality and variety <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The main implications of the study are: (1) An unfettered market is detrimental to consumer benefits. A powerful independent regulatory body, which is held accountable for its actions, is needed for a free market to operate in the broader public interest; (2) Unilateral liberalisation is a ‘necessary condition’ and provided a foundation for the government of Bangladesh to undertake binding liberalisation commitments under WTO GATS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} current WTO rules concerning telecommunications services. It {{includes an}} explanation {{of the structure of the}} GATS, its Annex on Telecommunications, and the Agreement on Basic Telecommunication Services. As discussed in the previous chapter, the latter reflects the commitments of sixty-nine countries that agreed to open their markets to foreign basic telecommunication services and to foreign suppliers of these services. It also contains additional rules which are linked to these commitments and are assembled under the so-called ‘Reference Paper’. The GATT is relevant in relation to equipment and terminals used to convey and receive telecommunications signals. This, however, constitutes a different line of trade, which is discussed in Chapter 9 of this book. he GATS, similarly to the GATT, aims at protecting equality of competitive opportunities for companies in domestic markets regardless of their origin and the origin of their services. It aims at facilitating progressive <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> while enabling WTO Members to regulate them “in order to meet national policy objectives”. The GATS thus constitutes the framework agreement relevant to all services and particularly those that, like telecommunication services, have been or are being liberalised. n contrast with the GATT, the GATS contains a mix of horizontal commitments applicable to all services and service suppliers and sectorbased commitments only applicable to those sectors which have been explicitly open to trade by WTO Members. Horizontal rules apply to all measures by Members affecting trade in services. There are no limits in the scope of services except those supplied on a non-commercial basis or outside any form of competition, such as national security or justice.

40|$|Abstract The {{reach of}} the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has gone beyond its {{traditional}} spheres of trading in goods to influencing the mobility of skilled labour and thus {{having an impact on}} migration patterns. The growing influence of the WTO has led to the enforcement and implementation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which calls for the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> including the movement of ‘natural persons’ for the purposes of providing services in member states of the WTO under mode 4 of the Agreement. Globalisation, liberal market economies and the increased mobility of skilled labour have led to a merging of the trade and migration communities globally. With fears running high of a skilled exodus from developing countries to developed countries, known as a brain drain, questions arise as to who the brain drain benefits, what the purpose of mode 4 is, and whether developing countries can use mode 4 to solve their brain drain as its emphasis is on the movement of skilled labour on a temporary basis. The rapid changes globally have been fueled by a shift in major industrial economies from industrial economies to knowledge based economies; these rely heavily on highly skilled labour for economic growth and wealth creation, this process has also been aided by the growing capacity of developing countries to produce skilled labour. Using South Africa as an example, the following thesis will assess what impact mode 4 of the GATS will have on developing countries {{in the midst of a}} skills shortage and brain drain. It will provide a general understanding of what the GATS is, while also showing what effect the brain drain, immigration policy, neo-liberalism and globalisation will have on mode 4 negotiations within the WTO...|$|E

40|$|Liberalisation {{of trade}} in {{services}} and associated domestic reforms is fundamental to the realisation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). However, this requires real (‘on the ground’) liberalisation, not simply “on paper” liberalisation {{in the form of}} commitments under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), a sideshow in services liberalisation. The decision by leaders to form an AEC covering also the free flow of services has put the emphasis very much on ensuring each ASEAN Member State (AMS) removes restrictions affecting {{trade in services}} (including related foreign investment) and implement related reforms. However, the diagnostic analysis presented in this Services Diagnostic and Needs Assessment Study (SDNAS), including in the in-country reports, suggests this is not happening, or at least is going very slowly, especially when set against the adopted start date for the AEC of 2015. Hence, key and effective technical assistance and capacity building is needed to advance ‘on the ground’ <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and related reforms. The in-country fieldwork and other analysis undertaken in the SDNAS helped identify constraints and provided a list of potential technical assistance and capacity building projects to help address them, both from a primarily cross-cutting but also a sectoral perspective. The SDNAS has also adopted an economic framework based on the fundamental benefits of unilateral liberalisation and a strategic structured approach, to identify key areas (‘umbrellas’) needing technical assistance and capacity building activities, such as strengthening the evidence base, promoting transparency, developing strategies and planning, and raising understanding and awareness. Key activity clusters were also identified within these three ‘umbrellas’, such as policy analysis, services policy visions, and organisations for dialogues, respectively. Individual priority technical assistance and capacity building project proposals within these clusters were determined using a cost-benefit analytical approach. The SNDAS importantly recommends the need to re-balance much of the technical assistance and capacity building activities away from being directed at servicing the AFAS trade negotiations and focusing on ‘on-paper’ liberalisation towards efforts to build transparency and fundamental support for services trade liberalisation and related reforms in AMS. This is what is required to achieve the necessary ‘on-the-ground’ changes to achieve the AEC. This is consistent with international experience that significant ‘on-the-ground’ services liberalisation and related reforms requires unilateral efforts, and that trade negotiations have generally failed to deliver such changes. With this in mind, the SNDAS has developed and recommended a number of detailed proposed technical assistance and capacity building project templates...|$|E
40|$|This article explores how {{political}} parties, trade unions, consumer {{bodies and}} business organisations {{have responded to}} the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> public <b>services</b> across a number of European states. It does so on the basis of research conducted as part of a Framework Five Project - BASIC - which examined the reform <b>of</b> public <b>services</b> at both the national and EU level. The paper concludes that there have been some elements of a shift in the consensus regarding the way in which such services should be organised but that concerns over the effects <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> still existed amongst many groups...|$|R
