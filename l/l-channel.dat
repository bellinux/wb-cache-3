40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of <b>L-channel</b> {{quadratic}} Gaussian multiple description (MD) coding. We recently introduced a new encoding scheme in [1] for general <b>L-channel</b> MD problem, based on a technique called `Combinatorial Message Sharing' (CMS), where every subset of the descriptions shares a distinct common message. The new achievable region subsumes the most well known region for the general problem, due to Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG) [2]. Moreover, we showed in [3] that the new scheme provides a strict improvement of the achievable region for any source and distortion measures for which some 2 -description subset is such that the Zhang and Berger (ZB) scheme achieves points outside the El-Gamal and Cover (EC) region. In this paper, we show a more surprising result: CMS outperforms VKG for a general class of sources and distortion measures, which includes scenarios where for all 2 -description subsets, the ZB and EC regions coincide. In particular, we show that CMS strictly extends VKG region, for the <b>L-channel</b> quadratic Gaussian MD problem for all L≥ 3, {{despite the fact that the}} EC region is complete for the corresponding 2 -descriptions problem. Using the encoding principles derived, we show that the CMS scheme achieves the complete rate-distortion region for several asymmetric cross-sections of the <b>L-channel</b> quadratic Gaussian MD problem, which have not been considered earlier...|$|E

This study examined functional vasomotor differences in L- and T-channel blockade between large and small vessels and compared the abundance of the L- and T-type channels in these vessels. The inhibition of endothelin- 1 and potassium-induced vascular contractile responses by <b>L-channel</b> blockers (verapamil and nifedipine) was compared with combined L- and T-channel blockers (mibefradil and efonidipine) in large (rat aorta) and small (rat mesenteric and human subcutaneous) vessels using wire myography. All 4 of the Ca 2 channel blockers inhibited contractile responses to a similar extent in large rat vessels; however, in rat microvessels, the combined L- and T-channel blockers produced significantly greater inhibition of contraction than <b>L-channel</b> blockers alone. The significance of this differential T-channel effect in microvessels was further supported by the following: (1) a greater abundance of T-channels compared with L-channels in microvessels but not in large vessels; (2) demonstration of divergent Ca 2 channel blocker responses in human microvessels; (3) incremental inhibition of constrictor responses with combined L- and T-Ca 2 channel blockers despite maximal <b>L-channel</b> blockade; (4) the use of structurally diverse Ca 2 channel blockers with varied affinity for L- and T-channels; (5) the use of pharmacodynamically and therapeutically appropriate Ca 2 channel blocker concentrations; (6) confirmation of contractile agonist independent responses; and (7) exclusion of an endothelium-dependent mechanism.

40|$|ABSTRACT Skeletal and cardiac {{dihydropyridine}} receptors function both as voltage-dependent btype calcium channels (<b>L-channels)</b> and {{as critical}} proteins that trigger calcium {{release from the}} sarcoplasmic reficulum in muscle. In spite of these similarities, skeletal <b>L-channels</b> exhibit a markedly slower activation rate than cardiac <b>L-channels.</b> We investigated the mechanisms underlying this difference by comparing the unitary behavior of <b>L-channels</b> in cell-attached patches of dysgenic myotubes expressing skeletal, cardiac, or chimeric dihydropyridine receptors. Our results demonstrate that ensemble averages activate rapidly for the purely cardiac dihydropyridine receptor and approximately five times more slowly for <b>L-channels</b> attributable to the purely skeletal dihydropyridine receptor or a chimeric dihydropyridine receptor in which only the first internal repeat {{and all of the}} putative intracellular loops are of skeletal origin. All of the constructs studied similarly exhibit a brief (2 -ms) and a long (~> 15 -ms) open time in the presence of Bay K 8644, neither of which depend significantly on voltage. In the absence of Bay K 8644, the fraction of total open events is markedly shifted to the briefer open time without altering the rate of ensemble activation. Closed time analysis of <b>L-channels</b> with cardiac-like, rapid activation (recorded in the presence of dihydropyridine agonist) reveals both a brief (Nl-ms) closed time and a second, voltage-dependent, long-lasting closed time. The time until first opening after depolarization is three to six times faster for rapidly activating <b>L-channels</b> than for slowly activating <b>L-channels</b> and depends strongly on voltage for both types of channels. The results suggest that a voltage-dependent, closedclosed transition that is fast in cardiac <b>L-channels</b> and slow in skeletal <b>L-channels</b> can account for the difference in activation rate between these two channels.

The most popular and effective tools for analyzing the roles of L-type calcium channels (<b>L-channels)</b> are specific antagonists such as dihydropyrigines. With these drugs however, it is difficult to target specific cells. One solution is to develop a genetically targetable inhibitor coded by DNA. As a candidate for such an inhibitor, a dominant negative mutant of Cav 1. 2 was designed by mimicking an ascidian 3 -domain-type α 1 subunit (that inhibits the full-length subunit’s current). The 3 -domain-type Cav 1. 2 subunit significantly inhibited wild-type Cav 1. 2 current, but not other ionic currents such as Cav 2. 1 and Nav channels in Xenopus oocyte expression systems. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of the wild-type protein into the plasma membrane was significantly suppressed on coexpression with the truncated protein.

40|$|L-type (CaV 1. 2) {{calcium channel}} antagonists play an {{important}} role in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. (R) -Roscovitine, a trisubstituted purine, has been shown to inhibit L-currents by slowing activation and enhancing inactivation. This study utilized molecular and pharmacological approaches to determine whether these effects result from (R) -roscovitine binding to a single site. Using the S enantiomer, we find that (S) -roscovitine enhances inactivation without affecting activation, which suggests multiple sites. This was further supported in studies using chimeric channels comprised of N- and <b>L-channel</b> domains. Those chimeras containing <b>L-channel</b> domains I and IV showed (R) -roscovitine-induced slowed activation like that of wild type L-channels, whereas chimeric channels containing <b>L-channel</b> domain I responded to (R) -roscovitine with enhanced inactivation. We conclude that (R) -roscovitine binds to distinct sites on L-type channels to slow activation and enhance inactivation. These sites appear to be unique from other calcium channel antagonist sites that reside within domains III and IV and are thus novel sites that could be exploited for future drug development. Trisubstituted purines could become a new class of drugs for the treatment of diseases related to hyperfunction of L-type channels, such as Torsades de Pointes...|$|E

40|$|Timothy {{syndrome}} (TS) is a multiorgan dysfunction {{caused by}} a Gly to Arg substitution at position 406 (G 406 R) of the human CaV 1. 2 (L-type) channel. The TS phenotype includes severe arrhythmias that {{are thought to be}} triggered by impaired open-state voltage-dependent inactivation (OSvdI). The effect of the TS mutation on other <b>L-channel</b> gating mechanisms has yet to be investigated. We compared kinetic properties of exogenously expressed (HEK 293 cells) rabbit cardiac L-channels with (G 436 R; corresponding to position 406 in human clone) and without (wild-type) the TS mutation. Our results surprisingly show that the TS mutation did not affect close-state voltage-dependent inactivation, which suggests different gating mechanisms underlie these two types of voltage-dependent inactivation. The TS mutation also significantly slowed activation at voltages less than 10 mV, and significantly slowed deactivation across all test voltages. Deactivation was slowed in the double mutant G 436 R/S 439 A, which suggests that phosphorylation of S 439 was not involved. The <b>L-channel</b> agonist Bay K 8644 increased the magnitude of both step and tail currents, but surprisingly failed to slow deactivation of TS channels. Our mathematical model showed that slowed deactivation plus impaired OSvdI combine to synergistically increase cardiac action potential duration that is a likely cause of arrhythmias in TS patients. Roscovitine, a tri-substituted purine that enhances <b>L-channel</b> OSvdI, restored TS-impaired OSvdI.

40|$|Using the cell-attached {{recording}} configuration, {{we found}} that in adult bovine chromaffin cells there exists a direct membrane-delimited inhibition of single Bay K-modified <b>L-channels</b> mediated by opioids and ATP locally released in the recording pipette. This autocrine modulation is mediated by pertussis toxin (PTX) -sensitive G-proteins and causes a 50 % decrease of the open channel probability (Po) and an equivalent percentage increase of null sweeps at + 10 mV with no changes to the activation kinetics, single channel conductance and mean open time. The decrease in Po is mainly due {{to an increase in}} the occurrence and duration of slow closed times (> 40 ms). Addition of purinergic and opioidergic antagonists (suramin and naloxone) or cell pre-treatment with PTX removes the inhibition while addition of ATP and opioids inside the pipette, but not outside, mimics the effect. Strong pre-pulses (+ 150 mV, 280 ms) followed by short repolarizations are unable to remove the inhibition at test potential (+ 10 mV). Increasing the level of cAMP by either direct application of 8 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) -cAMP (8 -CPT-cAMP) or mixtures of forskolin and 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine (IBMX) potentiates the activity of <b>L-channels</b> by increasing the mean open time and decreasing the mean closed time and percentage of null sweeps. The cAMP-induced potentiation occurs regardless of whether the G-protein-mediated inhibition is activated by ATP and opioids or inactivated by PTX. Protein kinase inhibitors (H 7 and H 89) prevent the effects of cAMP without altering the basal autocrine modulation associated with PTX-sensitive G-proteins. Our results provide new evidence for the coexistence of two distinct modulations that may converge on the same neuroendocrine L-channel: a direct G-protein-dependent inhibition and a cAMP-mediated potentiation, which may work in combination to regulate Ca 2 + entry during neurosecretion...|$|R

The Ca 2 + channel pore-forming subunit (CaVα 1) {{is a candidate for}} the site of AA inhibition because T-type Ca 2 + channels, which do not require accessory subunits for expression, are inhibited by AA. Here, we report the unanticipated role of accessory CaVβ subunits on the inhibition of CaV 1. 3 b L-type (L-) current by AA. Whole cell Ba 2 + currents were measured from recombinant channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells at a test potential of − 10 mV from a holding potential of − 90 mV. A one-minute exposure to 10 µM AA inhibited currents with β 1 b, β 3, or β 4 58, 51, or 44 %, respectively, but with β 2 a only 31 %. At a more depolarized holding potential of − 60 mV, currents were inhibited to a lesser degree. These data are best explained by a simple model where AA stabilizes CaV 1. 3 b in a deep closed-channel conformation, resulting in current inhibition. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition by AA occurred in the absence of test pulses, indicating that channels do not need to open to become inhibited. AA had no effect on the voltage dependence of holding potential–dependent inactivation or on recovery from inactivation regardless of CaVβ subunit. Unexpectedly, kinetic analysis revealed evidence for two populations of <b>L-channels</b> that exhibit willing and reluctant gating previously described for CaV 2 channels. AA preferentially inhibited reluctant gating channels, revealing the accelerated kinetics of willing channels. Additionally, we discovered that the palmitoyl groups of β 2 a interfere with inhibition by AA. Our novel findings that the CaVβ subunit alters kinetic changes and magnitude of inhibition by AA suggest that CaVβ expression may regulate how AA modulates Ca 2 +-dependent processes that rely on <b>L-channels,</b> such as gene expression, enzyme activation, secretion, and membrane excitability...|$|R
40|$|The hypocretin/orexins (Hcrt/Orxs) are {{hypothalamic}} neuropeptides {{that regulate}} stress, addiction, feeding, and arousal behaviors. They depolarize {{many types of}} central neurons and can increase [Ca 2 +]i in some, {{including those of the}} dorsal raphe (DR) and laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) nuclei—two structures likely to contribute to the behavioral actions of Hcrt/Orx. In this study, we used simultaneous whole cell and Ca 2 +-imaging methods in mouse brain slices to compare the Hcrt/Orx-activated current in DR and LDT neurons and to determine whether it contributes to the Ca 2 + influx evoked by Hcrt/Orx. We found Hcrt/Orx activates a similar noisy cation current that reversed near 0 mV in both cell types. Contrary to our expectation, this current did not contribute to the somatic Ca 2 + influx evoked by Hcrt/Orx. In contrast, Hcrt/Orx enhanced the Ca 2 + transients produced by voltage steps (− 60 to − 30 mV) by ∼ 30 % even in neurons lacking an inward current. This effect was abolished by nifedipine, augmented by Bay-K and abolished by bisindolylmaleimide I. Thus Hcrt/Orx has two independent actions: activation of noisy cation channels that generate depolarization and activation of a protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent enhancement of Ca 2 + transients mediated by L-type Ca 2 + channels. Immunocytochemistry verified that both these actions occurred in serotonergic and cholinergic neurons, indicating that Hcrt/Orx can function as a neuromodulator in these key neurons of the reticular activating system. Because regulation of Ca 2 + transients mediated by <b>L-channels</b> is often linked to the control of transcriptional signaling, our findings imply that Hcrt/Orxs may also function in the regulation of long-term homeostatic or trophic processes...|$|R

40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle myogenesis, precursor cells or myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated cells (myotubes), which then further develop into functional muscle. We investigated if the inhibition of myogenesis by transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) and bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) involve regulation of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels. Primary cultured myoblasts {{were kept in}} fusion medium (0 – 6 days) in either the absence (control conditions) or the presence of 40 pm TGF-β 1 or 5 nm BMP- 2. Subsequently, the developing myotubes were transferred to a growth factor-free recording solution, and subjected to whole cell patch-clamp experiments. At day 0, 14 % of non-fusing myoblasts exhibited T-current, whereas the L-current was practically absent. Under control conditions, however, the percentage of T- and L-channel-expressing myotubes increased sharply, from 25 % at day 1 to ∼ 100 % at days 2 – 6. In addition, parallel increases were determined for Ca 2 +-currents density and cell membrane capacitance (Cm), which {{is proportional to the}} size of myotubes. Interestingly, at days 1 – 2 TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 eliminated the T-current on initial 14 % of T-channel-expressing myoblasts. Moreover, at day 6 the growth factors significantly reduced the maximal values of both T-current density (80 %) and Cm (60 %). The effect of BMP- 2 was selective on T-channels, whereas TGF-β 1 decreased also the L-current density (90 %). A similar reduction in maximal conductance of the Ca 2 + channels was determined, in the absence of significant alterations in other essential properties of the channels, including the time course and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. The results suggest these growth factors markedly reduce the number of functional T- (both TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2) and <b>L-channels</b> (only TGF-β 1) in the surface of the plasma membrane, and contribute to explaining the associated effects on myogenesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} voltage-activated, L-type, Ca 2 + channels in phorbol ester-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) release from rat anterior pituitary tissue. The L-type Ca 2 + channel inhibitor, nimodipine (NMD), inhibited phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) -induced GH release but had no significant effect on LH release. The L-type Ca 2 + channel activator BAY K 8644 {{had no effect on}} PDBu-induced GH release but potentiated PDBu-induced LH release. In contrast, 60 mM K+-induced LH and GH release were inhibited by NMD, whereas BAY K 8644 had no effect. When PDBu and either K+ or BAY K 8644 were used together, they acted synergistically to evoke levels of LH release greater than addition of release caused by each secretagogue alone. However, the release of GH was additive with PDBu and either K+, BAY K 8644. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine inhibited both PDBu-induced LH release and GH release. A structurally different PKC inhibitor, H 7, significantly inhibited PDBu-induced LH release but had no effect on PDBu-induced GH release. Both staurosporine and H 7 inhibited LH release induced by PDBu and BAY K 8644 together. In contrast, although staurosporine inhibited GH release induced by PDBu and BAY K 8644, H 7 significantly potentiated this response. A difference in the action of these two inhibitors was also apparent on K+-induced hormone release where staurosporine partially blocked K+-induced LH and GH release but H 7 had no effect on the release of either hormone. Data obtained in 45 Ca 2 + influx experiments further suggested that a staurosporine-sensitive, but H 7 -resistant, PKC-like kinase may tonically maintain <b>L-channels</b> in a voltage-sensitive state, as down-regulation of PKC in dispersed anterior pituitary cells by long term PDBu treatment caused a significant reduction in K+-induced 45 Ca 2 + influx. We conclude that phorbol ester-induced GH release, but not LH release, is a result of L-type Ca 2 + channel activation which may occur by means of alterations in the channel itself to increase its responsiveness to a given depolarisation...|$|R
40|$|KEY POINTS: The {{voltage-gated}} Ca(2 +) channels (VGCCs) that catalyse striatal dopamine transmission {{are critical}} to dopamine function and might prime subpopulations of neurons for parkinsonian degeneration. However, the VGCCs that operate on mesostriatal axons are incompletely defined; previous studies encompassed channels on striatal cholinergic interneurons that strongly influence dopamine transmission. We define that multiple types of axonal VGCCs operate that extend beyond classic presynaptic N/P/Q channels to include T- and L-types. We reveal differences in VGCC function between mouse axon types that in humans are vulnerable versus resistant to Parkinson's disease. We show {{for the first time}} that this is underpinned by different sensitivity of dopamine transmission to extracellular Ca(2 +) and by different spatiotemporal intracellular Ca(2 +) microdomains. These data define key principles of how Ca(2 +) and VGCCs govern dopamine transmission in the healthy brain and reveal differences between neuron types that might contribute to vulnerability in disease. ABSTRACT: The axonal voltage-gated Ca(2 +) channels (VGCCs) that catalyse dopamine (DA) transmission are incompletely defined. Yet, they {{are critical to}} DA function and might prime subpopulations of DA neurons for parkinsonian degeneration. Previous studies of VGCCs will have encompassed those on striatal cholinergic interneurons, which strongly influence DA transmission. We identify which VGCCs on DA axons govern DA transmission, we determine their dynamic properties and reveal an underlying basis for differences between the caudate putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We detected DA release evoked electrically during nicotinic receptor blockade or optogenetically by light activation of channel rhodopsin-expressing DA axons in mouse striatal slices. Subtype-specific VGCC blockers indicated that N-, Q-, T- and L-VGCCs govern DA release in CPu, but in NAc, T and <b>L-channels</b> are relatively silent. The roles of the most dominant channels were inversely frequency-dependent, due to low-pass filtering of DA release by Ca(2 +) -dependent relationships between initial release probability and short-term plasticity. Ca(2 +) concentration-response curves revealed that differences between CPu and NAc were due to greater underlying Ca(2 +) sensitivity of DA transmission from CPu axons. Functions for 'silent' L- and T-channels in NAc could be unmasked by elevating extracellular [Ca(2 +) ]. Furthermore, we identified a greater coupling between BAPTA-sensitive, fast Ca(2 +) transients and DA transmission in CPu axons, and evidence for endogenous fast buffering of Ca(2 +) in NAc. These data reveal that a range of VGCCs operate dynamically on DA axons, depending on local driving forces. Furthermore, they reveal dramatic differences in Ca(2 +) handling between axonal subpopulations that show different vulnerability to parkinsonian degeneration...|$|R

T. Dirksen, H. T. Nguyen, I. N. Pessah, K. G. Beam, and P. D. Allen. 1996. Nature. 380 : 72 – 75.). However, the dependence of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of skeletal L-current on RyR 1 {{has yet to be}} fully elucidated. Thus, we have evaluated the influence of RyR 1 on the properties of macroscopic L-currents and intracellular charge movements in cultured skeletal myotubes derived from normal and “RyR 1 -knockout” (dyspedic) mice. Compared with normal myotubes, dyspedic myotubes exhibited a 40 % reduction in the amount of maximal immobilization-resistant charge movement (Qmax, 7. 5 ± 0. 8 and 4. 5 ± 0. 4 nC/μF for normal and dyspedic myotubes, respectively) and an approximately fivefold reduction in the ratio of maximal <b>L-channel</b> conductance to charge movement (Gmax/Qmax). Thus, RyR 1 enhances both the expression level and Ca 2 + conducting {{activity of}} the skeletal <b>L-channel.</b> For both normal and dyspedic myotubes, the sum of two exponentials was required to fit L-current activation and resulted in extraction of the amplitudes (Afast and Aslow) and time constants (τslow and τfast) for each component of the macroscopic current. In spite of a > 10 -fold in difference current density, L-currents in normal and dyspedic myotubes exhibited similar relative contributions of fast and slow components (at + 40 mV; Afast/[Afast + Aslow] ∼ 0. 25). However, both τfast and τslow were significantly (P < 0. 02) faster for myotubes lacking the RyR 1 protein (τfast, 8. 5 ± 1. 2 and 4. 4 ± 0. 5 ms; τslow, 79. 5 ± 10. 5 and 34. 6 ± 3. 7 ms at + 40 mV for normal and dyspedic myotubes, respectively). In both normal and dyspedic myotubes, (−) Bay K 8644 (5 μM) caused a hyperpolarizing shift (∼ 10 mV) in the voltage dependence of channel activation and an 80 % increase in peak L-current. However, the increase in peak L-current correlated with moderate increases in both Aslow and Afast in normal myotubes, but a large increase in only Afast in dyspedic myotubes. Equimolar substitution of Ba 2 + for extracellular Ca 2 + increased both Afast and Aslow in normal myotubes. The identical substitution in dyspedic myotubes failed to significantly alter the magnitude of either Afast or Aslow. These results demonstrate that RyR 1 influences essential properties of skeletal L-channels (expression level, activation kinetics, modulation by dihydropyridine agonist, and divalent conductance) and supports the notion that RyR 1 acts as an important allosteric modulator of the skeletal <b>L-channel,</b> analogous to that of a Ca 2 + channel accessory subunit...|$|E

We found differential contributions of these pathways to GnRH-stimulated rat LH subunit transcription in pituitary gonadotropes and cell lines. Endogenous transcription of the �- and LH�-subunits in rat pituitary cells was stimulated by GnRH. Independent PKC activation by phorbol myristate acid stimulated only the �-subunit gene.

40|$|Lymphatic {{smooth muscle}} (LSM) {{contracts}} spontaneously, actively returning interstitial fluid through {{a network of}} lymphatic capillaries and collecting lymphatic vessels to the great veins. Dysfunctional lymphatic contractions can impair lymph transport in lymphatic-related diseases such as lymphedema. Understanding the pacemaking mechanism of LSM that underlies active lymph transport is essential for therapeutic targeting of lymphedema. Based on experiments using pharmacological inhibitors, current literature posits that T-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (T-channels) {{play a role in}} controlling the pacing of lymphatic contractions, i. e., the contraction frequency, while Ltype voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (L-channels) play a role in controlling the strength of lymphatic contractions, i. e., the contraction amplitude. However, non-specific effects of currently available T-channel inhibitors, especially on L-channels, can confound the understanding of T-channel role in lymphatic pacemaking. Therefore, using transgenic mouse models as an alternative approach to test the role of T-channels, I hypothesized that genetic deletion of T-type Ca 2 + channels would decrease the frequency of lymphatic contractions but not the amplitude. First, I tested for the presence of T-channels in lymphatic vessels from both rat and mouse, and then more specifically in isolated single mouse LSM cells; second, I tested the effects of commonly-used T-channel inhibitors on lymphatic pacemaking and/or contraction in both rat and mouse vessels; and finally, I investigated the effect of genetic deletion of specific T-channel isoforms in mice on lymphatic pacemaking and contraction strength. First, RT-PCR and immunostaining were performed on whole lymphatic vessels to test for the expression of T-channels at mRNA and protein levels. Rat mesenteric lymphatics, mouse popliteal lymphatic vessels (PLs) and mouse inguinal-axillary lymphatic vessels (IALs) showed the mRNA expression of Cav 3. 1 and 3. 2, two of the three isoforms of T-channels, along with Cav 1. 2, the isoform of the <b>L-channel</b> prevalent in cardiac muscle and blood vessels. Likewise, in LSM cells isolated from mouse PLs and IALs, RT-PCR revealed the expression of Cav 3. 1 and 3. 2. In mouse IALs, immunostaining consistently revealed the protein expression of T-channel isoforms Cav 3. 1 and 3. 2 along with <b>L-channel</b> isoform Cav 1. 2 colocalized with the smooth-muscle a-actin (i. e., in LSM cells). Moreover, patch-clamp recordings in single LSM cells isolated from rat mesenteric, mouse PLs and IALs showed functional evidence of current through voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels that was blocked by 1 µM nifedipine, an <b>L-channel</b> inhibitor, along with a persistent nifedipine-insensitive current that had fast kinetics and was blocked by 1 mM Ni 2 +, a frequently used T-channel inhibitor. Second, pharmacological inhibitors were tested on isolated, cannulated and pressurized ex vivo lymphatic vessels from rat and mouse. Consistent with the findings of Lee et al. (2014) on rat mesenteric lymphatics, mibefradil, another conventional T-channel inhibitor, inhibited the contraction frequency (IC 50 = 66 nM) at a lower dose than that required to inhibit contraction amplitude (IC 50 = 423 nM). However, in contrast to their findings, treatment of rat mesenteric lymphatics with Ni 2 + inhibited both amplitude and frequency at similar doses (IC 50 = 248 µM and 279 µM, respectively). In wild-type (WT) mouse IALs and PLs, increasing doses of Ni 2 + progressively reduced contraction amplitude (IC 50 = 66 µM and 110 µM, respectively), while leaving the frequency unchanged until the contractions were completely inhibited. In WT PLs, TTA-A 2, a more recently developed T-channel inhibitor, had only a modest effect on contraction amplitude (IC 50 = 1. 3 µM) without changing the contraction frequency. Similarly, treatment with nifedipine, a specific <b>L-channel</b> inhibitor, gradually attenuated contraction amplitude (IC 50 = 43. 3 nM), suggesting that the effect on amplitude of T-channel inhibitors Ni 2 + and TTA-A 2 could be due to off-target effects on L-channels. Having established that pharmacologic inhibition of T-channels in this context is unreliable, I turned to genetic methods allowing deletion of specific T and <b>L-channel</b> isoforms. Surprisingly, smooth muscle-specific deletion of Cav 1. 2 (L-channels) rendered PLs and IALs quiescent without spontaneous lymphatic contractions, suggesting their potential contribution to both lymphatic frequency and contraction strength; no residual contractions were mediated by T-channels. In Cav 3. 1 -null mice and Cav 3. 2 -null mice, IALs exhibited no significant differences in functional contractile parameters (including frequency and amplitude) compared to WT vessels over a wide range of pressures. Likewise, PLs from Cav 3. 1 -/- mice exhibited no significant defects in the contractile response to pressure, to the <b>L-channel</b> inhibitor nifedipine, or even to the endothelialdependent inhibitor acetylcholine. These findings conflict with the currently established view that T-channels regulate the frequency of lymphatic pacemaking and that L-channels contribute only to the contraction strength. In summary, I confirmed the functional expression of T-channels in both rat and mouse LSM, but selective genetic deletion of either Cav 3. 1 or Cav 3. 2 T-channel isoforms did not produce a measurable functional defect in lymphatic vessel pacemaking or contraction. My findings conflict with the current established view that T-channels control lymphatic pacemaking and L-channels determine lymphatic contraction strength; a definitive role for T-channels in LSM function remains unknown...|$|E
40|$|Ingestion {{of ethanol}} {{results in a}} {{decreased}} level of plasma vasopressin, {{which appears to be}} caused by inhibition of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release from the neurohypophysis. Activation of membrane voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels {{plays an important role in}} triggering this neurohormone release. In this article, single-channel recordings are used to demonstrate that ethanol, at concentrations constituting legal intoxication, inhibits dihydropyridine-sensitive 2 ̆ 2 L-type 2 ̆ 2 Ca 2 + channels in isolated nerve terminals of the rat neurohypophysis. Ethanol reduced the channel open probability in a concentration-dependent manner. To allow finer resolution of channel openings and to better characterize the mechanisms of ethanol action, Bay K 8644 was used to prolong the openings of L-type Ca 2 + channels. In the presence of this dihydropyridine (DHP), the reduction of the channel open probability by concentrations of ethanol of 25 mM or higher could be determined to be due primarily, although not completely, to a shortening of the open duration of this <b>L-channel.</b> Channel conductance was unaffected by ethanol, even at high concentrations. These results are consistent with previous macroscopic data indicating that calcium channels in these peptidergic terminals are targets for ethanol action, and indicate that ethanol acts directly on the gating characteristics of the L-type channel. Furthermore, examination of open and closed state transitions, as well as Hill plot analysis, suggests that ethanol 2 ̆ 7 s effects on gating are consistent with the interaction of a single drug molecule with a single target site, possibly the <b>L-channel</b> itself...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{evidence}} in microvascular disease suggests that T-type Ca⁺⁺ channel blockers (CCBs) have benefits over conventional L-type CCBs, however {{the basis for}} this remains largely unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine vascular reactivity utilising both pharmacological and molecular techniques. This thesis is composed of three sections including (A) an Introduction, (B) Functional Vascular Studies and (C) Molecular Vascular Studies. Section A summarised fundamental principles of the vasculature including an outline of the vascular system, vascular physiology, vascular cell biology, regulation of cytosolic Ca⁺⁺ and vascular pathophysiology. Section B utilised isolated vessels and wire myography to determine the effect of pre-treatment with L-type CCBs (verapamil and nifedipine) and combined L- and T-type CCBs (mibefradil and efonidipine) on endothelin- 1 (Et- 1) and K⁺-mediated contractile responses in large (rat aorta) and small (rat mesenteric and human subcutaneous) vessels. All four CCBs inhibited both Et- 1 and K⁺-mediated contractile responses to a similar extent in large rat vessels, however in rat microvessels the combined L- and T-channel blockers produced significantly greater inhibition of contraction than <b>L-channel</b> blockers alone. The significance of this differential T-channel effect in microvessels was further supported by: (1) demonstration of divergent CCB responses in human microvessels, (2) incremental inhibition of constrictor responses with a combined L- and T-CCB despite maximal <b>L-channel</b> blockade, (3) utilisation of structurally diverse CCBs with varied affinity for L- and T-channels, (6) use of pharmacodynamically and therapeutically appropriate CCB concentrations, (7) confirmation of contractile agonist independent responses, (8) consistent results even in the presence of an altered microvascular physiology in the form of chronic Et- 1 activation and (9) exclusion of an endothelium-dependent mechanism. Section C utilised the molecular techniques of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ratiometric western blotting to examine the distribution of the pore-forming subunits Caᵥ 1. 2, Caᵥ 3. 1 and 3. 2 in both large (rat aorta) and small (rat mesenteric) vessels. The PCR data was equivocal with no difference noted in the distribution of the L- and T-channels between large and small vessels. In contrast to this, quantitative western blot analysis revealed that while there is a similar distribution of the three subunits in the large vessel, there is a significantly increased expression of both T-channel pore-forming subunits in microvessels (Caᵥ 3. 1 : 112 ± 38 %*, Caᵥ 3. 2 : 168 ± 48 %* relative to <b>L-channel</b> expression, *p< 0. 05).

NMDA blockers prevent LTP with burst stimulation, but some NMDA-independent LTP remains with HFS.

40|$|The alpha 1 -subunits of the {{skeletal}} and cardiac L-type calcium channels (L-channels) contain nearly identical pore regions (P-regions) {{in each of}} the four internal homology repeats. In spite of this high conservation of the P-regions, native skeletal L-channels exhibit a unitary conductance that is only about half that of native cardiac L-channels. To identify structural determinants of this difference in <b>L-channel</b> conductance, we have characterized unitary activity in cell-attached patches of dysgenic myotubes expressing skeletal, cardiac, and chimeric <b>L-channel</b> alpha 1 -subunits. Our results demonstrate that the S 5 -S 6 linker of repeat I (IS 5 -IS 6 linker) is a critical determinant of the difference in skeletal and cardiac unitary conductance. The unitary conductances attributable to the wild-type skeletal (CAC 6; approximately 14 pS) and cardiac (CARD 1; approximately 25 pS) alpha 1 -subunits expressed in dysgenic myotubes are identical to those observed in native tissues. Chimeric alpha 1 -subunits containing skeletal sequence for the first internal repeat and all of the putative intracellular loops (SkC 15), the IS 5 -IS 6 linker and the intracellular loops (SkC 51), or only the IS 5 -IS 6 linker (SkC 49) each exhibit a low, skeletal-like unitary conductance (< or = 17 pS). Constructs in which the IS 5 -IS 6 linker is of cardiac origin (CARD 1 and CSk 9) display cardiac-like conductance (approximately 25 pS). Unitary conductance and the rate of channel activation are apparently independent processes, since both SkC 51 and SkC 49 exhibit low, skeletal-like conductance and rapid, cardiac-like rates of ensemble activation. These results demonstrate that the IS 5 -IS 6 linker strongly influences the single channel conductance of L-channels in a manner that is independent from the rate of channel activation...|$|E

The error due to the approximation is very small for small λ/M and large M, where M is the bit size of the packet and λ is {{the rate of the}} packet-arrival process. The technique is verified using M = 64. Results obtained by the ballot technique are very close to the simulation results for low arrival rates and less accurate for higher arrival rates.

The oversampling process creates L redundant representations of the source, while the delta-sigma quantization with feedback-loop enables trading-off side distortion (receiving one description) for central distortion (receiving all the descriptions). We prove that the proposed scheme is asymptotically optimal (at large lattice quantizer dimension and high noise shaping filter order) at any resolution for a Gaussian source and MSE fidelity criterion.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{regulates the}} release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla but the {{molecular}} targets of its action are not yet well identified. Here we show that the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 200 μM) causes a marked depression of the single CaV 1 <b>L-channel</b> activity in cell-attached patches of bovine chromaffin cells. SNP action was complete within 3 - 5 min of cell superfusion. In multichannel patches the open probability (NPo) decreased by ∼ 60 % between 0 and + 20 mV. Averaged currents {{over a number of}} traces were proportionally reduced and showed no drastic changes to their time course. In single-channel patches the open probability (Po) at + 10 mV decreased by the same amount as that of multichannel patches (∼ 61 %). Such a reduction was mainly associated with an increased probability of null sweeps and a prolongation of mean shut times, while first latency, mean open time and single-channel conductance were not significantly affected. Addition of the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO or cell treatment with the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ prevented the SNP-induced inhibition. 8 -Bromo-cyclicGMP (8 -Br-cGMP; 400 μM) mimicked the action of the NO donor and the protein kinase G blocker KT- 5823 prevented this effect. The depressive action of SNP was preserved after blocking the cAMP-dependent up-regulatory pathway with the protein kinase A inhibitor H 89. Similarly, the inhibitory action of 8 -Br-cGMP proceeded regardless of the elevation of cAMP levels, suggesting that cGMP/PKG and cAMP/PKA act independently on <b>L-channel</b> gating. The inhibitory action of 8 -Br-cGMP was also independent of the G protein-induced inhibition of L-channels mediated by purinergic and opiodergic autoreceptors. Since Ca 2 + channels contribute critically to both the local production of NO and catecholamine release, the NO/PKG-mediated inhibition of neuroendocrine L-channels described here may represent an important autocrine signalling mechanism for controlling the rate of neurotransmitter release from adrenal glands...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{prolonged}} conditioning depolarizations on the activation kinetics of skeletal L-type calcium currents (L-currents) were characterized in mouse myotubes using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The sum of two exponentials {{was required to}} adequately fit L-current activation and enabled determination of both the amplitudes (Afast and Aslow) and time constants (τfast and τslow) of each component comprising the macroscopic current. Prepulses sufficient to activate (200 ms) or inactivate (10 s) L-channels did not alter τfast, τslow, or the fractional contribution of either the fast (Afast/(Afast + Aslow)) or slow (Aslow/(Afast + Aslow)) amplitudes of subsequently activated L-currents. Prolonged depolarizations (60 s to + 40 mV) resulted in the conversion of skeletal L-current to a fast gating mode following brief repriming intervals (3 - 10 s at - 80 mV). Longer repriming intervals (30 - 60 s at - 80 mV) restored L-channels to a predominantly slow gating mode. Accelerated L-currents originated from L-type calcium channels since they were completely blocked by a dihydropyridine antagonist (3 μM nifedipine) and exhibited a voltage dependence of activation similar to that observed {{in the absence of}} conditioning prepulses. The degree of L-current acceleration produced following prolonged depolarization was voltage dependent. For test potentials between + 10 and + 50 mV, the fractional contribution of Afast to the total current decreased exponentially with the test voltage (e-fold ∼ 38 mV). Thus, L-current acceleration was most significant at more negative test potentials (e. g. + 10 mV). Prolonged depolarization also accelerated L-currents recorded from myotubes derived from RyR 1 -knockout (dyspedic) mice. These results indicate that <b>L-channel</b> acceleration occurs {{even in the absence of}} RyR 1, and is therefore likely to represent an intrinsic property of skeletal L-channels. The results describe a novel experimental protocol used to demonstrate that slowly activating mammalian skeletal muscle L-channels are capable of undergoing rapid, voltage-dependent transitions during channel activation. The transitions underlying rapid <b>L-channel</b> activation may reflect rapid transitions of the voltage sensor used to trigger the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during excitation-contraction coupling...|$|E

Treatment of GH 3 pituitary cells for 30 min with 5 nM TG, 500 nM tBHQ or 50 nM CPA completely eliminated the TRH-induced spike in intracellular free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i). Higher concentrations of TG and tBHQ, but not CPA, {{were also found}} to inhibit strongly the activity of L-type calcium channels, {{as measured by the}} increase in [Ca 2 +]i or 45 Ca 2 + influx stimulated by depolarization. TG and tBHQ blocked high-K(+) -stimulated 45 Ca 2 + uptake, with IC 50 values of 10 and 1 microM respectively. Maximal inhibition of <b>L-channel</b> activity was achieved 15 - 30 min after drug addition. Inhibition by tBHQ was reversible, whereas inhibition by TG was not. TG and CPA did not affect spontaneous [Ca 2 +]i oscillations when tested at concentrations adequate to deplete the IP 3 -sensitive Ca 2 + pool. However, 20 microM TG and 10 microM tBHQ blocked [Ca 2 +]i oscillations completely. The effect of drugs on calcium currents was measured directly by using the patch-clamp technique. When added to the external bath, 10 microM CPA caused a sustained increase in the calcium-channel current amplitude over 8 min, 10 microM tBHQ caused a progressive inhibition, and 10 microM TG caused an enhancement followed by a sustained block of the calcium current over 8 min. In summary, CPA depletes IP 3 -sensitive Ca 2 + stores and does not inhibit voltage-operated calcium channels. At sufficiently low concentrations, TG depletes IP 3 -sensitive stores without inhibiting <b>L-channel</b> activity, but, for tBHQ, inhibition of calcium channels occurs at concentrations close to those needed to block agonist mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 +...|$|E
