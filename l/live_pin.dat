5000|$|... "Schuko" [...] is a {{registered}} trademark referring {{to a system of}} AC power plugs and sockets that is defined as [...] "CEE 7/3" [...] (sockets) and [...] "CEE 7/4" [...] (plugs). A Schuko plug features two round pins of 4.8 mm diameter (19 mm long, centers 19 mm apart) for the line and neutral contacts, plus two flat contact areas on the top and bottom side of the plug for protective earth (ground). The socket (which is often, in error, also referred to as CEE 7/4) has a predominantly circular recess which is 17.5 mm deep with two symmetrical round apertures and two earthing clips {{on the sides of the}} socket positioned to ensure that the earth is always engaged before <b>live</b> <b>pin</b> contact is made.

Schuko plugs are considered a very safe design when used with Schuko sockets, but they can also mate with other sockets to give an unsafe result.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} wood value-added processes currently under development is spalting, where pigment is added to wood via fungal colonization. Previous studies have shown laboratory level spalting to be achievable and highly predictable. However, large-scale spalting for potential commercial applications introduces a substantial number of additional variables which impact the spalting process. To test the potential of commercial-scale spalting, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Populus tremuloides logs were inoculated with multiple known spalting fungi utilizing both liquid spray cultures and <b>live</b> dowel <b>pin</b> cultures. Many of the fungi that successfully produce spalting in small, sterile cultures also produced significant amounts in large logs, with many spalting patterns identical to those found in small-scale testing. Pairings of Trametes versicolor/Scytalidium cuboideum and Xylaria polymorpha/Xylaria polymorpha (different isolates) produced significant amounts of zone lines. In addition, the method of inoculation impacted the amount of spalting: more zone lines were produced when fungi were introduced via plugs, while more stain was produced when liquid cultures were sprayed onto the logs. These results indicate that many of the standard spalting fungi are suitable for large-scale applications; however, the inoculation method appears to be a vital component for successful spalting under a restricted time schedule.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel empirical strategy to measure credit shocks. Theoretically, {{we show that}} credit shocks reduce the value of long term investments relative to short term ones. Under the (conservative) assumption that demand shocks affect short and long run investments similarly, credit shocks can be measured within firms by the shift in the investment vector away from long run investments and towards short term ones. This within-firm strategy {{makes it possible to}} use firm-times-year fixed effects to capture unobserved between firm heterogeneity as well as idiosyncratic demand shocks. We implement this strategy using a rich panel data set of Spanish manufacturing firms before and after the credit crisis in 2008. This allows us to quantify the effect of the credit crunch: our theory suggests that credit constraints are equivalent to an additional tax rate of around 11 % on the longest <b>lived</b> capital. To <b>pin</b> down credit constraints as the cause for this investment pattern we use two triple differences strategies where we show (i) that only Spanish owned firms became credit constrained during the financial crisis, and that the drop in long term investments after the crisis is indeed driven by credit constrained Spanish firms; and that (ii) the impact on long term investment is mostly noticeable in firms that started the crisis with more mature debt to roll over...|$|R
60|$|THE changes {{wrought by}} death are in {{themselves}} so sharp and final, and so terrible and melancholy in their consequences, {{that the thing}} stands alone in man's experience, and has no parallel upon earth. It outdoes all other accidents {{because it is the}} last of them. Sometimes it leaps suddenly upon its victims, like a Thug; sometimes it lays a regular siege and creeps upon their citadel during a score of years. And when the business is done, there is sore havoc made in other people's <b>lives,</b> and a <b>pin</b> knocked out by which many subsidiary friendships hung together. There are empty chairs, solitary walks, and single beds at night. Again, in taking away our friends, death does not take them away utterly, but leaves behind a mocking, tragical, and soon intolerable residue, which must be hurriedly concealed. Hence a whole chapter of sights and customs striking to the mind, from the pyramids of Egypt to the gibbets and dule trees of mediaeval Europe. The poorest persons have a bit of pageant going towards the tomb; memorial stones are set up over the least memorable; and, in order to preserve some show of respect for what remains of our old loves and friendships, we must accompany it with much grimly ludicrous ceremonial, and the hired undertaker parades before the door. All this, and much more of the same sort, accompanied by the eloquence of poets, has gone a great way to put humanity in error; nay, in many philosophies the error has been embodied and laid down with every circumstance of logic; although in real life the bustle and swiftness, in leaving people little time to think, have not left them time enough to go dangerously wrong in practice.|$|R
