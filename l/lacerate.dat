25|$|Before being depowered, the Blob's mutant {{physiology}} granted him {{a number}} of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin proved {{to be difficult to}} penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even Wolverine's claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can <b>lacerate</b> his flesh. For instance, the Blob once sat on the X-Man, but jumped off in pain when Wolverine extended his sheathed claws into the Blob's rear. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both Black Raazer and the Arabian Knight were able to harm him.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSES: To {{assess the}} tensile {{strength}} of the modified 4 -strand cruciate technique for obliquely <b>lacerated</b> tendons, and to compare the findings with the strength of transversely <b>lacerated</b> tendons repaired at various grasping depths. METHODS: 60 porcine front foot tendons were evenly divided into 4 groups. In groups 1 to 3, tendons were transversely <b>lacerated</b> and repaired with grasping points at both ends away from the laceration by 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm respectively. In group 4, tendons were obliquely <b>lacerated</b> and repaired with a grasping point 5 mm away from the laceration on one end and 15 mm on the other. All tendons were repaired with a modified 4 -strand core suture and continuous epitendinous suture, and then tested to failure in a tensile machine. RESULTS: The tensile strength in group 1 was significantly lower than that in the other 3 groups (p< 0. 005). The tensile strength in group 4 was {{not significantly different from}} groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: The tensile strength of modified 4 -strand cruciate repair configuration is not weakened in obliquely <b>lacerated</b> tendons; the grasping point {{at one end of the}} tendon being 15 mm away from laceration provides sufficient strength to compensate for the relatively weak 5 -mm end. So long as one grasping point is away from the laceration site by 10 mm, the ultimate tensile {{strength of the}} transversely <b>lacerated</b> tendons appears acceptable. The modified 4 -strand cruciate repair is safe to use for repairing obliquely <b>lacerated</b> tendons. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
500|$|Although A.hygrometricus bears a {{superficial}} resemblance to {{member of the}} [...] "true earthstars" [...] Geastrum, it may be readily differentiated from most by the hygroscopic nature of its rays. Hygroscopic earthstars include G.arenarium, G.corollinum, G.floriforme, G.recolligens, and G.kotlabae. Unlike Geastrum, the young fruit bodies of A.hygrometricus {{do not have a}} columella (sterile tissue in the gleba, {{at the base of the}} spore sac). Geastrum tends to have its spore sac opening surrounded by a peristome or a disc, in contrast with the single <b>lacerate</b> slit of A.hygrometricus. There are also several microscopic differences: in A.hygrometricus, the basidia are not arranged in parallel columns, the spores are larger, and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the hyphae of the peridium. Despite these differences, older specimens can be difficult to distinguish from Geastrum in the field. One species of Geastrum, G.mammosum, does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic, and could be confused with A.hygrometricus; however, its spores are smaller than A.hygrometricus, typically about 4µm in diameter.|$|E
500|$|Navigating the cellar, Jordan hides from an {{emerging}} Michael. The cellar itself pieces together Michael's backstory. Michael had incestuous feelings towards {{his sister and}} was distraught when she fell ill, lost all of her hair and died of leukemia. Foster has a prop head that he keeps in the cellar that he treats like his sister. He has also been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair, trying to find scalps that match his sister's hair. Jordan soon finds Casey strapped down to a dentist chair and attacks Michael, as he begins to <b>lacerate</b> Casey's scalp. She frees Casey and both manage to gradually escape the cellar, and Casey stabs Michael {{in the back with}} a pair of scissors. Michael pursues them and they are able to injure and kick him back down into the cellar, rendering him unconscious. While he is knocked out, they tie him to a chair. When he regains consciousness, they inform him that they plan to leave him to die and claim that Casey had escaped, was found by Jordan in the woods, and that Michael disappeared. Pleading with them that they cannot just leave him there, Jordan replies to Foster using his own words, [...] "It's already done," [...] and as Michael shouts insults at them, Jordan locks the door and leaves, avenging Leah's death.|$|E

2500|$|Spleen is {{the most}} common cause of massive {{bleeding}} in blunt abdominal trauma to a solid organ. The liver, conversely, {{is the most}} commonly injured organ. The spleen is the second most commonly injured intra-abdominal organ in children. [...] A laceration of the spleen may be associated with hematoma. [...] Because of the spleen's ability to bleed profusely, a ruptured spleen can be life-threatening, resulting in shock. [...] However, unlike the liver, penetrating trauma to the spleen, pancreas and kidneys do not present as much of an immediate threat of shock unless they <b>lacerate</b> a major blood vessel supplying the organs, such as the renal artery. [...] Fractures of the left lower ribs are associated with spleen lacerations in 20 percent of cases.|$|E

Dentists collaborating in the perioperative management center took dental impressions, {{with the support of}} anesthesiologists who opened the patientʼs jaw under propofol sedation, to produce a mouth protector. By raising the patientʼs bite, the completed mouth protector prevented the isolated tooth from contacting the tongue and protected the <b>lacerated</b> wound. Use of the mouth protector prevented the <b>lacerated</b> tongue from coming into contact with the pointed tooth, and the tongue healed gradually. These findings underscore that interprofessional collaboration including dentists can improve the quality of medical care...|$|R
