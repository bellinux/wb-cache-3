500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E
