40|$|Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is an {{emerging}} technology {{that can be}} applied to safety, transport efficiency, or infotainment applications for roads and highways. However, due to its unique features, such as dynamic mobility patterns and uneven distributions of vehicles, VANET faces many challenging research issues for robust data dissemination in the network. Many routing protocols have been proposed for VANET in the past few years, and the idea of utilizing a navigation system to assist the routing protocol for selecting the next best forwarder has become increasingly popular. However, it might not be realistic to assume that every vehicle is equipped with a navigation system. In addition, due to privacy concerns, drivers might not want to reveal their planned routes to other cars. In this work, we propose a new routing protocol, called LOTIR (<b>LOcal</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Information</b> Routing), that relies on only <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and does not require the assistance of a navigation system. LOTIR is a DTN-based routing protocol that utilizes the car-following theory and traffic light information to decide the next carrier to forward the data to. We implement LOTIR in NS- 2, and our results show that it can achieve similar performance as prior work which depends on the availability of global network topology information...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{vehicular}} ad-hoc networks (VANETs) {{have received}} increasing interests {{because of their}} promising solutions in many urban applications. VANETs are distinguished from other kinds of ad-hoc networks, such as Mo-bile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), by high mobility and reduced communications. The topology of the network is highly time-varying due to high mobility of wireless nodes, and also joining and leaving nodes. This makes it challenging to find and maintain efficient and reliable data forwarding routes between different nodes in the network. On the other hand, equipment such as positioning systems usually exist in current vehicles {{which can be used}} to improve the efficiency of packet dissemination. This paper proposes TIGeR, a new Traffic-aware Intersection-based Geographical Routing protocol. Nodes that are at intersections make routing decision to forward packets based on both the <b>local</b> vehicular <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> of different roads and the road’s angle with respect to the direct vector toward the destination. <b>Local</b> vehicular <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> is considered as a sign of network connectivity in a road.

40|$|Abstract — Admission {{control is}} a crucial network element for {{providing}} quality of service (QoS) guarantees in the Internet. In this paper, we propose a novel framework approach, called implicit admission control (iAC), for admission control in a differentiated services (DiffServ) network. In the iAC approach, admission control is performed distributedly at routers. No signaling is needed for exchanging service and <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> between flows and routers. The service requirement and some coarse <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> of a flow are carried by packets of the flow. Specifically, the DiffServ field is utilized for this purpose. At each router, admission control for the flow is performed when its first packet is detected. The admission test {{is based on the}} service requirement and <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> carried by the DiffServ field of the packet, as well as the <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> and resource <b>information.</b> In addition, to simplify admission control, two flow aggregation methods are adopted at each router. One is linkbased fair aggregation (LBFA) for the deterministic expedited forwarding (EF) service. The other is dynamic priority based flow aggregation (DPFA) for the statistical assured forwarding (AF) service. Analytical results show that with these flow aggregation approaches, a newly admitted flow does not adversely affect QoS guarantees of existing flows. Consequently, admission test is needed only for the new flow. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Even though {{multiple}} non-overlapped channels {{exist in}} the 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum, most IEEE 802. 11 -based multi-hop ad hoc networks today use only a single channel. As a result, these networks rarely can fully exploit the aggregate bandwidth available in the radio spectrum provisioned by the standards. This prevents them from being used as an ISP’s wireless last-mile access network or as a wireless enterprise backbone network. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel wireless mesh network (WMN) architecture (called Hyacinth) that equips each mesh network node with multiple 802. 11 network interface cards (NICs). The central design issues of this multi-channel WMN architecture are channel assignment and routing. We show that intelligent channel assignment is critical to Hyacinth’s performance, present distributed algorithms that utilize only <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> load <b>information</b> to dynamically assign channels and to route packets, and compare their performance against a centralized algorithm that performs the same functions. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that even with just 2 NICs on each node, {{it is possible to}} improve the network throughput by a factor of 6 to 7 when compared with the conventional single-channel ad hoc network architecture. We also describe and evaluate a 9 -node Hyacinth prototype that is built using commodity PCs each equipped with tw...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — It is {{very hard}} to design a network with {{performance}} guarantees, partly because it is hard to estimate the future traffic matrix. With no knowledge of the traffic matrix, one can use the Valiant Load-balancing (VLB) architecture which can support any traffic satisfying the node capacity constraints. To interconnect N nodes of capacity r, the VLB architecture requires a logical full mesh of link capacity c = 2 r N. Uniform load-balancing can guarantee throughput, but is not necessary if the traffic matrix is known, in which case the amount of load-balancing can be reduced. In this paper we study adaptive load-balancing in two cases: when only <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> is known to a node, and when the network traffic matrix is known. We give linear programming formulations to maximize directly routed traffic in both cases, so as to reduce the average hop count of packets.

40|$|Transmission {{power control}} (TPC) {{has a great}} {{potential}} to increase the throughput of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Existing TPC schemes achieve this goal by using additional hardware (e. g., multiple transceivers), by compromising the collision avoidance property of the channel access scheme, or by imposing impractical requirements on {{the operation of the}} MAC protocol. In this paper, we present a novel power control MAC protocol, known as POWMAC, for MANETs that enjoys the same simple single-channel, single-transceiver design of the IEEE 802. 11 ad hoc MAC protocol, but that achieves a significant throughput improvement over the 802. 11 scheme. Collision avoidance is integrated into the design of POWMAC. Instead of alternating between the transmission of control (RTS/CTS) and data packets, as done in the 802. 11 scheme, POWMAC uses an access window (AW) to allow for a series of RTS/CTS exchanges to take place before multiple, concurrent data packet transmissions can commence. The length of the AW is dynamically adjusted (based on <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> load <b>information)</b> to allow for concurrent interference-limited transmissions to take place in the same vicinity of a receiving node. Collision avoidance information is inserted into the CTS packet and is used to bound the transmission powers of potential interferers, rather than to silence such nodes. Simulation results for “random-grid” and “clustered ” topologies are used to demonstrate the significant throughput and energy gains that can be obtained under the POWMAC protocol...|$|R

Second, it requires frequent information exchange with the outer environment; for instance, it may need <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and other local services. The complex vehicle space needs a software infrastructure of high adaptation to meet the complex and easy variational situations. This paper proposes a semantic and adaptive middleware platform, i. e., ScudWare, for smart vehicle space. In ScudWare, techniques of multiagent, context-aware, and adaptive component management are smoothly synthesized. It consists of three key components, namely 1) semantic virtual agents; 2) a semantic context management service; and 3) an adaptive component management service. This enables entities in smart vehicle space to interact autonomously, provides semantic-integration context awareness, and supports componentbased adaptability and scalability.

30|$|Forging social {{connections}} with others {{is the core}} of what makes us human. However, people co-present in the same places often miss opportunities to leverage social affinities for instant interaction or friendship {{due to the lack of}} awareness. The social affinities can have different forms, such as shared interests/goals, with mutual friends, having similar backgrounds, and so on. For example, Bob and Alice meet in chance in a coffee shop. Alice is a close-friend of Bob’s sister, and they have the same interest on painting. Though sharing some commons, the two people are not aware of this, and may miss the opportunity for face-to-face conversation and friend making. The friendship network in existing MSNs is formed by user specification in online environments. Spontaneous prediction of potential “friends” co-present in offline/physical environments, however, is not incorporated in existing MSN services. Another motivation for opportunistic MSN is local information sharing, people often want to be aware of nearby events (e.g., sale in a nearby shop, <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information)</b> or need to distribute location-dependent, spontaneously-triggered information to others in the proximity (e.g., selling an unused ticket near the train station due to an unplanned schedule change).

40|$|With the {{penetration}} of broadband Internet and Wi-Fi-capable electronic products to homes, {{there has been}} a growing popularity to set up WLAN in homes, the so-called home WLAN. As opposed to traditional WLAN networks (such as a campus or company), these home WLANs are usually set up by network non-specialists, uncoordinated, and of unplanned topology. Therefore, the access points (APs) from different homes may interfere with each other, leading to unsatisfactory throughput performance. We study in this paper distributed channel assignment in an uncoordinated home network, so that APs can self-configure its operating channel to minimize interference with each other. We first discuss the weaknesses of a traditional channel assignment scheme, Least Congested Channel Search (LCCS), and formulate an assignment problem to overcome them. The problem is NP-hard, and hence we propose a scalable algorithm termed Client-Assisted Channel Assignment Optimization (CACAO) for home WLAN. In CACAO, an AP makes use of the feedback of the client’s <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> to make channel assignment decision. This leads to a better knowledge on the network condition, and a channel with the least interference. In CACAO, an AP continuously improves its channel selection until some optimum is achieved. CACAO is efficient, fully distributed, and simple to implement. Besides simulation, we have also prototyped CACAO and conducted proof-of-concept experiments. Both simulations and experimental measurements confirm that CACAO effectively reduces interference among different home WLANs, achieves fast convergence time, and substantially improves user throughput (doubly the throughput in some cases) ...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedBackground: Studies {{have shown}} that {{decreased}} lung function is predictive of various health outcomes including asthma, heart disease, and death. Although there are some inconsistencies in the literature, many studies {{have shown that}} exposure to various types of air pollutants negatively impact lung growth in children and adults. Furthermore, {{there is some evidence that}} social stress may also be of importance in the understanding of respiratory health; however, no studies have explored the joint relationship between lung function, air pollution, and stress. The aims of this study are to further explore the relationship between childhood lung function and air pollution, specifically traffic-related pollutants (TRPs), and to assess the potential modifying effects of parental stress.; Methods: A total of 1, 811 children from a new southern Californian Children’s Health Study cohort participated in lung function testing during the sixth year of the study. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV 1), maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) and peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) were measured at each of the 44 participating schools. Various metrics of TRP were used including distance to road and two different types of model-based estimates of pollutant concentration. The first set of modeled TRP estimates were based on the CALINE 4 line-source air-quality dispersion model, which took into account <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and meteorological conditions. The other set of TRP are predicted residential exposures of NO 2, NO, and NOx that incorporated population demographics and topography in addition to <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> Parental perceived stress and other covariates were collected through questionnaire.; Results: Close proximity to a major road was found to be negatively associated with both FEV 1 and FVC, while close proximity to a freeway was negatively associated with only FVC. Among all children, no observed associations were found with CALINE 4 predicted exposures. However with respect to the 10 th- 90 th percent distribution, predicted residential NO was associated with a 1. 4 % deficit in FEV 1 and a 2 % deficit in FVC (per 7. 6 ppb). Similarly, predicted residential NOx was associated with a 1. 3 % deficit in FEV 1 and a 1. 9 % deficit in FVC (per 21. 9 ppb), while residential NO 2 was associated with a 1. 7 % deficit in FVC (per 14. 5 ppb). The impact of various TRPs was more pronounced among children whose parents were classified as being highly stressed. Over the same distribution of predicted residential exposures to NO, NOx, and NO 2, these children experienced a 3. 3 %, 3. 6 %, and 3. 6 % deficit in FEV 1, respectively, while for children in lower stress homes, these pollutants had little impact. Similar findings were also observed with respect to the non-freeway component of CALINE 4 -modeled TRP and distance to a major road as well as when FVC was chosen as the outcome. Effect modification by parental stress was statistically significant in all of these examples. No statistically significant associations of TRP were found with MMEF and PEFR.; Discussion: These findings suggest that exposure to traffic-related pollutants negatively impacts the development of children’s lungs. Furthermore, living in a high stress household potentiates the adverse effects of these residential traffic-related pollutants...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{researchers}} have proposed many vehicular networks in which cars or buses {{act as a}} mechanical backhaul for transporting data. For example, a bus can be retrofitted with a computer and wireless card to automatically ferry data to/from rural villages without Internet connectivity. Alternatively, a person carrying a portable storage device {{can be used to}} link geographically disparate networks. These examples of challenged networks are characterized by frequent disruptions, long delays, and/or intermittent connectivity. This thesis proposes TrainNet, a vehicular network that uses trains to transport latency insensitive data. TrainNet augments a railway network by equipping stations and trains with mass storage devices; e. g., a rack of portable hard disks. TrainNet has two applications. First, it provides a low cost, very high bandwidth link {{that can be used to}} deliver non real-time data. In particular, cable TV operators can use TrainNet to meet the high bandwidth requirement associated with Video on Demand (VoD) services. Moreover, TrainNet is able to meet this requirement easily because its links are scalable, meaning their capacity can be increased inexpensively due to the continual fall of hard disk price. Secondly, TrainNet provides an alternative, economically viable, broadband solution to rural regions that are reachable via a railway network. Therefore, using TrainNet, rural communities will be able to gain access to bandwidth intensive digital contents such as music, video, television programs, and movies cheaply. A key problem in TrainNet is resource scheduling. This problem arises because stations compete for the fixed storage capacity on each train. To this end, this thesis is the first to propose three max-min scheduling algorithms, namely LMMF, WGMMF and GMMF, for use in challenged networks. These algorithms arbitrate the hard disk space among competing stations using <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> at each station, or those from other stations. To study these algorithms, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is first used to construct a model of TrainNet, before a simulator is constructed using the DESMO-J framework. The resulting TrainNet simulator is then used to investigate the behavior of said max-min algorithms in scenarios with realistic traffic patterns. Results show that while LMMF is the fairest algorithm, it results in data loss and has the longest mean delay, the lowest average throughput, and the lowest hard disk utilization. Furthermore, Jain’s fairness index shows WGMMF to be the least fair algorithm. However, it avoids data loss as is the case with GMMF, and achieves the best performance in terms of mean delay, averaged throughput, and hard disk utilization...|$|E
