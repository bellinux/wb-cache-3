5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment <b>laetrile</b> was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I, although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laetrile</b> {{advocates in}} the United States include Dean Burk, {{a former chief}} chemist of the National Cancer Institute cytochemistry laboratory, and {{national}} arm wrestling champion Jason Vale, who claimed that his kidney and pancreatic cancers were cured by eating apricot seeds. Vale was convicted in 2004 for, among other things, fraudulently marketing <b>laetrile</b> as a cancer cure. The court also found that Vale had made at least $500,000 from his fraudulent sales of <b>laetrile.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a 1977 controlled, blinded trial, <b>laetrile</b> {{showed no}} more {{activity}} than placebo.|$|E
25|$|A 500mg <b>laetrile</b> tablet {{may contain}} between 5â€“51mg of {{hydrogen}} cyanide per gram.|$|E
25|$|Like amygdalin, <b>laetrile</b> is hydrolyzed in the {{duodenum}} (alkaline) {{and in the}} intestine (enzymatically) to D-glucuronic {{acid and}} L-mandelonitrile; the latter hydrolyzes to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, that in sufficient quantities causes cyanide poisoning. Intravenous <b>laetrile</b> does not result in cyanide exposure. This {{is due to the}} fact that the necessary enzymes are released either upon chewing the plant material or are provided by bacteria residing in the human gastrointestinal system.|$|E
25|$|Seeds are {{the source}} of some {{medicines}} including castor oil, tea tree oil and the cancer drug, <b>Laetrile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{authors also}} recommended, on ethical and {{scientific}} grounds, that no further clinical research into <b>laetrile</b> or amygdalin be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the lack}} of evidence, <b>laetrile</b> has not been {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Commission.|$|E
25|$|Ernst T. Krebs branded <b>laetrile</b> as a vitamin {{in order}} to have it {{classified}} as a nutritional supplement rather than as a pharmaceutical.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{prohibited}} the interstate shipment of amygdalin and <b>laetrile</b> in 1977. Thereafter, 27 U.S. states legalized {{the use of}} amygdalin within those states.|$|E
25|$|Advocates for <b>laetrile</b> {{assert that}} there is a {{conspiracy}} between the US Food and Drug Administration, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical community, including the American Medical Association and the American Cancer Society, to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>laetrile</b> {{treatment}} are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, cherry red skin color, liver damage, abnormally low blood pressure, droopy upper eyelid, trouble walking due to damaged nerves, fever, mental confusion, coma, and death.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{classified}} as a cyanogenic glycoside because each amygdalin molecule includes a nitrile group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion {{by the action of}} a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them. Neither amygdalin nor <b>laetrile</b> is a vitamin.|$|E
25|$|In 1845 {{amygdalin}} {{was used}} as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous. In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative, and later marketed as <b>laetrile</b> for cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|Hypothesis (1) {{proposed}} that cancerous cells contained copious beta-glucosidases, which release HCN from <b>laetrile</b> via hydrolysis. Normal cells were reportedly unaffected, because they contained low concentrations of beta-glucosidases and {{high concentrations of}} rhodanese, which converts HCN to the less toxic thiocyanate. Later, however, it was shown that both cancerous and normal cells contain only trace amounts of beta-glucosidases and similar amounts of rhodanese.|$|E
25|$|Some North American cancer {{patients}} have traveled to Mexico for treatment with the substance, for example at the Oasis of Hope Hospital in Tijuana. The actor Steve McQueen died in Mexico following {{surgery to remove}} a stomach tumor having previously undergone extended treatment for pleural mesothelioma (a cancer associated with asbestos exposure) {{under the care of}} William D. Kelley, a de-licensed dentist and orthodontist who claimed to have devised a cancer treatment involving pancreatic enzymes, 50 daily vitamins and minerals, frequent body shampoos, enemas, and a specific diet as well as <b>laetrile.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{evidence}} for its use, <b>laetrile</b> developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a [...] "pain-free" [...] treatment of cancer {{as an alternative to}} surgery and chemotherapy that have significant side effects. The use of <b>laetrile</b> led to a number of deaths.|$|E
2500|$|Claims for <b>laetrile</b> {{were based}} on three {{different}} hypotheses: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Laetrile</b> (patented 1961) is {{a simpler}} semisynthetic version of amygdalin. <b>Laetrile</b> is {{synthesized}} from amygdalin by hydrolysis. The usual preferred commercial source is from apricot kernels (Prunus armeniaca). The name {{is derived from}} the separate words [...] "laevarotatory" [...] and [...] "mandelonitrile". Laevarotatory describes the stereochemistry of the molecule, while mandelonitrile refers to its chemical identity ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, <b>laetrile</b> {{was tested}} on 14 tumor systems without {{evidence}} of effectiveness. The Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) concluded that [...] "laetrile showed no beneficial effects." [...] Mistakes {{in an earlier}} MSKCC press release were highlighted {{by a group of}} <b>laetrile</b> proponents led by Ralph Moss, former public affairs official of MSKCC who had been fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of <b>laetrile.</b> These mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in Science stated that [...] "even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate." [...] The results from these studies were published all together.|$|E
2500|$|Hypothesis (3) {{asserted}} that <b>laetrile</b> is the discovered vitamin B-17, and further suggests that {{cancer is a}} result of [...] "B-17 deficiency". It postulated that regular dietary administration of this form of <b>laetrile</b> would, therefore, actually prevent all incidence of cancer. The term [...] "vitamin B-17" [...] is not recognized by Committee on Nomenclature of the American Institute of Nutrition Vitamins. There is no credible evidence supporting this conjecture.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, [...] "No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} (trials that compare groups {{of patients who}} receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of <b>laetrile</b> have been reported." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s, both {{amygdalin}} and a modified form named <b>laetrile</b> have been promoted as alternative cancer treatments, often using the misnomer vitamin B17. But {{studies have found}} them to be clinically ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth, due to cyanide poisoning. The promotion of <b>laetrile</b> to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of quackery, and as [...] "the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history".|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] 1970s, {{court cases}} {{in several states}} {{challenged}} the FDA's authority to restrict access to what they claimed was a potentially lifesaving drugs. More than twenty states passed laws making the use of <b>Laetrile</b> legal. After the unanimous Supreme Court ruling in Rutherford v. United States which established that interstate transport of the compound was illegal, usage fell off dramatically. The US Food and Drug Administration continues to seek jail sentences for vendors marketing <b>laetrile</b> for cancer treatment, calling it a [...] "highly toxic product that has not shown any effect on treating cancer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The study {{concluded}} [...] "Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed {{about the danger}} of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (<b>Laetrile)</b> is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment".|$|E
2500|$|Advocates {{of the use}} of <b>laetrile</b> {{have also}} changed the {{rationale}} for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a [...] "holistic" [...] nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.|$|E
2500|$|Hovind {{claims that}} the cyanide-releasing {{compound}} <b>laetrile</b> is a [...] "cancer cure" [...] which the U.S. government is conspiring to suppress and that diseases including HIV, Gulf war syndrome, Crohn's colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's were engineered by [...] "the money masters and governments of the world" [...] {{for the purpose of}} global economic domination. [...] He has denounced democracy as [...] "evil and contrary to God's law", and called global warming a communist conspiracy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Privitera {{was convicted}} of {{conspiracy}} to possess and distribute <b>laetrile</b> for telling patients where to obtain it -apricot seeds-(yes, the fruit.) The case led to a Supreme Court of California decision in 1979. Citing Roe v. Wade, Privitera's lawyers contended {{that the right to}} obtain <b>laetrile</b> is a fundamental right of privacy. The California Court of Appeal overturned the conviction citing a compelling interest, and the state appealed. The Supreme Court of California ruled 5 to 2 that the right to obtain drugs of unproven efficacy is not encompassed by the right of privacy embodied in either the State or Federal Constitutions. The majority wrote that [...] "the lesson of Roe v. Wade for our case is that a requirement that a drug be certified effective for its intended use is a reasonable means to 'insure maximum safety for the patient.'" [...] (So basically they were saying fruit should be illegal, yes the seeds from apricots.) The outcome was vitamin B-17 [...] "Amygdalin" [...] and apricot seeds were made legal to possess and sell and are widely available and consumed and purchased today. The term used [...] "laetrile" [...] is actually incorrect because that's referring to the injectable pharmaceutical form of Amygdalin, not the extract from the apricot seed. Privitera was soon pardoned by California governor Jerry Brown after the governor received more than 10,000 letters from citizens asking him to Pardon him.|$|E
2500|$|By February 1980, {{evidence}} of widespread metastasis was found. While {{he tried to}} keep the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had [...] "terminal cancer" [...] on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, for unconventional treatment after US doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over the trip, because McQueen sought treatment from William Donald Kelley, who was promoting a variation of the Gerson therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cattle and sheep, massage, and <b>laetrile,</b> an anticancer drug available in Mexico, but described as canonical quackery by mainstream scientists. McQueen paid for Kelley's treatments by himself in cash payments which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month ($ today) during his three-month stay in Mexico. Kelley's only medical license (until revoked in 1976) had been for orthodontics. Kelley's methods created a sensation in the traditional and tabloid press when it became known that McQueen was a patient.|$|E
50|$|Griffin's {{websites}} refer {{visitors to}} doctors, clinics, and hospitals with alternative cancer treatments, including sellers of <b>laetrile.</b> He does not sell <b>laetrile</b> himself.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center {{board member}} Benno Schmidt {{convinced}} {{the hospital to}} test <b>laetrile</b> in order to assert its ineffectiveness [...] "with some conviction". Sugiura found that <b>laetrile</b> inhibited secondary tumors in mice, without destroying the primary tumor, but in a blind test was unable to conclude that <b>laetrile</b> had anticancer activity.|$|E
