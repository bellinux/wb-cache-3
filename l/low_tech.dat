25|$|Assistive {{technology}} {{in this area}} is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. <b>Low</b> <b>tech</b> encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|E
500|$|Depending {{on their}} {{language}} and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards. Visual scene displays {{have been used}} on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction. Approaches such as [...] "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" [...] train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe. They can be produced at a very <b>low</b> <b>tech</b> level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words {{they are trying to}} say. Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.|$|E
5000|$|Combat is {{generally}} a four-step process. One first determines if a character scores {{a hit with}} his chosen weapon. Things like range, size of the target, movement, and amount of cover come into play. If one scores a hit, then one rolls to determine hit location. After hit location, one then determines if the attack penetrated the armor.

5000|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly praised Hammerfall, {{calling it a}} [...] "satisfying novel" [...] that is a [...] "blend of gorgeous, {{slightly}} knotty prose, deeply conflicted heroes, desperate action and nicely observed cultural details".

But she was critical of Cherryh's portrayal {{of the two major}} characters, Marak and the Ila, who she felt come across as being the perfect hero and villain. Buzbee said that neither of them appear to experience any internal conflict: one never doubts Makak's sanity, and the Ila is simply too opaque to understand.|$|R
40|$|Assistive {{technology}} (AT) {{is defined}} as any tool that can help integrate students with severe or multiple disabilities (SMD) into learning activities. As mandated by federal law, AT must be considered for all students with disabilities. Educators, however, do not consistently embrace <b>low</b> and mid <b>tech</b> AT devices in reading and the language arts, thus limiting student engagement in learning activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore educators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their experiences regarding the acquisition and the use of <b>low</b> and mid <b>tech</b> assistive devices with students with SMD. This study builds on the existing literature base of using AT to increase student participation in literacy activities, thus moving students through Vygotsky 2 ̆ 7 s zone of proximal development from limited performance to independent performance. Research questions in this study addressed (a) educators 2 ̆ 7 experiences regarding the use of AT for students with SMD, (b) educators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of AT use for students with SMD, and (c) strategies educators use to match AT to students with SMD. A qualitative phenomenological research design utilizing interviews with educators and unobtrusive data collection was used to determine the effectiveness of the incorporation of AT devices in learning activities for students with SMD. Results indicate that educators have limited AT use and little or no training. This study indicates the need for formal and informal AT training for educators and contributes to social change by enhancing the literature on academic modifications and adaptations with the use of <b>low</b> and mid <b>tech</b> assistive device interventions. Implications for social change include improving teaching practices for students with SMD...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{byproducts}} or residues {{are widely}} produced in Kazakhstan and their utilization as a sorbent material for petroleum spill {{can be developed}} as <b>low</b> cost, high <b>tech</b> environmental technology. Rice husk, an agricultural waste, was used as petroleum sorbent material. The present study examines the sorption capacity of thermally treated rice husk for different petroleum products. Results showed that the petroleum sorption capacity of this material prepared at 700 ºC was 15 g/g for heavy crude petroleum. The material obtained by thermal treatment of rice husk has very good buoyancy characteristics, high petroleum sorption capacity and high hydrophobicity. The effects of heating temperature, contact time and petroleum density on the petroleum sorption capacity of thermally treated rice husks were further studied {{on the basis of}} phase composition, microstructure and morphology using X-ray diffraction analysis, FTIR spectrometry, optical digital microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results of the SEM and optical microscopy studies strongly indicate that thermal treatment is a suitable method to improve structure of husk particles regarding porosity compared to virgin samples.
