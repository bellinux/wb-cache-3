40|$|Wit is {{a system}} {{infrastructure}} that supports wireless connection of palmtop computers to a wired local area network (LAN). The system includes a primitive windowing system, nonpreemptive threads, reliable and unreliable connections, and a Tcl interpreter[Ouster 94] that allows applications to dynamically extend the palmtop system and user interface by downloading sequences of Tcl code. Together, these services provide an environment for exploring issues in mobile computing for small devices by supporting {{a wide range of}} solutions for hiding low bandwidth constraints, and permitting disconnected operation through <b>local</b> execution of <b>application</b> <b>functions.</b> 1 Introduction Mobile computing is one of the hot-topics in today's increasingly computer-sophisticated society.

40|$|Abstract — Remote {{attestation}} in trusted computing {{is about}} the ability of a local platform to authenticate the hardware and the software stack running on a remote trusted platform. We say that this process is successful, if a <b>local</b> <b>application</b> is able to authenticate each layer in the remote stack; it is meaningful if, by using this information, the <b>local</b> <b>application</b> can make its own evaluation on the safety of the platform environment where the remote application is running. In this paper we analyze the credentials and beliefs that are necessary to a <b>local</b> <b>application</b> in order for the remote attestation process to be both successful and meaningful. I...|$|R

Therefore, the network traffic in the cooperative bandwidth sharing scenario is supposed to be unbalanced. We define three kinds of traffic patterns: (i) Idle, which means no network traffic is generated by <b>local</b> <b>applications</b> or services; (ii) Max CBR, which means the <b>local</b> <b>application,</b> e.g., streaming application, expects as much as possible bandwidth that {{is no more than a}} maximum constant bit rate (CBR); (iii) Greedy, which means the <b>local</b> <b>application,</b> e.g., file downloading, leeches as much as possible bandwidth and thus generates a bursty traffic.
