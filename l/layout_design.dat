5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E

25|$|At {{the heart}} of the {{amusement}} park, visitors are greeted by International Street which lies just beyond the main entrance. As one of the park's original staples when it opened in 1972, International Street was designed by Bruce Bushman, a former Walt Disney Imagineering <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> artist. The area's architecture and cultural themes represent Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland. To save on the cost of construction, the second story of each building was designed on a three-quarters scale, borrowing from a practice used by Disney throughout their theme parks.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{layout of}} Ado-Ewi {{appeared to have}} taken definite shape {{from the time of}} Ewi Awamaro as a matter of strategic repositioning for Kingdom building and political dominance of the rural and conquered communities. The traditional <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> of Ado-Ekiti relocated most of the early settlers outside the vicinity of Ewi’s Palace. It was an arrangement that also left the Ado community and the subordinate towns to revolve around Ewi in a preferred order. The enlargement of the Ewi’s Kingdom during the reign of Ewi Gberubioya (1630-1696) in the 17th century and other successive Ewis upward into late 19th century which covers the period under review with the expansion of the main town’s layout indicates that they did not alter the traditions for town settings which is similar to what is obtained in many other of Yoruba major towns.|$|E

40|$|In {{flip chip}} on flex (FCOF) technology, the {{flexible}} substrate and the assembly process are very essential for the reliability of solder joints. In the research, fine-pitch solder-bumped chips with various chip sizes were assembled on the flexible substrates using FCOF technology. The five types of <b>layout</b> <b>designs</b> were evaluated for their effects on the assembly process and reliability of FCOF technology. It was found that appropriate substrate <b>layout</b> <b>designs</b> provided more accurate control of the wetting area because they minimized the misalignment between the copper pad and the solder mask opening. The concept of wetting area error ratio is introduced to evaluate the variation of the wetting area on the various <b>layout</b> <b>designs.</b> The shapes of solder joints formed are also related to the flex designs. Die shear test was performed for the samples of FCOF without underfill materials to study the adhesion strength of the copper pad, the solder mask and the base layer. The rafted samples after thermal cycling and HAST were analyzed using SAM, X-ray imaging system, cross-sectioning, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ...|$|R
