40|$|We apply {{conjoint}} {{analysis to}} study the influence of tax <b>labeling</b> <b>and</b> tax earmarking on German taxpayers' willingness to contribute. From a survey based sample we show that <b>labeling</b> <b>and</b> earmarking effects can substantially increase participants' willingness to contribute, which results in a considerable deviation from a pure consumption maximizing behavior. Furthermore, we give an explanation for this effect regarding socio-demographic attributes of German taxpayers. These results explain the variety in tax <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> provide implications for tax policy regarding further reforms of the tax <b>and</b> contribution system: <b>Labeling</b> <b>and</b> earmarking of contributions are important instruments in selling policies and increasing tax revenue.

40|$|The {{required}} {{amount of}} labeled training data for object detection and classification {{is a major}} drawback of current methods. Combining <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled data via semisupervised learning holds the promise to ease the tedious <b>and</b> time consuming <b>labeling</b> effort. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning method which combines the power of learned similarity functions and classifiers. The approach capable of exploiting both <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled data is formulated in a boosting framework. One classifier (the learned similarity) serves as a prior which is steadily improved via training a second classifier on <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled samples. We demonstrate the approach on challenging computer vision applications. First, we show how we can train a classifier using only a few <b>labeled</b> samples <b>and</b> many unlabeled data. Second, we improve (specialize) a state-of-the-art detector by using <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled data. 1...|$|R

To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the <b>label</b> <b>and</b> Dr.Dre.

5|$|Albert Bouchard {{had been}} {{completely}} excluded from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the <b>label</b> <b>and</b> within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E
