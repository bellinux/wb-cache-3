50|$|The college {{takes its}} title from the Anglo-Saxon pre-conquest {{description}} of the particular area {{in which it is}} situated - place of clover or good pasture. The college opened in 1955 and has been fortunate in having enjoyed considerable stability in that up to the time of the appointment of the present Principal (2008) there had been only four changes of leadership since that time with each one having made his own unique contribution {{to the development of the}} College. Robert Davies (1955-1958) gave the school a firm foundation. Peter Court (1958-1980) is most associated with the establishment of the school as one of three community colleges in East Sussex (the others being Portslade and Uplands, Wadhurst). The philosophy underpinning this concept was that a school should act as a focal point for its community opening its facilities to the general public during evenings and weekends. A wide range of adult education courses and activities was established as well as a youth centre housed in separate premises in the town. Christopher Thompson (1980-1992) built on the community provision with the establishment of the Battle Area Sports Centre and the Claverham Day Nursery while at the same time making a wide range of radical changes to the pastoral and academic organisation of the College, in particular by abandoning mixed ability teaching groups and replacing these with the setting of pupils by ability by subject throughout the academic subject range. This was also accompanied by the introduction of criteria based twice termly pupil assessments, the close monitoring of pupils and staff in regard to the setting, completion and marking of homework and careful oversight of <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and teaching standards. In regard to pastoral care, a fully fledged vertical house system was developed. When first opened, there were originally four houses. Mountjoy, Middleborough, Sandlach, and Telham - the names of the houses being derived from post conquest place names given by the Normans to areas of the battleground which had been significant in the action. However, originally, these house groupings did not form the core of the pastoral system which was, instead, based upon a horizontal year system. In 1981 the name Middleborough was replaced by that of Caldbec, and the houses became the key part of the pastoral care provision, replacing the existing horizontal year structure with a 'family' vertical structure where all staff and pupils shared loyalties to organisations within the College as well as to the college as a whole. The College Houses, each represented by a different colour and with all girls and boys wearing house ties incorporating their particular house colour alongside the blue and yellow College stripes - Calbec purple, Montjoie blue, Santlache red, Telham green and then, in 2008, Oakwood silver, when this additional house was introduced. These changes in academic and pastoral organisation facilitated the development of a strong ethos of high expectations in regard to all aspects of the life of the College - in particular, high standards of pastoral care, pupil discipline and attainment. Richard Pitts (1992-2008) greatly further consolidated the ethos of the College while overseeing considerable building developments including four new laboratories and classrooms, and further expansion of pupil numbers as the reputation of the college continued to grow. Starting from the first christmas, the school started using the Vivo Miles system replacing the old merit system.|$|E
50|$|Through Radio Bantu, {{government}} policy was preached {{to deter the}} youth from activating their consciousness.This trend continued at Radio Bantu, whose broadcasting time increased to 24 hours in 1978, making it a canvas upon which battle lines were drawn; a push and pull between government ideology and multiply defined resistance. The move of the SABC from the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs to the Ministry of National Education under Van der Spuy aligned Radio Bantu directly with the heartbeat of the Apartheid state; Bantu education. Having noted {{that the key to}} sustaining the status quo of White supremacy/Black subservience was the creation of a generation educated in a reality of subservience, the School Radio Service began focusing its attentions on younger standards; neglecting to touch on home language and aboriginal cultural instruction. The removal of Geography and Citizenship programme directed at educating Black persons about the conditions of their South African citizenship following legislative changes in 1970 from the lesson roll respectively served the making of parochial Black persons who remained unaware of a life outside their present reality and voiced the exclusion of Blacks from the banner of South African citizenship. Furthermore, the removal of the Bantu composers programme (1973) and the editing out of ethnic history from the History lesson script (1974) stripped the Service entirely of its mask as a supplementary cultural education source. Attempts to feign impartiality firstly faded then vanished completely. The conversion of the programme for teachers to a ‘series for the educated Bantu’ in 1973 presented itself as an intellectuals paradise, but was in fact a means to punt the ideology of homelands to educated fence-sitters. By 1975, the blatant correlation between changes in the Bantu education policy the Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974, which dictated that the medium of instruction to be used from Std 5 upwards was Afrikaans, and Radio Bantu, which aired a 10 <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> for this on the School Radio Service and subsequently removed older standards from the lesson roll, meant the line between SABC and the government became so blurred that it was almost non-existent. Within this politically impotent environment were members of staff like Thokozani Nene, Thetha Masombuka and Koos Hadebe who explored the foggy separation between these two institutions, attempting to maintain some objectivity. Nene, who joined Radio Bantu as a news reader in 1971, consciously prefaced his news bulletins with the disclaimer that the news being broadcast was state (Johannesburg) prepared and used praise poems, whose format lends itself to poetic and archaic language and heavily references Zulu history, to address the listeners in the introduction and conclusion to his news bulletins. Hadebe, who joined Radio Zulu as a sports commentator under the wing of Thetha Masombuka in 1974 following the splitting of Radio Bantu as an umbrella Black radio service into separate language services along ethnic lines, would broadcast soccer matches in Zulu on the weekend, then translate them into siNdebele and siSwati for the weekday sports shows with Masombuka. Nene’s effort to educate his audience in history and culture (lived and linguistic) and Hadebe’s multi-ethnic-serving broadcasts with Masombuka aligned their work with two greater resistance movements in motion at the time.Nene, Hadebe and Masombuka’s presence on the airwaves thus acted as resistance-booster-shots in a cesspool of government infected transmissions.|$|E

However preparing suitable learning content for effective language learning remains a challenging and time-consuming task. This paper reports the experience of designing and developing a m-Learning platform (named LingoSnacks) for semi-automatic preparation of content for language learning using Natural Language Processing (NLP) services. LingoSnacks Authoring Tools provide an environment of assisted authoring of learning content and delivering it to the learner in game-like interactive learning activities.

This work studied the preparation of geography lessons in Czechia with an emphasis on the use of internet sources. Based on the findings, criteria for an ideal geographic website for teachers were suggested. The data were collected in two ways: (1) on-line survey of ran- domly selected secondary school teachers (n= 72), and (2) semi-structured interviews (n= 6). The work indicated that <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> greatly varies from teacher to teacher. In general, teachers do not change their lesson plans significantly, and thus the beginning of teachers' career is crucial for future teaching. Participating teachers spend on average about a quarter of their working time on <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and there is no apparent correlation between the time spend on <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and the teachers' age or the length of teachers' career. Furthermore, it was found that all participating teachers use internet resources during <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation,</b> particularly for search of updated infor- mation.

40|$|M. Ed. Teaching is only {{successful}} if {{it leads}} to effective learning. In order {{to be successful in}} their teaching, teachers need skills and techniques that can be used simultaneously so that they can attain predetermined aims and objectives. There {{can be no doubt that}} teaching is a complex task, and in order to accomplish this demanding task successfully, teachers need to focus on the different aspects in the preparation of their lessons. The major objective of this study was to investigate the amount of the teachers' professional input with reference to the different aspects of <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and presentation. The research was based on the assumption that for prospective and serving teachers to teach effectively they should prepare their lessons thoroughly beforehand. In order to understand this problem in its total context, a study of the literature on <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and presentation as a teachers responsibilities was done. The most important points to be considered when planning and presenting lessons were discussed. In order to gather information concerning the research problem questionnaires were administered to teachers. The results obtained in this research indicated the following: female teachers are the ones who are giving a higher input concerning <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and presentation. Teachers who speak other languages put more effort into preparing their lessons than Afrikaans and English speaking teachers. junior primary school teachers put more effort into preparing their lessons than Secondary school teachers.

40|$|Fundamental for {{mentoring}} a {{preservice teacher}} is the mentor’s articulation of pedagogical knowledge, {{which in this}} research draws upon specific practices, viz: planning, timetabling <b>lessons,</b> <b>preparation,</b> teaching strategies, content knowledge, problem solving, questioning, classroom management, implementation, assessment, and viewpoints for teaching. Mentoring is haphazard; consequently mentors need a pedagogical knowledge framework and a repertoire of pedagogical knowledge strategies to guide a preservice teacher’s development. Yet, what are strategies for mentoring pedagogical knowledge practices? This qualitative research investigates mentoring strategies assigned to pedagogical knowledge from 27 experienced mentor teachers. Findings showed that there were multiple strategies that {{can be linked to}} specific pedagogical knowledge practices. For example, mentoring strategies associated with planning for teaching can include co-planning, verbally reflecting on planning with the mentee, and showing examples of the mentor teacher’s planning (e. g., teacher’s plans, school plans, district and state plans).

40|$|International audienceThe work of {{mathematics}} teachers, in and out-of-class, is often considered as individual. Apart from some training programs, or very particular contexts, teachers {{seem to work}} by themselves to prepare and implement their lessons. In this presentation we argue to the contrary that teachers’ work comprises many collaborative aspects and that the interactions with colleagues, often through resources, are crucial for teacher professional development. In terms of theoretical framework, we consider a “resource” in its wider terms leaning on work by Adler (2000). Textbooks and website are resources (e. g. Remillard 2005), and discussions with colleagues or student work may also constitute resources for teachers. Teachers select resources, combine and modify them, use them in class etc. – we call this “teacher documentation work” (Gueudet, Pepin & Trouche 2012) and argue that teacher documentation work and professional development are intertwined. In one direction the documentation work depends on teachers’ professional knowledge; in the other working with resources shapes teachers’ knowledge and pedagogic practice, and in turn ‘produces’ new resources. Our conclusions {{are based on the}} analyses of two cases: Vera, a mathematics teacher in France; and Claire, a teacher in Norway, both teaching grade six mathematics classes. Both teachers were observed in class and selected lessons video-taped. They were interviewed about their resource systems (drawings were produced) and how these linked to their <b>lesson</b> <b>preparations</b> and pedagogic practice. Further documents (e. g. <b>lesson</b> <b>preparations)</b> were collected and the data analysed on the basis of our understandings of a teacher’s documentation work and of the contexts in which these teachers were working. Results show that both teachers’ documentation systems were to a large extent influenced by their working conditions, the constraints and affordances to work collaboratively, in their environments. Interestingly, both teachers claimed that during their professional lives they had encountered few opportunities to work with colleagues over a prolonged period of time, and those were mainly linked to particular initiatives supported by the school, or school authority. However, our analyses of their respective systems identified several collaborative aspects of their work, which were, albeit, not given priority or time in the schools’ action plans. Further, it appeared that ‘serious’ collaborative work was always linked to particular resources: Vera talked about working in the same room, a “maths and physics laboratory”, and using the same single textbooks as a central resource. Claire discussed the “arbeidsplan” (work plan for each individual pupil) in detail, which linked her to work with colleagues. Thus, we claim that particular resources help to ‘produce’ particular collaborative teacher interaction, and that these resources link individual teacher’s documentation system, to develop, over several cycles, into a larger dynamic system of teacher collaboration. This has implications for mathematics teacher education and professional development, for individual teacher learning/knowledge and for development at scale. Contrasting these two cases permits to identify (1) particular systemic features of teachers' work with resources; and (2) what could appear as deep invariants linked to the collective dimensions of this work...|$|R
40|$|Only a small {{percentage}} of mathematics teacher professional development activities in South Africa include pedagogy and instruction approaches required to teach the content. In the light of the poor mathematics results, it is of pertinent importance that teachers need to be developed in terms of the mathematics they teach and the pedagogical component of it. A teachers’ professional development programme that used mentoring as one of the interventions was investigated where the mentor conducted classroom observations and had post–observation conferences with the teachers. The data from the observations, post observation conferences and interviews of both the mentors and the mathematics teachers was used to inform the off-site workshops on mathematics content and the instructional skills required to effectively teach the content. Mentoring supported the teachers in terms of mathematics content and instruction, team teaching and <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation.</b> The teachers’ individual content and instructional needs were also assessed and supported. The study revealed that mentoring that takes cognisance of teachers’ content and instructional needs enhanced their <b>lesson</b> <b>preparation</b> and understanding of mathematics as well as the skills required to teach it effectively.
