5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E

6000|$|... "Although {{the early}} years of my manhood were devoted to public life, it was never really suited to my taste. <b>I</b> <b>longed,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am sure you must often have done, for the quiet and {{independence}} that belong only to the private citizen; and now, at forty, I feel that desire stronger than ever.|$|R

500|$|It is {{believed}} that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises have added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes {{has been compared to}} the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter has noted, [...] "The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have, I am used to it." [...] He later stated that the helmets in their current iteration are fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating.|$|E

[...] In 1921, his first season as commissioner, New York Giants owner Charles Stoneham and manager John McGraw purchased Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. Landis gave Stoneham and McGraw an ultimatum—they could not be involved in both baseball and horse racing. They quickly put the track back on the market.|$|E
500|$|... "both my {{children}} and I have but one dream: to return! To return to that stupendous New World, which makes you almost guiddy [...] because of its immencity, [...] its noise, its striving, its fearful impetuous [...] to get on, to do always more, always bigger, quicker, more astonishingly a restless, flaring great world, where I think everything can be realised...

500|$|The Charity Shield was {{presented}} to Bruce by former Arsenal manager Billy Wright. Wright died barely a year later, aged 70. Graham assumed both clubs would share the trophy, so {{when it came to}} a penalty shoot-out he entrusted his players to decide their order. He described Wright's goal as [...] "brilliant" [...] and felt it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] that Seaman missed: [...] "For a goalkeeper, he normally takes great penalties. He normally hits them hard but he decided to try and place this one and it didn't work." [...] Wright was unashamed of his penalty miss, [...] "…just as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> don't do it when it is important".|$|E

500|$|According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Rodgers, Hammerstein and Fields {{had hoped}} to engage Yul Brynner as director. [...] Brynner, who had gained fame in the team's 1951 hit, The King and I, was an {{accomplished}} director. [...] However, he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury, and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox. [...] Instead, they hired actor and dancer Gene Kelly, who had never directed on stage before. [...] Kelly felt that the work would not be one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best, but [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> crammed the show brim-full of every joke and gimmick in the book, I could get it to work".|$|E
500|$|To this end, Welensky {{organised}} {{a conference}} in February 1949 to investigate {{the idea of a}} federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' between blacks and whites. However, he insisted that [...] "for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can see, in that partnership [...] will be senior partners".|$|E
500|$|Lowell had {{intended}} never to remarry {{after the death}} of his wife Maria White. However, in 1857, surprising his friends, he became engaged to Frances Dunlap, who many described as simple and unattractive. Dunlap, niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap, was a friend of Lowell's first wife and formerly wealthy, though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances. Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16, 1857, in a ceremony performed by his brother. Lowell wrote, [...] "My second marriage was the wisest act of my life, & as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am sure of it, I can afford to wait till my friends agree with me." ...|$|E

500|$|Scully traces Doggett's {{phone call}} and has Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) travel to the Mexican town where he was last seen. It is {{revealed}} that Caballero, an enforcer for the local drug cartel, is a [...] "memory vampire": he can absorb the memories of those posing {{a threat to the}} cartel. Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are likewise controlled by the cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even the bad ones, [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember the good.” ...|$|E
500|$|Zola {{himself was}} happy with his {{achievements}} to the Chelsea side, but when asked if his substitution was all projected, he denied it, stating: [...] "It wasn't planned. In the moment, I used my positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember." [...] Their victory meant Aston Villa gained {{a place in the}} 1998–99 UEFA Cup.|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} verse {{of the song}} begins, {{childhood}} pictures of Jared and Shannon with their mother Constance are shown. Takes of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and other confessions follow, including clips from Corey Feldman's early work as a child actor. Feldman discusses how he started working at age three and how his family relied on him to pay the bills. Ashley Olsen opines on the fleeting nature of fame, while Juliette Lewis and James Franco talk about managing dreams and expectations. As the song ends, Christopher Lloyd Dennis sums up, [...] "Do I think I'm gonna {{make it in the}} industry? As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> keep believing, it will happen." [...] The short film ends with the various personalities introducing themselves.|$|E
