50|$|The {{big news}} for 1988 was the {{introduction}} of the Seville Touring Sedan (STS) which came equipped with GM's FE2 Touring Suspension. It featured special 15 inch alloy wheels, special springs, rear sway bar, and a special 15.6:1 steering ratio for enhanced handling, a grille mounted Cadillac emblem, special cloisonne trunk <b>lock</b> <b>cover,</b> and a unique four-place interior. 1988 Seville Touring Sedan production totaled 1,499 units. The first 1988 STS's were custom built in June 1988 by Cars and Concepts and announced at the 1988 Detroit Grand Prix. These initial run models were available to VIP's within General Motors, the Cadillac Division, some major shareholders and a short list of dignitaries. A special label was affixed to the lower corner of the driver-side front door by Cars and Concepts identifying it as one of the original STS's.|$|E

5000|$|In late 1992, the {{exterior}} {{was given a}} minor update with a new grille and slightly redesigned tail lamp lenses (distinguished by a [...] "checkerboard" [...] pattern) for 1993 models. As with the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis, the Town Car received a larger update for the 1995 model year in late 1994. This facelift is best distinguished by the deletion of the fixed quarter glass in the rear doors along with the redesign of the side mirrors (enlarged and changed to body-color). Although the bumper largely remained unchanged, the front fascia is updated as the headlamp clusters are changed to a clear-lens design and separated from the grille. The grille was redesigned, returning to the 1990-1992 design in a surround fitting closer to the body. The rear fascia saw the trim between the tail lamps redesigned, featuring additional running lights, while the reverse lamps were moved from the outer edges of the reflector panel to the center, beneath the lid <b>lock</b> <b>cover</b> (similar to the 1985 - 1987 models).|$|E
5000|$|Midnight Blue 'Kasman II' luxury cloth bucket {{seats with}} a hand-stitched leather covered console and upper {{instrument}} panel crash pad were standard.

50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained.

50|$|In some cases, such as {{equipment}} used in schools, community centers, or other public places, {{the equipment is}} designed so that {{some or all of}} the switches are hidden behind a <b>locked</b> <b>cover.</b> Some public address systems are sold in tamper-resistant designs that make it harder for unauthorized members of the public to activate the system or change the settings. The switches are at the rear of the unit; only LED lights are on the front of the panel. When the unit is rack-mounted into a wall or rack unit, this means that only official personnel (who are able to access the back of the panel) can change the settings or use the unit. Another variant on this design is to cover the switches with a locked panel. In some cases, such as the sound system in a bar or club, the <b>locked</b> <b>cover</b> may be made from transparent plexiglass, so that the sound engineer can verify the sound system settings and switches (yet at the same time, the locked panel prevents mischief-minded club patrons from tampering or altering the amplifier or equalizer settings).|$|R
50|$|In {{his first}} appearance, {{we learn that}} Sabbath was {{originally}} a renegade member of the British Secret Service during the late 18th century. It was explained that it is customary for agents to take Biblical names, and Sabbath's name derived itself from a Jewish Kabalistic trend in the Service during the time period of his initiation. His initiation into the Service involved him being thrown into the River Thames bound in thirteen chains and thirteen <b>locks,</b> <b>covered</b> in sackcloth. Sabbath survived by encountering Leviathan, who rescued him.|$|R
5000|$|With such {{big changes}} for Eldorado {{just a year}} earlier, 1989 saw little that was new. The {{optional}} automatic rearview mirror went from an electrically operated mechanical tilting mechanism to the new electrochromic style, using a clear fluid filled between the mirror and a thin sheet of glass, which tints upon activation. A new exterior color, White Diamond, brought the color choices up to 18. Gone were the 14-inch wheels, as the previously optional 15-inch [...] "snowflake"-style aluminum wheel, introduced last year, was made standard for the base Eldorado. A compact disc player, available only with the Delco Bose Gold Series music system, was a new option this year, as was reversible floor mats, and gold-plated ornamentation ("Cadillac" [...] grille and trunk scripts, sail panel ornaments, deck lid engine plaque, trunk <b>lock</b> <b>cover,</b> tail lamp emblems, and available wire wheel cover wreath and crest). New standard items include an express-down module for the driver's window, electronic oil-life indicator, a more powerful Delco Freedom II battery, a revised factory warranty, and GM's PASS (Passive Automotive Security System) KEY theft-deterrent system, which activated the fuel system based upon a coded pellet within the ignition key. Previously optional items that were now added as standard equipment included a cassette player with graphic equalizer, remote fuel filler door release, and a front license plate mounting. In an effort to use up existing warehouse stock, the brushed chrome lower bodyside accent molding, optional through last year, was added as standard equipment for 1989 (revamped moldings would appear in 1990). New high-gloss Birdseye Maple trim (replacing the satin-finished American Walnut used from 1986 to 1988) on the instrument panel and console was standard on Eldorado Biarritz, and available (for $245) on the base Eldorado. The optional full cabriolet roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top, was offered this year in limited colors. Pricing rose again, now at $26,738. Production slipped slightly, down to 27,807 (including 7,174 Biarritz models). The dip in sales was partly due to competition from GM's own Buick Riviera, which grew 11" [...] this year in a dramatic restyle, and had a production increase from 8,625 units in 1988 to 21,189 in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, a [...] 4.9-liter V8—the {{largest of}} this type—became the new {{standard}} powerplant. Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last years egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings. The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself—a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to Mercedes-Benz). The secondary hood release latch {{was at the bottom}} of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, twilight sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first [...] "Deville Touring Sedan" [...] became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year, it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature [...] "TOURING SEDAN" [...] lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid <b>lock</b> <b>cover</b> similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe.

30|$|The main aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is fabrication of low-cost S.H Cu and Al nanoparticles and extending their application towards the catalysis field. For the synthesis of S.H Cu or Al metal plates, a standard literature procedure was followed [35]. The Cu or Al plate with the area of 12  cm 2 was taken as a source material. The metal plate was cleaned with acetone and ultrasonicated for 1  h in an aqueous medium. Then the plate {{was removed from the}} ultrasonic bath and dried at 110  °C for 2  h and it was weighed (W 1 g) and subjected to the chemical etching reaction in the presence of 0.10  g MA in 100  mL ethanol medium under mild stirring condition. After 7  days of chemical etching, the metal plate was removed from the reaction medium and dried at 80  °C for 2  h (W 2 g). The content of the medium was dried at 80  °C for a night. The metal with hierarchical structure was obtained as a powder, weighed (W 3 g) and stored in a zip <b>lock</b> <b>cover.</b> During the fabrication of S.H Cu or Al plate, the etching agent-coated Cu or Al is formed as a by-product without any use. Thus, obtained hierarchically structured Cu or Al powder was dispersed in an aqueous medium with the aid of ultrasonication for 30  min. Once the dispersion was completed, excess of NaBH 4 was added under ultrasonication. The hierarchically structured Cu or Al is now subjected to chemical reduction reaction and reduced to Cu and Al nanoparticles. The reduction reaction was allowed to continue for another 30  min. At the end of the reaction, the dark-colored precipitate was filtered, dried, weighed and stored in a zip <b>lock</b> <b>cover</b> under nitrogen atmosphere.|$|E
30|$|FA-functionalized ferrite was {{synthesized}} as follows: 5  g {{ferrous sulphate}} and 10  g ferric chloride in 100  mL water were mixed thoroughly; 2  g FA in 25  mL water was added slowly. The slow addition was continued for 30  min at 45  °C {{under nitrogen atmosphere}} under mild stirring condition; 5  g NaOH in 25  mL water {{was added to the}} content slowly. The appearance of dark black color (pH > 10) confirmed the formation of FA-functionalized ferrite. The stirring was continued for another 1  h. Then the beaker was kept on a magnetic bar to isolate the FA-functionalized ferrite and to purify the nanohybrid material (Scheme  1). The purification process was continued three times with 50  mL fresh water. After the purification process the contents were filtered and dried at 110  °C for 8  h.

40|$|Background: Lead exists {{extensively}} in the environment {{and it is a}} heavy metal, which is neurotoxic in nature which is harmful to children. In contrast to trace elements such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), lead has no recognized benecial effects in human body. With the economic development in India in recent years, the concentration of lead has increased in the environment and henceforth, lead pollution has become a severe problem in the country. Lead poisoning can create an immense damage and irreversible harm to foetal growth, the growth of teenagers and psychological, behavioural and cognitive development. Aim and Objectives: To estimate the lead content in the sample of toys. Material and Methods: 97 different toys were collected and coded as TS, these toys were kept in plastic <b>lock</b> <b>cover</b> which were lead proof. At rst the toys were arranged in order according to the serial number of the code (TS 1 – TS 97). The FP X-ray uorescence (Innov-X ray analyzer) instrument was placed with the window of the analyzer {{on the surface of the}} toy vertically in such a way that there was no gap between the toy surface and the sampling window. The parts per million (ppm) values of all toys were recorded. Results: Out of 97 samples tested, 22 samples were above permissible limits. The different materials demonstrate signicant correlation with the lead content in ppm. Lead is used as a stabilizer in some toys as well as children's items made from PVC plastic. Baby toys made up of plastic have higher concentration of lead. Lead can leach out of products when children handle and swallow them involuntarily...|$|E
