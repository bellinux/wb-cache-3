25|$|A {{lighting}} designer (LD) {{is familiar}} with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in his plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, and the channel number of the dimmer system or lighting control console.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to much theatre of the time, The Importance of Being Earnests <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> does not tackle serious {{social and political}} issues, something of which contemporary reviewers were wary. Though unsure of Wilde's seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play's cleverness, humour and popularity with audiences. George Bernard Shaw, for example, reviewed the play in the Saturday Review, arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse, [...] "I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter." [...] Later in a letter he said, the play, though [...] "extremely funny", was Wilde's [...] "first really heartless [...] ". In The World, William Archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but {{found it to be}} empty of meaning, [...] "What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?" ...|$|E

50|$|While {{instrument}} schedules {{have traditionally}} been made by hand or on spreadsheets, there are now several industry specific software based means to generate them. Lightwright is a spreadsheet program that will print nicely formatted instrument schedules. CAD software such as VectorWorks and AutoCAD used for creating a <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> can often export lighting information into forms that other programs can use. This way the lighting designer only needs to draft the <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> and the instrument schedule and other paperwork can be generated automatically. Some designers use Microsoft Word.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> {{there are a number}} of other important pieces of paperwork (i.e. Dimmer hookup, Instrument Schedule, and Magic Sheet) in a complete lighting design.

5000|$|In {{theatrical}} productions, {{an instrument}} schedule is {{a listing of}} all the lighting instruments and information about them used in a show. [...] The instruments are organized by their position on-stage, and is the distinguishing characteristic between an instrument schedule and a channel hookup or similar paperwork. The instrument schedule includes all information about every instrument, including hanging location, instrument number, type, wattage, color, focus area, circuit, dimmer and templates, along with any additional information. The variety of information included in an instrument schedule generally makes this more [...] "complete" [...] than other generated paperwork, and as such the schedule is often considered the [...] "master" [...] sheet. The master electrician uses {{the information contained in}} the instrument schedule along with the <b>light</b> <b>plot</b> to direct the hanging of the instruments.|$|E

It contains the relevant architectural information of the venue space including locations of walls, the floor level, the location of seats and balconies, and occasionally sight lines, {{as well as the}} location of each lighting instrument and other relevant hardware, like modular dimmer boxes. The plan must also include information on the electrical systems of the theater--the location of outlets connected to the theater's dimmers and the available lighting positions--rails, booms, side arms, and catwalks. The plan view may also contain scenic information, such as a drawing of the set.|$|E
