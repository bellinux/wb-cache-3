He {{falls in love with}} Indiana before speaking to her, saying, [...] "...she is all I ever read of! all I ever conceived! she is beauty in its very essence! she is elegance, delicacy, and sensibility personified!' To which even the thoughtless Lionel replies, 'All very true...but how should you know anything of her besides her beauty?'. Eugenia develops a crush on him because of his studious nature and fervent love of literature. Sometimes his romantic passions carry him away, {{as in the case of}} Indiana, but he has a good heart and principles underneath. Mrs. Berlinton is an eighteen-year-old friend of Camilla's and Melmond's sister. Camila describes her to Edgar as [...] "attractive, gentle, amiable." [...] She was forced to marry a much older man by her aunt but continues a correspondence with a mystery male. She is very beautiful and her sweetness of manners are captivating, which makes Camilla enraptured with her. She is very romantic, just like Melmond, but without the firmness of his principles: thus she sinks into gambling, flirting, and immoral [...] "friendships."Jacob is a faithful old family servant, who adores his master, Sir Hugh Tyrold. He speaks affectionately of Camilla to Edgar, loves his master, and is plain-spoken to Clermont Lynmere.Nicholas Gwigg (Alphonso Bellamy): the younger son of the master of a great gaming-house. In his first youth, he had been utterly neglected, and run wild; but his father afterwards becoming rich, had bestowed on him as good an education as the late business with which it had begun could possibly give (it was pity, perhaps, that the education did not include morals). He tried gaming, but spending as fast as he earned, he acquired nothing; and once, in a tide of disfavor, he had cheated, and been found out. His father dead, his elder brother passive, he went to London, hoping to elope with some heiress by relying on his handsome face and <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliments.</b> In the process he changed his name to Alphonso Bellamy. He had first met with the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton, and though this would not make him any money, her romantic turn of mind and loveliness tempted him to a scheme yet darker. They had exchanged letters with each other after she left, and soon after he forced Eugenia to marry him by shocking her gentleness of disposition with a suicidal threat. He treated her cruelly, yelling at her and trying to force her to write to her uncle for money, and continuing his heinous correspondence, and even meeting with, Mrs. Berlinton. Several unpleasant debts of honor being claimed, he had tried to force Eugenia to write to her uncle for money by putting a gun to her head and saying he would kill himself immediately after she was dead. Terrified, she was beginning to agree, when the alarmed postillion shouted out, [...] "Hold, villain! or you are a dead man!" [...] His hand shook—the gun went off—and he dropped dead. His behavior to Eugenia throughout was selfish, unfeeling, and brutally cruel. At first, Eugenia really believed in his passion for her, and though refusing to accept it, she sincerely pitied him and would not suspect him. After the marriage, she found out what he was really like, but refused to persecute him in court ("Solemn has been my vow! sacred I must hold it!")Mr. Westwyn: A good hearted old man and very close friend of Sir Hugh Tyrold. Though not so gentle or sweet tempered as his friend, he is affectionate and unassumingly plain spoken. He is very strict with his son, Hal, but clearly loves him dearly. He treats Clermont with well-deserved contempt, saying, [...] "That person...is a fellow I have prodigious longing to give a good caning to." [...] He takes a great liking to Camilla at first, but when he observes her seemingly coquettish behavior (in reality she was just making a naive mistake in the process of trying to repulse Hal's affection), his partiality for her soon cools. Later he grows delighted with Lavinia, who is [...] "pretty near as pretty" [...] as her sister, and whose gentle sweetness wins his blunt heart over.|$|E
40|$|Hitting the Bars with Aristotle: Dating in a Time of Uncertainty What does a man {{do when he}} {{suddenly}} finds himself single? In some ways there have never been more choices available. He can hang out in bars getting slowly smashed, Bogart style, {{in the hope that}} Ingrid Bergman might walk through the door. He can go onto the singles scene and meet other equally desperate people and maybe even hook himself a stalker. Alternatively, for those who lack social skills, or are too hideously disfigured and malodorous to go out in public, there is always the Internet. But this wealth of choices belies one fact: we live in a time of profound confusion. The old ways of being a man have gone, unlamented and unlikely to return.

We paid <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliments,</b> bought gifts, meals and drinks and generally tried to offend as little as possible, in the hope perhaps that we might bore women into submission. All the time we felt a gnawing unease that the old saw was true and that women really did prefer jerks. We know that partly because we watched our mothers, sisters and female friends dating them.

Role plays which were designed based on compliment topic and the gender <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> receivet. eeere employed to collect the compliment production data and were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics (i. e., independent-samples r-test and four-way mixed ANOVA). Retrospective verbal reports (RVRs) were conducted with the two groups of participants to elicit their perceptions and cognitive processes and were analyzed inductively and deductively. In terms <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> performance, both Taiwanese and British participants tended to offer Explicit compliments across all the situations, with the latter group producing significantly more than the former group. Statistical significant differences were also identified between the two groups of respondents in the employment <b>of</b> four Implicit <b>compliment</b> sub-strategies. Furthermore, this study evidenced the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>compliment</b> performance influenced by the interaction effect between different social variables. Results from the RVRs indicated not only between-groups but also within-group variations in the perceptions of the effect <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> topic and the gender <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> receiver. Results further suggested the mediating role of social distance in the act of compliment-giving for the two groups of participants. Moreover, Taiwanese and British participants focused their attention on different aspects of contextual information <b>of</b> the <b>compliment</b> situations, confirming the significance of the content-enriched design of situational prompts. Furthermore, the RVRs were indicative of two factors affecting the <b>compliment</b> performance <b>of</b> both groups, that is, perceived functions <b>of</b> <b>compliments</b> and linguistic difficulties. In addition, Taiwanese EFL learners reported a preference for thinking in English during the planning and production <b>of</b> <b>compliments.</b> The findings are discussed in relation to theoretical and methodological contributions for compliment studies as well as pragmatics research in general. Pedagogical implications are explored with respect to instruction in pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic knowledge as part of enhancing Taiwanese students' pragmatic knowledge and raising learners' pragmatic awareness of intralingual and social variations in pragmatic performance.

This research is a descriptive qualitative research. This research uses a socio-pragmatics approach. The technique of sampling used is total sampling. All conversations containing compliments and compliment responses were taken as data. Based on the data analysis, the researcher draws conclusions as follows: There are four types <b>of</b> topics <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> employed by the characters in the film entitled white chicks, namely, personal appearance, possession, general ability, and specific-act ability. Following Wolfson’s classification <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> functions, there are six functions <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> proposed by Wolfson found in this research, namely to affirm solidarity, to create or maintain rapport, to express admiration or approval, to encourage, to express positive evaluation, to strengthen or to replace other speech act formulas. Most of the addressees in the film entitled white chicks respond to the compliments by employing appreciation token. The appreciation token includes verbal and nonverbal acceptance. In verbal acceptance, the addressees deliver the word thanks to respond to the speaker’s compliment. Meanwhile, the addressees respond to the compliment by smiling in the non-verbal acceptance. Other compliment responses used by the addressees are comment acceptance, praise upgrade, down grade, reassignment, question and no acknowledgement. In the comment acceptance, the addressees accept the compliment and offer a relevant comment on the compliment. In the Praise upgrade, the addressee accepts and asserts insufficiently <b>of</b> the <b>compliment’s</b> force.

In response of question, the addressee questions the sincerity or the appropriateness <b>of</b> the speaker’s <b>compliment.</b> Finally, in No Acknowledgment, the addressees give no indication of having heard the compliment, shift the topic, and even give no response. Based on the conclusions above, the researcher hopes that this research will give a contribution to the students in studying the speech act <b>of</b> <b>compliments.</b> There are still many cases on the study <b>of</b> <b>compliments.</b> It is suggested to other researchers who are interested in compliment speech act to conduct a further research on compliment structure and its vocabulary. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the politeness strategies employed by Najdi Saudi Arabic speakers in giving {{and responding to}} compliments. Gender, age and relationship were hypothesized to influence features <b>of</b> <b>compliments</b> and compliment responses. A corpus <b>of</b> 592 <b>compliments</b> and compliment responses collected in natural contexts were analyzed. The researcher hypothesized that: a) gender influences the way men and women pay and respond to compliments; b) people of different age groups give and respond to compliments differently; and c) {{the relationship between the}} participants affects the strategies used in giving and responding to compliments. The results show that Najdi compliments draw on a limited number of syntactic patterns as well as a limited number of adjectives which makes Najdi complimenting formulaic. Najdi speakers are likely to implicitly accept the compliments. As for the interaction <b>of</b> <b>compliments</b> and compliment responses with social variables, the results reveal speaker-gender/age/social relationship contrasts. Compliments occurred more frequently among interlocutors of the same gender, age and social relationship. Men focused on personality and performance whereas the majority <b>compliments</b> <b>of</b> women’s <b>compliments</b> focused on appearance. Women’s compliments are lengthier than men’s. Women also used more invocation, appreciation tokens, praise upgrade, relationship and returned more compliments than men. In terms of the relationship between compliment topics and generations, the findings show that young and middle-aged speakers paid more compliments on appearance while the older group focused on personality and performance. Additionally, the middle-aged group and the older group used more non-acknowledgment than the young generation. Social relationships also play a role in complimenting behavior. Unfamiliar speakers paid more compliments on performance and their compliment responses contained primarily invocation and blessing. Though the speech act <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> is used frequently in everyday human interaction in Saudi culture, no study has investigated the nature <b>of</b> <b>compliments</b> as a speech act in Najdi Arabic. Because there has not been any attempt to uncover differences in the linguistic and semantic realizations <b>of</b> <b>compliments</b> and <b>compliment</b> responses <b>of</b> Najdi Saudis, there still exists a gap that needs to be filled in the cross-cultural study of speech acts.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine compliment responses among Jordanian university students. It aims to explore the use <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> responses among Jordanian, and investigate if there are any differences with regard to gender. The corpus consists <b>of</b> 611 <b>compliment</b> responses collected from 36 participants through an ethnographic (note-taking) method during the second semester of 2013 / 2014 academic session. This research adopted Herbert’s (1990) taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> response strategies to analyze the compliment responses. Results show that recipients used the agreement strategies more frequently than the other strategies. The findings also show although both males and females favored to use agreement strategies more than non agreement and other interpretation strategies, female students used agreement strategies more frequently than the male students. This may support the claim that males tend to interpret compliment as FTA. Females also preferred to use agreement strategies to respond to compliment offered by female than compliment offered by male. Compliment responses strategies are discussed in terms of gender. It can be concluded that the linguistic manipulations <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> responses shown in this study indicate that no one strategy <b>of</b> <b>compliment</b> responses would work because different genders have different sets of strategies, thereby preventing any valid generalization. The current study offered important differences in using compliment responses between genders...|$|R

Therefore, this pragmatic failure may specially be traced in the areas of speech acts. This paper investigates to explore the differences between the strategies <b>of</b> responses to <b>compliments</b> given by Iranian EFL students compared with Australian English speakers in terms of socio-cultural patterns. In line with the nature of the present research, a cross-cultural one, 30 Australian English speakers and 30 Iranian EFL students were given a questionnaire consisting of two parts, each of which was composed of 8 open-ended questions. Based on the Chi- square inferential statistics the collected data were analyzed and interpreted and the results were obtained. The overall results suggested that some strategies <b>of</b> <b>Compliment</b> Responses (CRs) are cultural-specific like request interpretation "Qabel-Nadare" (I am glad {{to give it to you}} as a gift) " in Iranian culture and that there were various strategies of CRs which were used for different purposes by Iranian EFL students and Australian English speakers...|$|R
