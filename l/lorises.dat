5|$|Exporting {{countries}} {{reported a}} total of 111 pygmy slow <b>lorises</b> traded internationally between 1977 and 2004, whereas importing countries reported 131 animals. In Laos, large numbers of native <b>lorises</b> are exported to Vietnam. In Japan, pet shops occasionally offer pygmy slow <b>lorises</b> for US$2,000–3,800 (€1,500–2,800).|$|E
5|$|Rehabilitation is {{available}} to some confiscated slow <b>lorises.</b> Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow <b>lorises</b> that have had their teeth removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow <b>lorises</b> are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow <b>lorises</b> {{as if they were}} from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow <b>lorises</b> to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow <b>lorises</b> are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow <b>lorises</b> are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow <b>lorises</b> prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow <b>lorises</b> from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow <b>lorises</b> were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as slender <b>lorises</b> (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most {{closely related to the}} slender <b>lorises</b> of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow <b>lorises</b> of today.|$|E
5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow <b>lorises</b> have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender <b>lorises,</b> their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow <b>lorises</b> are more stout.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow <b>lorises</b> have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow <b>lorises</b> are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow <b>lorises</b> include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet <b>lorises.</b> Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow <b>lorises</b> have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow <b>lorises</b> are also very stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet <b>lorises.</b> The diets of wild slow <b>lorises</b> are poorly understood. Signs of an inappropriate diet in captivity include tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are often sleeping when the nocturnal pet is normally awake.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow <b>lorises</b> still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow <b>lorises</b> are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow <b>lorises,</b> their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow <b>lorises</b> for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the most}} notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow <b>lorises</b> were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow <b>lorises</b> much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow <b>lorises</b> began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E
5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow <b>lorises</b> in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow <b>lorises</b> are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow <b>lorises</b> can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow <b>lorises</b> are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|In Japan alone, 39confiscations {{including}} 363live {{animals were}} made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During {{the same time}} period, Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358lorises destined for Japan. Details of several confiscations from smuggling attempts between Thailand and Japan have been reported by the IPPL, including one event on 2May 2007, where 40slow <b>lorises</b> were confiscated at Narita Airport only {{a month before the}} CITES conference that elevated the slow loris status to Appendix I. Twelve of those animals died. The deaths are not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow <b>lorises,</b> many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow <b>lorises</b> causes traders to smuggle more slow <b>lorises</b> than are needed to supply the market.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> are {{commonly}} used in traditional medicine across their geographic range, a practice that has been reported since at least 1900. Thousands of slow <b>lorises</b> are captured each year for such use. Many human factors drive the trade in slow loris parts, including social customs, economic factors, and traditional belief systems.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Zoo {{has also}} written {{husbandry}} manuals for slow <b>lorises,</b> promoted public awareness, conducted field surveys, and supported slow loris rescue facilities. The Vietnamese postal service recognized slow <b>lorises</b> on a postage stamp by using {{a picture of a}} Bengal slow loris and her infant published by the San Diego Zoo in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow <b>lorises,</b> is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow <b>lorises,</b> populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow <b>lorises</b> are particularly vulnerable {{because they tend to}} freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{beliefs and}} uses for slow <b>lorises</b> vary, and many {{practices}} {{appear to have}} deep roots going back at least 300years. Oral traditions suggest these practices go back even further. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of the island of Borneo believed that slow <b>lorises</b> were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow <b>lorises</b> are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow <b>lorises</b> because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow <b>lorises.</b> Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow <b>lorises</b> are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow <b>lorises</b> are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy <b>lorises</b> {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts may find it {{difficult}} to distinguish between the pygmy slow loris and the Sunda slow loris, as both have similarly reddish fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy <b>lorises</b> may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Populations of Bengal and Sunda slow <b>lorises</b> are not faring well in zoos. Of the 29captive {{specimens}} in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, {{while most}} are past their reproductive years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego. Pygmy slow <b>lorises</b> are doing better in North American zoos; {{from the late}} 1980s (when they were imported) to 2008, the population grew to 74 animals, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow <b>lorises</b> are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender <b>lorises,</b> the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow <b>lorises</b> have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow <b>lorises</b> can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of slow <b>lorises</b> are forward-facing, {{which gives}} stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow <b>lorises</b> have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow <b>lorises,</b> although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy <b>lorises</b> may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy <b>lorises</b> smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow <b>lorises</b> also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow <b>lorises</b> found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow <b>lorises</b> rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all <b>lorises.</b> Both slender and slow <b>lorises</b> have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> range across {{tropical}} and subtropical {{regions and}} {{are found in}} primary and secondary rainforests, as well as bamboo groves and mangrove forests. They prefer forests with high, dense canopies, although some species have also been found in disturbed habitats, such as cacao plantations and mixed-crop home gardens. Due largely to their nocturnal behavior and the subsequent difficulties in accurately quantifying abundance, data about the population size or distribution patterns of slow <b>lorises</b> is limited. In general, encounter rates are low; a combined analysis of several field studies involving transect surveys conducted in South and Southeast Asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0.74lorises per kilometer for N.coucang to as low as 0.05lorises per kilometer for N.pygmaeus.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as <b>lorises,</b> pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. <b>Lorises</b> are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E
5|$|Populations of slow loris species, {{such as the}} Bengal and Sunda slow loris, are not faring well in zoos. In 2011, the International Species Information System (ISIS) {{had only}} 11 and 53specimens (respectively) on file from {{reporting}} zoos worldwide. In North American zoos, for instance, several of the 29captive specimens in 2008 were hybrids that could not breed while most were past their reproductive years, and the last captive birth was in 2001 at the San Diego Zoo. Only three Javan slow <b>lorises</b> were kept in zoos in 2011 according to ISIS. Pygmy slow <b>lorises</b> are doing better, with 100specimens reported from zoos worldwide in 2011. In North American zoos, for instance, the population has grown to 74animals between {{the time they were}} imported in the late 1980s and 2008, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Slow <b>lorises</b> {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{are needed}} to {{determine}} existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow <b>lorises</b> {{because they are not}} adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. For successful reintroductions, connectivity between sites with low population density is considered ideal. Protected area extensions are also needed in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow <b>lorises,</b> however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow <b>lorises</b> remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow <b>lorises</b> be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding patterns on the chromosomes of all slow <b>lorises</b> are similar, this species may be distinguished from the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of nucleolus organizer regions.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris is traded {{mainly for}} its purported {{medicinal}} properties, for the pet trade, or, {{to a lesser}} extent, as food for local consumption. According to a 2003 report, the animals were sold for 30,000–50,000 Vietnamese đồng (US$1.50–2.50 or €1.10–1.80). Other reports have found them to cost US$2–10. In Cambodia, the species is used in Traditional Khmer Medicine. Surveys conducted at Cambodian markets showed that the species was the third most common mammal for sale, offered at prices ranging from US$0.85–6.25 (€0.65–4.70). In Vietnam, the pygmy slow loris is used for food, medicine, and often as a pet and {{is among the most}} frequently sold species. Formerly, hundreds of pygmy <b>lorises</b> were traded monthly in major markets, but recently numbers seem to have decreased, due to shortages in supply. In southern Vietnam, <b>lorises</b> are among the most popular wildlife dishes in wildlife meat restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by J. Lewis Bonhote in 1907. The description {{was based on}} a male specimen sent to him by J.Vassal, a French physician who had collected the specimen from Nha Trang, Vietnam (then called Annam, a French Protectorate) in 1905. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock combined all slow <b>lorises</b> into a single species, Nycticebus coucang.|$|E
