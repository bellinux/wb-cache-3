40|$|Purpose of this diploma {{thesis is}} a {{design of a}} {{compound}} tool for manufacturing the form shim. The form shim is made by shearing and bending technology from steel sheet 11 343. 1. Thickness is 2 mm. On {{the basis of a}} literary study and design calculations was designed the compound tool, which will manufacture this component by 4 actions on the automated line containing rewinder, feeding <b>levelling</b> <b>machine</b> and eccentric press with designed compound tool. Economic calculations show that the designed manufacturing is profitable...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{redesign}} and manufacture of a shovel for a pull-type land <b>levelling</b> <b>machine,</b> which, in its present condition, is used to get easily damaged even under low loads. Firstly, the maximum pulling load affecting the levelling shovel was experimentally determined. Then, stable-shovel system with the bolt connection was replaced with a bearing-shaft connection system. In this way, the new shovel has gained a capability of making oscillation motion {{so that it can}} operate on sloped grounds. CATIA program was used in the design studies. The shovel system was investigated by assembly structural stress analyses. This new construction enabled the system to operate 3 times more securely at maximum stress conditions without changing the levelling shovel material. Thus, it is managed to prevent any possible damages that might occur due to maximum loading conditions of the system. Besides, displacements that occur on the shovel decreased at the rate of 90 %...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation was {{worked on}} the theme " Project and {{surveying}} of the network for planimetry and hight points {{in the area of}} the river Jenín using several methods". Target of this dissertation was building of point field, their planimetry and altitude destination like basis for another telemetry in range. On the basis of geodetic and map data was effected reconnaissance of the area, estimation of current point field, their completion to required density and locating new points by geodetic and GPS methods. It was built net of 16 points of the detailed planimetry point field and eight of them was subjekt of my dissertation. For planimetry and altitude survey by GPS method was used Trimble 4600 LS device. By geodetic method points was located by electronic total station Leica TCR 407 power. Altitude of the three points was determined by the technical levelling using <b>levelling</b> <b>machine</b> Topcon AT { [...] } 22 A and the other hights of points was calculated trigonometrically. Part of dissertation was processing of surveyed data, execution of graphic enclosure and comparing both methods...|$|E
50|$|An engineer's {{spirit level}} (or machinist's level) is {{generally}} used to <b>level</b> <b>machines,</b> {{although they may}} also be used to level large workpieces on machines such as planers. Using gravity as a reference and checking a machine's axis of travel at several points, the level is used to ensure the machine's axis is straight. A perfectly <b>level</b> <b>machine</b> does not actually need to be achieved, unless the particular manufacturing process requires it. Spirit levels are also used in building construction by carpenters and masons.|$|R
40|$|A {{brief summary}} of the Hierarchical Development Methodology (HDM) is provided. The design of a system is {{decomposed}} into a hierarchy of abstract machines, linearly ordered with a different abstract <b>machine</b> at each <b>level</b> in the hierarchy. Each abstract machine in the hierarchy is dependent only on the functionality of lower <b>level</b> <b>machines.</b> The facilities of the highest <b>level</b> abstract <b>machine,</b> and only those of that machine, are visible to a user of the system. A machine is itself decomposed into modules, each module having operations and data structures which typically define a single abstract data concept. As in the Parnas module concept, the module is the programming unit of HDM; each of the modules may be independently implemented. The programs implementing a module can access the data structures of their own abstract machine, but not those of lower <b>level</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sheet metals {{often have}} {{flatness}} defects {{which are usually}} combined with internal stresses. Flatness defects as well as internal stresses are undesirable because they make the further treatment more difficult and deteriorate {{the quality of the}} sheet metal. Roller levelling is a wide-spread method to minimize flatness defects and internal stresses by repreated forming under bending conditions. This thesis presents a numerical model to simulate the forming operation at roller levelling. A bilinear material law is used which allows to investigate kinematic and isotropic material hardening. The deformed shaps of the elastic-plastic structure of the sheet in the <b>levelling</b> <b>machine</b> is evaluated by the use of an iterative process. Contact conditions between the rollers and the sheet are satisfied by a superposed iterative algorithm. The different positions of the rollers and the flatness defect of the sheet metal are taken as boundary conditions. Besides the internal stresses of the sheet metal are considered. Furthermore an optimization problem is formulated to get better levelling results. This optimization problem is solved by combining the process model with an optimization algorithm. Configurations which lead to optimized results within the meaning of minimum internal stresses and residual bend are calculated. Especially the feed motions of the rollers for those configurations can be determined. These results enable an extensive automization of the levelling process using predetermined feed motions.
