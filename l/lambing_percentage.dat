50|$|The {{live weight}} of a mature Border Leicester ram {{will be in the}} range of 140 - 175 kg and a mature ewe 90 - 120 kg. A {{yearling}} ewe is around 64 kg. Their white wool tends to be very long and by Merino standards, broad crimped, and in fineness about 32 to 38 microns, and is used for medium to heavy weight garments. This wool, though, is prized by spinners because of the crimp and lustre. The sheep are normally shorn twice a year when the wool has reached a length of around 100 mm. Lambs when shorn have an average of 1.8 kg of wool; yearlings have a larger body and can have as much as 3.2 kg at each shearing. The U.S., Australian and New Zealand Border Leicesters very rarely sport the extreme of British flocks. All strains of Border Leicesters are known for their docility.

40|$|Recent {{development}} in automatic sheep management systems based on radio frequency tags, in-race readers and automatic drafting equipment creates opportunities for strategic nutritional management of individual animals. This paper describes a simple simulation model for investigating {{the implications of}} different supplementary feeding systems in terms of potential benefits of increased lambing percentages. Four different feeding systems are compared: (i) feeding each animal according to its individual requirements to reach a weight of 52 kg prior to joining; (ii) feeding 0. 3 kg daily to each animal; (iii) feeding {{the same amount of}} feed as in (ii) but given twice per week to the whole group; and (iv) as for (iii), but with variation in intake randomly allocated across all weight ranges. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was set at 8 : 1 for twice weekly feeding and at 5 : 1 for daily feeding. Although the highest <b>lambing</b> <b>percentage</b> was achieved using the feeding system in scenario (i), the most profitable feeding regime was (ii). The results confirm that feeding restricted amounts of supplement twice weekly may not be a cost-effective way of increasing ovulation rate and <b>lambing</b> <b>percentage.</b> On the other hand, precision nutrition, in conjunction with electronic sheep management systems, may increase efficiency and profitability of the ewe flock. Although the current study deals only with lambing rate, it is likely that precision nutrition may be cost-effective in managing ewe nutrition prior to lambing. New methods of feeding management and feed preparation may be needed to get the most value from computer-based feed management systems...|$|E
30|$|Longstanding English upland farming systems {{comprise}} {{sheep and}} beef-rearing enterprises which {{make use of}} the varied contours and conditions found in these landscapes. The exposed moorland and enclosed land on the higher slopes is mainly used to rear breeding stock – hardy hill breeds of sheep and cattle, and on Exmoor, native ponies. The majority of the ewes in a hardy sheep flock are crossed with less hardy but bigger breeds to produce crossbreed flocks. Traditionally (certainly since the mid- 20 th century), the majority of half-hardy ewes would be sold to lowland farmers as breeding stock, and the male lambs sold as ‘stores’ to be fattened on lower, more productive land. If there is sufficient lower enclosed land (often called in-bye land) available, an upland farm may also run its own cross-bred flock which is more productive than the hill breeds (as measured in both <b>lambing</b> <b>percentages</b> and carcass weights).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a survey {{conducted}} in the hill-country of the Wairarapa in May-June 1972. The object of the survey was to provide information on the management practices that farmers were using {{in relation to the}} aim of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of increasing lambing percentages in the area. In Chapter Four, extensive review of literature is presented on factors affecting lambing percentages. This review is divided into two sections, the first relating to the management of the f 1 ock throughout the year, and the second relating to breeding management, in particular, selection, culling and crossbreeding. Data collected in the survey is presented in Chapters Five and Six. Chapter Five presents physical data on the survey farms, and Chapter Six presents data on management policies and practices employed on the survey farms. In Chapter Seven, some analysis is attempted of the reiationships between the data presented in Chapters Five and Six, and lambing percentages. The small nunbers of survey farms (2 O) and the wide range of factors affecting <b>lambing</b> <b>percentage,</b> precludes any precise statistical analysis, but trends are observed and discussed. Chapter Eight presents an in-depth study of two case farms, based on two of the survey farms. Physical data, present production and present management practices of these two farms are presented, fol 1 owed by recommendations for management changes which could increase lambing percentages. These recommendations are {{made on the basis of}} the literature review, the results achieved on other survey farms, and the resources available on the case farms.

40|$|The Canterbury farmer depends to a {{great degree}} upon {{supplementary}} greenfeeds {{as part of the}} diet of sheep and dairy cows, but the actual extent to which he is dependent upon them is seldom fully realised until the occurrence of a very dry period. For instance, the low <b>lambing</b> <b>percentages</b> and high mortality in the Spring of 1933 can be attributed in general to defective or unbalanced nutrition arising from feed shortage. This feed shortage occurred in the Autumn and Spring of that year. Both seasons were dry, and supplementary greenfeed crops were very much reduced in production. Had there been ample and better balanced, greenfeeds for Autumn and Spring flushing and for lambing, more lambs would have been born and more would have survived. The question now arises as to whether, in the establishment of permanent pastures, sufficient greenfeed is not thereby provided so that ordinary temporary greenfeeds may be largely dispensed with, or at least, reduced in area with advantage. It is the object of this paper to discuss this question and to show that new permanent grass can provide: at least a part of the greenfeed ration...|$|R
30|$|The {{domestication}} {{of plant}} and animal species has historically centred very much on exploiting favourable interactions between genetic improvement and management inputs, with domesticated stocks requiring but rewarding intensified management inputs. A classic example of favourable, synergistic interactions in plant breeding is afforded by the dwarf wheats of the “Green Revolution” which began in Mexico in the 1950 s. These wheats could respond very well to increased fertiliser, with greatly increased yields (Borlaug 1970), whereas such fertiliser inputs made the more traditional long-strawed wheats prone to lodging which would vitiate their yield potential. (Admittedly, a question now exists over the long-term sustainability of such fertiliser use, but it is not seen as detracting from the illustrative value of this example.) In animal breeding, a good example exists in breeding for improved reproductive performance in sheep in New Zealand (Young 2015), boosting <b>lambing</b> <b>percentages</b> with twins and triplets instead of mainly single lambs. That can mean much improved meat production from the same, or even fewer, capital stock (see Figure 8 in Cocks and Brown 2005). But it does depend for its practical success on providing benign farm conditions with reliable and plentiful supplies of high-quality feed (Burton n.d.), so almost all the lambs can survive and prosper.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from shepherding to fencing in colonial Australia was a technological revolution replacing labour with capital. Fencing {{could not be}} widespread in Australia until an historical conjunction of technological, social and economic changes: open camping of sheep (from about 1810), effective poisoning of dingoes with strychnine (from the mid- 1840 s), introduction of iron wire (1840 s), better land tenure (from 1847), progressive reduction of Aboriginal populations, huge demand for meat (from 1851) and high wages (from 1851). Labour shortages in the gold-rushes of the early 1850 s were the final trigger, but all the other changes were essential precursors. Available data are {{used to test the}} alleged benefits of fencing: a higher wool cut per head; an increased carrying capacity; savings in wages and the running costs of stations; less disease in flocks; larger sheep; higher <b>lambing</b> <b>percentages,</b> and use of land unsuitable for shepherding. Many of the benefits were real, but some cannot be verified. By the mid- 1880 s, over ninety-five per cent of sheep in New South Wales were in paddocks, wire fences were spreading rapidly, and the cost of fences was falling. However, shepherding persisted in remote northern areas of Australia until well into the twentieth century. 20 page(s...|$|R
