5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> found no protective effect.|$|E

5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E

A <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> started by Franciszek Piper used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths, a figure adopted as official by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in the 1990s. Piper stated that a figure of as many as 1.5 million total deaths was possible.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E

25|$|In 1935 Claus Jungeblut {{reported}} that vitamin C treatment inactivates the polio virus in vitro, making it non-infectious when injected into monkeys. In 1937, Jungeblut injected polio into {{the brains of}} monkeys, and found that many more monkeys that also received vitamin C escaped paralysis than controls - the results seemed to indicate that low doses were more effective than high doses. A subsequent study by Jungeblut demonstrated that polio infected monkeys had lower vitamin C levels than others, and that the monkeys that escaped paralysis had the highest vitamin C levels. Jungeblut subsequently confirmed his findings in a <b>larger</b> <b>study,</b> finding that natural vitamin C was more effective than synthetic vitamin C, and as the disease progressed, larger and larger amounts of vitamin C were needed for therapeutic effect.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mitochondrial}} DNA perspective, haplogroup H, {{which has}} high incidence (≈40%) throughout Europe, has received similar attention. Early studies by Richards et al (2000) {{suggested that it}} arose 28–23 kya (thousand years ago), spreading into Europe ≈20kya, before then re-expanding from an Iberian glacial refuge ≈15 kya, calculations subsequently corroborated by Pereira et al. (2005). However, a <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> by Roostalu et al. (2007), incorporating more data from the Near East, suggested that whilst Hg H did begin to expand kya, this {{was limited to the}} Near East, Caucasus and Southeastern Europe. Rather its subsequent spread further west occurred later, in the post-glacial period from a postulated South Caucasian refugium. This hypothesis has been supported by a recent ancient DNA analysis study, which links the expansion of mtDNA Hg H in Western Europe with the Bell Beaker phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Vaginally dosed {{progesterone}} {{is being}} investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women {{with a history of}} preterm birth. According to a recent study, women with a short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day {{during the second half of}} a pregnancy. A subsequent and <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data in this trial showed that women with a short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care.|$|E

25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} dental amalgam on babies in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. A <b>larger</b> <b>study,</b> consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among the study group, 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term. These women had little to no difference in infant birth weight compared to the women whom did not undergo amalgam restoration during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of another modality of treatment {{is referred to}} as adjuvant (literally helping) therapy, compared to its use as the initial (primary) therapy, also referred to as radical therapy. Consequently, many of these patients have been treated with adjuvant radiation, with or without chemotherapy. In the above series of reports of minimally invasive surgery, many (30–80%) patients received adjuvant radiation. However, functional outcomes were worse if radiation was added to surgery and worst if both radiation and chemotherapy were used. Radiation dosage has largely followed that derived for all head and neck cancers, in this setting, based on risk. Historically only one randomised clinical trial has addressed optimal dosage, allocated patients to two dosage levels, stratified by risk, but showed no difference in cancer control between the low and high doses (63 and 68.4Gy), but a higher incidence of complications at the higher doses. Consequently, the lower dose of 57.6Gy was recommended. Because the authors used a fractionation scheme of 1.8Gy per treatment, this dosage was not widely adopted, practitioners preferring a larger fraction of 2Gy to produce a shorter treatment time, and a slightly higher dose of 60Gy in 2Gy fractions (30 daily treatments). Yet 57.6Gy in 1.8Gy fractions is equivalent (iso-effective dose) to only 56Gy in 2Gy fractions. 60Gy corresponds to the 63Gy used as the low dose in the high risk group. 60Gy was also the dose used in RTOG 73-03. Subsequently, there was a tendency to intensify treatment in head and neck cancer, and a number of centres adopted a dose of 66Gy, at least for those patients with adverse tumour features. The effectiveness of PORT in HPV+OPC receives some support from a cohort study (Level 2b), although the number of patients was low, and the number of events (recurrent disease or death) only 7%. Another retrospective population-level study (Level 4) of the SEER database (1998–2011) concluded that there was an overall survival but not disease-specific survival effect of radiation in 410 patients with a single lymph node involved, but used only univariate statistical analysis and contained no information on HPV status. A subsequent much <b>larger</b> <b>study</b> on a similar population in the National Cancer Database (2004–2013) of over 9,000 patients found a survival advantage but this was only in HPV-OPC, not in 410 HPV+OPC patients.|$|E
