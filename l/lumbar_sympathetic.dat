40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} in vitro from {{two hundred and}} twenty post-ganglionic neurones of {{the fourth and fifth}} lumbar paravertebral ganglia of cats. Thirty-seven percent of neurones tested evoked antidromic responses during electrical stimulation of post-ganglionic fibres in the inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves. Twenty-seven percent of neurones tested evoked antidromic responses during electrical stimulation of post-ganglionic fibres in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain. Twenty-four percent of neurones tested evoked convergent antidromic responses during electrical stimulation of post-ganglionic fibres in separate inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves or <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain, and by inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain. Eighty-six percent of paravertebral post-ganglionic fibres which project to the inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves or <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain were composed of B fibres with maximal conduction velocities ranging from above 2. 0 to 16. 0 m/s. Fourteen percent of post-ganglionic fibres were composed of C fibres with maximal conduction velocities ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 0 m/s. Synaptic responses of neurones were recorded intracellularly during electrical stimulation of preganglionic fibres in inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves, lumbar white rami communicantes and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain located one to three segments above the fourth and fifth lumbar ganglia and one to two segments below. Synaptic responses consisting of excitatory post-synaptic potentials and action potentials were mediated via nicotinic receptors. Twenty-seven percent of neurones tested received synaptic input from only one or two segments of the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain. Seventy-three percent of neurones tested received convergent synaptic input from one or two segments of the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain, lumbar white rami communicantes and inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves. It is concluded that central preganglionic fibres which project to inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves also project to the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain to innervate neurones in the L 4 and L 5 ganglia. Synaptic responses of neurones during electrical stimulation of preganglionic fibres in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain and in the inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves were reduced in a chronic isolated segment of the sympathetic chain devoid of central preganglionic inputs. It is concluded that synaptic responses elicited in neurones during electrical stimulation of inferior lumbar splanchnic nerves and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain were mediated in part via collaterals of central preganglionic axons and in part via axons whose cell bodies were located in the periphery.

The current study tested the hypothesis that an impairment in cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex function exists in SHR-S before NaCl loading. The reflex response to volume expansion was compared in SHR-S, NaCI-resistant SHR (SHR-R), and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on a normal NaCl diet. Conscious, free-moving SHR-S, SHR-R, WKY, and Sprague-Dawley rats were volume expanded with whole blood to 15 % of blood volume within 6 minutes, and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity were recorded. Heart rate and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity decreased significantly in SHR-R, WKY, and Sprague-Dawley rats after volume expansion. In contrast, in SHR-S neither heart rate after volume expansion nor <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity was significantly different from levels before volume expansion.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the baroreflex control of <b>lumbar</b> and renal <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity (SNA) in conscious rats. Arterial pressure (AP) and lumbar and renal SNA were simultaneously recorded in six freely behaving rats. Pharmacological estimates of <b>lumbar</b> and renal <b>sympathetic</b> baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) {{were obtained by}} means of the sequential intravenous administration of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Sympathetic BRS was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower for lumbar [3. 0 ± 0. 4 normalized units (NU) /mmHg] than for renal (7. 6 ± 0. 6 NU/mmHg) SNA. During a 219 -min baseline period, spontaneous lumbar and renal BRS were continuously assessed by computing the gain of the transfer function relating AP and SNA at heart rate frequency over consecutive 61. 4 -s periods. The transfer gain was considered only when coherence between AP and SNA significantly differed from zero, which was verified in 99 ± 1 and 96 ± 3 % of cases for lumbar and renal SNA, respectively. When averaged over the entire baseline period, spontaneous BRS was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower for lumbar (1. 3 ± 0. 2 NU/mmHg) than for renal (2. 3 ± 0. 3 NU/mmHg) SNA. For both SNAs, spontaneous BRS showed marked fluctuations (variation coefficients were 26 ± 2 and 28 ± 2 % for lumbar and renal SNA, respectively). These fluctuations were positively correlated in five of six rats (R = 0. 44 ± 0. 06; n = 204 ± 8; P < 0. 0001). We conclude that in conscious rats, the baroreflex control of lumbar and renal SNA shows quantitative differences but is modulated in a mostly coordinated way. PublishedN/...|$|R

By varying the volume or location of the glutamate microinjections, we also identified individual examples of differential and selective activation of these nerves. Decreases in arterial pressure or bilateral blockade of RVLM GABAA receptors also revealed differential activation, with the latter having a 3 - to 4 -fold greater effect on sympathetic activity.

In this study, we systematically determined the effects on both autonomic and respiratory outflows, as well as reflex function, following acute and repeated administration of METH, which enhances behavioural responses. Arterial pressure, heart rate, phrenic nerve discharge amplitude and frequency, <b>lumbar</b> and splanchnic <b>sympathetic</b> nerve discharge, interscapular brown adipose tissue and core temperatures, and expired CO₂ were measured in urethane-anaesthetised male Sprague-Dawley rats. Novel findings include potent increases in central inspiratory drive and frequency that are not dependent on METH-evoked increases in expired CO₂ levels. Increases in non-shivering thermogenesis correlate with well-described increases in body temperature and heart rate. Unexpectedly, METH evoked minor effects on both sympathetic outflows and mean arterial pressure. METH modified cardiorespiratory reflex function in response to hypoxia, hypercapnia and baroreceptor unloading. Chronically METH-treated rats failed to exhibit changes in baseline sympathetic, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic parameters.

In both preparations guanethidine and bretylium in appropriate dosage specifically blocked the inhibitory effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation while leaving the response to parasympathetic nerve stimulation and to acetylcholine unaltered: the response to noradrenaline was unaltered or potentiated. In the ileum, after the addition of guanethidine or of bretylium, the inhibitory response to periarterial nerve stimulation was replaced in every preparation by a motor response which had the same frequency sensitivity as parasympathetic nerves. In the colon a motor response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was rarely obtained after blocking the inhibitory response. When such a motor response was uncovered it had similar characteristics to the motor response in the ileum. Furthermore, if the parasympathetic nerves were stimulated for prolonged periods both the parasympathetic and sympathetic motor responses were reduced. These results do not support the idea that post-ganglionic sympathetic nerves to the intestine are generally cholinergic and are themselves responsible for the motor responses.

Methods: From 1992 to 2000, 73 patients with RSD underwent 46 video-assisted thoracoscopic (first to fourth thoracic ganglion) or 37 surgical lumbar (first to fourth <b>lumbar</b> ganglion) <b>sympathetic</b> chain resections. The patients were referred from multidisciplinary pain clinics with documented sympathetically maintained pain syndrome on the basis of reproducible more than 50 % reduction in pain severity score (0, no pain; 10, most severe pain imaginable) for more than 2 days after sympathetic block therapy. The mean duration of the RSD symptoms before sympathectomy was 26 ± 14 months (range, 6 to 100 months). Postoperative pain severity score, limb disability, and overall patient satisfaction were assessed by an independent third-party observer at a mean follow-up period of 30 months. Results: No operative mortality or serious morbidity (Horner's syndrome, bleeding that needed transfusion, wound infection) occurred. Transient (< 3 -month) postprocedural sympathalgia developed in one third of the patients for cervicodorsal sympathectomy and 20 % of the patients for lumbar sympathectomy and was treated effectively with trigger point/proximal ganglion block therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. At 3 months after sympathectomy, 10 % of the patients had conditions that were judged treatment failures with no reduction in pain severity or limb disability. The remaining patients testified to more than 50 % pain reduction, with pain severity scores decreasing from a mean of 8. 7 before surgery to 3. 4 after sympathectomy. At 1 year, one quarter of the patients had continued significant pain relief (pain severity score, < 3) and an additional 50 % of the patients indicated continued but reduced pain severity and an increase in daily/work activities. Overall, patient satisfaction (willingness to have procedure again, benefit from sympathectomy) was 77 % and was not significantly influenced by patient age, RSD duration/stage, or extremity involvement (lumbar, 84 %; cervicodorsal, 72 %). Conclusion: Patients with RSD with a confirmed sympathetically maintained pain syndrome can realize long-term benefit from surgical sympathectomy. Procedural efficacy was similar for both upper limb and lower limb RSD syndromes, although the level of pain reduction did deteriorate with time.

Inhibition of the PVN significantly decreased RSNA in 48 h water-deprived rats but not in 24 h water-deprived or control rats (48 h, − 17 ± 4 %; 24 h, − 2 ± 5 %; control, 4 ± 6 %; P < 0. 05). In addition, injection of muscimol significantly decreased LSNA in 48 and 24 h water-deprived rats but not in control rats (48 h, − 41 ± 4 %; 24 h, − 14 ± 6 %; control, − 3 ± 2 %; P < 0. 05). Interestingly, the decrease in LSNA was significantly greater than the decrease in RSNA of 24 and 48 h water-deprived rats (P < 0. 05). Inhibition of the PVN also significantly decreased MAP to a greater extent in 48 and 24 h water-deprived rats compared to control rats (48 h, − 34 ± 5 mmHg; 24 h, − 26 ± 4 mmHg; control, − 15 ± 3 mmHg; P < 0. 05). When 48 h water-deprived rats were acutely rehydrated by giving access to tap water 2 h before experiments, inhibition of the PVN with muscimol did not alter LSNA (− 12 ± 8 %) or RSNA (7 ± 4 %) but did produce a small decrease in MAP (− 15 ± 4 mmHg) that was not different from control rats. In a parallel set of experiments, acute rehydration of 48 h water-deprived rats significantly attenuated the increased Fos immunoreactivity in PVN neurones that project to the spinal cord or rostral ventrolateral medulla.

Scislo Major:		Physiology Degree:	Doctor of Philosophy Adenosine is an {{important}} neuromodulator of cardiovascular control {{at the level of}} the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) where cardiovascular and other autonomic reflexes are primarily integrated. Levels of adenosine increase in the NTS during life threatening hypotension, ischemia and hypoxia. Adenosine may modulate cardiovascular reflexes to correct hemodynamic imbalance, acting via A 1 and A 2 a receptors which inhibit and facilitate neurotransmitter release, respectively. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that NTS A 1 adenosine receptors inhibit the arterial baroreflex whereas A 2 a receptors do not reset baroreflex control of regional sympathetic outputs, although stimulation of these receptors decreases renal (RSNA) increases preganglionic adrenal (pre-ASNA) and does not alter <b>lumbar</b> (LSNA) <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity. Cardiopulmonary chemoreflex (CCR), also known as Bezold-Jarisch reflex, triggered by various chemicals inhaled or released during myocardial ischemia, may have beneficial effects when it decreases afterload and heart rate thus decreasing oxygen demand. However, strong activation of the CCR may cause severe bradycardia and hypotension leading to hypoperfusion of vital organs, fainting and even death. During this severe reflex hypotension adenosine may be release into NTS. Then adenosine may inhibit the reflex to regain hemodynamic balance. A 1 adenosine receptors likely inhibit glutamatergic transmission the CCR pathway as they inhibit the arterial baroreflex mediated via similar medullary pathways and transmitters. Interestingly, preliminary data showed that NTS A 2 a facilitatory receptors also inhibit the CCR. Therefore I hypothesized that adenosine operating via both receptor subtypes may act as negative feedback regulator for CCR control of regional sympathetic outputs acting via two different mechanisms: A 1 receptors mediated direct inhibition and A 2 a receptor mediated facilitation of release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (most likely GABA) which in turn inhibits the CCR pathway. Since both NTS A 1 and A 2 a adenosine receptors exert differential effects on regional sympathetic outputs I anticipated that the inhibition of CCR control of regional sympathetic outputs will be also regionally specific. In urethane-chloralose-anesthetized rats I compared regional reflex sympathoinhibition evoked by activation of cardiopulmonary receptors with intra-atrial injections of phenylbiguanide (1 - 8 microg/kg) before and after stimulation of NTS A 1 and A 2 a adenosine receptors via microinjections into the NTS of N 6 cyclopentyl adenosine (0. 33 - 330 pmol/ 50 nl) and CGS 21680 (0. 2 - 20 pmol/ 50 nl), respectively. The comparisons were made also following nonselective blockade of A 1 and A 2 a receptors ((8 -(p-sulfofenyl) theophyline, 1 nmol/ 100 nl)) and selective blockade of A 2 a receptors (ZM- 2143285, 40 pmol/ 100 nl) and following respective volume controls. Gradual stimulation of both A 1 and A 2 a adenosine receptors located in the NTS caused similar dose dependent inhibition of hemodynamic and regional sympathetic responses. The inhibition was independent of differential effects of adenosine receptor subtypes in regional sympathetic activity suggesting that these two effects are mediated via different mechanisms in the NTS. Blockade of adenosine receptor subtypes did not affect the CCR showing that under normal conditions adenosine levels are too low to affect the reflex. Blockade of GABAA receptors in the NTS (Bicuculline, 10 pmol/ 100 nl) removed A 2 a receptor mediated inhibition of the reflex whereas blockade of GABAB receptors (SCH- 50911, 1 nmol/ 100 nl) attenuated the A 2 a receptor mediated inhibition to a lesser extent. I found also that GABA operating via GABAA but not GABAB receptors exerts small, but significant tonic inhibition of the CCR. In addition, simultaneous recordings from the three sympathetic outputs showed that CCR differentially inhibits regional sympathetic outputs (RSNA 3 ̆epre-ASNA 3 ̆eLSNA); this observation clarified inconsistent reports on CCR control of these sympathetic outputs. I conclude that adenosine may act as a negative feedback regulator of the CCR control of neural and hemodynamic variables. NTS A 1 receptors directly inhibit glutamatergic transmission in the reflex pathway, whereas A 2 a receptors facilitate release of GABA which inhibits the CCR pathway mostly via GABAA receptors...|$|R
40|$|Retrograde tracing with Fluoro-Gold (FG) {{was used}} to {{identify}} the complete population of knee joint sympathetic postganglionic efferents in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain of adult female Wistar rats. In 6 rats, the total number and distribution of FG-labelled neurons in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain was determined.

Immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), somatostatin (SS) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) revealed that 33 % of knee joint sympathetic afferents contained TH, 42 % contained VIP, and none contained somatostatin. Retrograde tracing with FG provided accurate and reproducible labelling of the joint-innervating subpopulation of sympathetic efferent neurons. This model lends itself to the further study of the molecular responses of this neuronal population in the various disorders and conditions affecting joints...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{vasodilatation}} achieved by various diagnostic methods (arterial occlusion, ganglionic block established by certain agents, <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> block, spinal anesthesia, and indirect heating) was studied {{by means of}} the pneumo-plethysmogram as well as through readings of skin temperature and skin resistance. The data obtained were interpreted as to their value in determining the type of patient with vascular disease for whom lumbar sympathectomy would be of noticeable benefit. Arterial occlusion proved itself a rapid and simple method which in most patients produced satisfactory results. As a rule, lumbar sympathectomy was effective in patients who preoperatively had shown a positive response upon release of arterial occlusion. A negative response, that is, absence of significant increase in blood flow, does not necessarily indicate organic disease, and cannot be taken to mean that lumbar sympathectomy would always be ineffective. Ganglionic block, using 2. 6 dimethyl piperidinium bromide or tetraethylammonium ion, was generally less reliable in indicating the probable results of sympathectomy than <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> block or indirect heating. <b>Lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> block with procaine was followed by a greater increase in skin temperature and blood flow than spinal anesthesia, and permitted far more accurate conclusions as to the probable outcome of sympathectomy. Subsequent to indirect heating the plethysmogram showed characteristic differences depending on the degree of vascular disease present. From the effect of this simple, safe and painless method upon the relative blood flow to the toe it becomes possible to arrive at a comparatively accurate estimate of the clinical benefit to be expected from lumbar sympathectomy...|$|E

40|$|Physiologists {{have known}} for many years that <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> {{stimulation}} caused inhibition of motor activity in the colon together with contraction of the internal sphincter ani (1) (2). No direct application of this knowledge {{to the treatment of}} Hirschsprung's disease was however attempted until Royle observed marked improve-ment in the obstinate constipation of spastic paralytic patients after interrupting the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> connections (3). Hunter studied the problem in the laboratory (4). Their clinical and experimental experiences that improved motor function of an inert colon followed the removal of the sympathetic influence, furnished the basis for testing the effect of a similar procedure in the treatment of congenital idio-pathic dilatation of the colon. This condition had long been sus-pected of having a neurogenic basis (5) (6). But not until the relief of it achieved by Wade and Royle (7) through <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ramisection, was there any convincing evidence that the extrinsic nervous mechanism of the bowel was etiologically involved. Besides this original case, the results of interrupting the sympathetic pathways to the colon have been recorded in six others of Hirsch-sprung's disease. Wade (8) operated upon four of these patients and Judd and Adson (9) reported two. We are sure that some others have been treated in this way but the results are not available as yet in the literature. In five of the seven cases the results have been eminently successful, while in two they have been unsatisfactory. The failure to obtain uniform results raises the question, in a given case of megalo-colon what effect will be obtained by operative interruption of its sympathetic innervation.

40|$|Background: Dystonia musculorum (dt) is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary neuropathy with a characteristic uncoordinated movement and {{is caused by}} a defect in the bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG 1) gene. The neural isoform of BPAG 1 is expressed in various neurons, including those in the central and peripheral nerve systems of mice. However, most previous studies on neuronal degeneration in BPAG 1 -deficient mice focused on peripheral sensory neurons and only limited investigation of the autonomic system has been conducted. Methods: In this study, patterns of nerve innervation in cutaneous and iridial tissues were examined using general neuronal marker protein gene product 9. 5 via immunohistochemistry. To perform quantitative analysis of the autonomic neuronal number, neurons within the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and parasympathetic ciliary ganglia were calculated. In addition, autonomic neurons were cultured from embryonic dt/dt mutants to elucidate degenerative patterns in vitro. Distribution patterns of neuronal intermediate filaments in cultured autonomic neurons were thoroughly studied under immunocytochemistry and conventional electron microscopy. Results: Our immunohistochemistry results indicate that peripheral sensory nerves and autonomic innervation of sweat glands and irises dominated degeneration in dt/dt mice. Quantitative results confirmed that the number of neurons was significantly decreased in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia {{as well as in the}} parasympathetic ciliar...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> {{nerves and}} supraspinal {{mechanism}} in the defecation reflex was investigated in 30 adult cats and 6 kittens. One or two propulsive contractions, whose mean pressure evoked was more than about 90 cmH 2 O (adult cats) and 50 cmH 2 O (kittens), were induced in the rectum of all animals by rectal distension. These propulsive contractions could be generated at the descending and the transverse colons. The removal of the supraspinal influence by spinal transection at T 13 or removal of pelvic afferents to the supraspinal center by spinal transection at L abolished the propulsive contractions. Successive lumbar sympathectomy restored the contractions. Lumbar sympathectomy and the successive removal of the supraspinal influence {{did not affect the}} propulsive contractions. In both cases, the final exclusion of the sacral segments by pithing of the spinal cord abolished the propulsive contractions. These results suggest that the sacral excitatory reflex mediated via pelvic nerves and the lumbar inhibitory reflex mediated via <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerves can function during rectal distension in spinal cats and that the lumbar inhibitory reflex is suppressed by the supraspinal sympathetic inhibitory reflex activated by pelvic afferents in intact cats, as in guinea pigs, resulting in propulsive contractions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate, in Wistar rats, the effect of high- or low-salt diet on the hemodynamic parameters and on the renal and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity. the renal gene expression of the renin angiotensin system components was also evaluated, aiming to find some correlation between salt intake, sodium homeostasis and blood pressure increase. Male Wistar rats received low (0. 06 % Na, TD 92141 -Harlan Teklad), a normal (0. 5 % Na, TD 92140), or a high-salt diet (3. 12 % Na, TD 92142) from weaning to adulthood. Hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, and the renal and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity were determined (n= 45). Plasma renin activity, plasma and renal content of angiotensin (ANG) I and II, and the renal mRNA expression of angiotensinogen, renin, AT 1 and AT 2 receptors were also measured (n = 24). Compared to normal- and low-salt diet-, high-salt-treated rats were hypertensive and developed an increase (P < 0. 05) in total peripheral resistance and <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity. A decrease in renal renin and angiotensinogen-mRNAs and in plasma ANG II and plasma renin activity was also found in salt overloaded animals. the renal sympathetic nerve activity was higher (P < 0. 05) in low-compared to high-salt-treated rats, and was associated with an increase (P < 0. 05) in renal ANG I and II and with a decrease (P < 0. 05) in AT 2 renal mRNA. Plasma ANG I and II and plasma renin activity were higher in low-than in normal-salt rats. Our results show that increased blood pressure is associated with increases in <b>lumbar</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity and total peripheral resistance in high-salt-treated rats. However, in low-salt-treated rats an increase in the renal sympathetic nerve was correlated with an increase in the renal content of ANG I and II and with a decrease in AT 2 renal mRNA. These changes are probably in favor of the antinatriuretic response and the sodium homeostasis in the low-salt group. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
