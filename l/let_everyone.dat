Only 8 weeks to go, the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and want to make this announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there.

Amphipolis surrendered, despite protests from Eucles. Thucydides arrived at the nearby port of Eion on the same day the city surrendered, and defended it with help from those who had left Amphipolis.

During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone.

Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E

Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip."

After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

500|$|Waters' {{lyrics to}} The Dark Side of the Moon {{dealt with the}} {{pressures}} of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it [...] "an exhortation... to embrace the positive and reject the negative." [...] Reisch described The Wall as [...] "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness." [...] The Wall protagonist, Pink, is unable {{to deal with the}} circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is [...] "crazy, over the rainbow". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: [...] "have I been guilty all this time?" [...] Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has <b>let</b> <b>everyone</b> down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for [...] "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, [...] "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, in the {{prevailing}} cyber-libertarian {{discourse of the}} internet [58] it is often forgotten that although the internet liberates communication by <b>letting</b> <b>everyone</b> be a publisher it also opens up new tools of control and surveillance for states and companies.
