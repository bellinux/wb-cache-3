5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive {{a significant portion}} of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> {{for the rest of the}} year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
2500|$|Extreme <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> {{occur during}} drought. [...] Extreme <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> are {{associated}} with reduced connectivity and limited species migration.

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>flows</b> are {{becoming}} an increasing {{issue in the}} UK. The effect of an increasing population on water supply demand is bringing awareness {{of the issue of}} extreme <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> risk to the attention of water and environmental managers across the country. Summer droughts in the Lake District in 2010 which followed winter flooding have raised the question of whether land management can be applied to reduce <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> risk in the area. This is the issue considered in this project. This master’s thesis, funded by the Adaptive Land-use for Flood Alleviation (ALFA) project of the EU set out to discover whether land management, vegetation change or changes in farming practices, could help reduce the risk of extreme <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> in Cumbria, England. The hydrological model CRUM 3 was applied to simulate the river discharge of the Dacre Beck under different land management change scenarios. Sensitivity analysis and a rigorous Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation experiment proved the model’s efficiency at predicting <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> discharges as well as flood peaks. Results of vegetation change scenarios demonstrated that a cover of natural grassland provided the best water supply to the river during <b>low</b> <b>flows.</b> Increases in cover of the land by each 1...|$|R
5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
25|$|States and Indian tribes adopt general {{policies}} {{pertaining to}} water quality {{standards that are}} subject to review and approval by the EPA. These provision regarding water quality standards include mixing zones, variance, and <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> policies. Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance {{as part of their}} water quality standard. Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. <b>Low</b> <b>Flow</b> policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> conditions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{uncertainty}} analysis to aid {{decision making in}} applications of statistically modeled flow-duration-frequency (FDF) relationships of both daily high and <b>low</b> <b>flows.</b> The analysis is based on 24 selected catchments in the Lake Victoria basin in Eastern Africa. The FDF relationships were derived for aggregation levels in the range 1 – 90 days for high flows and 1 – 365 days for <b>low</b> <b>flows.</b> The validity of the projected FDF quantiles for high return periods T was checked using growth factor curves. Monte Carlo simulations were used to construct confidence intervals CI on both the estimated Ts for given flows and the estimated FDF quantiles for given T. The average bias of the modeled T of high and <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> are for all catchments and Ts up to 25 years lower than 8 %. Despite this relatively small average bias in the modeled T, {{the limits of the}} CI on the modeled 25 -year flows go up to more than 100 % for high flows and more than 150 % for <b>low</b> <b>flows.</b> The assessed FDF relationships and accompanied uncertainties are useful for various types of risk based water engineering and water management applications related to floods and droughts. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|In a {{multi-stage}} compressor, at {{the high}} pressure stages, axial velocity is very small. Stalling value decreases with a small deviation from the design point causing stall near the hub and tip regions whose size increases with decreasing flow rates. They grow larger at very <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> rate and affect the entire blade height. Delivery pressure significantly drops with large stalling {{which can lead to}} flow reversal. The stage efficiency drops with higher losses.|$|E
25|$|The kinetic rate {{of these}} {{reactions}} depends {{mostly on the}} monomer gas, which must be either gaseous or vaporized.

The high end of MaP scores is 1000. A toilet with a MaP score of 1000 should provide trouble-free service. It should remove all waste with a single flush; it should not plug; it should not harbor any odor; it should be easy to keep clean.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> in ungauged rivers from minimum discharge of perennial springs is proposed. This spring-based approach (SBA) is tested in 21 catchments {{from the northern}} Apennines, Italy. First, the hydrogeological behaviour of each geological formation and superficial deposit {{is related to the}} spatial distribution and discharge of perennial springs in a test area using a Bayesian approach, weight of evidence (WoE). Second, the observed river flow exceeded for 95 % of the observation period is related to the type of geological formations outcropping within the catchment. Finally, the q 95 <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> are estimated from the WoE weights. The SBA performance is assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation and compared with the results of a multiple regression (MR) model that accounts for selected catchment characteristics, but no springs. The results show that the SBA outperforms MR. The better performance of the SBA may be related to its ability to capture bedrock characteristics, which are the main controls of <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> in the study area...|$|R
40|$|Recession slope {{analysis}} {{has often been}} used to estimate aquifer thickness, i. e. groundwater depth.

In general total annual precipitation has tended to increase. These increases are matched {{by an increase in}} <b>low</b> <b>flows.</b> Intriguingly, the coefficients of the recession slope analysis show trends that do not match the trends in groundwater depths or <b>low</b> <b>flows.</b> These comparisons show that the choice of analysis may have important implications on the conclusions drawn from studies that attempt to assess the effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: For {{the purpose}} of <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> regionalization, {{relevant}} issue for water resources management like environmental flows requirements definition, this study focused on the controls on the seasonal and spatial variability of q 95 (i. e., the specific discharge that was exceeded on 95 % of all the time) with particular reference {{to the role of}} soil characteristics, that, like soil infiltration rate, aquifers recharge, evapotranspiration and topography, usually play a relevant role in <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> seasonality and occurrence within a river. Approach: Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Regions (North-Western Italy) were the investigated study area (30, 027 km 2) where 41 catchments were analyzed with the aim of robust regression models enabling the transfer of hydrological information from gauged to un-gauged sites. Results: The regionalization method consisted of multiple regression models between <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> and catchment characteristics. Twenty-five catchment descriptors were used, checking their relative influence with the multi-regressive procedure and a special attention was devoted to the selection of significant soil characteristics in the regionalization process. Seasonality indices were used to classify catchments into two sub-regions and separate multiple regressions was performed by checking the prediction performance with cross-validation. Also a global regression was fitted out but it yielded a lower performance. In the study domain land use, topography and Thornthwaite moisture index demonstrated to be the most significant variables in order to represent relationships between catchment soil characteristics and <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> regime. Conclusion/Recommendations: Results obtained in this study were comparable with other regionalization studies carried out in Austria and Switzerland. The interpretation of the identified regression models provided, at local scale, new tools for water management and environmental flows requirements and, from a wider point of view, useful insights into the general comprehension of <b>low</b> <b>flows</b> processes...|$|R
