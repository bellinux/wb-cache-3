We use the ratio of maximized likelihood for discrimination purposes. The asymptotic properties of the proposed criterion have been investigated. It is observed that the asymptotic distributions are independent of the unknown parameters. The asymptotic distributions have been used to determine the minimum sample size needed to discriminate between these two distribution functions for a user specified probability of correct selection.

40|$|Abstract: Many of the {{challenges}} faced in health care delivery can be informed through building models. In particular, Discrete-Conditional Survival (DCS) Models, recently under development, can provide policymakers with a flexible tool to assess time-to-event data. The DCS Model is capable of modelling the survival curve based on various underlying distribution-types and is capable of clustering or grouping observations (based on other covariate information) external to the distribution fits. The flexibility of the model comes through the choice of data-mining techniques that are available in ascertaining the different subsets {{and also in the}} choice of distribution-types available in modelling these informed subsets. This paper presents an illustrated example of the DCS Model being deployed to model ambulance response-times; utilizing multi-nomial logistic regression for the Discrete-Conditional Component and a mixture of log-logistic and two-term <b>log-logistic</b> <b>distributions</b> for the Process Component. This model is contrasted against use of a parametric accelerated failure-time model...|$|R

40|$|Complex load-sharing {{parallel}} systems incorporate dependencies between components {{through a}} load-sharing rule. Such systems {{were used to}} model the strength of fibrous composites where component fiber failures occur in cycles having two phases. As the load on the system increases, a single component fails (Phase I), which then causes a cascade of component failures (Phase II) due to the load transfer as these Phase II failures occur. Under monotone load-sharing the failures have a simple Markovian structure. The {{current state of the}} system only depends on the latest Phase I failure and the corresponding Phase II failures have a Gibbs measure (GM) representation when the component strengths are independent. The GM representation formalism indicates that log odds ratios for the strength distribution are the fundamental quantities in determining the potentials in the GM for the state of the system. Formulas for the potentials are particularly simple through the use of generalizations of the log-logistic and the <b>log-logistic</b> <b>distributions</b> for the component strength distributions.

However, most modeling approaches, including those based on complex network theory, do not fully account for real-life traffic patterns and may provide an incomplete view of network functions. This study utilizes trip data obtained from the Beijing Subway System to characterize individual passenger movement patterns. A directed weighted passenger flow network was constructed from the subway infrastructure network topology by incorporating trip data. The passenger flow networks exhibit several properties that can be characterized by power-law distributions based on flow size, and <b>log-logistic</b> <b>distributions</b> based on the fraction of boarding and departing passengers. The study also characterizes the temporal patterns of in-transit and waiting passengers and provides a hierarchical clustering structure for passenger flows. This hierarchical flow organization varies in the spatial domain.

40|$|Abstract Background: Breast {{cancer is}} a fatal disease and the most {{frequently}} diagnosed cancer in women with an increasing pattern worldwide. The burden is mostly attributed to metastatic cancers that occur in one-third of patients and the treatments are palliative. It is {{of great interest to}} determine factors affecting time from cancer diagnosis to secondary metastasis. Materials and Methods: Cure rate models assume a Poisson distribution for the number of unobservable metastatic-component cells that are completely deleted from the non-metastasis patient body but some may remain and result in metastasis. Time to metastasis is defined {{as a function of the}} number of these cells and the time for each cell to develop a detectable sign of metastasis. Covariates are introduced to the model via the rate of metastatic-component cells. We used non-mixture cure rate models with Weibull and <b>log-logistic</b> <b>distributions</b> in a Bayesian setting to assess the relationship between metastasis free survival and covariates. Results: The median of metastasis free survival was 76. 9 months. Various models showed that from covariates in the study, lymph node involvement ratio and being progesterone receptor positive were significant, with an adverse and a beneficial effect on metastasis free survival, respectively. The estimated fraction of patients cured from metastasis was almost 48...|$|R
40|$|In {{survival}} analysis, {{there are}} two types of model, parametric and nonparametric. For parametric models the survival data is described by a known non negative distribution. Exponential, weibull, log-normal and <b>log-logistic</b> <b>distributions</b> are the popular distributions used in survival analysis. Most of the time, distributions with two parameters are used as it allowed for more flexibility than one parameter distribution. There are cases where a fraction of individual who are not at risk in the event of interest. This fraction of individual is known as cure fraction. Survival models that take into account the existing of a cure fraction are called as cure model. Cure model separates the target population into two subgroups, long-term and short-term survivor. The survival time of the short-term survivor is described by a proper survival function, such as exponential, weibull, and log-normal survival functions. Weibull cure model is the most popular cure model used in survival analysis However, in some cases weibull distribution is not able to describe the survival data well. As an alternative distribution with two parameters Log-normal cure model is discussed in this study. Weibull cure model and log-normal cure models are compared in term of consistency.
