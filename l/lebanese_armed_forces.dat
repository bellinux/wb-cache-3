The programme was delayed by lack of spare parts for the aircraft, such as cartridges for the Martin-Baker ejection seats. On 12 November 2008, 50 years after its original introduction, the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron, based at Rayak AB: one two-seater and three single-seaters. Military exercises were conducted with Hunters, {{such as those that}} took place on 12 July 2010. The Hunters were retired from service during 2014.|$|E

[...] The agreement incited Maronite frustration over what were perceived as excessive concessions to the Palestinians, and pro-Maronite paramilitary groups were subsequently formed to fill the vacuum left by government forces, which were now required to leave the Palestinians alone.

40|$|THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE” {{addresses}} {{using the}} doctrine of command responsibility - the doctrine according to which military and non-military leaders can be held individually criminally responsible for the crimes committed by their subordinates - before the International Criminal Court (ICC) {{as a way to}} prevent gender crimes in armed conflict. The prevention of gender crimes in armed conflict is an important issue for a variety of reasons. One extremely important reason is the connection that the United Nations has cited between the AIDS pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and rape in armed conflict. In addition, in the August 25, 2003 issue of NEWSWEEK, Fareed Zakaria draws a link between the Chechen female suicide bombers and the routine rape of Chechen women by Russian soldiers (see [URL] There are three prerequisites to the imposition of criminal command responsibility: 1) a commander/subordinate relationship; 2) “knowledge” that subordinates are committing or about to commit a crime; and 3) failure to prevent or punish the crime. It is the knowledge prerequisite that I think prevents the doctrine from functioning effectively. Commanders can, in most cases, easily claim that they lacked knowledge that their subordinates were committing or about to commit violations of international humanitarian law. Only with respect to gender crimes in armed conflict, I propose that the widespread knowledge that gender crimes have occurred historically in internal and international armed conflict be used to satisfy the knowledge prerequisite before the ICC. Meaning, given the prevalence of gender crimes in armed conflict (see Bosnia and Rwanda), I contend that it is no longer plausible or acceptable for commanders to claim that they were unaware that their subordinates were committing or going to commit gender crimes. Knowledge should be assumed and the emphasis placed on the measures that the commander took to prevent the commission of gender crimes or punish the perpetrators. My proposal, I hope, will result in the burden shifting to where it needs to be; on taking all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the commission of gender crimes. Precedent for my proposal {{can be found in a}} report, the KAHAN REPORT, prepared by an Israeli Commission of Inquiry into a massacre which occurred at two largely Palestinian refugee camps (Sabra 2 ̆ 6 Shatilla) in Beirut, Lebanon in 1982. The Commission found Ariel Sharon, among others, “indirectly” responsible for the massacre committed by a <b>Lebanese</b> Christian <b>armed</b> <b>force,</b> in part, because of the widespread, historical knowledge of the enmity and the violence which occurred between the <b>Lebanese</b> Christian <b>armed</b> <b>force</b> and the Palestinians in Lebanon. Based on that historical information, and common or public knowledge, the Commission found that Sharon should have foreseen the likelihood of violence and should have taken measures to guard against it. Likewise, with respect to gender crimes in armed conflict, I argue that based on historical information, and common or public knowledge that gender crimes are routine in internal and international armed conflict, commanders have a duty to take measures to guard against the commission of gender crimes in armed conflict - if not, they could be prosecuted before the ICC which should provide the appropriate amount of incentive...|$|R

Staffan de Misura, Personal Representative of the Secretary-General for Southern Lebanon stated that he was [...] "deeply concerned that air violations by Israel across the Blue Line during altercations with Hezbollah are continuing to take place", calling [...] "upon the Israeli authorities to cease such violations and to fully respect the Blue Line". [...] In 2001 de Misura similarly expressed his concern to Lebanon's prime minister for allowing Hezbollah to violate the Blue Line, saying it was a [...] "clear infringement" [...] of UN Resolution 425, under which the UN certified Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon as complete.
