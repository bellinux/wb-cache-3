In comparison, many shallow water octopuses only live for a year. Higher water temperatures result in increased growth rates, but shorter <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> in Bathypolypus arcticus. Temperatures above 10 C are typically lethal to this cold-water species, although specimens have survived at 11 C if slowly acclimated.|$|R

5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of P.fluviatile is {{typically}} 10–12 years. Moulting {{does not occur}} in winter. Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August. Females carry the eggs on their pleopods (appendages on the abdomen) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs, having passed through the larval stages inside the egg.|$|E
5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The {{age of a}} few snails was {{estimated}} to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in mechanical damage to the snails.|$|E

5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of {{peregrine}} falcons in {{the wild}} is up to 15.5years. Mortality {{in the first year}} is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% annually in adults.

5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E

Significant difference was observed in α(1) -AG as well as Fbg between stage Ⅰ and Ⅱ, in Ch-Ease between stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ and in LDH between stage Ⅲ and Ⅳ. In inoperable cases who did not obtain any clinical improvement during chemotherapy, significant positive correlation was observed between their <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> and α(1) -AG as well as Fbg measured prior to chemtherapy, and as for Ch-Ease negative correlation was observed. More close correlation was obtained between <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> and biological status which was set up following their laboratory data as stated above. Therefore, it seems that biological status are reliable index for estimating <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> of inoperable cases...|$|R
