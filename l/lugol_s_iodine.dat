40|$|Currently 80 % of {{cervical}} cancer cases worldwide arise in low income countries. In Uganda, the age standardized incidence rate of {{cervical cancer}} {{is estimated at}} 40. 7 per 100, 000 women. Public health policies, logistical, socio-political-cultural factors and other inequities limit the delivery of services for cervical cancer prevention. This thesis presents data on biological factors and service delivery issues that may affect cervical cancer control. Article I: A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) explored factors that influence the usage of reproductive health care services {{with an emphasis on}} cervical cancer. Barriers identified included: a lack of knowledge and misconceptions about cervical cancer, cultural constructs about the illness, economic factors, patriarchal domestic gender power relations, alternative authoritative sources of reproductive health knowledge, and unfriendly health care services. Article II: An open interventional study with 2 arms, to evaluate the efficacy of male partner involvement in reducing the loss to follow-up among women referred for colposcopy after a positive cervical cancer-screening test. A total of 5, 094 women were screened in two family planning/postnatal clinics at Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. 824 screened positive and were referred for colposcopy, half were allocated to the intervention group and half to the control group. In the intervention group, information about the screening findings and a request to assist their partner in attending the next examination were sent to the male partners. In the control group, a standard service was provided, which did not include a letter to the male partner. Women in the intervention group were {{more than twice as likely}} to return for colposcopy (odds ratio, OR 2. 8, 95 % confidence interval, CI 1. 9 3. 9). Article III: We estimated the prevalence of cervical abnormalities detectable by visual inspection and cervical lesions diagnosed by colposcopy according to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serostatus and described the outcomes of cryotherapy treatment. In a see and treat cervical prevention strategy, trained nurses screened women for cervical cancer using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and visual inspection with <b>Lugol</b> <b>s</b> <b>iodine</b> (VILI). Women with abnormal visual inspection findings were referred for colposcopic evaluation and HIV testing. Women with premalignant cervical lesions detected at colposcopy were treated mainly by cryotherapy, and were evaluated for treatment outcome after 3 months by a second colposcopy. The colposcopy diagnosed abnormal cervical lesions in 27 % of women who returned. HIV seropositivity was associated with a higher likelihood of cervical lesions especially inflammation (Risk Ratio, RR= 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 4) and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) (RR= 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 6. 7). Article IV: From 625 women who underwent colposcopic evaluation, information on social demographic characteristics was collected. They were tested for HIV testing and HPV typing was performed using SPF 10 /LiPA. The overall prevalence of HPV infection was 39. 4 %. The most common HPV types in decreasing order of frequency were: HPV 16, HPV 52, HPV 35, and HPV 18. An age of less than 40 years, low income status and infection with HIV were statistically significant risk factors for any HPV infection. Conclusions: The work in this thesis identified potential barriers for the successful implementation of cervical cancer programs in Uganda, proposed some practical solutions that may improve cervical cancer screening uptake and added to the body of knowledge about the distribution of HPV types that may be relevant to the development of second generation HPV vaccines...|$|E

PAPA-koe) perustuva seulontamenetelmä ei kalleutensa vuoksi tule kyseeseen. Siksi on kehitetty menetelmiä, joissa silmämääräisen tarkastelun perusteella voidaan todeta epäilyttävältä näyttäviä muutoksia kohdunkaulassa ja suun limakalvolla. Nämä menetelmät ovat yksinkertaisia eivätkä vaadi lääkärinkoulutusta seulojilta. Intiassa köyhin väestönosa jää usein kokonaan ilman terveydenhuollon palveluja. Hinnaltaan edulliset seulontamenetelmät ovat todellinen mahdollisuus ehkäistä syöpää tilanteessa, jossa syövän hoito on hintansa vuoksi useimmille ihmisille käytännössä mahdotonta. Silmämääräisen tarkastelun jälkeen kohdunkaulan muutokset hoidetaan yksinkertaisilla menetelmillä saman tien, jolloin varsinkin maaseudun asukkaat saavat hoidon eivätkä jää menemättä uudelle käynnille mahdollisesti kaukaisellekin klinikalle. Tutkimuksen tavoitteena oli selvittää erilaisissa tutkimusasetelmissa useiden eri seulontamenetelmien vaikutusta kohdunkaulan syövän ennalta ehkäisyn keinoina ja selvittää näiden organisoitujen seulontaohjelmien vaikutusta kohdunkaulan syövästä ja suusyövästä aiheutuvaan kuolleisuuteen Intiassa. Tutkimuksissa verrattiin vaikutuksia seulonta- ja vertailuryhmissä. Eri tutkimusryhmien koot vaihtelivat 58 000 :n ja 190 000 :n henkilön välillä. Tutkimukset suoritettiin Dingdigulissa Tamil Nadun osavaltiossa ja Trivandrumissa, Keralassa. Tutkimustulokset osoittivat, että silmämääräiset seulontamenetelmät toimivat toistettuina ja järjestelmällisesti toteutettuina erinomaisesti kehittyvien maiden olosuhteissa. Kohdunkaulan syövän ilmaantuvuus pieneni 25 % ja kuolleisuus peräti 35 % yhdessä tutkimusosiossa. Myös suusyövän aiheuttamassa kuolleisuudessa havaittiin 20 %:n vähenemä. Asiallisesti järjestettyinä silmämääräisiin menetelmiin perustuvat seulontaohjelmat vaikuttavat kuolleisuutta vähentävästi ja niitä voidaan soveltaa muuallakin kehittyvien maiden olosuhteissa. Tutkimukset koordinoi WHO:n Kansainvälinen syöväntutkimuskeskus (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, Ranska) yhteistyössä paikallisten intialaisten tutkijoiden kanssa.

Globally, India has the {{greatest}} relative burden of cancers of the cervix and oral cavity in terms of absolute numbers, and numbers of these two cancers summed together form the biggest part of the cancers in the country. With well organized screening programmes, screening for precancerous lesion of these two cancers and giving appropriate treatment to individuals with these lesions, would be beneficial in {{reducing the number of}} cancers and cancer deaths in the country. Pap smear, which has been seen to be an effective cervical cancer screening technique in the developed world, is resource demanding, requiring a laboratory infrastructure, quality assurance for the different steps involved and a system to report the test results to women. For this reason, implementation of Pap smear screening in India, as in other low/medium resourced countries, has met challenges and difficulties, leading to the evaluation of alternative, simple, safe, acceptable, affordable and inexpensive visual inspection techniques for detecting cervical precancer lesions and preventing cervical cancer. Furthermore, oral visual inspection is an oral cancer screening method which is cheap, can be easily applied by a wide range of medical personnel and, hence, is suitable for India and other developing countries. The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess the validity of these visual inspection techniques and to evaluate what impact they would have on reducing the incidence of and/or mortality from cervical and oral cancers when used in organized screening programmes, especially in low/medium resourced settings. The test performance of five cervical cancer screening methods, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), visual inspection with <b>Lugol</b> <b>s</b> <b>iodine</b> (VILI), VIA with magnification (VIAM), conventional Pap smear and Human papilomavirus (HPV) testing, were simultaneously evaluated in more than 58, 000 women aged 25 to 64 from eleven urban settings in India (6 centres) and five African countries (5 centres), all centres following the same protocol. These studies were carried out by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as part of the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Seattle, Washington, USA) to advance cervical cancer prevention in low/medium resourced countries. The test accuracy of VIA and VILI in detecting high grade cervical disease was found to be similar or even better than that of conventional Pap smear. In order to evaluate whether a single lifetime VIA screening and treatment of detected cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by cryotherapy and excision under field conditions, all provided by trained nurses, can lead to reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality among women offered screening compared to a similar group of women receiving the existing standard health care, IARC in collaboration with the Christian Fellowship Community Health Centre, a rural hospital and a cancer centre in the Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu State in South India, organized a large randomized controlled trial involving about 80, 000 women aged 30 - 59 years. In this trial, 57 municipal administrative units (49, 300 women) were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 56 to the control group (31, 000 women). Women (31, 300 in number) in the intervention group were then offered VIA, and VIA positive women were colposcopied and/or biopsied by the nurse during the same screening visit followed by immediate treatment with cryotherapy, when appropriate. Women with lesions not eligible for cryotherapy were referred for loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and those with suspected invasive cancer were referred for further investigations and treatment. After seven years from the beginning of screening, there was a 25 % reduction in the number of cervical cancer cases, and a 35 % reduction in the number of cervical cancer deaths among women offered VIA screening compared to those not offered screening. In conclusion, this trial showed that VIA screening could reduce the cervical cancer burden. In a similar randomized oral cancer screening trial, carried out by IARC in collaboration with the Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India, 13 municipal administrative units, involving about 191, 800 apparently healthy individuals of 35 years and above, were randomly allocated to two groups. The intervention group (with about 96, 500 individuals) received three rounds of oral visual inspection at 3 -year intervals provided by trained health workers, whereas the control group received the standard health care. The aim of this trial was to assess if oral visual screening would ultimately lead to a reduction in oral cancer mortality in the intervention group compared to the control group. Nine years from the initiation of screening, a 21 % reduction in oral cancer mortality was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group which did not reach statistical significance. However, a statistically significant 33 % reduction in mortality was observed among tobacco and/or alcohol users compared to similar control subjects. In summary, evidence from this Indian study shows that oral visual screening can reduce mortality in high-risk individuals. In a nested case-control study using data from the Trivandrum oral cancer screening trial it was shown that individuals chewing paan, smoking bidi and/or drinking alcohol heavily were more likely to catch oral cancer compared to those not having the habits. Big differences in risk estimates among men and women chewing paan were observed with a 3 -fold increased risk of oral cancer for male chewers compared to an 11 -fold increased risk among female chewers, both groups compared to their corresponding never chewers. Effects of chewing paan with or without tobacco on oral cancer risk were elevated for both sexes. A 2 -fold increased risk of oral cancer was observed among male bidi smokers. The risk of catching oral cancer increased with increasing frequency and duration of chewing and alcohol drinking, as well as with increasing duration of bidi smoking. These results further show that cessation of tobacco use and moderation of alcohol use in combination with early diagnosis remain the key elements in oral cancer prevention and control. India, like many low and medium resourced countries, is hit hard by the burden of cervical and oral cancers. It has a limited health budget, cancer treatment facilities are not universally available and life-prolonging therapies are often unavailable. Nevertheless, it is of great importance to prevent those cancers (such as cervical and oral cancer) that can be prevented. Based on the evidence discussed in this dissertation, specific priorities should be given to primary prevention initiatives aimed at taking action against tobacco and heavy alcohol consumption and intensified action against cancers of the cervix and oral cavity through screening...|$|E
40|$|Diatom {{contamination}} is {{a problem}} in the early cultivation stages of Saccharina latissima. Macro- and microalgae compete for the same abiotic resources, and diatoms may overgrow and eliminate seedlings of S. latissima if introduced to the macroalgae cultivation system. Germanium dioxide (GeO 2), which blocks the cell division in diatoms, {{has been used as a}} diatom controller in the growth medium in cultivation of macroalgae. However, the chemical is very expensive and it has been suggested that the chemical inhibit growth of S. latissima seedlings. In the present study, it was desirable to establish a sori disinfection method for large-scale cultivation systems that eliminate diatoms prior to S. latissima spore release. It that was called for a purely chemical disinfection method as mechanical removal of contamination is labour-intensive and costly. Five chemicals, including 130 different trials, were tested on diatoms in free suspension. Acetic acid, sodium hypochlorite and ethanol eliminated diatom growth independent of concentration, exposure time and exposure temperature. Formaldehyde and <b>Lugol</b> <b>s</b> solution revealed surviving diatoms in the weaker treatments. GeO 2 eliminated growth of Chaetoceros muelleri and Skeletonema costatum, but monocultures of Phaeodactylum tricornutum were found at both concentrations (0. 1 mL L- 1 and 0. 5 mL L- 1) eleven days after inoculation. Acetic acid, <b>Lugol</b> <b>s</b> solution and sodium hypochlorite were tested as sori disinfectants, and GeO 2 was used as a negative control for diatom growth. Acetic acid treatments were lethal to both diatoms and S. latissima spores, and GeO 2 treatments appeared to have negative influence on fertility and growth of young seedlings of S. latissima. Disinfection with 600 ppm sodium hypochlorite or 2 % <b>Lugol</b> <b>s</b> solution, with an exposure time of 2 minutes and exposure temperature of 10 °C, followed by two rinsing baths of sterile seawater, gave total elimination of diatoms. No notable effects on spore release, sporophyte growth or early development of young seedling were seen. This implies that disinfection of sori can be done safely by use of these treatments, without concern about reduced quality or quantity of cultivated seaweeds. Sori disinfection was done on disks cut from ripe sori in a disinfecting bath, and no mechanical removal of sori contamination was performed. Sodium hypochlorite was suggested as a new sori disinfectant based on an apparently good safety margin between lethal doses to diatoms and a harmful dose for S. latissima. The chemical also appears to be a widespread disinfectant in aquaculture systems, and can easily be neutralized with thiosulphate...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the changes in thyroglobulin (Tg) mRNA and Tg proteins during thyroid development in the fetus and in maternal thyroid glands during gestation and lactation is studied. While the appearance of Tg mRNA (fetal day 15) showed good temporal correlation with that of 12 S Tg, no 19 S Tg could be detected until 3 days later. The 12 S Tg was the predominant protein on days 18 and 19 of gestation in the fetus, while 19 S Tg was the predominant protein on fetal days 21 - 22 and during the postnatal period in the offspring; by the 20 th postnatal day, the 19 S Tg content per gland was 4 {{times the amount of}} 12 S (155 vs. 37 μg/gland; P < 0. 001). The 19 <b>S</b> <b>iodine</b> content in the fetus was the same as that in 12 S up to the 21 st day of gestation, except for lower values on day 18. From fetal day 22 and through the postnatal period, the iodine content in 19 S was 1. 6 - 5. 9 times greater than that in 12 S. Therefore, the ratio of atoms of iodine per mol Tg during the experimental period changed from 0. 75 to 19. 5 for 19 S and from 0. 72 to 7. 2 for 12 S. The levels of all of the iodoamino acids were low on fetal days 17 - 19, after which they increased at different rates for each protein. The greatest increase in monoiodotyrosine and T 3 corresponded to 12 S, while diiodotyrosine and especially T 4 showed a greater increase in 19 S than in 12 S Tg; 20 days after birth, the T 4 content in 19 S was about 3 times greater than that in 12 S Tg. The soluble thyroid proteins from pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant female controls contained a main protein, 19 S, and a smaller amount of 27 S. Both 19 S Tg and 19 <b>S</b> <b>iodine</b> contents were already lower than those in nonpregnant rats at 14 days of pregnancy, and the levels continued to decrease during the experimental period. In contrast, the 27 S Tg and 27 <b>S</b> <b>iodine</b> levels remained constant and similar to nonpregnant values. Surprisingly, a decrease in the level of Tg mRNA was observed during pregnancy and lactation. We have no explanation for the dramatic decrease in Tg mRNA during the last days of pregnancy.

The present work aims to show the effects of furanace on the population growth of Brachionus. Cultures of Brachionus were obtained and fed with Chlorella at a density of 1 - 2 x 10 SUP- 6 cells/ml. Five liters of the culture water were placed in each of 4 white, circular, 152 x 304 mm plastic basins. The mean initial densities of the rotifer ranged from 26. 5 to 38. 5 individuals/ml. The concentrations of furanace were 0, 1, 2 and 3 mg /l. The cultures were vigorously aerated. Population growth was observed after 3, 6, and 9 hours of exposure. The cultures were thoroughly mixed before samples were taken to ensure an almost equal distribution of the rotifers in the water. To facilitate the counting of the rotifer, one drop of <b>Lugol</b> <b>s</b> solution was added to each sample. This immobilizes the rotifer as well as stops further reproduction. Individuals with only the lorica left or with badly deformed lorica were considered dead. Population counts were done using a Sedgwick-Rafter counting chamber. Among the different durations of exposure, the percentage survival of the populations in the furanace baths were highest after 3 hr. There were slight increases in the control and 2 mg/l and slight decreases in 1 and 3 mg/l. The differences in the mean densities are statistically insignificant at. 01 significance level.

40|$|Abstract Background Solar-powered sea slugs are {{famed for}} their ability to survive {{starvation}} due to incorporated algal chloroplasts. It is well established that algal-derived carbon can be traced in numerous slug-derived compounds, showing that slugs utilize the photosynthates produced by incorporated plastids. Recently, a new hypothesis suggests that the photosynthates produced are not continuously made available to the slug. Instead, {{at least some of the}} plastid 2 ̆ 019 s photosynthetic products are stored in the plastid itself and only later become available to the slug. The long-term plastid-retaining slug, Elysia timida and its sole food source, Acetabularia acetabulum were examined to determine whether or not starch, a combination of amylose and amylopectin and the main photosynthate produced by A. acetabulum, is produced by the stolen plastids and whether it accumulates within individual kleptoplasts, providing an energy larder, made available to the slug at a later time. Results Histological sections of Elysia timida throughout a starvation period were stained with Lugol 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>Iodine</b> solution, a well-known stain for starch granules in plants. We present here for the first time, an increase in amylose concentration, within the slug 2 ̆ 019 s digestive gland cells during a starvation period, followed by a sharp decrease. Chemically blocking photosynthesis in these tissues resulted in no observable starch, indicating that the starch in untreated animals is a product of photosynthetic activity. Conclusion This suggests that kleptoplasts function as both, a nutritive producer and storage device, holding onto the polysaccharides they produce for a certain time until they are finally available and used by the starving slug to withstand extended starvation periods...|$|R

40|$|The main {{change in}} thyroid {{function}} {{associated with the}} pregnant state is the requirement of an increased production of thyroid hormone that depends directly upon the adequate availability of dietary iodine and integrity of the glandular machinery. Physiologic adaptation takes place when the iodine intake is adequate, while this is replaced by pathologic alterations {{when there is a}} deficient iodine intake. Pregnancy acts typically, therefore, as a revelator of underlying iodine restriction. Iodine deficiency (ID) has important repercussions for both the mother and the fetus, leading to sustained glandular stimulation, hypothyroxinemia and goitrogenesis. Furthermore, because severe ID may be associated with an impairment in the psycho-neuro-intellectual outcome in the progeny - because both mother and offspring are exposed to ID during gestation (and the postnatal period), and because ID is still prevalent today in several European countries - it has been proposed already in the early 1990 <b>s</b> that <b>iodine</b> supplements be given systematically to pregnant and breast-feeding women.

Sixty-four-slice technology is a minimum requirement for assessing valvular and peri-valvular involvement and the coronary anatomy. We restrict the use of β-blocker to patients with normal haemodynamic status. In our centre, we use a three-phase injection rationale starting with pure iodine contrast medium (60  ml for a patient around 70  kg; speed, 4  ml/s), followed by a 50  % mix of contrast medium and saline (40  ml, 4  ml/s), followed by pure saline injection (40  ml, 4  ml/s). This procedure has the advantage of enhancing the coronary tree as well as the right heart. To assess mechanical prosthetic valve motion, we perform retrospective acquisitions without ECG dose modulation. The second acquisition covers the thorax, abdomen, pelvic and cerebral regions. IE and antibiotic therapy can compromise renal function; therefore we do not use an additional iodine injection for the second acquisition; subsequently this second acquisition is performed around 60 <b>s</b> after <b>iodine</b> injection.

40|$|Part I 1. It was {{proved that}} to oxidize one {{molecule}} of cysteine to cysteic acid 6 atoms of bromine are required. 2. A method for determining cysteine by titration with a bromate solution {{in the presence}} of acid and bromide was proposed. 3. A single determination of cysteine by this bromine method requires only a few minutes. The concentrations of cysteine and acid in sample-solutions have practically no influence upon this method. Part II A method, called the iodine-method, for the determination of cysteine is described. The principle of the method is to titrate cysteine in a hydrochloric acid solution, {{in the presence of}} iodide, with a standard iodate solution. The procedure of this method is not so simple as that of the bromine method, but the method is applicable in the presence of all the cleavage products of proteins. Consequently it is available for the qualitative and quantitative determination of cysteine in amino acids mixture. Part III (1) When treated with nascent hydrogen, cystine and cysteine alone among amino acids react to iodine very actively in acid solution and at room temperature. (2) A method for the determination of cystine is described. The principle is to titrate cysteine produced by the reduction of cystine, with a standard iodate solution in presence of iodide and acid. (3) The quantitative method must be made under strictly comparable conditions of the concentrations of acid and of the temperature of the solution etc. Part IV It was verified that there is no appreciable decomposition of cystine during ordinary acid hydrolysis of proteins, using the bromine-method and iodine method and sometimes FOLIN and LOONEY 2 ̆ 7 s colorimetric method for the determination of cystine. Part V (1) The cystine content in some proteins was determined by FOLlX and LOONEY 2 ̆ 7 s colorimetric method and by OKUDA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>iodine</b> method. (2) The colorimetric method gave too high results. This was ascribed {{to the fact that there}} are some substances which are present in the hydrolysate of proteins and give a blue color as cystine does. (3) Cysteine was absent in all of the completely hydrolyzed solutions of the proteins examined. Part VI (1) A method for the determination of cystine in urine was described. It is an application of the iodine-method for cystine, and we designated it, for the sake of convenience 2 ̆ 2 micro iodine method 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 general method. 2 ̆ 2 (2) This method, with some modification, may be useful for the determination of cystine in blood and in small quantities of proteins. (3) Special methods for removing thiocyanide were also described, but they are useful only in very rare cases. (4) LOONEY 2 ̆ 7 s method for the determination of cystine in urine was studied, but we failed to prove it satisfactory. In conclusion I wish to express my thanks to Messrs. J. MOTOMURA and Y.

40|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} nutrient. An adequate intake of iodine {{is required for the}} production of thyroid hormones. The term iodine excess is used in this profile to refer to increases in intake relative to estimated physiological requirements. As a reference point, the chronic dietary intake of <b>iodine</b> in U. <b>S.</b> populations has been estimated to range from approximately 150 to 950 µg/day. Estimates for various populations have ranged from 10 mg/day in populations that regularly ingest seaweeds containing a high iodine content. The National Research Council (NRC) Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iodine is 150 µg/day (2. 1 µg/kg/day for a 70 -kg adult), with additional allowances of 25 and 50 µg/day during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. The diet is the major source of iodine intake in the U. <b>S.</b> population. <b>Iodine</b> enters the human diet from a variety of natural sources, including mineral dissolution and atmospheric transport and deposition of seawater aerosols to surface water, vegetation, and soil. Major food categories that contribute to dietary iodine include marine produce (e. g., fish and shellfish) and milk. Cows and goats absorb iodine from ingested vegetation and water, when iodine is either deposited on the vegetation or in water or when the iodine is taken up by vegetation grown in soils containing iodine. The absorbed iodine is excreted into their milk; goat milk typically has higher concentrations of iodine than cow milk for equal deposition o...|$|R
40|$|Iodine-doped polyvinylalcohol, doped up to 52 wt %, was studied using {{positron}} annihilation lifetime {{technique and}} Doppler broadening of annihilation radiation. Three component, free fit {{analysis was used}} for the lifetime spectra. It is found that I- 3 drops sharply on initial iodine doping, whereas decrease in tau(3) is small, indicating inhibition of positronium formation by the dopant. The <b>S</b> parameter, on <b>iodine</b> doping, initially shows a drastic increase due to the decrease in crystallinity of the doped sample. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction curves confirm that doping results in decreased crystallinity of the sample. tau(3) increases beyond 23 wt% doping level due to structural changes induced by formation of polyiodide complexes, which is confirmed by UV-Vis spectra, for moderately and highly doped samples. The drop in tau(3) at higher levels of doping (> 44 wt %) suggests chemical quenching of positronium, probably due to iodine aggregation. DSC confirms formation of iodine aggregates, as revealed by a large endotherm at 185 degrees C, for doping levels beyond 47 wt %. S 0163 - 1829 (99) 08321 - 6]...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of iodide by synthetic birnessite (δ-MnO 2) was {{studied in}} perchlorate mediain the pH range 4 - 8. Iodine (I 2) was detected as an oxidation product that was subsequently further oxidized to iodate (IO 3). The third order rate constants, second order on iodide and first order on manganese oxide, determined by extraction of iodine in benzene decreased with increasing pH (6. 3 - 7. 5) from 1790 to 3. 1 M 2 <b>s</b> 1. Both <b>iodine</b> and iodate {{were found to}} adsorb significantly on birnessite with an adsorption capacity of 12. 7 mM/g for iodate at pH 5. 7.

Crystals of both of the mixed valence compounds belong to the triclinic space group P¯ 1; for E = S, a = 10. 278 (4), b = 11. 508 (2), c = 13. 333 (4) Å, α = 114. 97 (2), β = 99. 21 (3), γ = 92. 65 (2) °, FW = 308. 15, Z = 6; for E = Se, a = 10. 368 (6), b = 10. 818 (8), c = 13. 421 (8) Å, α = 80. 64 (5), β = 81. 20 (5), γ = 75. 18 (6) °, FW = 401. 95, Z = 6.

In each of the mixed valence compounds the molecular (asymmetric) unit consists of a trimeric [PhCN 2 E 2] 3 + cation and an associated triiodide anion. Within the cations the mean interannular E-E contacts are 3. 181 / 3. 377 Å (E = S/Se). The packing patterns of the two compounds show important differences. For E = S the crystal structure does not exhibit stacking of the trimeric molecular building blocks, but for E = Se the trimer units form dovetailed stacks in which consecutive layers are oriented in a trans-antipodal fashion. This arrangement introduces close interannular contacts between the blocks along the stack, as well as close lateral contacts. The asymmetric unit of [PhCN 2 S 2][I 3] consists of a single PhCN 2 S 2 + cation and an associated triiodide anion; there are no unusual stacking features. The magnetic and conductivity properties of [PhCN 2 Se 2] 3 [I 3] are reported, and the results discussed {{in the light of}} extended Hückel band structure calculations. ...|$|R

Foram utilizados iodo (0, 57 %), clorexidine (2, 0 %), cloro (2, 5 %) e composto de amônio quaternário (4, 0 %), nas concentrações indicadas, como desinfetantes comerciais usados convencionalmente no pré e pós-dipping. Analisou-se um total de 97 isolados de Staphylococcus spp. identificados como S. aureus (16), Staphylococcus coagulase positiva (7) e Staphylococcus coagulase negativa (74). Os desinfetantes foram avaliados em três tempos distintos (15 ", 30 " e 60 "). Observou-se que 56, 3 % de Staphylococcus aureus foram sensíveis ao iodo, 68, 8 % sensíveis ao cloro, 87, 5 % à clorexidine e 37, 5 % ao composto de amônia no tempo de 60 ". Quanto aos Staphylococcus coagulase positiva (SCP), 100 % dos isolados foram resistentes ao clorexidine, 85, 7 % ao composto de amônio, 57, 1 % ao cloro, e 42, 9 resistentes ao iodo no tempo de 60 ". Em relação aos Staphylococcus coagulase negativa (SCN) foi observado 91, 9 % de sensibilidade ao clorexidine, 70, 3 % sensíveis ao cloro, 66, 2 % ao iodo e 24, 3 % sensíveis ao composto de amônio no tempo de 60 ". Conclui-se com esse estudo que a maior atividade desinfetante in vitro foi verificada para clorexidine e cloro frente aos S. aureus, iodo e cloro para os SCP e clorexidine e cloro para os SCN. Devido às variações no perfil de sensibilidade e resistência encontradas, é necessária a avaliação regular da eficiência dos desinfetantes usados nas propriedades, com o intuito de observar a eficácia do produto e assim garantir o controle da mastite no rebanho. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of commercial disinfectants used in pre- and post-dipping, against Staphylococcus spp. isolated from milk originating from dairy cattle farms in the Wasteland and Forest Zone of Alagoas, Brazil. We used iodine (0. 57 %), chlorhexidine (2. 0 %), chlorine (2. 5 %) and quaternary ammonium compound (4. 0 %) at concentrations indicated, conventionally used as commercial disinfectants before and after dipping. We analyzed a total of 97 isolates of Staphylococcus spp. identified as S. aureus (16), coagulase positive Staphylococcus (7) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (74). The disinfectants were evaluated at three different times (15 ", 30 " and 60 "). We found that 56. 3 % of Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to iodine, 68. 8 % to chlorine, 87. 5 % to chlorhexidine, and 37. 5 % to the compound of ammonia, in time 60 ". As for coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS), 100 % of the isolates was resistant to chlorhexidine, 85. 7 % to the ammonia compound, 57. 1 % to chlorine, and 42. 9 % iodine, in time 60 ". Regarding coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), 91. 9 % was sensitive to chlorhexidine, 70. 3 % to chlorine, 66. 2 % to iodine, and 24. 3 % the ammonium compound, at time 60 ". It is concluded from this study that the greatest disinfectant activity in vitro was with chlorhexidine and chlorine for <b>S.</b> aureus, with <b>iodine</b> and chlorine for SCP, and with chloride and chlorhexidine for SCN.
