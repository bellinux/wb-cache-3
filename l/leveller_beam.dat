These trade-offs {{relate to the}} use of low <b>level</b> <b>beam</b> forming, flexible power and spectrum distribution, and selection of the number of beams to cover the service area. It is shown that antenna performance can be improved by sharing horns between beams using a low <b>level</b> <b>beam</b> forming network (BFN). Additionally, greatly increased power utilization is possible using a hybrid matrix concept to share power between beams...|$|R

The developed IPBPM was measured 26 nm with 30 % of nominal beam charge of ATF. From the measured beam position resolution, we can expected to 8 nm beam position resolution with nominal ATF beam charge condition.

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} {{particle}} physics experiments are being proposed {{as part of}} the Department of Energy HEP Intensity Frontier. Many of these experiments will utilize megawatt <b>level</b> proton <b>beams</b> onto targets to form secondary beams of muons, kaons and neutrinos. These experiments require transverse size measurements of the incident proton beam onto target for each beam spill. Because of the high power <b>levels,</b> most <b>beam</b> intercepting profiling techniques will not work at full beam intensity. The possibility of utilizing optical transition radiation (OTR) for high intensity proton beam profiling is discussed. In addition, previous measurements of OTR beam profiles from the NuMI beamline are presented...|$|R

In the present work, coded pulsed excitations (linear frequency modulated and nonlinear frequency modulated signals) {{are used to}} evaluate the superharmonic field generation and propagation (coded tissue superharmonic imaging). The evaluation includes the study of parameters such as peak side lobe <b>level,</b> <b>beam</b> width, axial <b>level</b> for analyzing SNR and penetration depth. The results for coded tissue SHI are reported in comparison with conventional SHI and with the performance of coded tissue harmonic imaging and fundamental ultrasound imaging...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector {{system is}} very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic sub-reflector and its supporting struts (usually 3-4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when {{the size of the}} parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.To avoid blockage from the sub-reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe <b>levels,</b> <b>beam</b> squint, poor cross-polar response, etc.|$|R
40|$|Luminosity-driven {{channeling}} extraction {{has been}} observed {{for the first time}} in a 900 GeV study at the Fermilab Tevatron. This experiment, Fermilab E 853, demonstrated that useful TeV <b>level</b> <b>beams</b> can be extracted from a superconducting accelerator during high luminosity collider operations without unduly affecting the background at the collider detectors. Multipass extraction was found to increase the efficiency of the process significantly. The beam extraction efficiency was about 25 %. Studies of time dependent effects found that the turn-to-turn structure was governed mainly by accelerator beam dynamics. Based on the results of this experiment, it is feasible to construct a parasitic 5 – 10 MHz proton beam from the Tevatron collider...|$|R
