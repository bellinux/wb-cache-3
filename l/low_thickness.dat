30|$|This {{parameter}} {{is adequate}} for classifying the cloud phase as either “ice” or “water”. Cloud radiative properties in both channels are {{dependent upon the}} cloud particle size. Scattering processes and the dependence on particle size are stronger in the 8.7 -μm channel relative to the 10.8 -μm channel (Strabala et al. 1994). Therefore, for larger particles, the ΔT 8.7 – 10.8 increases. The water vapor absorption in the 8.7 -μm channel is higher relative to the 10.8 -μm channel (Soden and Bretherton 1996; Schmetz et al. 2002). This is why ΔT 8.7 – 10.8 is lower for <b>low</b> optical <b>thicknesses.</b> For higher optical thicknesses, the ΔT 8.7 – 10.8 increases. As a result, ΔT 8.7 – 10.8 reaches high values for large effective particle radius and large optical <b>thicknesses.</b> A <b>low</b> optical <b>thickness</b> in combination with small effective particle radius leads to minimum ΔT 8.7 – 10.8. A <b>low</b> optical <b>thickness</b> with large particles and a large optical thickness with small particles result in medium values of ΔT 8.7 – 10.8.|$|R

In reality this limit can not be reached and typical stable efficiencies are about 9% (world record 11.7%). That is well over the stable efficiencies of single junction thin film silicon solar cells which are around 6%. One reason of the low costs of silicon thin film solar cells is its very <b>low</b> <b>thickness</b> (2 µm) compared to silicon wafer (200 µm).

The Spannagel Cave has arisen in a large vein of Jurassic calcite marble of the Hochstegen Formation, a marble with over 90% total carbonate content, that runs through the slate mantle of the Western Tauern window. The formation of this extensive cave as a result of geological corrosion (and mixing corrosion) is explained by the tectonics of the region.|$|E

For slow-grown films, the data reveal the linear thickness dependence predicted by Pertsev and Zembilgotov, using a complete elastic description, while a 2 / 3 scaling exponent is found for fast-grown films. Extremely long domains running all through the samples have been observed in the latter case, compared to the short domains observed in slow-grown films. These differences are ascribed to the in-plane anisotropy for domain wall nucleation, which is likely caused by the anisotropic elastic modulus of the substrate. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC. ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members. The thickness of this intumescent coating is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an intermediate coat in a coating system (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively <b>low</b> <b>thickness</b> of this intumescent coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|E

With the demolition of the Vienna Basin, this is a layer on top Brigittenauer only 200 m in height, however, in Zwischenbrücken 2000 m in depth. During the medium Miocene (Badener layer) the pool broke and deposited in power less freshwater sediments (sands and conglomerates). From the East the sea stored clay marl, sand and algae, whose thickness increases to the east. In the Sarmatian (upper Miocene) by the performance of the oceans a brackish fauna emerged and clay marl was deposited. Also, this layer has increasing thickness from west to east. Today, this layer on the Brigittenauer Spitz lies 10 m below the surface, at Zwischenbrücken 360 m. In the Pannonium, the increasingly silting-up freshwater lake deposited tegel. The territory of Brigittenau is covered with quaternary deposits, the thickness from 10 to(-) 15 m. The bottom layers consist mostly of gravel with sand and layers of gravel.
