40|$|Abstract — The {{model is}} {{developed}} {{for reducing the}} wastage of electricity due to careless and improper switching in households, schools, colleges and offices etc. It saves energy by maximizing the use of daylight. This is an automatic system which employs solar energy through PV. The system is capable of controlling lights, fans and air conditioners in a room depending upon various parameters such as <b>LUX</b> <b>level,</b> room temperature and motion. All these parameters are measured through various sensors and the controlling is done by microcontroller. PIR sensor detects the occupancy in the room. The microcontroller reads the <b>LUX</b> <b>level</b> of the room from the ambient light sensor. If the daylight value is below the preset threshold value, then the lights are turned on and vice versa. LM 35 sensor reads the room temperature and is compared with preset value and accordingly the ON and OFF of the fan is controlled. The model has been developed and tested in Department of Energy, MANIT Bhopal. This model itself consumes very low power and helps in saving {{a significant amount of}} energy. The model can be applied to government offices, private firms, residential buildings, schools, colleges etc. so as to avoid the wastage of electricity and maximum use of day lighting, also reduces our dependence on conventional energy and will help in conserving energy.

40|$|The {{visibility}} {{of an object}} is largely determined by the relative contrast between the object and its background. Thus, it might be assumed that without consideration of environmental conditions surrounding a target illuminated by a headlamp, target visibility may not be accurately assessed. That is, methods that consider only illuminance characteristics of headlamps (e. g., distribution and intensity of light) may assess headlamp performance differently from methods that include roadway and viewing conditions in the appraisal. In this report, headlamp performance ratings are first generated using CHESS, a software application that determines visibility by simulating headlamp illumination, roadway, and target characteristics, using target contrast. The CHESS ratings were then compared with ratings obtained by two alternative illuminance-based ratings methods. The first method, the lux-area method, computes road area at or above an established lux threshold. The second method, the distant-light method, computes the average <b>lux</b> <b>level</b> within a predefined forward road area centered on the midline of the vehicle.

Also, design of the physical environment is increasingly recognized as an important attribute in patient care. Patient has to cope with not only the disease but also with changes in environmental factors on hospitalization. Light in healthcare environment is known to influence physical and emotional well-being of patients and also enhance their recovery. Optimum bedside lighting condition is vital for patient’s personal needs and comfort and also for activities such as clinical examinations, various tests and procedures as also nursing care. The present study was undertaken to test visual comfort relative to bedside light. A structured, interviewer guided questionnaire {{was used to evaluate}} 136 adult patients who visited three multi-speciality hospitals and results were compared to standards. The 136 patients consisted of 82 males and 54 females {{with a mean age of}} 31 years (+ 13). Of these patients 72 % were satisfied with bedside daylight levels and 68 % patients were satisfied with bedside artificial light levels. Dissatisfaction was mainly due to excessive illumination/ glare from brightness of light sources and reflecting surfaces, spotty appearance of light in certain areas in the room especially those near the windows.

40|$|Summary Display {{lighting}} which enhances object appearance may be legitimate {{for many}} museum exhibits, but is generally inappropriate for works of art. These require presentation which reveals their intrinsic visible characteristics with accuracy and honesty, and the term ’exhibition ’ {{is used to}} distinguish this process from display. It requires that the entire setting, including lighting, develops from an aim to reveal works of art rather than to enhance them, {{and the notion of}} ’the well-lit room ’ is promoted as a concept which expresses the essentials of this design approach. However, it is evident that these may conflict with recommended illuminance maxima, particularly the 50 <b>lux</b> <b>level</b> for more sensitive objects. A working model of the photochemical processes is proposed to give an improved basis for specifying control of lighting. Limiting values of annual damage exposure are derived from the current illuminance maxima recommendations; these permit a more flexible approach to reconciling competing requirements for exhibition and conservation. Also, the model provides a framework which enables information relating to exposure of materials and to means for controlling degradation to be evaluated in terms which can readily be related to actual conditions of exhibition m museums and art galleries.

The characterization of degradations products is studied through some spectroscopic techniques commonly used in cultural heritage studies: particularly, ATR-IR and Raman spectroscopies can provide important information on variations of chemical bonds during accelerated ageing.

40|$|Introduction Industrial safety {{professionals}} {{recognize that}} adequate illumination {{is essential to}} a safe and productive work environment. The need for effective, lighting in underground coal mines is even greater. 1 Designing appropriate lighting systems for these mines is no easy [] task because of the unique environment and work procedures encountered in underground coal-mining operations. Miners must depend totally on artificial lighting systems to see. Moreover, the working face is a low-reflectivity and low-contrast environment and is continually advancing or retreating. 2 Laboratory mock-ups {{have been a major}} part of the process lighting equipment manufacturers must under- go to design an underground machine-mounted lighting system. The mock-ups often have taken considerable time. Furthermore, modifications to a lighting system (using different luminaires with an existing configuration or changing a luminaire's location, orientation, etc.) could require more time with additional mock-ups and laboratory measurements. Understanding the need to improve this situation, the US Bureau of Mines has developed an alternate method for facilitating lighting system mock-ups. A PC-Program (CAP),* with the latest software technology enables users to design, alter, and evaluate under- ground machine-mounted illumination systems. Lux levels and distance are measured as the luminaire is moved incrementally through angular traverses about horizontal and vertical axes. The measurements and angles subsequently are entered into the model. From this input data, three-dimensional isolux or isofootcandle profiles are constructed for luminaires that can be placed at various locations and orientations on a mining machine. As an example, Figure 1 shows a computer display of 21. 5 Ix or 2. 00 fc profiles for luminaires mounted on a simulated mine-shuttle car. Using this information, the model allows the user to determine the <b>lux</b> <b>level</b> at different locations in space about the shuttle car. How the model calculates illumination During initial development of the CAP model, the isolux profile of the luminaire was determined using the inverse square law (ISL). 3 The method of gathering data comprised recording a single measurement of distance at 21. 5 21 1. 21 x (2. 00 2111 fc) for angular traverses following 0. 09 rad (5 degree) increments. This data was then used to find the illumination in space for any other distance at a given azimuth and elevation using the ISL. Limitations, however, exist with this method. 4 The main one is that the ISL assumes a luminaire is a single point source of light, so long as the distance is greater than five times the 1 al;gest dimension of the luminous area of the luminaire. 5 Also, by using a single measurement to calculate the illumination for a given luminaire in the CAP model a large error could result from an inaccurate measurement...|$|E
40|$|On the {{aesthetic}} side of green architecture or sustainable design is {{the philosophy of}} designing a building that is {{in harmony with the}} natural features and resources surrounding the site. There are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings: specify 'green' building materials from local sources, reduce loads, optimize systems, and generate on-site renewable energy. The Air Force Headquarters (AFHQ) building has been constructed 12 years before and minimal concern has been made for the application of green building concepts. In order to apply these key steps into the AFHQ building there are restrictions and limited steps could be accommodated. Reduce the load, optimize the systems and save energy are the most important key steps which can be applied for this building. At present the systems are being operated catering only for the basic requirements of occupants. Whole building is used for offices and there are few elements operated in the night time also due to the operational and security commitments in the country. Observations have been made on general lighting and air conditioning systems which can be improved {{in order to reduce the}} load, optimize the system and finally to save the energy. Minimise the energy waste is one of the main concerns of the green building design and such avenues have been explored and evaluated the total energy saving has been estimated. AFHQ building’s light system and air conditioning system have been modelled using DIALux 4. 11 and Loadsoft 6. 0 software respectively. Basically a typical floor is modelled for the existing system parameters and calculated the energy consumption. The lighting system has been designed based on general requirement of offices and not integrated with the partitions and natural lights. The power consumption of a typical floor is nearly 10 KW where fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts used. With the new design electronic ballast are used and luminaries were selected to maintain 300 - 500 <b>lux</b> <b>level</b> at the working plane. The total power consumption is reduced by 4 KW and further reduced with the day light integration. The total load averagely reduced to 3. 2 - 4. 1 KW at the day time where total energy reduction is 46 - 52 kWh per day per floor. Chilled water central air conditioning system has designed for two chillers of capacity 200 tonnes and each chiller serve 7 floors of the building. There are 14 AHUs serving each floor having fixed drive motors. The temperature of each floor varies significantly within the floor as well as during the working time. In side temperature is directly responded to the outside environmental conditions. Only one thermostat is available in one floor and not sufficient to cater the whole area where there are different types of partitions. Present cooling load of a typical floor is approximately 25 - 28 tonnes with constant air flow and uncontrolled fresh air. At present the inside temperature is not controllable and some instances drops to 22 - 23 oC creating uncomfortable working environment. While proposing variable air flow and regulating the inside temperature to 24 oC the cooling load could be reduced by 14 - 17 % of the total existing load where total energy saving per day per floor is 197. 1 kWh. Then a new system was proposed with day light integration and simulated with software and optimum quality of the window is defined. The total energy saving is calculated as LKR 16. 7 M against the total cost of the proposal LKR 56. 6 M. The return on the investment has been calculated as 3 years.

40|$|Psychogenic {{symptoms}} (trouble sleeping, lack of energy, {{difficulty in}} concentration, nervous tension, feelings of sadness/ downheartedness) {{are among the}} most frequently reported symptoms of menopausal transition, as are nocturnal hot flushes/sweats. Few studies have combined psychosocial and biomedical models to seek an explanation as to why menopausal symptoms such as these are problematic for some but not all women during menopausal transitional. In Study 1, 71 transitional women (mean age: 50. 02 years, SD: 3. 52 years) completed questionnaires examining the predictive value of a number of psychosocial factors in terms of the impact of menopausal symptoms on the ability to maintain a normal lifestyle during transition. Participants included women undergoing natural transition and those using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). A sub-set of participants (N= 22) with the highest and lowest psychogenic symptom frequency scores took part in Study 2. Their evening on-set salivary melatonin secretion levels were compared, as was their exposure to natural light at 500, 3, 000 and 10, 000 <b>lux</b> <b>levels,</b> their subjective and objective (wrist actigraph) sleep quality and their nocturnal peripheral body temperatures (PBT). Results from Study 1 indicated that, while the quality and availability of health care was of most concern to all participants, domestic environment, including quality of relationships and communications, was the main predictor of successful transition when assessed as the ability to maintain a normal lifestyle during transition. No {{significant differences were found between}} natural or HRTassisted transition in terms of the impact of symptom severity, or the predictive value of psychosocial factors. Participants with low psychogenic frequency scores (less frequent symptoms) showed a trend towards higher evening on-set melatonin secretion levels, and had significantly greater exposure to natural light than their high psychogenic frequency counterparts. These results were consistent regardless of transitional status (natural or HRT-assisted). No significant differences between the high and low psychogenic symptom groups were found in either subjective or objective sleep quality. However, women with high psychogenic frequencies spent significantly more hours with higher peripheral body temperatures and reported significantly more nocturnal hot flush/sweat episodes than their low psychogenic frequency counterparts. These results show that, in terms of overall menopausal transition, domestic environment plays a major role in the way in which transitional women are able to deal with the impact of menopausal symptoms during transition. They also suggest a permissive link between melatonin evening on-set of rhythms and psychogenic symptoms that may be mediated by exposure to natural light. However, these results should not be viewed in isolation from each other, but in combination with each other. It could be argued that a healthy domestic environment may affect the perception of symptom severity. This could result in greater involvement in domestic and social activities outside the home, increasing exposure to natural light, and thus better entrained melatonin secretion on-set rhythms. However, any inference of causation (rather than association) requires experimental verification, preferably in research designs where key factors, such as exposure to natural light, can be experimentally manipulated...|$|R

The analysis of nah-lux mRNA from cells exposed to toluene revealed that the bioluminescence response was not due to increased nahG-luxCDABE gene expression, whereas increased <b>lux</b> mRNA <b>levels</b> were found with exposure to naphthalene or JP- 4 jet fuel. While different mixture combinations of solvents resulted in either additive or intermediate effects, the combination of naphthalene and solvent resulted in a synergistic effect on the bioluminescence response. The addition of n-decanal, a substrate for luciferase, showed that the cells were aldehyde-limited. If aldehyde was added, only the presence of naphthalene caused a significantly increased bioluminescence response over the control. The solvent effects were dependent on the physiological status of the reporter culture and were present in growing, but not in resting cell cultures. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the latest technology}} development in High-output (HO) T 5 fluorescent lamps and luminaires, and their possible application in high bay lighting instead of High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps. To demonstrate the potential of this application, the Energy Efficiency Office of EMSD had designed and installed a new HO T 5 lighting system in East Kai Tak Indoor Games Hall as a pilot project. The lighting design involved the utilisation of 3 × 49 W HO T 5 lamps accommodated in 56 special impact resistance luminaires to provide an average illuminance of 500 <b>lux</b> on floor <b>level.</b> Measurements of {{the quality and quantity}} of the two lighting systems were made before and after the retrofit. Detailed studies were carried out for improvement in both visual and energy performance of the new HO T 5 lighting system. Opinion surveys of the frequent users of the games hall were also carried out via questionnaires after the installation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of light intensity and duration on mental performance at night. A number of investigations have found light levels as low as 500 lux can {{have a significant impact on}} cognition, but there have been few, if any, systematic experiments that have investigated the potential trade-off between the intensity of the light and its duration. Light levels of 100 (normal room lighting), 300, 600 and 1, 000 lux were paired with one of two different light exposure times: 15 and 60 minutes. Sixteen volunteers completed tests of critical thinking, simple maths, letter cancellation, recall, and recognition between 2300 and 0100 hours once a week for four consecutive weeks. Body temperature and subjective sleepiness levels were also recorded. The results showed that, in general, light intensities, irrespective of duration, of 300 and 600 lux had a positive effect on critical thinking and recognition memory. In contrast to some previous findings, there was little or no effect on sleepiness levels, core body temperature, recall, letter cancellation or the simple maths task. Surprisingly, the 1, 000 <b>lux</b> light <b>level</b> had no effect on any of the tasks. It was concluded that changes in the intensity of broad-spectrum light can affect night-time cognitive performance, but that the intensity of the light cannot be traded for duration. However, further investigation of the manner in which light intensity is varied, either by distance from the light or by varying the brightness of the light source, is required before firm conclusions can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Personnel {{working in}} {{hospitals}} {{are exposed to}} many occupational hazards that may threaten their health and safety. Physical hazards that are encountered in hospital working environment include temperature, illumination, noise, electrical injuries, and radiation. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify physical health hazards in all departments of Al-Azhar University Hospital in new Damietta, to measure risk level of these hazards, and to recognize safety measures in these departments. Study Site: The study was conducted in Al-Azhar University Hospital in Damietta Governorate. Study Subjects: All personnel (328) working in the hospital were recruited. Study Methods: Interview forms; a workplace inspection checklist, assess physical health hazards in the hospital and a modified checklist (workplace safety and health risk management, assess leadership commitment towards workplace safety and health). Risk assessment matrix was used to describe the risk level. Also, environmental measurements of noise, temperature, relative humidity, and lighting were taken in all departments including auxiliary service offices. Results: Majority of the staffs reported stairways were free of obstacles, emergency lighting worked properly, and temperature was suitable. Minority of the staffs reported stairways were slippery, they were informed on hazards of noise and non-ionizing radiation, and they were given radiation safety training. Measurements of physical agents revealed noise levels were above standard of the WHO in all wards and above slandered of OSHA as in laundry, kitchen, etc. Range of noise level was from 58 dB in renal dialysis unit to 88 dB in kitchen. Lighting level was from 290 to 1150 <b>Lux,</b> temperature <b>level</b> was from 25 to 31 °C, relative humidity level was from 45 to 59...|$|R
40|$|Buildings in the United States {{account for}} nearly 68 % of all U. S. energy {{consumption}} due to their reliance on electrical lighting and mechanical systems. Beginning in the 20 th century, emphasis on developing the glass curtain wall created increased energy demands on lighting and mechanical systems. Consequently, the building’s curtain wall is a direct cause of significant energy loads. This research project investigated how current parametric design tools and energy analysis software are used during a performance-driven passive solar design process to develop facade systems that lower the energy use intensity (EUI) of a building and increase natural daylight to an acceptable illuminance <b>level</b> (<b>lux).</b> Passive solar shading strategies were employed to realize the proposed design process through a proof of concept project that retrofits the facade of an outdated office building in a hot-mediterranean climate. Incremental steps were taken using parametric software (Revit Architecture 2015) to increase the passive solar and daylighting performance capabilities of the facade system and Autodesk Green Building Studio was employed to measure, compare and contrast the results of each design...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} light is very {{beneficial}} in office buildings because energy consumption can be reduced, and working conditions can be enhanced, which positively affect workers' health and productivity. However, bringing natural light into deep plan office buildings is not possible with simple windows or skylights, and light transport systems are necessary to bring natural light into the deep cores of buildings. Light transport systems usually need sun-tracking devices to collect natural light that are complicated, expensive and require continual maintenance. Mirrored light pipes coupled with laser cut panels (LCP) are a passive and simpler daylight transport solution and {{are the focus of}} this PhD research. The primary aim has been to improve the technology and achieve the most efficient passive solution possible through the interactive use of theoretical modelling, experimental measurements and case studies. Applications of this technology were investigated in two case studies: 1) as horizontal light pipes for daylight illumination of a high rise building proposal in the tropics; and 2) as vertical light pipes for daylight illumination of a middle-rise deep plan building proposal in a subtropical environment. In both cases, quantitative system performance under best (clear sunny sky) and worst (overcast) case scenarios was undertaken via scale model testing and mathematical modelling. The major conclusion for both case studies was that mirrored light pipe technologies, when coupled with LCP, were effective in introducing sufficient ambient light levels inside buildings and over distances > 20 m from the façade or roof. Average <b>lux</b> <b>levels</b> achieved in the space were 150 to 350 lux for the horizontal light pipes and 50 to 300 lux for vertical light pipes. However, as a passive solution, this technology has two major limitations: 1) the dependence on sun azimuth and elevation angles, which result in variations in illuminance levels during the day and the year; and potentially 2) pipe size, as pipes with a large diameter (e. g. 2 m in diameter for 20 m long pipes) are required for optimal performance, such that the large pipes may limit integration in building design. Two other solutions were assessed to circumvent these limitations to the mirrored light pipe technology: 1) a passive collector that concentrate natural light by using a fluorescent panel {{to reduce the size of}} the pipe, and 2) an active collector comprising a LCP rotating 360 degrees in a 24 hour cycle to reduce system dependence on sun azimuth and elevation angles. The low light-to-light efficiency of the fluorescent panels made them inappropriate for collecting sufficient amounts of daylight necessary for daylighting of large buildings. In contrast, the rotating LCP is a very simple active system that by rotating constantly at 15 degrees per hour, reduces the deviation angle between the panel orientation and sun azimuth angle, and significantly increased the system performance. The performance was generally better (e. g. 2. 5 times better for light collection under low sun elevation angles) than the passive light pipe system with fixed LCP. However, active systems raise other issues in terms of cost-benefit in constructing, operating and maintaining such systems. Passive mirrored light pipes coupled with LCPs or simple active systems with rotating LCPs have great potential as daylight solutions for deep plan buildings as they can contribute to lowering overall energy consumption, improve workplace health and become an architectural design element. Research is still required on the implementation of the technology into buildings, but the growing trend towards 'green buildings', sustainable design and government regulations or building codes will require more daylighting use in buildings, and will motivate designers to increasingly consider and incorporate such daylighting strategies into future building designs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the acceptable horizontal illumination levels in an office environment by interviewing 293 occupants about the visual environment being perceived in all dasses of office buildings in Hong Kong. In particular, the measured horizontal illumination <b>level</b> (<b>lux)</b> in the offices was chosen as an indicator and correlated with the occupants' acceptability on a visual analogue assessment scale and a dichotomous assessment scale. The {{results showed that the}} occupants' acceptability was significantly influenced by the horizontal illumination level and was correlated with a logistic regression model. A satisfaction criterion of the lighting level was then evaluated from the frequency distribution of the occupants' response at certain horizontal illumination levels, and provided a measure to balance the occupants' acceptability and the energy consumption of the lighting system in the office area. In addition, the survey samples of the proposed criterion of visual comfort showed that an indoor environment with a horizontal illuminance of 518 lux would satisfy most of its occupants, corresponding to an overall satisfaction of 86 %. This confirmed the design criterion (500 lux) generally adopted in current practice. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
