25|$|By 1940, {{the work}} Blalock {{had done with}} Thomas placed him at the {{forefront}} of American surgery, and when he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at his alma mater Johns Hopkins in 1941, he requested that Thomas accompany him. Thomas arrived in Baltimore with his family in June of that year, confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of racism worse than they had endured in Nashville. Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his white <b>lab</b> <b>coat,</b> many heads turned. He began changing into his city clothes when he walked from the laboratory to Blalock's office because he received so much attention.|$|E

50|$|When {{used in the}} laboratory, <b>lab</b> <b>coats</b> {{protect against}} {{accidental}} spills, e.g., acids. In this case they usually have long sleeves and are made of an absorbent material, such as cotton, so that the user can be protected from the chemical. Some <b>lab</b> <b>coats</b> have buttons or elastic {{at the end of}} the sleeves, to secure them around the wrist so that they do not hang into containers of chemicals. Short-sleeved <b>lab</b> <b>coats</b> also exist where protection from substances such as acid is not necessary, and are favoured by certain scientists, such as microbiologists, avoiding the problem of hanging sleeves altogether, combined with the ease of washing the forearms (an important consideration in microbiology).|$|R
25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her <b>lab</b> <b>coat</b> pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E

The {{instruction}} in physics was poor, and while there were distinguished mathematicians in Frankfurt like Carl Ludwig Siegel and Otto Szász, Bethe disliked their approaches, which presented mathematics {{without reference to the}} other sciences. Bethe found that he was a poor experimentalist who destroyed his <b>lab</b> <b>coat</b> by spilling sulfuric acid on it, but he found the advanced physics taught by the associate professor, Walter Gerlach, more interesting. [...] Gerlach left in 1925, and was replaced by Karl Meissner, who advised Bethe that he should go to a university with a better school of theoretical physics, specifically the University of Munich, where he could study under Arnold Sommerfeld.|$|E

Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the CBS Reports TV special [...] "The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson" [...] that aired April 3, 1963.

[...] Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee. Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.|$|E

After Samus saves the platoon from monsters, Adam allows her to cooperate with the platoon under the condition that she follow his orders, and assigns the platoon to go on solo searches to investigate the Bottle Ship. Samus and the 07th Platoon heads to the Biosphere's Exam Center, where they learn that the ship's director, Dr. Madeline Bergman, had conducted research on illegal bioweapons for the Federation. After a mysterious reptilian creature attacks before being driven off, Adam directs Samus to follow the monster to the Pyrosphere, but is quickly directed to the Cryosphere in search for survivors.

Dr. Singh then asks his colleague Samuel, whom Rose recognises as Mickey Smith, to seal the doors. Ms. Hartman questions the Doctor, who admits that {{the woman in the}} sphere chamber is really Rose and that the woman with him in her office is Rose's mum Jackie. In the command centre, the three employees under manipulation initiate an unscheduled ghost shift and forcibly open the breach. The extended shift causes millions of ghosts to appear across the globe before they materialise into their true form, the Cybermen. At the same time the Cybermen arrive the Void ship suddenly activates and begins to open. The Cybermen take control of Torchwood and order the complete surrender of humanity for conversion. The Doctor, puzzled at how the Cybermen could have created an advanced piece of technology like the Void ship, asks the Cyber Leader how they were able to build it. The Cyber Leader responds that the sphere does not belong to them. The Cybermen are similarly oblivious to the origins of the sphere and that they merely followed its course through the breach.|$|E

The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore).

After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop).
