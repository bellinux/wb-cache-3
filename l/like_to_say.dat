25|$|Her {{secret is}} in her ability to {{transfer}} to the musical plane {{the suffering of the}} character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.|$|E

It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where I go back to when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|Though Brazilians of {{at least}} partial African {{heritage}} make up {{a large percentage of}} the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E

500|$|A. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings.

On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I {{want to say this}} here in this context as well, although I know that it is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E

Writing in I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said, [...] "Patty and Selma have rarely been more evil than here— they are fabulously cruel." [...] In a review of the sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes, [...] "Homer’s disdain for Marge’s sisters– and vice versa– has always led to terrific sparks, and “Vs.” provides another great round in their eternal battle.

I {{was trying to help}} end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|His father's last {{move was}} in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong {{attended}} Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed later in August; all {{before he had}} a driver's license. Armstrong {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo11 would like to send them best wishes". [...] Houston replied: [...] "Thank you, Apollo11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that."

In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules. [...] He then tells the audience that he Xeroxed her driver's license and she is never welcome at Chili's again. Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) car and smiles as they leave.|$|E

500|$|Fan {{reaction}} was largely positive, though certain fans {{complained that the}} game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato {{were aware of the}} changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever [...] "really got through to them". He continued, [...] "Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths. But I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> thank you for falling in love with Trigger so much."

[...] In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming Why Did I Get Married Too?. Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, [...] "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second." [...] During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet [...] "Scream". MTV stated [...] "there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] The performance was lauded by critics, with Entertainment Weekly affirming the rendition [...] "as energetic as it was heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{was given}} his own {{laboratory}} called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped {{to obtain a}} British work visa. His pay eventually rose to £6,000 per year, and an American patent attorney, Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles Anthology DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, [...] "Hello, I'm Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Hello' to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics." [...] Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: [...] "I'm a rock gardener, and now I'm doing electronics. Maybe next year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant".|$|E

500|$|Several viewers {{outside the}} film industry, such as evangelical pastors and commentators, argued that Frozen {{promotes}} normalization of homosexuality, while others {{believed that the}} main character, Elsa, represents a positive image of LGBT youth, viewing the film and the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} coming out. These claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and the LGBT community. Writing for Film International, Robert Geal has argued that while the film offers a superficially progressive vision of homosexuality, it perpetuates conservative notions about sexuality and gender; whereas Elsa's female homosexuality is rendered visually pleasurable to a male gaze, male transgressions of heterosexuality are coded in various negative ways. When asked about perceptions of a homosexual undertone in the film, Lee said, [...] "We know what we made. But at the same time I feel like once we hand the film over, it belongs to the world, so I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything, and let the fans talk. I think it's up to them." [...] She also mentioned that Disney films were made in different eras and were all celebrated for different reasons, but a 2013 film would have a [...] "2013 point of view".|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference.

[...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E
500|$|In her {{civilian}} identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., {{is depicted}} as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, {{as well as being}} head of Gotham City public library, [...] "presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality." [...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [...] Batman." ...|$|E

500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated that it just feels like too much. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that {{we have a lot of}} tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the search for truth in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E
500|$|The first song, [...] "Anything Goes", was {{recorded}} by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra, Strike Up the Band, and Gaga {{first came to}} know about it when she was 13 years old. Gaga thought that [...] "Anything Goes" [...] was a funny track with a [...] "real sexy, powerful vibe to it, and it's just because we're having fun singing it." [...] The version on Cheek to Cheek finds Bennett and Gaga swapping the lyrics between themselves, and was described by Bobby Olivier, from The Star-Ledger, as [...] "smooth as silk". The syllables are pronounced strongly by Gaga in syncopation while her vibrato complemented Bennett's characteristic jazz vocals and swing. Olivier added, [...] "Gaga's voice, when stripped of its bells and whistles, showcases a timelessness that lends itself well to the genre." [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" [...] was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue, Blackbirds of 1928. The version on Cheek to Cheek opens with the sound of high-hat and an electronic organ. Gaga alters the lyrics to sing [...] "Gee, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you're looking swell, Tony", who later rejoins with the line [...] "Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga". [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was first released as a single in 1948 by Cole, and it became a commercial success for him. Written by eccentric songwriter eden ahbez, the song about a [...] "strange enchanted boy" [...] features instrumentation from flutes and drums, and has an orchestral arrangement. A loungier version, Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range, followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character.|$|E
