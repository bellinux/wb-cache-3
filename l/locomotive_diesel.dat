They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives {{continue to have}} 2-man crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being much quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam <b>locomotive.</b> <b>Diesel</b> locomotives can be worked in multiple with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives throughout a single train—something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered {{for use as a}} single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train still under the control of a single crew. With steam traction a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to double heading with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.|$|E

50|$|The Winton Engine Corporation {{produced}} the first practical two-stroke diesel engines in the 400 to 1,200 hp (300 to 900 kW) range. They powered early Electro-Motive Corporation (another GM subsidiary) diesel locomotives and U.S. Navy submarines. In 1934 an 8-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447 kW), 8-201A diesel engine powered the first American diesel-powered train the Burlington Zephyr streamliner passenger train. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> manufacturing side of Winton {{became part of}} the Electro-Motive Corporation (later the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors) in 1935. The 2-stroke Winton Model 201 series engines featured Uniflow scavenging with intake ports in the cylinder walls and exhaust valves in the cylinder heads which would carry over to later Cleveland Diesel designs. They were a 60 degree opposed V type engine with mechanical injection. They were produced for rail use until late 1938 when the new lighter-weight diesel engine with more speed and flexibility had been developed and introduced as the EMC designed Model 567 series. EMD's successor is still producing locomotive engines based on the Model 567 design.|$|E
50|$|West Coast University {{was founded}} in Los Angeles in 1909 as a small {{ophthalmology}} school.

These programs were offered in non-traditional settings. For example, in 1953, the University began offering evening-only programs based on a schedule of six two-month academic terms. The success of this approach led the University to expand and diversify its programs to include offerings in the areas of business and management, computer science, industrial technology, and pre-health science. Associate degrees in Science as well as master's degree programs were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1981, the University reorganized into three distinct colleges: the College of Business and Management, the College of Engineering, and the College of Letters and Sciences. The University was led by the late Dr. Victor Elconin, whose direction was instrumental in developing the University’s solid reputation in the business and academic community.|$|E

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} simulation is used {{to study}} effects of O 2 -enriched intake air on performance and NO emissions of a <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engine. Parasitic power of the air separation membrane required to supply the O 2 -enriched air is also estimated. For a given constraint on peak cylinder pressure, gross and net power output of an engine operating under different levels of O 2 enrichment are compared with those obtained when a high-boost turbocharged engine is used. A 4 % increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in 13 % increase in net engine power when intake air with 28 vol% O 2 is used and fuel injection timing retarded by 4 degrees. When the engine is turbocharged to a higher inlet boost, the same increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in only 4 % improvement in power. If part of the higher exhaust enthalpies from the O 2 enrichment is recovered, the power requirements of the air separator membrane can be met. O 2 enrichment with its higher combustion temperatures reduces emissions of particulates and visible smoke but increases NO emissions (by up to 3 times at 26 % O 2 content). Therefore, exhaust gas after-treatment and heat recovery would be required if the full potential of O 2 enrichment for improving the performance of <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engines is to be realized...|$|E
40|$|The {{collaborative}} research program between the Department {{of energy and}} Electro-Motive Diesels, Inc. {{on the development of}} common rail fuel injection system for <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engines that can meet US EPA Tier 2 exhaust emissions has been completed. This final report summarizes the objectives of the program, work scope, key accomplishments and research findings. The major objectives of this project encompassed identification of appropriate injection strategies by using advanced analytical tools, development of required prototype hardware/controls, investigations of fuel spray characteristics including cavitation phenomena, and validation of hareware using a single-cylinder research <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engine. Major milestones included: (1) a detailed modeling study using advanced mathematical models - several various injection profiles that show simultaneous reduction of NOx and particulates on a four stroke-cycle <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engine were identified; (2) development of new common rail fuel injection hardware capable of providing these injection profiles while meeting EMD engine and injection performance specifications. This hardware was developed together with EMD's current fuel injection component supplier. (3) Analysis of fuel spray characteristics. Fuel spray numerical studies and high speed photographic imaging analyses were performed. (4) Validation of new hardware and fuel injection profiles. EMD's single-cylinder research diesel engine located at Argonne National Laboratory was used to confirm emissions and performacne predictions. These analytical ane experimental investigations resulted in optimized fuel injection profiles and engine operating conditions that yield reductions in NOx emissions from 7. 8 g/bhp-hr to 5. 0 g/bhp-hr at full (rated) load. Additionally, hydrocarbon and particulate emissions were reduced considerably when compared to baseline Tier I levels. The most significant finding from the injection optimization process was a 2 % to 3 % improvement in fuel economy over EMD's traditional Tier I engine hardware configuration. the common rail fuel injection system enabled this added benefit by virtue of an inherent capability to provide multiple injections per power stroke at high fuel rail pressures. On the basis of the findings in this study, EMD concludes that the new electronically-controlled high-pressure common rail injection system has the potential to meet locomotive Tier 2 NOx and particulates emission standards without sacrificing the fuel economy. A number of areas to further improve the injection hardware and engine operating characteristics to further exploit the benefits of common rail injection system have also been identified...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} simulation is used {{to study}} the effects of oxygen-enriched intake air on the performance and nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions of a <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engine. The parasitic power of the air separation membrane required to supply the oxygen-enriched air is also estimated. For a given constraint on peak cylinder pressure, the gross and net power outputs of an engine operating under different levels of oxygen enrichment are compared with those obtained when a high-boost turbocharged engine is used. A 4 % increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in an increase in net engine power of approximately 13 % when intake air with an oxygen content of 28 % by volume is used and fuel injection timing is retarded by 4 degrees. When the engine is turbocharged to a higher inlet boost, the same increase in peak cylinder pressure improves power by only 4 %. If part of the significantly higher exhaust enthalpies available as a result of oxygen enrichment are recovered, the power requirements of the air separator membrane can be met, resulting in substantial net power improvements. Oxygen enrichment reduces particulate and visible smoke emissions but increases NO emissions. However, a combination of retarded fuel injection timing and post-treatment of exhaust gases may be adequate to meet the <b>locomotive</b> <b>diesel</b> engine NO{sub x} standards. Exhaust gas after-treatment and heat recovery would be required to realize the full potential of oxygen enrichment. Economic analysis shows that oxygen-enrichment technology is economically feasible and provides high returns on investment. The study also indicates the strong influence of membrane parasitic requirements and exhaust energy recovery on economic benefits. To obtain an economic advantage while using a membrane with higher parasitic power requirements, it is necessary to recover a part of the exhaust energy...|$|E
