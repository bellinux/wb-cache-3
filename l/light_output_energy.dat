The relative <b>light</b> <b>output,</b> <b>energy</b> resolution and decay characteristics were measured for pure and Ca-doped ZnWO 4 scintillators. An increase in the light yield of ~ 40 % compared with the undoped crystal, and an energy resolution 9. 6 % (137 Cs) were obtained for Ca-doped ZnWO 4. The observed improvement is attributed to the reduction of self-absorption (bleaching) of the crystal.

We find an extremely high light output of 98 ? 000 ± 10 ? 000 ?photons/MeV. LuI 3 :Ce 3 + also gives {{a very high}} electron-hole (e-h) pair response when it is coupled with an avalanche photodiode (APD) (92 ? 000 ± 9000 ?e?h?pairs?MeV). With an APD, a best energy resolution (full width at half maximum over the peak position) of 3. 3 %± 0. 3 % for 662 ?keV ? quanta is observed. A combination of an extremely high light output and a good energy resolution makes LuI 3 :Ce 3 + an ideal scintillator for radiation sensor applications.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the testing of}} several prototype detectors, designed {{to be used in}} a radiation detector called the UoYTube. This detector can be used to detect charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation reactions. In this work, several UoYTube prototypes were designed, fabricated and characterised/tested. These included prototypes with different scintillator crystals (Caesium Iodide and plastic), prototypes with different geometries (truncated pyramid and cuboid), and prototypes that included different types of light guides (Acrylic and 3 D Printed). These prototypes were characterised in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the optimum bias value, the energy resolution, the Acrylic versus 3 D-Printed light guides, the number of counts and the optimum amplifier shaping time. Two different methods used to fabricate light guides (one 3 D Printed and the other with the HURCO VMX 60 m Machining Centre), are also described. The light guides were then characterised and compared to each other in terms of their <b>light</b> <b>output,</b> <b>energy</b> resolution, and the optimum shaping time. Using these results, it was inferred that the plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) and Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated a range of the optimum bias values, over which there was little variation in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. The Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated good energy resolution. The transmittance of light from the spectrometer through the 3 D Printed light guide was significantly poorer than that of the acrylic light guide. The difference in recorded energy resolution between the light guides was not very significant. The recorded number of counts was greater for the Acrylic light guide, when compared to the 3 D Printed light guide. It was also concluded that both the acrylic and 3 D Printed light guided prototypes should be operated with the highest values of shaping time, corresponding to the best resolution. These results were then used to decide upon the optimum design for the next generation UoYTube detector. ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} years the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN {{operated}} {{with a maximum}} center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV, a peak luminosity of around 7 × 10 ^ 33 cm^- 2 s^- 1 and collected about 23 fb^- 1 of data which lead {{to the discovery of}} a Higgs Boson in July 2012. To further constrain the properties of the newly discovered Higgs boson, the decision to extend the LHC program has recently been made. In this framework, a major upgrade of the beam optics in the interaction region will take place around 2022 to achieve a leveled peak luminosity of L = 5 × 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1. These will be the operating conditions during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb^- 1 by 2035. During HL-LHC phase the radiation levels will become much higher with respect to the nominal values for which the CMS detector was designed. Therefore it is of crucial importance to identify and quantify the effects ofradiation damage on the current detector in order to prepare an adequate upgrade of its components and maintain a good performance throughout its whole operation. In this thesis, a detailed study of the radiation damage effects on the performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is presented. A dedicated campaign of irradiation with 24 GeV protons has been performed at CERN Proton Synchrotron during 2011 and 2012. Lead tungstate (PbWO_ 4) crystals have been irradiated to different proton fluences up to 14 × 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2 which is close to the integrated fluences expected at the end of HL-LHC in the ECAL endcaps (EE). Degradation of crystal properties such as <b>light</b> <b>output,</b> <b>energy</b> linearity and energy resolution has been studied combining laboratory measurements and test beam results, obtained with 10 - 150 GeV electrons provided by the CERN H 4 facility. Results have been compared with a simulation model which properly reproduce the experimental data and allows to extrapolate the performance of the CMS ECAL throughout the whole HL-LHC phase. Especially in the forward region of the detector, where radiation levels are higher, the constant term of the energy resolution will increase up to ∼ 10 % (at |η| = 2. 2) after 3000 fb^- 1 of data, foreseen for the end of HL-LHC. A similar degradation of the calorimeter resolution will not allow a proper operation. ...|$|E

The Ce concentrations are 0. 5, 0. 05, and 0. 005 mol%. The relative light yield of the YAG:Ce with 0. 5 mol % with a 2 s shaping time was measured as 1 : 1. 08 : 1. 14 at + 20, 0, and 20 degrees C, respectively, including the temperature de-pendence of the phototube (0 2 % degree). The energy resolu-tion stays almost constant at 7. 2 % for 662 keV gamma-rays. The ceramic with 0. 05 mol % shows the almost same properties, while the light yield {{of that with}} 0. 005 mol % is 2 – 4 times lower (hence the energy resolution becomes 14 – 19 %). All the scintillators ex-hibit good linearities within 1 % between the <b>light</b> <b>output</b> and the irradiated gamma-ray energy from 59. 5 keV to 662 keV. The decay time constants of the dominant decay components are about 80 ns and 300 ns at+ 20 degrees C. As the temperature increases from 20 to+ 20 degrees C, the effective decay of all the ceramics becomes faster, because the decay time constants and fractions of the slower components shorten and decrease, respectively. This re-sult suggests that carriers which are captured in shallow traps be-fore transferring excitation to Ce ions can escape the traps more easily at higher temperatures. Considering the decrease of the total light yield toward higher temperatures, {{it is thought that}} thermal quenching starts to dominate the {{temperature dependence}} of the ceramic YAG:Ce around the room temperature. The 0. 5 mol% scintillator shows a lower quenching energy than the 0. 05 mol% one. This can be explained in terms of self absorption of Ce emis-sion.

40|$|Like most {{applications}} that utilize scintillators for gamma detection, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) desires materials with high <b>light</b> <b>output,</b> short decay time, and excellent stopping power {{that are also}} inexpensive, mechanically rugged, and chemically inert. Realizing that this ``ultimate`` scintillator may not exist, this paper evaluates {{the relative importance of}} these qualities and describes their impact on the imaging performance of PET. The most important PET scintillator quality is the ability to absorb 511 keV photons in a small volume, which affects the spatial resolution of the camera. The dominant factor is a short attenuation length ({le} 1. 5 cm is required), although a high photoelectric fraction is also important (> 30 % is desired). The next most important quality is a short decay time, which affects both the dead time and the coincidence timing resolution. Detection rates for single 511 keV photons can be extremely high, so decay times {le} 500 ns are essential to avoid dead time losses. In addition, positron annihilations are identified by time coincidence so {le} 5 ns fwhm coincidence pair timing resolution is required to identify events with narrow coincidence windows, reducing contamination due to accidental coincidences. Current trends in PET cameras are toward septaless, ``fully- 3 D`` cameras, which have significantly higher count rates than conventional 2 -D cameras and so place higher demands on scintillator decay time. <b>Light</b> <b>output</b> affects <b>energy</b> resolution, and thus the ability of the camera to identify and reject events where the initial 511 keV photon has undergone Compton scatter in the patient.

We also tested a YAP matrix that consisted of pixels of the same size specification but was manufactured by a different company, who instead of white epoxy, used a thin aluminium reflective layer for optical isolation that resulted in a septal thickness of just 0. 01 mm, resulting in a much higher packing fraction.

The vehicles were driven on a 155 -km route under conditions of active precipitation or no precipitation, and with or without the headlamps on. Subsequent to each drive, measurements of <b>light</b> <b>output</b> were made at eight key test points in the headlamp beam pattern. The headlamps were then cleaned and measured again. In this way, each headlamp served as its own control. The results indicate that hydrophobic treatment of glass headlamp lenses did not affect <b>light</b> <b>output.</b> However, the presence of precipitation did result in decreased <b>light</b> <b>output</b> below the horizontal cutoff of the beam pattern and increased <b>light</b> <b>output</b> above the horizontal cutoff. This result was especially evident above the horizontal cutoff when the headlamps had been illuminated. The side of the vehicle the headlamp was on did not affect <b>light</b> <b>output...</b>|$|R
