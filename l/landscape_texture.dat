Second, we show that bird communities in agricultural regions had fewer body mass groups and fewer functional groups than expected by chance. This suggests that both the function and the resilience of bird communities in agricultural regions were reduced.

40|$|AbstractTo explore {{application}} of fractal analysis to study texture features of microscopic images, a critical exponent analysis (CEA) method is {{proposed to improve}} classification ability of histological structures in microscopic breast cancer images based on one-dimensional (1 D) sequences. Fractal analysis is commonly a mathematical tool for handling with a complex system. A method of estimating fractal dimension (FD) {{has been found to}} be useful for an analysis of various medical images. The CEA has been established as an important tool for detecting the FD parameter of the self-affine series information. To reduce computational complexity, two-dimensional (2 D) images are firstly preprocessed to form two 1 D sequences, including horizontal and vertical landscapes, and then their complexity and self-affinity are detected using the CEA. Subsequently, the FDs at different image orientations are analyzed. Results from both horizontal and vertical landscape sequences indicate that a region of stromal cells has the FD value higher than a region of cancer cells and a region of lymphocytes; in contrast, a region of lymphocytes has the FD value lower than other two regions. Results of the p values obtained from analysis-of-variance of FDs from three regions of histological structures indicate that the difference between mean FDs of three regions from vertical landscape is statistically more significant than that of three regions from horizontal <b>landscape.</b> <b>Texture</b> features computed from the CEA method can be useful for solving the classification of breast cancer cell from microscopic images that is difficult to classify if a colour feature and a spatial feature, notably shape, of cells are similar to each other...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{methodology}} to generate 30 -m resolution land surface albedo using Landsat surface reflectance and anisotropy information from concurrent MODIS 500 -m observations. Albedo information at fine spatial resolution is particularly useful for quantifying climate impacts associated with land use change and ecosystem disturbance. The derived white-sky and black-sky spectral albedos maybe {{used to estimate}} actual spectral albedos by {{taking into account the}} proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation arriving at the ground. A further spectral-to-broadband conversion based on extensive radiative transfer simulations is applied to produce the broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. The accuracy of this approach has been evaluated using 270 Landsat scenes covering six field stations supported by the SURFace RADiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM/SGP) network. Comparison with field measurements shows that Landsat 30 -m snow-free shortwave albedos from all seasons generally achieve an absolute accuracy of +/- 0. 02 - 0. 05 for these validation sites during available clear days in 2003 - 2005,with a root mean square error less than 0. 03 and a bias less than 0. 02. This level of accuracy has been regarded as sufficient for driving global and regional climate models. The Landsat-based retrievals have also been compared to the operational 16 -day MODIS albedo produced every 8 -days from MODIS on Terra and Aqua (MCD 43 A).

40|$|Land surface albedo {{has been}} {{recognized}} by the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) as an essential climate variable crucial for accurate modeling and monitoring of the Earth's radiative budget. While global climate studies can leverage albedo datasets from MODIS, VIIRS, and other coarse-resolution sensors, many applications in heterogeneous environments can benefit from higher-resolution albedo products derived from Landsat. We previously developed a "MODIS-concurrent" approach for the 30 -meter albedo estimation which relied on combining post- 2000 Landsat data with MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) information. Here we present a "pre-MODIS era" approach to extend 30 -m surface albedo generation in time back to the 1980 s, through an a priori anisotropy Look-Up Table (LUT) built up from the high quality MCD 43 A BRDF estimates over representative homogenous regions. Each entry in the LUT reflects a unique combination of land cover, seasonality, terrain information, disturbance age and type, and Landsat optical spectral bands. An initial conceptual LUT was created for the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States and provides BRDF shapes estimated from MODIS observations for undisturbed and disturbed surface types (including recovery trajectories of burned areas and non-fire disturbances). By accepting the assumption of a generally invariant BRDF shape for similar land surface structures as a priori information, spectral white-sky and black-sky albedos are derived through albedo-to-nadir reflectance ratios as {{a bridge between the}} Landsat and MODIS scale. A further narrow-to-broadband conversion based on radiative transfer simulations is adopted to produce broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. We evaluate the accuracy of resultant Landsat albedo using available field measurements at forested AmeriFlux stations in the PNW region, and examine the consistency of the surface albedo generated by this approach respectively with that from the "concurrent" approach and the coincident MODIS operational surface albedo products. Using the tower measurements as reference, the derived Landsat 30 -m snow-free shortwave broadband albedo yields an absolute accuracy of 0. 02 with a root mean square error less than 0. 016 and a bias of no more than 0. 007. A further cross-comparison over individual scenes shows that the retrieved white sky shortwave albedo from the "pre-MODIS era" LUT approach is highly consistent (R(exp 2) = 0. 988, the scene-averaged low RMSE = 0. 009 and bias = 0. 005) with that generated by the earlier "concurrent" approach. The Landsat albedo also exhibits more detailed <b>landscape</b> <b>texture</b> and a wider dynamic range of albedo values than the coincident 500 -m MODIS operational products (MCD 43 A 3), especially in the heterogeneous regions. Collectively, the "pre-MODIS" LUT and "concurrent" approaches provide a practical way to retrieve long-term Landsat albedo from the historic Landsat archives {{as far back as the}} 1980 s, as well as the current Landsat- 8 mission, and thus support investigations into the evolution of the albedo of terrestrial biomes at fine resolution...|$|E

Havaalanlarını kente bağlayan karayolu güzergahlarının temel işlevi; trafik sirkülasyonunun emniyetli, güvenli ve hızlı olarak sağlanması, peyzaj elemanları ile arasında estetik, görsel ve fiziksel bir bütünlük oluşturarak, yolu kullananlara ahenkli ve dengeli bir manzara imkanı sağlanmasıdır. Karayolu çevresinde yapılacak peyzaj düzenlemesi, güzergah boyunca tahrip olan peyzaj dokusunun yeniden oluşturulmasıyla karayolu sistemine pek çok katkı sağlayacağı gibi, yolu ilk kez kullanan insanların kenti algılayışına yön vererek, kente dair temel fikirlerinin oluşmasında etkili olur. Havayolu ulaşım talebinin gün geçtikçe artması ve İstanbul Atatürk Uluslararası Havaalanı’nın da bu büyüme trendini sürdürüyor oluşu, erişim sağlayan karayolu güzergahının kalitesinin sorgulanmasına neden olmaktadır. Günümüzde hep bir yerlere, kısıtlı zamanlarda yetişme telaşı içerisinde kalınması nedeniyle uçak yolculukları, başlangıç ve bitişinde yolcuda belirgin bir stres meydana getirmektedir. Bu bakımdan; havaalanlarını kente bağlayan karayolu ulaşım akslarının, kesintisiz ulaşım sağlaması, emniyetli ve güvenli planlanması, estetik ve görsel açıdan da güzel manzara olanakları sunması önem taşımaktadır. Bu çalışma kapsamında D- 100 güzergahı; İstanbul Atatürk Uluslararası Havaalanı’na erişim sağlayan ana arter olması nedeniyle bir prestij yolu olma özelliği ve sıklıkla kent dokusunun içinden geçmesi nedeniyle kent sirkülasyonunda da önemli yeri olması bakımından incelemeye alınmıştır.

Airports {{which are}} the symbol of {{prestige}} with being the best gates speciality and opening outside fort the cities, everyday being landlords for thousands of passengers everyday, {{needs to have a}} successful management system inside of it and needs an effective transport plannig at the axles which connect to the city. The main function of highways which combine airports to a city is provide traffic circulation in a safe and fast way, consist of aesthetics, visual and physical balance among landscape and people and provide aesthetics for the people who use the highway colourful and balanced view possibility. The landscape planning around the motorway with the becoming of <b>landscape</b> <b>texture</b> again which was destroyed along the way, providing motorway system a lot by leading {{to the people who are}} experiencing the way for the first time understanding the city, becomes effective with the main ideas of city life. People who are travelling by plane to a city for the first time consists of by taking individual air photos the first impressions about city life. Understanding the city from height of thousands of feet is about the highway net earth shapes, watery areas, the densities of building-green areas and the most important thing of city’s shape. Highway which provides different size of transport groups of circulation in day time with the green area system of arranged around it, again movement, defined- lights from the above photographs of the most evident and attractive thing. Today the number of vehicles are increasing everyday and developed and it is needed enough highway systems, the developments about the landscape of around the highway, it is essential to give importance inside the highway. To have projects of high standard highways along the highway which passes inside and along the corridor to combine way and other things to surroundings landscape, to have a connection, negative pressures of the environment (air, water pollution, as a result of salt usage soil’s barrenness, noise-visual pollution etc.) as soon as possible to eliminate, it is possible with the protection of landscape along the highway and development of it. The demand of airline transport is increasing day by day and İstanbul Atatürk Airport going on with this increase trend it becomes reason of questioning to reach the highway quality. Today to somewhere, as a result of reaching places in limited time travelling by planes at the beginning and at the end causes for the passenger to have stress. Therefore, transport axles which connect highway to airports, providing unlimited transport, planning in a safe way presenting beautiful view possibilities in aesthetics and visual way. In this work to İstanbul Atatürk International Airport providing reach and main arterial road beside being a prestige way often with the reason of city pattern, it has been examined that D- 100 route which has an important place in city circulation. From Mecidiyeköy which is a part of central business district and has other possible transport ways as an alternative to highway, dense pedestrian-vehicle circulation along the route of until Atatürk International Airport by combining the actual air photographs city analyses have been done and potentials have been evaluated. This work; first of all plan staff members of highway landscape project need; precautions which will be taken within highway landscape mending, and how effective the arrangements that passes through the way the landscape arrangements, the need of highway in the matter of plan should be examined and aims to prove. The aim is that restore the habitat which is destroyed at highway routes, not only to tell the landcape pattern mending development of ecological and sustaniable works, but also to examine the town-dweller often used, the first experience of people who arrive from outside the city, on these highways which pass from city pattern, the people who use the way (driver, passenger, pedestrian, owners of the flats around the way) with this point of view, around the route landscape effective degree increase landscape arrangements that will be done and what they are. In the light of this it has been discussed about the city first impressions taken, highway routes which provide connection to airports and the prestige symbol for cities. The aim is for a prestige way, providing along the highway different characteristics and D- 100 route of European part, that provides reaching to Atatürk International Airport, possible landscape planning that is the increase of effect value. D- 100 highway route landscape characteristics, have been discussed mainly in five parts along the route landscape pattern quality differences and with the reason of landscape planning that will be done the area for the government size differences. Five different landscape which were confirmed along the highway in fact, around the route landscape types were evaulated and as a result of this, Mecidiyeköy, Haliç Bridge, Edirnekapı, Bahçelievler and close to Atatürk :International Airport each of the part problems were defined, and it has been presented about landscape potentials developments and offers devoted to affect degree increase. The first thing that must be done the overpass of Mecidiyeköy, to protect the building users from noise which is because of vehicle and finding out the obstacles. As a result of not finding enough place for plantal screening, as it was given in Guangzhou sample, to protect effective key from noise and dust, driver’s eye level height was designed as transparent -it can be related to town identity- to build an artificial noise barriers. The highway advertisements along the way outside of the buildings and on every surface must be limited because speed limit is high on this type of highways so it is important to prevent the care of drivers. Therefore, such protections shoul be taken like advertisements should be given in traffic flow running in one way or taking under control of covered area size and not to contain a lot of colours details. Along Haliç Bridge, outfit members beside functions to give importance to its aesthetics specialities from D- 100 other parts it has to be planned differently. Like in HongKong sample, the lights which will mention bridge’s visual and aesthetics specialities and margent-obstacle designs must be done changes. Although the area is so little for plant to grow it must be encouraged between bridges and corridors which have wire to protect possible accidents. It is important concrete margents which look towards the way, at the margent fixed light member with building, lighting the inside of the way, in cold and rainy weather for driver, according to asphalted surface condition to provide possibility and night bridge lights making stronger from the view of effect degree increase. In Edirnekapı part, not to do terracing wall at slope areas in a gradual way, building in an only one height serves the driver away from aesthetics strong-solid view. Thus, way area defined soften the high concrete relying upon walls contructional impression choosing the way of natural planting on the wall will provide a positive effect. And what is more, along the way the first example in this area pedestrian overpasses used and overpasses close to AHL often repeated inside flower pots for each season plant usage, by driver a noneffective view shows. While going both from the way and speed of the vehicle not plants for season it is possible to see the plastic flower pots which were put regularly and a little detail for planting, it can not provide essential green effect. It’s compulsory to do herbal screening in green areas in Bahçelievler part beside the way left nationalization spread rather convenient and existing building areas close to the way. Thus, like in the Guangzhou sample starting from coniferous tree which falls the leaves coniferous plant group and plant group for season shading the place and towards the way the height is decreasing it must be done thick herbal screen as much as possible. On the parts which are not suitable for high plants grow and these areas Around the motorway becomes narrow, noise walls designed with to nature from convenient equipments it must be encouraged a natural landscape by using, in front of it, medium tree. Thus, from the point of driver not only nature will be seen positive, flat user who is close to the highway, will be provided to develop a positive psychology about the highway which has a heavy traffic. Moreover, in this area plant usage in each season, along the slopes it has been built as to consist of design. However, instead of this example, which presents an effective visuality and repeats itself constantly, by using plant group for each season and area hiding, from growing conditions in accordance with each other, mulching which will be done designs on the surface, changing the type of grass or stones etc. examples will be more effective. The other point is that must be noticed metrobus stops take place in this part, providing the control of pedestrian movements, by planning with designs of pedestrian overhead crossings following each other, consisting of same areas, providing comfort for pedestrian, and not to harm to the concentration of driver, tidy, clean visuality. At the limited parts where metrobus users stop, instead of plants which continue their development in a difficult condition and in concrete cases, seat groups which will provide the need of waiting people, kiosks, exhibition halls etc. must be full of these activities. Along the D- 100 route providing the movements of pedestrians in a particular standard by taking under control of not to warn the driver and to make it comfortable with using it again along the way only one type of overhead crossing area solving, presenting clean and aethetics visuality, it must be mentioned with suitable design or a new contest by the municipiality. The main points that must be noticed on the route of AHL and close to it, developing the new projects about the city identity, beside the aesthetics and visuality choosing suitable plant types, described green spaces beside the motorway and making it whole with the way it can be put in order like these. Plant groups at the green areas must be arraged again, type choices must be done with effective visuality. Moreover at the traffic islands which have huge green area with the aim of emphasis when it was done only one type of planting to emphasize for the area aesthetics it must be increased for night point of view with LED lights it must be made stronger. Generally around the world airports who give important messages in the name of sustaniable (management of waste, decrease of noise, green building samples etc.) it is expected to show same sensibility at the reach reach route. With this aim, landscape planning that will be done, will be able to provide contribution for the productivity of the soil and harmony for the nature conditions in a best way, it will need less water, fertilizer and medicine in comparison with other plant types, these types will be chosen and it must be provided for the people who use the way to get a view which is close to natural views. However, as it was given in Bangkok example, as a prestige way and the last route to the AHL making it rich with the city identity points which will be the one of the best and it will increase the degree of effect for the people who use the way as it gives messages for sustainable development.

The images are of conspicuously of natural forms, <b>landscapes</b> and <b>textures.</b> They are also in some ways essentially vacant, in the sense that there is seldom any human presence. But perhaps more importantly, they are vacated of any specificity. For example a recurrent mountain is simply ‘mountain’; the sea is ‘sea’ and so on. Subtitles appear sporadically throughout, and are discernibly ‘off screen’ – most likely an interior monologue, they are non-sequiturs that are obscure and occasionally nightmarish in their observations. They are excerpted from the final diaries of my father, kept as he knew he was dying, though this information remains tacit...|$|R
40|$|This poster showcases {{a scenic}} design for Talley’s Folly by Lanford Wilson. The play {{takes place in}} a {{riverside}} boathouse located near a farm in Lebanon, Missouri, on July 4, 1944. In developing the design concept, I pursued the Victorian and Gothic revival gingerbread imagery and romantic aesthetic Wilson created within the script. During my early research, I found Thomas W. Schaller’s paintings Evening in Spring and Fishing in Central Park. Schaller’s blending of watercolors inspired the romantic aesthetic and unification of the <b>landscape’s</b> colors, <b>textures,</b> and inorganic and organic structures. The way in which Schaller conveys peace, seclusion, and nature very much influenced the design. Evening skies and earthy tones determined the color scheme. The gazebo’s hexagonal shape influenced the symmetrical, central, and simple layout of scenery, with the riverside open to the audience in thrust formation. The turntable provides a unique element in the design. Moving very slowly throughout Matt’s opening monologue, the physical change mirrors the movement of the text and facilitates the transition from the exterior of the boathouse to an interior view that focuses the fourth-wall staging {{of the rest of the}} play.

The system uses multiple images, 3 -D models and camera information, {{in addition to}} knowledge about man-made structures, to cope with problems such as perspective distortion, data deficiency, and corruption caused by shadows and occlusions. Combined with the Ascender site modeling system [3] and scene rendering algorithms, the system is typically useful for urban site model refinement and visualization. 1 Introduction Visualization and virtual reality applications are now capable of generating high-quality renderings and animations of textured geometric objects. In certain applications such as <b>landscape</b> architecture, surface <b>textures</b> (intensity variations on building faces) and microstructures (small structures that are attached to building faces, such as windows and doors) are two important factors that determine the realism of the renderings [...] ...|$|R

(This instruction is not included in the 1950 edition of the score, being replaced by a written rhythmic line and instruction [...] "cad. ad lib." [...] after a few bars.)

40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{computer}} game design is toward larger and richer virtual worlds, providing interesting and abundant game content for players to explore. The creation and continuous expansion of detailed virtual environments, however, {{is a time}} and resource-consuming task for game developers. Procedural content generation po-tentially solves this problem; <b>textures,</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and more recently the creation of entire cities and their constituent roads and buildings can be performed in an auto-mated fashion, potentially offering considerable resource savings for developers. This thesis develops a comprehensive system for content generation, centering on a hierar-chical world design. The Arda tool {{is presented as a}} modular system for supporting automatic content generation in a game context. Arda is composed of a framework for internally managing environmental data and content-generation algorithms, in addition to a graphical tool providing a simplified interface for generating video game content. The tool supports extensive customization, which is demonstrated through a novel algorithm for efficient and realistic city (road-plan) generation. Experimenta...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Several novel methods {{based on}} {{intelligent}} recognition techniques are presented. This {{is an extension}} of our earlier work that utilises a number of these techniques, which included production rules, genetic algorithms and associative memories. The first additions involve the use of an implied grammar that is derived from a dermatology heuristic that describes lesion morphology characteristics; this is also known by its mnemonic ‘ABCDE’. The technique is combined with both our novel neural adaptive architecture and an image transform, the HALOGRAPH. This combination extracts the requisite components from the lesion image defined by the grammar, from which subsequently a diagnosis is generated. Another aspect of the lesion morphology is also considered: texture. The technique applied here makes use of Laws basis function to describe its structure. The <b>texture</b> <b>landscape</b> is defined as an energy profile. One of the limitations of our previous system involved the creation of volumes of information during the analysis phase, and to limit this effect we now apply PCA. The inclusion of this technique provides a reduction in the information content while retaining the essential detail, and it also acts as a method of feature recognition. A further side effect of this approach is that it can be used as an encoder to assist the simplification process of the internal definition of the evolving neural architecture...|$|R
40|$|Questions] Humid savannas can be {{considered}} fire-filtered landscapes because fire is very frequent (< 10 yr return intervals) and only fire-resistant species can occur. This flammable vegetation can be functionally heterogeneous, structurally and floristically patchy. We hypothesized that resource availability (mainly water and nutrient availabilities) accounted {{for most of the}} functional and phylogenetic spatial structure of communities across these savanna landscapes. [Location] Emas National Park, central Brazil. [Methods] We used individual-based functional trait, phylogenetic and environmental data combined with spatial information to assess the main drivers and mechanisms of community functional change (turnover) in a large fire-filtered savanna landscape. We used Mantel correlograms and a maximum rank correlation approach to assess the spatial structure and the subset of landscape factors that best predict compositional, phylogenetic, species-based and individual-based functional community turnovers and the mechanism by which they do operate. [Results] Communities were spatially structured across the landscape, presenting functional convergence at shorter distances and divergence at larger distances. All of the turnover metrics presented unique spatial structures and were correlated with a unique set of <b>landscape</b> predictors. Soil <b>texture</b> accounted for the largest fraction of the spatial structure, but soil N availability, pH, altitude and fire frequency were also important. [Conclusions] Our results support the idea that the patchy distribution of water and nutrients mediated by clay content shape community membership in fire-filtered savannas, whereas current variations in fire frequency interact with resource availability to shift community attributes from species average trait values (intraspecific variability).

40|$|A produtividade em sistemas agrícolas de subsistência depende do nível de fertilidade natural do solo. Em condições de relevo forte ondulado, espera-se que a fertilidade do solo se modifique não apenas pelo tipo de uso mas, também, devido à sua posição no relevo. Para avaliar essas modificações, 260 amostras simples de solo (0 - 20 cm) da microbacia Vaca Brava, PB, representando combinações de três usos do solo, cinco posições no relevo e cinco classes texturais, foram analisadas quanto aos teores de P disponível, bases e acidez trocáveis. Ca e Mg compreenderam 75 - 80 % dos cátions trocáveis, K e Na, de 10 a 15 %, e H+Al, 10 %; o valor de pH médio foi 5, 5, enquanto P Mehlich- 1 foi, em média, 3, 8 mg kg- 1 solo.

Under strongly undulated relief conditions, {{it is expected}} that soil fertility will be determined not only by land use, but also by the position in the landscape. To study these relationships 260 single soil samples (0 - 20 cm) from the Vaca Brava watershed, Paraiba, representing combinations of three land uses, five positions in the <b>landscape</b> and five <b>textures</b> were analyzed for extractable P, exchangeable bases and soil acidity.

Although land use, relief and texture exerted significant effects (p < 0. 05) upon certain nutrient concentrations, in a broad sense the watershed appeared relatively uniform. The main effect of land use resulted from the use of animal manure in areas of subsistence agriculture and fodder, which were preferentially located at the base of stopes and low lands positions. Approximately 80 % of the samples were low in extractable P, while 70 % had medium levels of extractable K. However, when available K was estimated by the K/(Ca+Mg) 0, 5 ratio, most samples were classified as low...|$|R
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 63 : 55 in lengthThe five works presented on this graduate percussion recital represent {{the wide range}} of music available in the percussion repertory both in the types of percussion instruments represented and the periods and styles of the music. Although only works from the baroque era and the twentieth century are represented on this program, transcriptions of works from the renaissance, classic, and romantic eras are available to the percussionists of today. The recital opens with the chaconne from the Partita no. 2 in D Minor from the set of Six Sonatas and Partitas for Violin Solo by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750), representing repertory from the baroque era. This movement, set in the style of a the dance known as the sarabande, is the final movement of this partita, actually a set of five works in dance styles also including an allemande, acourante, a sarabande (different from the chaconne) and a gigue. Written during Bach's tenure at the court of Anhalt-Cothen, the Chaconne is a large set of variations on a four-note ground bass theme. Performed on this recital on the vibraphone, the chaconne is a cornerstone of the violin repertory, and tests the performer on the levels of patience, technique, endurance, musicality. Images, for four timpani, five cymbals, and large tam tam, is the first of two pieces by William Kraft (b. 1923) to be performed on this program and is representative of repertory from the twentieth century. this piece, composed in 1978, is set in four movements, each of which is dedicated to a different master of the timpani; Saul Goodman, Cloyd Duff, Vic Firth, and Fred Hinger. This work is unique in its original blending of the use of different special effects and techniques with lyrical and beautifully conceived textures and melodies. Due to its technical and musical demands, images stands as one of the premier pieces in the solo timpani repertory and well represents the graduate level of achievement. Encounters V also by Mr. Kraft, is scored for one percussionist and 'cello and was inspired by a poem by Carl Faber entitled In the Morning of the Winter sea, which reads as follows: This work, commissioned by the ford foundation for violoncellist Nathaniel Rosen, was premiered in new York by the composer and Mr. Rosen in 1976 and revised into its present state in 1982. The percussion part of the piece is written for vibraphone (played with bass bows, normal mallets, and specially made "cluster" mallets), three tams, five graduated drums, crotales, and car spring coil, while the 'cello part makes use of difficult harmonics, col legno, pizzicato and snap pizzicato techniques. Together these parts blend to from an eerie musical atmosphere reminiscent of Mr. Faber's poem. Also part of the modern repertory for percussion, the Duo for Two Marimbas by David Wheatley is a Three movement work composed in 1978 and scored for two percussionists playing two marimbas. the first movement features challenging four-mallet work and difficult mallet changes as the texture moves from boisterous septal chordal exclamations to softer, more lyrical textures and melodies. The second movements is a study in space and control as each player Navigates a very sparse musical <b>landscape</b> where <b>texture</b> is altered by changes in mallet type and hardness. The finale is an exciting two mallet movement based on quartal harmony. The final work of the recital is a piece of some importance to the continuing legacy of jazz music and specifically jazz drumming, music which exits only in the twentieth century. This piece was passed to Jazz drummer Max Roach aurally by Jonathan (Papa Jo) Jones, drummer with the early Count Basie Band, who composed this work. This aural transmission is a staple of the African tradition in jazz music. performed on the Hi-Hat alone,"this piece," says Mr. Roach,"teaches one how to do the most with the least.... The title of the piece is simply 'Papa Jo"...|$|R
