500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} we would go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you to}} your face that we would pay you if we thought we were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong. We just wanted to essentially <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|The film {{includes}} four role-playing scenes. In the first, a man tells a girl {{that he will}} buy her a toy if she goes home with him. In the second, eight-year-old Natasha goes to her friend's house and finds that only her friend's father is home; after he intentionally spills water on her clothes, he tells her to take them off. The film cuts to Harris, who says, [...] "She should <b>look</b> <b>him</b> {{straight in the eye}} and tell him to stop, go away". In the third scene, a group of older boys try to lure young children into their [...] "special club"; they lead one young boy to a secluded, wooded area and try to convince him to remove his clothes. In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E
500|$|New York {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making {{headlines}} off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, Hank Bauer and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management's patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the Kansas City Athletics. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel could not <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the eye as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.|$|E

500|$|Alice's matrimonial {{plans were}} begun in 1860 by her mother. Queen Victoria had {{expressed}} her wish that her children should marry for love, {{but this did}} not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. Raising a British subject to royalty, however high their rank, was politically objectionable, and also wasted any opportunity for a useful foreign alliance. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, recently married to Prince Frederick of Prussia, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only two suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia, cousin to Victoria's husband Frederick. The Prince of Orange was soon discounted. He journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could <b>look</b> <b>him</b> over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother, Queen Sophie of the Netherlands. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick of Prussia remarking that his cousin would not do for [...] "one who deserves the very best".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, {{a sister}} {{of one of}} the victims {{expressed}} her desire to visit and forgive him, saying [...] "I want to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the eye and make sure he knows our pain... God will judge him". She said the decision to release him was [...] "more than we could ever expect from Libya if the tables were turned." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{religious}} {{paintings were}} sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ {{in the sky}} in his painting of Saint-Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of Simon Vouet for having [...] "Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy". Poussin responded that [...] "he could {{not and should not}} imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the face".|$|E

2500|$|Diaghilev {{was known}} as a hard, demanding, even {{frightening}} taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too afraid to ever <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the face. George Balanchine said he carried around a cane during rehearsals, and banged it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914–18 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballet Russes and would later say that she had called Diaghilev [...] "Sergypops" [...] and he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.|$|E
2500|$|In his March 1845 inaugural address, President Polk {{quoted from}} the party platform, saying that the U.S. title to Oregon was [...] "clear and unquestionable". Tensions grew, with both sides moving to {{strengthen}} border fortifications in anticipation of war. Despite Polk's bold language, he was actually prepared to compromise, and had no real desire {{to go to war}} over Oregon. He believed that a firm stance would compel the British to accept a resolution agreeable to the United States. While meeting with Representative James A. Black on 4 January 1846, Polk stated that [...] "the only way to treat John Bull was to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> straight in the eye... if Congress faultered ... John Bull would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands..." [...] But Polk's position on Oregon was not mere posturing: he genuinely believed that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire region. He rejected British offers to settle the dispute through arbitration, fearing that no impartial third party could be found.|$|E
2500|$|Republican candidates, running {{concurrently}} {{with the}} 1964 federal election, were {{undermined by the}} unpopularity of Barry Goldwater, the Republican challenger for the US Presidency, {{and the leader of}} their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should [...] "duck" [...] Goldwater as they feared any association with the Arizona Senator would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his [...] "political Godfather", reportedly told his aides, [...] "Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him now, I could never <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the face again. I would rather lose." [...] The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) [...] Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes. [...] The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.|$|E

2500|$|One {{image from}} his Facebook page depicts Roof wearing a jacket {{decorated}} with two emblems that are popular among American white supremacists: {{the flag of}} the former Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe) and the flag of apartheid-era South Africa. Roof reportedly told friends and neighbors of his plans to kill people, including a plot to attack the College of Charleston, but his claims were not taken seriously. On June 20, a website was discovered called The Last Rhodesian (www.lastrhodesian.com); it had been registered to a [...] "Dylann Roof" [...] on February 9, 2015. The website included what appeared to be an unsigned manifesto containing Roof's opinions of [...] "Blacks", [...] "Jews", [...] "Hispanics" [...] and [...] "East Asians", as well a cache of photos, including an image of Roof posing with a handgun and a Confederate Battle Flag. In this manifesto, Roof says he became [...] "racially aware" [...] {{as a result of the}} 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, writing that because he kept hearing people talk about the incident, he [...] "decided to <b>look</b> <b>him</b> up" [...] and read the Wikipedia article about it. He concluded that George Zimmerman had been in the right, and he was unable to comprehend why the case had gained national attention. He said he then searched for [...] "black on White [...] crime" [...] on Google and found the website of the Council of Conservative Citizens, where he read [...] "pages upon pages" [...] of cases involving black people murdering white people. Roof then writes he has [...] "never been the same since that day".|$|E
