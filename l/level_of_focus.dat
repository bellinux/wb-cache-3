25|$|The {{framework}} {{is a logical}} structure for classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an enterprise. It is significant to both {{the management of the}} enterprise, and the actors involved in the development of enterprise systems. While there is no order of priority for the columns of the Framework, the top-down order of the rows is significant to the alignment of business concepts and the actual physical enterprise.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of {{students}} (N = 118) engaged in an 8 -week project to build an e-book chapter, this study finds that cognitive absorption impacts interpersonal conflict and team performance. In particular, virtual teams with aggregated higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> immersion and temporal dissociation (dimensions of cognitive absorption) demonstrate higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> performance and interpersonal conflict. Furthermore, there is an interaction effect between focus immersion and temporal dissociation that moderates the impact on performance and interpersonal conflict. The teams with aggregated high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> immersion and aggregated low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> temporal dissociation demonstrated the best performance and lowest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal conflict. The authors also found that individuals with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> immersion preferred asynchronous communication media, whereas individuals with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> temporal dissociation preferred synchronous communication media.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} impact of PBRS on public sector service quality in Botswana by exploring whether different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> customer oriented PBRS schemes impact customers’ perceptions of service quality. Six government departments were examined, three categorised as having high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> customer <b>focus</b> in their PBRS plans and three as having low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> customer <b>focus</b> in their PBRS plans. Marketing research generally suggests that customer orientation should improve organisational performance and bring about high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> customer satisfaction in both private (Narver & Slater, 1990) and public sector organisations (Cheng et al., 2004). Thus, it would be anticipated that customers should potentially be more satisfied if departments’ reward schemes were more customer focused.

The variations of both systems differ from each other based on their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> MTM-1 and MiniMOST are optimal for short processes with only small hand motions. BasicMOST, MODAPTS and MTM-UAS are more suitable for processes that average around 1 to 5 minutes, while MTM-B and MaxiMOST are more properly used for longer processes that are less repetitive.|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used form of MOST is BasicMOST, which was released in Sweden in 1972 and in the United States in 1974. Two other variations were released in 1980, called MiniMOST and MaxiMOST. The difference between the three is their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> - the motions recorded in BasicMOST are {{on the level of}} tens of TMUs, while MiniMOST uses individual TMUs and MaxiMOST uses hundreds of TMUs. This allows for a variety of applications - MiniMOST is commonly used for short (less than about a minute), repetitive cycles, and MaxiMOST for longer (more than several minutes), non-repetitive operations. BasicMost is in the position between them, and can be used accurately for operations ranging from less than a minute to about ten minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Within the tower, {{a highly}} disciplined {{communications}} process between air control and ground control {{is an absolute}} necessity. Air control must ensure that ground control is aware of any operations that will impact the taxiways, {{and work with the}} approach radar controllers to create [...] "gaps" [...] in the arrival traffic to allow taxiing traffic to cross runways and to allow departing aircraft to take off. Ground control need to keep the air controllers aware of the traffic flow towards their runways in order to maximise runway utilisation through effective approach spacing. Crew resource management (CRM) procedures are often used to ensure this communication process is efficient and clear.

50|$|Human {{physiology}} {{seeks to}} understand the mechanisms that work to keep the human body alive and functioning, through scientific enquiry {{into the nature of}} mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function in animals. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.|$|E
