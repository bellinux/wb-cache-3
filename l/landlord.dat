5|$|Rob-B-Hood {{tells the}} story of a {{kidnapping}} gone wrong in Hong Kong; a trio of burglars consisting of Thongs (Chan), Octopus (Koo) and the <b>Landlord</b> (Hui) kidnap a baby from a wealthy family on behalf of triads. With the <b>Landlord</b> arrested, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby for a short time, developing strong bonds with him. Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the triads who hired them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the <b>landlord</b> to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a <b>landlord</b> ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a <b>landlord</b> who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the <b>Landlord</b> {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The <b>Landlord</b> informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the <b>Landlord</b> will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the <b>Landlord</b> leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a <b>landlord</b> was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the <b>landlord</b> was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the <b>landlord</b> of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E

40|$|Studies on {{rent control}} have {{generally}} failed to elicit attitudes and reactions of <b>landlords</b> to rent control ordinances. This analysis attempts {{to fill the}} gap by querying 1357 <b>landlords</b> in San Diego County, an area currently without rent control. As expected, almost all the <b>landlords</b> were opposed to rent control. The <b>landlords</b> were asked if actual rent control enactment would impact their investment plans and, if so, how. They also were asked if the current threat of rent control is having an impact on their investment plans and, if so, how. The vast majority of <b>landlords</b> responded to both of these questions in the affirmative. The various answers on type of reaction center around two themes: getting out of the apartments business and a cessation of any further investment in apartments. A discriminant analysis showed numerous variables to be related to whether <b>landlords</b> are reactive to rent control enactment or the threat of rent control.

5|$|The Defective Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' {{liability}} for poorly constructed and poorly maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a <b>landlord</b> could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings. The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the <b>landlord</b> was still largely free from being sued.|$|E

5|$|Thongs and Octopus {{are taken}} to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the <b>Landlord,</b> who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the <b>Landlord</b> volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the <b>Landlord</b> then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the <b>Landlord</b> are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{analyzes}} {{the results of}} a survey of <b>landlords</b> regarding selection factors for different types of rental contracts. The results can be summarized through the following 3 observations. First, selection factors depend on landlords’ personal preferences. In Korea, rental contracts can be divided broadly into two types: Monthly Rent with Variable Deposit (MRVD) and Chonsei (multi-year rent paid up-front), which is a variant of MRVD. According to the survey results, most of the <b>landlords</b> who prefer MRVD are motivated by higher rental profits and a rental income stream that can cover living expenses. On the other hand, <b>landlords</b> who prefer Chonsei contracts are motivated by the leverage provided by sizable lump sums paid up-front by tenants. The second observation is that many <b>landlords</b> use the deposits from both MRVD and Chonsei to achieve financial leverage. The third observation is that many Chonsei <b>landlords</b> hope to convert their tenants to MRVD contracts, while almost all MRVD <b>landlords</b> want to increase the monthly rent and receiving a smaller up-front deposit. Some <b>landlords,</b> however, prefer Chonsei contracts because they don’t want to be exposed to tenant credit risk, i. e. overdue rent or non-payment. In logit analysis, older <b>landlords</b> tend to choose MRVD rental contracts and can be distinguished by their conspicuous preference for this rental type. In multiple regression analysis, other variables being held equal, MRVD <b>landlords</b> tend to lower required deposits and increase monthly rents as the difference between their yearly income and mortgage balance increases. Because this study does not use a sufficiently large sample size, these results cannot be extrapolated, however...|$|R

5|$|As a <b>landlord,</b> Coke was a {{firm believer}} in the right and moral {{obligation}} of a landowner {{to improve the quality of}} life of those living on his estates. The roles of <b>landlord</b> and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the <b>landlord</b> was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while the tenant would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts as a result of his uncle's work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke's uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better, but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this, after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.|$|E
