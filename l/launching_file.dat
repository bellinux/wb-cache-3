5000|$|Version 6.2 {{forced the}} user to {{constantly}} check for updates by installing and <b>launching</b> the <b>file</b> [...] "dpupdchk.exe" [...] in the background. It must stay in the background for the control panel's settings to launch (although it could be avoided by renaming the file to something else). Version 6.3 fixed this behavior by only making it an opt-in option during the installation.|$|R

The FTS application supervises parallel NE software download or NE Management Information Base (MIB) backup sessions for multiple supported NEs. FTS operations are based on “JOB”, which can be defined as a descriptor file which contains list of NEs and all the parameters required for action to be scheduled. This paper proposes a system which could be used for file transfer operations using SWIM framework...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} use of a Java Web Start framework called Initium. Initium generates a jar file that minimizes the number of included classes by performing a static class dependency analysis. It then prompts the programmer for security parameters that enable the programmatic signing of the jar file, {{for the purpose of}} authentication. Initium generates a local Java Network <b>Launch</b> Protocol <b>file</b> (JNLP file) for the purpose of testing, as well as a remote JNLP file, for deployment. Finally, Initium programmatically uploads both the JNLP and jar files to the web server, to complete the deployment cycle...|$|R
40|$|After {{unzipping}} the <b>file,</b> <b>launch</b> the <b>file</b> OverviewI. html in {{your browser}} window. The cartographic example presented below displays principles of spatial synthesis as {{they focus on}} centrality and hierarchy. * Classical example: The dot density map employs a nested hierarchy of regions to convert information about dots to information about regions; in so-doing, the clusters of dots emerge as centers of activity associated {{with the nature of}} the underlying data from which the dots were extracted. * Contemporary example: The interactive online map may employ a nested hierarchy that, in a single map, offers not only information of the sort available in a dot density map but also a host of other previously impossible features, as well. It may be linked to the underlying database in a manner that also permits o scale transformation o views of the database corresponding to small regions on the map o searches of the underlying database. Interactive capability can be far more than an interesting visualization tool; it can be one offering synthesis of spatial information at a level far greater than that available with any classical map...|$|R

The search box can search the system path, can show partial matches, and can show all results inside the menu.|$|R
50|$|The classic Mac OS {{disposed}} of filename-based extension metadata entirely, instead using a distinct file type code {{to identify the}} file format. Additionally, a creator code was specified to determine which application would be <b>launched</b> when the <b>file's</b> icon was double-clicked. macOS, however, uses filename suffixes, as well as type and creator codes, {{as a consequence of}} being derived from the UNIX-like NeXTSTEP operating system.|$|R

Discussions of these plots, merits and drawbacks, example suited and not suited for application, and a host of related matters persist in the social scientific (and other) literature. Our focus in this internet paper is on the geometric visualization of rank-size relations: not only as plots but also in other ways that have come about as a result of contemporary electronic and internet capability...|$|R

5000|$|In 1990, Wong {{used his}} entire savings - HK$500,000 - to <b>launch</b> News <b>File</b> magazine, but it closed down {{within two years}} and left him heavily in debt. On 18 March 1996, he {{established}} Mad Dog Daily, a tabloid with a clear [...] "Anti-communism" [...] and [...] "Anti-Tung" [...] stance. However, the paper suffered from a low sales volume, which Wong jokingly blamed on its [...] "journalistic integrity" [...] and refusal to participate in sensationalist journalism. After the Asian financial crisis, it transformed into a magazine in October 1997, and then was suspended shortly afterwards. As a result, Wong had to bear debts that amounted {{to a total of}} 15 million HKD. He repaid this debt in a matter of years by working on talk shows and other TV programmes.|$|R
