Fossil species are frequently remarkably stable over extremely <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> of geological time, despite continental drift, major climate changes, and mass extinctions.

Thus the fossil record suggests that evolution occurs in bursts, interspersed by <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> of evolutionary stagnation in so-called punctuated equilibria.
