50|$|DuBiel rifles were {{constructed}} using only patented DuBiel actions which feature a five <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> locking mechanism {{resulting in a}} 36 degree bolt rotation. The short rotation produced the fastest bolt-action rifle available at the time. The actions were produced in three lengths, both right and left hand configurations.|$|E
50|$|Lindley's last career Grand National start came at Richmond in 1985 for Bobby Hawkins in a {{car with}} Larry McReynolds as crew chief. He drove the #16 Carolina Tool Chevrolet, started 17th and was running near the front before a <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> fell off and he settled for a 19th-place finish.|$|E
50|$|The 2004-05 models {{received}} minor revisions. Cosmetic changes included revised headlight (dual bulb setup) and taillight designs, standard side skirts, and {{an option}} for a HFP (Honda Factory Performance) upgrade. The suspension was updated with a change from 4 lug to 5 <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, a larger rear sway bar, and a change from 15-inch wheels (195/60-15) to 16-inch wheels (205/55-16). The interior received more silver accents {{in place of the}} chrome ones (the lock switch).|$|E
5000|$|These CAD models {{describe}} {{not simply}} the envelope or shape of the object, but CAD models also embody the [...] "design intent" [...] (i.e., critical features {{and their relationship to}} other features). An example of design intent not evident in the shape alone might be a brake drum's <b>lug</b> <b>bolts,</b> which must be concentric with the hole in the centre of the drum. This knowledge would drive the sequence and method of creating the CAD model; a designer with an awareness of this relationship would not design the <b>lug</b> <b>bolts</b> referenced to the outside diameter, but instead, to the center. A modeler creating a CAD model will want to include both Shape and design intent in the complete CAD model.|$|R

David Pearson passed Ned Jarrett 23 laps from the finish and won the 100-mile race ...|$|R
50|$|A lug nut is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of lug nuts are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to threaded wheel studs and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use <b>lug</b> <b>bolts</b> instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (threaded) hole in the wheel's hub or drum brake or disc. This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
5000|$|... 1967 {{begins the}} [...] "Second Generation" [...] ChevyVan {{with a whole}} new look to the van and {{offering}} a longer 108" [...] wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time. GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield. 1967 was the only early 2nd generation {{that did not have}} side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional V8 Chevrolet Small-Block engine. Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase 90 in or the new optional long wheelbase 108 in with 5 on 4&3/4" [...] <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van. The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.For 1967, the 140 hp (100 kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155 hp (116 kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175 hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, V8. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir master cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{the same}} {{principles}} as the Remington 700 series, the Model 710 uses a centerfire bolt action cartridge, a 3 <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> system {{as opposed to the}} Remington 700's dual opposed locking lugs, with a 4 round detachable magazine (or a 3 round for the 7 mm Remington Magnum and the [...]300 Winchester Magnum). All can be equipped with a bipod and sling, and comes equipped with a gray or olive drab rugged all-weather synthetic stock, and a mounted Bushnell Sharpshooter, 3-9 × 40 scope which is bore-sighted from the factory. The Remington 710 is a moderately priced rifle. With the synthetic stock and the already mounted scope, it makes an adequate rifle for the novice shooter or hunter.|$|E
5000|$|This development, {{named the}} Pattern 1913 Enfield or P13, {{included}} a front locking, dual <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> action with Mauser type claw extractor {{as well as}} a new, powerful rimless [...]276 Enfield cartridge. The design carried over a Lee-Enfield type safety {{at the rear of the}} action and a bolt that cocked on closing to ease unlocking of the bolt during rapid fire. An advanced design of aperture rearsight and a long sight radius were incorporated to maximize accuracy potential. Ease of manufacture was also an important criterion. However, the onset of World War I came too quickly for the UK to put it into production before the new cartridge could be perfected, as it suffered from overheating in rapid fire and bore fouling.|$|E

5000|$|Numerous changes {{occurred}} in 1971. First came another new grille design (the [...] "egg crate") for Chevrolet trucks and black paint over {{portions of the}} GMC grille. Second, an additional trim package was introduced: the Cheyenne. On GMC models, this {{was referred to as}} the Sierra. These packages consisted mostly of comfort features — nicer interiors, more padding and insulation, carpet, chrome trim, and upper and lower side molding and tailgate trim. 1971 was the first year for AM/FM radios factory installed. Finally, the front brakes on all light-duty trucks were switched from drum brakes to disc brakes, resulting in much less brake fade under heavy use. While prior C/K half-ton trucks had used a six-lug bolt pattern (6 x 5.5") for the wheels, two-wheel-drive models switched to a five-lug pattern (5 x 5-inch bolt circle) common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac passenger cars. The 1/2 ton 4 x 4 retained the 6 <b>lug</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. This bolt pattern would remain the standard {{through the end of the}} C/K series (along with the Chevrolet/GMC vans). The 20 and 30-series trucks had the 8 x 6.5" [...] pattern. Also, Chevrolet changed the 396 V8 emblem designation to 400 V8.|$|E
5000|$|Larry Frank was the last-place {{finisher}} of {{this event}} due to his car overheating on lap 29. George Green would become the final driver to finish the event while David Pearson's faulty <b>lug</b> <b>bolts</b> would prevent him from acquiring a [...] "top five" [...] finish. Most of the vehicles in this race were Pontiac or Chevrolet. All of the drivers {{were born in the}} United States of America; no foreigners attempted to qualify for this racing event. Bobby Johns would eventually defeat Fireball Roberts by a margin of six laps; making Johns the only finisher on the lead lap. Gene Blackburn would retire from NASCAR Cup Series racing after this event.|$|R
50|$|Locking was {{achieved}} by a solid bolt head and three <b>bolt</b> <b>lugs.</b> The <b>bolt</b> head {{was designed to be}} removable thus allowing the owner to vary the head space by replacing the head. The bolt head is of the floating type whereby it is a loose fit in the bolt tube and held in place by a pin, the firing pin passing through a hole in that pin. This allows the locking lugs to self centre with even pressure when the action is locked.|$|R
40|$|Contact maps of an {{electrical}} interface are acquired using an x-ray computer tomography technique {{without the need}} for dismantling the specimens. These maps consist of approximately 1500 × 1500 pixels with each pixel relating to an 8. 0 µm by 8. 0 µm by 8. 0 µm volume at the interface. The specimens consist of a cable <b>lug</b> <b>bolted</b> to a printed circuit board at various contact normal forces of between 0. 8 and 3. 2 kN. The contact maps reveal a complex network of contacting 'islands' with meandering perimeters consisting of contacting 'peninsulas' and non-contacting 'fjords'. The fractal characteristics of the spot spatial distribution show similar behaviour to the fractal characteristics of the spot size distribution. <br/...|$|R
50|$|The BMW M3 {{utilised}} a widened {{and heavily}} redesigned {{variation of the}} coupe body style, therefore the M3 shares few body parts with other E30 models. The M3 suspension is also significantly different from regular E30 models, including 5 <b>lug</b> wheel <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CZ 550 system {{consists}} of a receiver {{that serves as the}} systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three locking lugs, two large main <b>lugs</b> at the <b>bolt</b> head and the bolt handle serves as a backup in case the primary locking <b>lugs</b> failed. The <b>bolt</b> handle is permanently attached to the bolt and is turned-down and backwards for use with optical sights.|$|R
50|$|There were 12 American-born drivers on the grid; Ned Jarrett was {{credited}} with the last-place finish due to an engine problem on lap 127 of 200. Jimmy Pardue traded the lead with LeeRoy Yarbrough before he defeated Marvin Panch by one lap. <b>Lug</b> <b>bolts</b> forced Cale Yarborough to end the race on lap 185; though he finished in fifth place. It took nearly 90 minutes for the drivers to complete all 200 laps at speeds averaging up to 70.326 mph. Pardue qualified for the pole position by achieving {{a top speed of}} 73.111 mph during the solo qualifying sessions. Monetary prizes after this race ranged from $1,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) to $150 ($ when adjusted for inflation). The combined purse of the entire race was $3,790 ($ when adjusted for inflation).|$|R
5000|$|Rotating bolt is {{a method}} of locking used in firearms. Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse {{developed}} the first rotating bolt firearm, the [...] "Dreyse needle gun" [...] in 1836. The Dreyse locked using the bolt handle rather than <b>lugs</b> on the <b>bolt</b> head like the Mauser M 98 or M16. The first rotating bolt rifle with two <b>lugs</b> on the <b>bolt</b> head was the Lebel Model 1886 rifle. The concept has been implemented on most firearms chambered for high powered cartridges since the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Winchester began {{producing}} a controlled round feed Model 70 that was marketed as the [...] "Classic" [...] model. This version reintroduced the CRF feature, while retaining the [...] "anti-bind" [...] locking <b>lug</b> groove <b>bolt</b> guide of the 1968 push feed model. The use of modern CNC manufacturing techniques allowed Winchester to re-introduce the CRF feature {{at a competitive}} price.|$|R
50|$|He found {{release in}} playing the family piano and {{eventually}} attended the Damrosch Institute of Music (now the Juilliard School) {{where he studied}} to become a concert pianist. When the Great Depression hit, Meisner's father pulled him out of music school {{to help in the}} family business in New York City's Garment District. Meisner later recalled that {{the only way he could}} endure days spent <b>lugging</b> <b>bolts</b> of fabric was to entertain himself by replaying, in his mind, all the classical piano pieces he had studied in music school. Meisner believed this experience helped him develop an acute sense of sound, akin to perfect pitch. Later, as an acting teacher, he often evaluated his students' scene work with his eyes closed (and his head dramatically buried in his hands). This trick was only partly for effect; the habit, he explained, actually helped him to listen more closely to his students' work and to pinpoint the true and false moments in their acting.|$|R
50|$|The Wildey uses a fixed-barrel, three-lug, rotating-bolt design. The bolt locks {{into the}} aft barrel extension. The bolt {{is linked to}} the slide via one of the <b>bolt</b> <b>lugs.</b> When the {{cartridge}} is fired, the piston is forced against the slide. The retracting slide catches the extended <b>bolt</b> <b>lug</b> which causes the bolt to rotate open. The spent cartridge is ejected by the bolt through the retracting slide's ejection port. The fixed-barrel design is considered to promote greater accuracy over pistols designed around an articulating barrel design. The Wildey can be used as either a single-shot or an auto-loading pistol.|$|R
50|$|Some motorists, {{especially}} those with less physical strength, may risk injury while attempting to change a tire. Often, <b>lug</b> nuts are <b>bolted</b> very tightly to the wheel, and tires themselves are quite heavy.|$|R
50|$|Although {{of similar}} {{appearance}} to the Sportco (Omark) Model 44 {{there are no}} interchangeable parts with the Angel. The Omark has the same style three <b>lug</b> removable <b>bolt</b> head but {{the orientation of the}} hole for the pin that attaches the head to the bolt body is at a different angle as is the extractor. The locking lugs for the Angel are a part the action whereas the Omark has the lugs as part of the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The Remington 700 {{action is}} {{designed}} for mass production. It is a manually operated bolt action with two forward dual-opposed <b>lugs.</b> The <b>bolt</b> face is recessed, fully enclosing {{the base of the}} cartridge, The extractor is a C-clip sitting within the bolt face. The ejector is a plunger on the bolt face actuated by a coil spring. The bolt is of 3-piece construction, brazed together (head, body and bolt handle). The receiver is milled from round cross-section steel.|$|R
50|$|In 1896 Mauser {{changed the}} firing pin {{distance}} facilitating faster lock time and accuracy; he also installed a cutout section in {{the left of the}} receiver, perfect for a thumb to fill while loading the ammunition from a charger/stripper clip. More impressively, he improved the bolt again by: 1), creating vector holes for gas from a ruptured primer; 2), a shrouded bolt head that protected the shooter from a ruptured cartridge; 3), the bolt head was designed to divert gas away {{from the face of the}} shooter; 4), a third <b>bolt</b> <b>lug</b> was added to keep the shooter safe if the two main <b>bolt</b> <b>lugs</b> should fail; and finally 5), a better designed extractor was added.|$|R
50|$|This type is {{intrinsically}} safe, since opening the cam-locks under pressure releases the door seal and depressurizes the vessel. In fact, the ASME code {{does not require}} interlocks or mechanical pressure indicating devices on such doors. Even when opened, the cam-lock does not allow the bolt to disengage from the latching lug {{if there is any}} pressure against the door. Since it is mounted at a small angle to the <b>lug,</b> the <b>bolt</b> cannot be swung outward away from the engaging lug on the door if there is any pull on it.|$|R
5000|$|In 1957 Cummings secured {{an order}} of 7,500 AR-10 rifles from Nicaragua, with an initial {{delivery}} of 1,000 rifles to be delivered before January 1958. [...] The order was contingent on a successful completion of a 7,500-round endurance test. With the AR-10 in short supply, Cummings left his personal demonstrator rifle with Nicaragua's chief military commander, General Anastasio Somoza, who would personally conduct the endurance test trial. While General Somoza was firing this rifle for the trial, the <b>bolt</b> <b>lug</b> over the ejector sheared off and flew past Somoza's head. The general angrily returned Cummings' AR-10 and canceled the entire Nicaraguan order. The remaining Hollywood rifles were inspected and refitted as necessary with new parts to prevent reoccurrence of the <b>bolt</b> <b>lug</b> failure, but the Nicaraguan order was lost for good.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington Model 798 is a {{bolt-action rifle}} that was sold by Remington Arms from 2006 until 2008. The gun was {{made as a}} hunting rifle. It is {{composed}} of an imported Zastava Arms barreled action assembled with a laminated stock after import to the United States. It {{is based on a}} Mauser 98 action. It is chambered for [...]243 Winchester, [...]308 Winchester, [...]30-06 Springfield, [...]270 Winchester, 7mm Remington.Magnum, [...]300 Winchester.Magnum, [...]375 H&H Magnum and [...]458 Winchester.Magnum. It is drilled and tapped for scope mounts. It can have a barrel length of 22, 24 or 26 inches. It weighs 7 pounds, and has a brown laminated stock. The standard variant costs $599, and the Magnum versions can cost anything between $638 and $839. This is an all-steel, controlled-feed action using a flat-bottom receiver with an integral recoil <b>lug,</b> one-piece <b>bolt</b> with dual locking lugs plus a third safety <b>lug</b> and a <b>bolt</b> guide, full-length extractor, solid steel one-piece bottom iron/magazine box/trigger guard, hinged magazine floor plate, and all of the usual Mauser 98 deluxe features.|$|R
