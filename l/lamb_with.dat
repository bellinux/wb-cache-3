25|$|The {{captured}} vessel {{turned out}} to be the brig Raposa, pierced for 16 guns but mounting only 12, and also carrying some coehorns, swivel guns, and small arms. She had a crew of 90 men, but her captain, Don Joaquin de la Cheva and most of his officers were ashore, with the result that there were only 75 men on aboard. The Spanish suffered five men killed, not including some who drowned when they jumped overboard, and the senior officer on board and 25 men wounded, many mortally. The British had only seven men wounded. Dashwood sent all the Spanish wounded and prisoners ashore under a flag of truce as they could receive better care there.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find the relationship between body weight of male and female Awassi <b>lambs</b> at birth <b>with</b> their body development at early weaning period. Sixty lambs were used and divided into two groups (I, II). Each group was consisted of 30 lambs and divided into two subgroups (15 male and 15 female). Groups formed according to body weight at birth as follows: Group I, <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> less than 3 kg of weight; and Group II, <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> more or equal than 3 kg of weight. <b>Lambs</b> were kept <b>with</b> their mothers and suckling ad libitum throughout the experimental period and were weighed at birth day (1 day old), at 30 days, and at 60 days. Differences between groups of lambs at 60 days of age were significant (p< 0. 05). Correlations ranged from low to moderate among the respective traits and ranged between positive from 0. 505 to 0. 762 and negative from- 0. 181 to- 0. 513. Highest correlation in this study found between age (1 - 60) in male lambs (0. 762) and in female lambs (0. 659) of group II. The correlation coefficient effect at 60 days of age was higher in males than females lambs (p< 0. 05) where the correlation coefficient was 66 % for male and 50 % for female <b>lambs.</b> Therefore, <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> heavier birth weights, showed the best production results in the development of body weight during the period of 60 days of early weaning process, which indicated that selection of <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> greater birth weight may contribute to increasing Awassi lamb body development and growth...|$|R

500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a <b>lamb</b> <b>with</b> a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E

40|$|For {{examination}} {{of the characteristics of}} lentivirus-induced pulmonary disease in an animal model, neonatal lambs were given intratracheal injections of high-and low-passage ovine lentivirus (OvLV) isolates. In 6 of 6 <b>lambs</b> inoculated <b>with</b> low-passage OvLV or OvLV from lung lavage fluid, lesions of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) developed. In none of 7 <b>lambs</b> inoculated <b>with</b> a high-passage OvLV or 4 control <b>lambs</b> inoculated <b>with</b> medium alone or ultrafiltered lung fluid did lung lesions develop. Systemic distribution of lentivirus was greater and development of lentivirus antibody was more rapid in <b>lambs</b> inoculated <b>with</b> low-passage OvLV, compared <b>with</b> <b>lambs</b> inoculated <b>with</b> high passage OvLV. The number of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage samples was increased in <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. The development of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia was markedly accelerated, in comparison with previous reports of experimentally induced lentivirus pneumonia in sheep. In lentivirus-inoculated lambs pulmonary lesions developed comparable to lymphoid interstitial pneumonia associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other human benign lymphoid disorders of the lung. Similarities between the disease manifestations and virologic properties of OvLV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus III argue for the relevance of OvLV-induced disease as a model for human retrovirus diseases. The ability of OvLV to cause accelerated pulmonary disease in neonates may be due to age-related susceptibility factors that enhance the pathogenicity of lentiviruses...|$|R

40|$|High {{mortality}} in newborn babies with {{congenital diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH) is principally due to persistent pulmonary hypertension. ATP-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channels might modulate pulmonary vascular tone. We have assessed the effects of Pinacidil, a K(ATP) channel opener, and glibenclamide (GLI), a K(ATP) channel blocker, in near full-term <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> and without CDH. In vivo, pulmonary hemodynamics were assessed by means of pressure and blood flow catheters. In vitro, we used isolated pulmonary vessels and immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of K(ATP) channels in pulmonary tissue. In vivo, pinacidil (2 mg) significantly reduced pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in both controls and CDH animals. GLI (30 mg) significantly increased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and PVR in control animals only. In vitro, pinacidil (10 microM) relaxed, precontracted arteries from <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> and without CDH. GLI (10 (- 5) microM) did not raise the basal tone of vessels.

40|$|Abstract: Twenty eight Ossimi male <b>lambs,</b> <b>with</b> {{an average}} live body weight 4. 75 kg and 7 days age were {{randomly}} assigned to two feeding groups each of 14 animals to study the effect of pre-weaning diet on lamb's rumen development. Both the two groups suckled their dams until being weaned at 12 weeks of age (natural weaning). The first group depended completely on dam's milk as a solely available feed (control), while the other was supported by a starter ration which found the nutritive value to be 19. 1 % CP (14. 5 % DCP) and 81. 0 TDN, besides dam's milk. Supporting natural weaned <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> creep feeding at an earlier age influenced (p> 0. 05) length of the alimentary canal, however different intestinal segments maintained to keep constant ratios. The small intestine represented the major length (about 80 % of the total length). Supporting <b>lambs</b> <b>with</b> creep feeding rations led also to higher volume displacement. However, different stomach compartments maintained to keep constant volumes. As shown the rumeno-reticulum indicated the higher volume capacity (nearly 80 - 84 %). Natural weaned lambs, depended solely on rearing milk, had higher (p> 0. 05) abomasum volume in comparison with the creep-feeding one.
