5000|$|The spider species Argiope aurantia is {{commonly}} known as the yellow <b>garden</b> <b>spider,</b> black and yellow <b>garden</b> <b>spider,</b> golden <b>garden</b> <b>spider,</b> writing spider, corn spider, or McKinley spider. It is common to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, southern Canada, Mexico, and Central America. It has distinctive yellow and black markings on the abdomen and a mostly white cephalothorax. Its scientific Latin name translates to [...] "gilded silver-face" [...] (the genus name Argiope meaning [...] "silver-face", while the specific epithet aurantia means [...] "gilded"). Males range from 5 - 9 mm; females range from 19 - 28 mm. These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is seemingly harmless to humans.|$|R

40|$|Using {{a virtual}} spider robot, we studied {{hypotheses}} about the weaving behaviour of orb spiders. Our model spiders built virtual webs that mimicked perfectly the visual architecture of real webs of the <b>garden</b> cross <b>spider</b> Araneus diadematus.

This validated our interpretation of the <b>garden</b> <b>spider's</b> web-building decision rules, which use strictly local interactions with previously placed threads to generate global architecture...|$|R

60|$|We weren't {{fortunate}} enough, I {{regret to}} say, to see Eliza's eggs hatch {{out from the}} cocoon; but in other instances, especially in Southern Europe, I have noticed the little heap of well-covered ova, glued together into a mass, and attached to a branch or twig by stout silken cables. If you open the cocoon when the young spiders are just hatched, they begin to run about in the most lively fashion, and look like a living and moving congeries of little balls or seedlets. The common <b>garden</b> <b>spider</b> lays some seven hundred or more such eggs at a sitting, and out of those seven hundred only two on an average reach maturity and once more propagate their kind. For if only four lived and throve, then clearly, in the next generation, there would be twice as many spiders as in this; and in the generation after that again, four times as many; and then eight times; and so on ad infinitum, until {{the whole world was}} just one living and seething mass of common <b>garden</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R

50|$|Yellow <b>garden</b> <b>spiders</b> breed twice a year. The males roam {{in search}} of a female, {{building}} a small web near or actually in the female's web, then court the females by plucking strands on her web. Often, when the male approaches the female, he has a safety drop line ready, in case she attacks him. The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female. After inserting the second palpal bulb, the male dies, and is sometimes then eaten by the female.|$|R
