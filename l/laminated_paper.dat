2500|$|The first {{proposal}} {{to construct a}} special bomb with which to disperse airborne leaflets was put forward by British air force officers during World War II. The most successful [...] "leaflet bomb" [...] model of the War was the Monroe bomb, invented in 1943 by USAAF Captain James Monroe of the 305th Bombardment Group. It was developed from <b>laminated</b> <b>paper</b> containers {{that had been used}} to transport M-17 incendiary bombs.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, complex {{software}} that mapped many non-standard functions to the keys (such as a flight simulator) would be shipped with a [...] "keyboard overlay", a large {{sheet of paper}} with pre-cut holes matching the key layout of a particular model of computer. When placed over the keyboard, the overlay provided a quick visual reference as to what each key's new function was, without blocking the keys or permanently modifying their appearance. The overlay was often made from good-quality <b>laminated</b> <b>paper</b> and was designed to fold up and fit in the game's packaging when not in use.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTen-ply high {{pressure}} <b>paper</b> <b>laminates</b> were prepared by impregnating filter paper with mimosa tannin solution mixed with furfuryl alcohol and formurea concentrate. Abrasion resistance tests, a cross-cut test, and water vapour resistance measurements were carried out. The effect of 10 -ply <b>paper</b> <b>laminates</b> on the shear strength of plywood was also determined. It was demonstrated that 10 -ply <b>paper</b> <b>laminates</b> with mimosa tannin resin {{may increase the}} dry shear strength of plywood and reduce the absorption of water into the plywood. 10 -ply <b>paper</b> <b>laminates</b> pressed at 140 °C temperature at 120 kg cm− 2 pressure for 600 s gave the best appearance compared to other laminates...|$|R
50|$|<b>Laminating</b> <b>paper</b> products, such as photographs, {{can prevent}} them from {{becoming}} creased, faded, water damaged, wrinkled, stained, smudged, abraded, or marked by grease or fingerprints. Photo identification cards and credit cards are almost always laminated with plastic film. Boxes and other containers are also laminated using a UV coating. Lamination is also used in sculpture using wood or resin. An example of an artist who used lamination in his work is the American Floyd Shaman.|$|R
2500|$|The tanks made of plastic-impregnated (<b>laminated)</b> <b>paper</b> {{could not}} store fuel for an {{extended}} period of time, but they worked quite well for the time it took to fly a single mission. These tanks were cheaper, lighter, and were useless to the enemy if recovered after being dropped—not only did they break apart, but they did not provide the enemy with any reusable materials that could be scavenged for their own war effort. With the increased fuel capacity, the P-47 was now able to perform escort missions deep into enemy territory. A drawback to their use was that fighters could not land with the tanks in place because of the hazard of rupture and explosion. Fighters recalled from a mission or that did not jettison their paper tanks for some reason were required to drop them into a designated [...] "dump" [...] area at their respective fields, resulting in substantial losses of aviation fuel.|$|E

50|$|Unlike solid wood, {{hardboard}} is very homogeneous with no grain. A {{wood veneer}} can be glued onto it {{to give the}} appearance of solid wood. Other overlays include Formica, <b>laminated</b> <b>papers,</b> ceramics, and vinyl. It has many uses, such as a substrate. It is used in construction, flooring, furniture, home appliances, automobiles and cabinetry, and is popular among acrylic and oil painters as a painting surface due to its economical price (though it must be coated with gesso or canvas before use). Hardboard has often been used as the surface material in clipboards, especially older models. It is also used as the final layer in many skateboard ramps and the half-pipe.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a method to measure damage to packaging laminates by penetration. A hemispherical probe was shown to provide the most reproducible results and the rate of loading was found to be a small factor. The puncture mechanism for different types of laminates was examined. It was shown that the presence of paper in the structure has a decisive effect on puncture resistance. For paper-based <b>laminates,</b> the <b>paper</b> layer limits the strength by rupturing first and then producing premature rupture of the other layers; the result is a 4 – 10 -fold improvement in strength by eliminating paper as an outer layer. For <b>laminates</b> without <b>paper,</b> all layers rupture together so changing the composition of the non-paper layers has a direct influence on the puncture resistance. The direction of the penetration through the laminate usually has an effect on the energy to puncture...|$|R

50|$|Wood is a {{naturally}} occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a lignin and hemicellulose matrix. Engineered wood includes {{a wide variety}} of different products such as wood fibre board, plywood, oriented strand board, wood plastic composite (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), Pykrete (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or <b>laminated</b> <b>paper</b> or textiles, Arborite, Formica (plastic) and Micarta. Other engineered laminate composites, such as Mallite, use a central core of end grain balsa wood, bonded to surface skins of light alloy or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.|$|E
50|$|Pump clips {{can be made}} {{of various}} materials. For beers that are brewed {{regularly}} by the big breweries, high quality plastic, metal or ceramic pump clips are used. Smaller breweries would use a printed plastic pump clip and for one-off beers <b>laminated</b> <b>paper</b> is used. There are variations on the material used, and the gaudiness or tastefulness of the decoration {{depending on how much}} the brewery wants to market their beers at the point of sale. Novelty pump clips have also been made of wood, slate and compact discs. Some even incorporate electronic flashing lights. Older pump clips were made of enamel.|$|E
