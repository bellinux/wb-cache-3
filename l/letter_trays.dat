50|$|This {{is where}} mail is {{delivered}} to or received from when an employee has a desk. Each desk has {{a minimum of}} three <b>letter</b> <b>trays</b> labelled, in, out and pending. The in tray is where mail is received. The out tray is mail that is waiting to be collected. The pending tray is for documents that cannot be worked on at present because input from another person is required, or the requests are low priority. Sometimes additional trays are used for post, filing, dictation, etc. according {{to the needs of the}} individual or organisation.|$|E

The Transorma Letter Sorting Machine, manufactured by the Dutch company Werkspoor and {{distributed in the}} United States by Pitney Bowes, consisted of an upper and lower section, a conveyor belt transport {{and a series of}} five sorting keyboards. Operators read the destination and keyed a sorting code. The letter was then automatically transferred to a <b>letter</b> <b>tray</b> and deposited into one of 300 chutes. The Transorma could sort 15,000 letters per hour, double the amount that the same number of clerks could do by hand.|$|R

60|$|The apartment, a drawing-room {{with two}} windows, was dusty and untidy. The paint and wall paper {{had not been}} renewed for years; nor did the pianette, which stood near the fireplace, {{seem to have been}} closed during that time; for the {{interior}} was dusty, and the inner end of every key begrimed. On a table between the windows were some tea things, with a heap of milliner's materials, and a brass candlestick which had been pushed back to make room for a partially unfolded cloth. There was a second table near the door, crowded with coils, batteries, a galvanometer, and other electrical apparatus. The mantelpiece was littered with dusty <b>letters,</b> and two <b>trays</b> of Doulton ware which ornamented it were filled with accounts, scraps of twine, buttons, and rusty keys.|$|R
6000|$|What, then, is {{the main}} grief you spoke of as {{annoying}} you--the toothache in the Lord Mayor's jaw, the thorn in the cushion of the editorial chair? It is there. Ah! it stings me now as I write. It comes with almost every morning's post. At night I come home and take my letters up to bed (not daring to open them), {{and in the morning}} I find one, two, three thorns on my pillow. Three I extracted yesterday; two I found this morning. They don't sting quite so sharply as they did; but a skin is a skin, and they bite, after all, most wickedly. It is all very fine to advertise on the Magazine, [...] "Contributions are only to be sent to Messrs. Smith, Elder and Co., and not to the Editor's private residence." [...] My dear sir, how little you know man- or woman-kind, if you fancy they will take that sort of warning! How am I to know, (though, to be sure, I begin to know now,) as I take the <b>letters</b> off the <b>tray,</b> which of those envelopes contains a real bona fide letter, and which a thorn? One of the best invitations this year I mistook for a thorn-letter, and kept it without opening. This is what I call a thorn-letter:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{magazine}} {{was a great}} success, but justice compels {{me to say that}} Thackeray was not a good editor. As he would have been an indifferent civil servant, an indifferent member of Parliament, so was he perfunctory as an editor. It has sometimes been thought well to select a popular literary man as an editor; first, because his name will attract, and then with an idea that he who can write well himself will be a competent judge of the writings of others. The first may sell a magazine, but will hardly make it good; and the second will not avail much, unless the editor so situated be patient enough to read what is sent to him. Of a magazine editor it is required that he should be patient, scrupulous, judicious, but above all things hard-hearted. I think it may be doubted whether Thackeray did bring himself to read the basketfuls of manuscripts with which he was deluged, but he probably did, sooner or later, read the touching little private notes by which they were accompanied,--the heartrending appeals, in which he was told that if this or the other little article could be accepted and paid for, a starving family might be saved from starvation for a month. He tells us how he felt on receiving such letters in one of his Roundabout Papers, which he calls [...] "Thorns in the cushion." [...] "How am I to know," [...] he says--"though to be sure I begin to know now,--as I take the <b>letters</b> off the <b>tray,</b> which of those envelopes contains a real bona fide letter, and which a thorn? One of the best invitations this year I mistook for a thorn letter, and kept it without opening." [...] Then he gives the sample of a thorn letter. It is from a governess with a poem, and with a prayer for insertion and payment. [...] "We have known better days, sir. I have a sick and widowed mother to maintain, and little brothers and sisters who look to me." [...] He could not stand this, and the money would be sent, out of his own pocket, though the poem might be--postponed, till happily it should be lost.|$|R
