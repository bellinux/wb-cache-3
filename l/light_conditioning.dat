[...] Coach Yost opined that the 1910 season {{would see a}} more open style of play under the new rules with reduced risk of injuries. [...] Training camp began with <b>light</b> <b>conditioning</b> work, then progressed to [...] "more strenuous labors." [...] The squad began with 11 players at Whitmore Lake but grew larger as more players arrived over the two weeks. [...] Halfback Joe Magidsohn arrived at Whitemore Lake ten days later but was in [...] "splendid condition after hard summer's work." [...] In late September, Yost announced that Shorty McMillan of Detroit would take over the quarterback spot held the prior year by Billy Wasmund.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the events}} of Closer, Colonel Bismarck, deprogrammed by an {{explosion}} during {{the attack on the}} Bank of England, decides to help defeat the Styx, and joins Will and Drake at Parry's estate. Drake introduces Will and Chester to three retired commandos living at Parry's estate: [...] "Sparks" [...] Sweeney, who was surgically altered to have enhanced senses and faster reaction times, Danforth, a genius who worked in defense electronics, and Jiggs, who is very good at hiding. Will also meets Parry's gardener, Old Wilkie, and his granddaughter Stephanie. The people of the estate watch for Styx presence, and eliminate the Dark <b>Light</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{with the help of a}} device known as the Purger, invented by Danforth. The Purger causes a Darklit person to repeat part of their programming, and Elliott, who is able to speak Styx, finds that Chester has been programmed to call the Styx and report their location. Bartleby and Colly, the Hunters, are engaged in a hunt near the estate, when they encounter two of the Styx soldiers called Limiters spying on the manor. The Limiters wound Colly, and kill Bartleby. Will and the group decide to leave when Mrs. Burrows detects Limiters entering the estate. They escape, only to be cornered by Eddie the Styx, who reveals that the Limiters, rogues like him, are under his control, he was the one Chester was reporting to, and that he saved Emily Rawls, Chester's mother, from being used as a terrorist by the Styx. After much hesitation and discussion he decides he must tell them of the Phase. Meanwhile, in the Colony, the Second Officer begins to worry, as the Styx are neglecting the Colonists to focus on their Topsoil plans. Many people have been moved to an unruly and violent shantytown in the North Cavern to make room for the New Germanian army, and people are disappearing. Topsoil, various terrorist attacks are made by Darklit people who have had bombs surgically implanted within them, and these [...] "human bombs" [...] kill foreign politicians to stir up hatred of Britain. At a factory bought by the Old Styx, the Rebecca Twins have brought several hundred humans and Darklit them to render them brain-dead, perfect hosts for the Phase. They have also brought the Styx's females, who are undergoing part of the Styx's life cycle called the Phase. The Styx are revealed to be an insect species with a unique trait: at infrequent intervals (hundreds or thousands of years apart), the Styx women grow a pair of insect limbs and a mosquito-like ovipositor, used to insert egg sacs into human hosts. From each egg sac, thirty Styx larvae hatch and eat the host from the inside, also absorbing the host's genetic code, explaining why the Styx so closely mimic humans. Styx females who haven't gone through puberty, such as the Rebecca Twins, only experience back pain and minor bleeding where the insect limbs would grow if they were old enough to join in the Phase. Eddie also reveals that in the event the Warrior Class was killed, the Armagi would be released. The Armagi are capable of adapting to all environments, with three legs on land, fins and gills for water, or wings for air. The most horrifying aspect is that they can regenerate their entire body from just a single cell, making them nearly impossible to kill. Upon learning this, Drake and them decide they must take action. They set up headquarters in a military base known as the Complex, bomb shelter for the UK High Command dating back to the Great War. As a newscast reveals, strong anger has arisen worldwide over the human bomb attacks originating from Britain, and the United States and other countries cut off their connections to Britain, which closes its borders and puts itself under martial law. Underground, the Styx abandon the Colony and seal the exits after evacuating the people of the shantytown to use as hosts for the Phase. Finally, Eddie is brought back to base where [...] Elliott angrily attacks him.|$|E

40|$|Apple {{consumers}} continuously demand {{better quality}} apples and texture (i. e. hardness, cohesiveness, fracturability,) {{is a critical}} aspect of apple quality. Apples texture was studied by various methods (penetrometry, compression, sonic transmission, sensory) and impact of factors (storage temperature, <b>light,</b> <b>conditioning</b> atmosphere, maturity…) but little information is available about the soil impact on the apple quality. So, {{the main purpose of}} this study was to investigate the soil impact on the apple texture, which is characterised by penetrometry and compression. Penetrometry and compression tests were performed on a French apple cultivars, Golden Smoothee ® coming from two different soils S 1 (loam, sandy and clay) and S 2 (clay and no-limestone). The preliminary study shows that soil have an impact on apple texture (rupture breakdown force, maximal force, slope of the force deformation curve and gumminess). Results have also shown that the effect of soil is more important than the effect of cultivars on textural parameters like chewiness and gumminess. ...|$|E

40|$|Stress {{and genetic}} {{background}} regulate {{different aspects of}} behavioral learning through the action of stress hormones and neuromodulators. In reinforcement learning (RL) models, meta-parameters such as learning rate, future reward discount factor, and exploitation-exploration factor, control learning dynamics and performance. They are hypothesized {{to be related to}} neuromodulatory levels in the brain. We found that many aspects of animal learning and performance can be described by simple RL models using dynamic control of the meta-parameters. To study the effects of stress and genotype, we carried out 5 -hole-box <b>light</b> <b>conditioning</b> and Morris water maze experiments with C 57 BL/ 6 and DBA/ 2 mouse strains. The animals were exposed to different kinds of stress to evaluate its effects on immediate performance as well as on long-term memory. Then, we used RL models to simulate their behavior. For each experimental session, we estimated a set of model meta-parameters that produced the best fit between the model and the animal performance. The dynamics of several estimated meta-parameters were qualitatively similar for the two simulated experiments, and with statistically significant differences between different genetic strains and stress conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Whole-building energy models take {{information}} about {{the structure of a}} building, its equipment (electrical loads, <b>lights,</b> <b>conditioning</b> equipment, etc.), and disturbances (people, weather) and predict its year long comfort and energy performance. Both commercial and freely available tools are available for performing these time-domain simulations, which are used for design trade studies and more frequently to check for energy consumption and comfort compliance. These models require hundreds of assumptions as input when it comes to parameterizing the building model. Previous studies have investigated how predictions are influenced by these assumptions and which of the parameters are critical to year-long calculations. In this paper we extend this approach to investigate how parametric uncertainty influences uncertainty in the energy dynamics within a building. We provide a case study that investigates an office building by extracting dynamic information out of an EnergyPlus model, and supplies this information to an automatically generated analytical thermal network model. We conclude with a control-oriented frequency-based robustness assessment as well as a study of how un-certainty influences the network structure of the building by investigating the spectral gap of its graph Laplacian.
