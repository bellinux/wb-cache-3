25|$|Some {{people have}} a serious <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> and {{exposure}} to natural latex rubber products such as latex gloves can cause anaphylactic shock. The antigenic proteins found in Hevea latex may be deliberately reduced (though not eliminated) through processing.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{allergic}} reactions to avocado. There {{are two main}} forms of allergy: those with a tree-pollen allergy develop local symptoms in the mouth and throat shortly after eating avocado; the second, known as latex-fruit syndrome, is related to <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> and symptoms include generalised urticaria, abdominal pain, and vomiting and can sometimes be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Latex {{can trigger}} an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and {{systemic}} reaction. The prevalence of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> {{in the general}} population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins.|$|E

5000|$|In a blog post, Stoya {{said that}} she has mild <b>latex</b> <b>allergies</b> and {{difficulties}} with hormonal birth control. In the past, she {{said that she}} has had three medication induced abortions, and states, [...] "I've been pretty successful at avoiding pregnancy." ...|$|R
25|$|Spina bifida is a {{birth defect}} {{where there is}} {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and <b>latex</b> <b>allergy.</b> Learning problems are relatively uncommon.|$|E
2500|$|To {{reduce the}} contact with latex seals in divers with a <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> a soft {{elastomer}} band called a [...] "Bio-seal" [...] {{can be worn}} under the latex contact area. These may also reduce friction with the seal and improve watertightness.|$|E
2500|$|Latex {{and banana}} {{sensitivity}} may cross-react. [...] Furthermore, those with <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> {{may also have}} sensitivities to avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut. These people often have perioral itching and local urticaria. Only occasionally have these food-induced allergies induced systemic responses. Researchers suspect that the cross-reactivity of latex with banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally homologous with some other plant proteins.|$|E
50|$|Polyisoprene is a {{synthetic}} version of natural rubber latex. While significantly more expensive, {{it has the}} advantages of latex (such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms) without the protein {{which is responsible for}} <b>latex</b> <b>allergies.</b> Like polyurethane condoms, polyisoprene condoms are said {{to do a better job}} of transmitting body heat. Unlike polyurethane condoms, they cannot be used with an oil-based lubricant.|$|R
50|$|Polyurethane {{has emerged}} as another polymer that meets the medical device market's demands for thinner wall sections, longer lengths and {{extended}} blood exposure. The high strength and range of properties make these materials an excellent choice for soft elastomer applications. Among the first commercial polyurethane medical products were non-allergenic medical gloves, developed {{as a response to}} <b>latex</b> <b>allergies.</b> These advanced polymers offer a full range of physical properties, improved biocompatibility, and lubricous properties by way of custom formulations and coatings.|$|R
5000|$|Rubber rabbitbrush was {{considered}} {{as a source of}} rubber as early as 1904. Several studies have been conducted on the possible use of rubber rabbitbrush as a source of rubber including ones during World Wars I and II, and 1987. Currently the University of Nevada is conducting research on possible of uses of rubber rabbitbrush for biomaterial and bioenergy uses. [...] One possible commercial use of rubber rabbitbrush would be as a source for hypoallergenic rubber for use in products designed for people with <b>latex</b> <b>allergies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{a major source of}} indoor allergens, ranking as the third most common cause of indoor allergies after dust and pets. Common allergy {{symptoms}} include rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma. Ficus plants can be of particular concern to <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> sufferers due to the latex in the ficus plant, and should not be kept in the environment of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> sufferers. In extreme cases, ficus exposure can cause anaphylactic shock in <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> sufferers.|$|E

40|$|Occupational Medicine specialists {{serve as}} de facto public health {{officers}} {{for the working}} population. A major part of this service is providing medical surveillance. Workers in the biomedical research industry, in particular, require medical surveillance {{for a wide variety}} of workplace hazards. Since the 1930 s, the medical literature is replete with studies detailing the mortality and morbidity of biomedical research workers related to such hazards (especially biohazards). Laboratory-associated illnesses often reflect the specific methodologies utilized in biomedical research (e. g., <b>latex</b> <b>allergies,</b> animal dander hypersensitivity, repetitive motion illness, blood-borne pathogens, B virus, etc).

50|$|Recently, the guayule {{plant has}} seen {{a small but growing}} {{resurgence}} in research and agriculture due to its hypoallergenic properties. While Hevea-derived rubber contains proteins that can cause severe allergic reactions in a few people, guayule does not. With the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, the surge in rubber glove usage revealed how many people were allergic to latex (about 10% of health care workers, according to OSHA), and thereby created a niche market for guayule. There are synthetic alternatives for medical device products, but they are not as stretchable as natural rubber. Guayule performs like Hevea but contains none of the proteins that cause <b>latex</b> <b>allergies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the risk}} of <b>latex</b> <b>allergies</b> among users, the {{original}} composition of elastic bandages has changed. While some bandages are still manufactured with latex, many woven and knitted elastic bandages provide adequate compression without the use of natural rubber or latex. The modern elastic bandage is constructed from cotton, polyester and latex-free elastic yarns. By varying the ratio of cotton, polyester, and the elastic yarns within a bandage, manufacturers are able to offer various grades of compression and durability in their wraps. Often aluminum or stretchable clips are used to fasten the bandage in place once it has been wrapped around the injury. Some elastic bandages even use Velcro closures to secure and stabilize the wrap in place.|$|R
50|$|If contact {{dermatitis}} is suspected, soaps and other external irritants should be discontinued and a <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> should be investigated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most serious}} and rare form of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> Type I {{hypersensitivity}} can cause {{an immediate and}} potentially life-threatening reaction, not unlike the severe reaction some people have to bee stings. Such reactions account for {{a significant proportion of}} perioperative anaphylactic reaction, especially in children with myelomeningocele. [...] Type I natural rubber <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> is an IgE (immune) mediated reaction to proteins found in the Hevea brasiliensis tree, a type of rubber tree.|$|E
50|$|Testing {{for type}} I natural rubber <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> is through blood testing to {{determine}} if the patient is producing IgE antibodies to latex proteins.|$|E
50|$|Gloves {{are used}} in the Foodservice Industry for {{minimizing}} contact with ready to eat foods. Generally, foodservice employees are required to wash hands before starting work or putting on single-use gloves. Due to the incidence of <b>latex</b> <b>allergies,</b> many people switch to vinyl or nitrile gloves. Poly gloves are a very inexpensive alternative. Latex, Vinyl and Nitrile gloves are available in powder and powder-free varieties. The powder in the gloves are made of USDA cornstarch. Powder-free gloves are generally more expensive than powdered gloves because gloves must be powdered to be removed from the mold they are made on. The majority of disposable gloves are manufactured in China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.|$|R
40|$|Latex {{products}} {{have long been}} recognized {{as a cause of}} <b>latex</b> protein <b>allergy.</b> The increased usage of latex gloves, with the consequent increased occurrence of <b>latex</b> <b>allergies</b> appears to have escalated with increasing awareness of the transmission of HIV–AIDS and other infections. The use of condoms as a means to prevent the transmission of STD's (sexually transmitted diseases) and HIV–AIDS has been widely promoted. Although extensive testing is done to evaluate the physical quality of condoms, no information is available regarding the biological safety of condoms. This study was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} short‐term exposure to physiological levels of condom surface material on cell viability (MTT assay) and cell growth (crystal violet assay). A direct contact cell culture testing method (FDA test method F 813 ‐ 83 used to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of medical materials and devices) was used. The modified test method was found to be a sensitive test system for the evaluation of the biological safety of condoms. This study reveals the importance of evaluating the biological safety of all condoms that are commercially available, because of the potential health risk that may be associated with prolonged use of certain types of condoms...|$|R
40|$|Nurses {{have been}} found to be exposed to a wide range of {{occupational}} hazards. They are particularly vulnerable to several diseases and injuries, including musculoskeletal injuries, <b>latex</b> <b>allergies</b> and needlestick injuries. Concerns have been raised in the research literature that rural and remote workplaces pose further and unique demands and risks on nurses. However, there is relatively little information regarding hazards faced by Australian nurses in rural and remote areas. The Office of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council conducted a survey in February 2007 on occupational exposures in Australian nurses. General results arising from the study were published in 2008 (see Driscoll, 2008 a). The report recommended that an in-depth comparison between rural and metropolitan participants of the survey be undertaken. This report describes the differences in perceived occupational hazards for rural (or remote) and metropolitan nurses that were found in the 2007 survey in order to inform and facilitate effective policy formulation and OHS intervention...|$|R

40|$|Myelomenigocele {{occurs when}} a sac {{containing}} the meninge’s, spinal fluid and elements of the spinal cord protrude through an open vertebral lesion. It may be covered with skin or thin membrane. The care of an infant with Myelomenigocele is managed using a multidisciplinary approach coordinated by the neonatology, spinal rehabilitation teams, neurosurgery, urology, orthopaedics, physiotherapy and social work. Neonatologist will refer to Spinal Rehabilitation Team (SRT) and Neurosurgeon for closure of lesion. Neurosurgeon will refer to Plastic Surgeon if a flap closure is required. Surgical closure of open lesion is usually recommended in the first 24 hours to {{reduce the incidence of}} infection and trauma to the exposed tissues and preventing stretching of nerve roots. KEY POINTS Infants with Myelomeningocele have a high risk of developing <b>latex</b> <b>allergies.</b> It is therefore important to avoid any contact with products containing latex. Instead, silicon, portex or vinyl gloves, dummies, catheters and teats should be used.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that liquid natural rubber latex from the Hevea brasiliensis tree {{contains}} a number of proteins that cause minor to serious allergic reactions. Many prior authors have studied these proteins extensively and have isolated what are believed to be the most allergenic. Estimates run as high as 17 % of healthcare workers affected by <b>latex</b> <b>allergies</b> due to the various targeted proteins within a relatively short range of rubber elongation factors. Vystar Corporation has developed a novel, patented method for the deactivation of the antigenic proteins (AP) in liquid natural rubber latex that involves the quasi-sequestration of these proteins. The authors believe that this method ÒdenaturesÓ the proteins by altering the stereochemistry of their structures thus reducing the ability to generate an immune response. It appears that the deactivation method has no adverse effects on the physical and chemical properties of natural rubber latex as it is used in the manufacture of dipped products. Further studies are planned to determine if barrier properties may be slightly improved over untreated natural rubber latex. Dipped product manufacturing techniques may be enhanced by greatly reducing the antigenic protein levels prior to production; costs may be positively impacted due to a reduced need for post treatment such as excessive washing and leaching. Processability studies and pilot plant runs are in the early stages, but show promise. Applications include the production of medical devices such as gloves, condoms, catheters, etc. End unit pricing will be in line with the alternatives currently in the market while providing the positive properties of natural rubber latex...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that liquid natural rubber latex (NRL) from the Hevea brasiliensis tree {{contains}} a number of proteins that cause minor to severe allergic reactions. Estimates run as high as 17 % of healthcare workers affected by various types of <b>latex</b> <b>allergies</b> that have been studied extensively. 1, 2 This paper proposes a unique method to alleviate the impact of normal levels of antigenic proteins but not negatively impact the needed chemical and physical properties. Past attempts at fixing the antigenic protein (AP) problem have usually resulted in a reduction in the chemical and physical properties of NRL. These authors believe that the natural protein {{plays an important role in}} the physical and chemical properties of NRL and AP reduction techniques that degrade the proteins are deleterious to the NRL properties. The key property of NRL is its elastomeric behavior and any alterations to that property reduce its utility. Vystar Corporation has developed a novel, patented method for the deactivation of the AP in liquid NRL that involves the denaturing of these proteins. This new, patented method for fixing the protein problem results in equal or slightly improved chemical and physical properties in NRL thus allowing a seamless transition for manufacturers using the current commercially available product. Of particular interest is that the low antigenic NRL appears to have a slightly reduced initial modulus when compared to untreated NRL. A reduced initial modulus translates into greatly reduced fatigue for items such as surgeon’s gloves or examination gloves that are worn for a considerable period of time. Barrier property studies are in the early stages, but proceeding as planned...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{proteins}} in latex cause {{a range of}} allergic reactions.

5000|$|<b>Latex</b> <b>allergy</b> is {{a medical}} term {{encompassing}} a range of allergic reactions to the proteins present in natural rubber latex. [...] <b>Latex</b> <b>allergy</b> generally develops after repeated exposure to products containing natural rubber latex. When latex-containing medical devices or supplies {{come in contact with}} mucous membranes, the membranes may absorb latex proteins. The immune system of some susceptible individuals produces antibodies that react immunologically with these antigenic proteins. [...] As many items contain or are made from natural rubber, including shoe soles, elastic bands, rubber gloves, condoms, baby-bottle nipples, and balloons, there are many possible routes of exposure that may trigger a reaction. People with latex allergies may also have or develop allergic reactions to some fruits, such as bananas.|$|E

40|$|Hand {{dermatitis}} (HD) {{represents one}} of the most common manifestations of occupational skin disease among health care workers (HCW). Occupational HD usually has a poor prognosis with considerable socioeconomic impact for the individual and their workplace. Contact dermatitis (both irritant and allergic) is a common cause of HD in HCW. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors may put HCW at a higher risk of occupational HD. Among them, <b>latex</b> glove <b>allergy</b> has been well-described among several health professions. Accurate diagnosis of occupational HD, through further investigation, is necessary to help reduce its often chronic course and help address risk factors. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of HD, and the success of various treatment regimes appears to be highly variable. Although difficult to implement in practice, the prevention of occupational HD is paramount, and a variety of prevention strategies may be employed to reduce the prevalence of HD amongst HCW...|$|R
50|$|Latex Tails: Molded latex is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} tail material. It can be molded into scale shapes, and gives a more lifelike impression than fabric, particularly when poured or otherwise affixed onto a neoprene backing. Some of the earliest tails available on the market were made of {{the same type of}} latex used in latex clothing, however, these tails went out of production when the company owner died. The material has very little elasticity, which renders the tail difficult to get on and off. Many mermaids cannot use <b>latex</b> due to <b>allergies,</b> and mermaids who specialize in children's parties or other events where a tail may be touched often stay away from this material for that same reason.|$|R
