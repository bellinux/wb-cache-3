5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful <b>leadout.</b> They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
25|$|In Stage 11, Petacchi {{took the}} green jersey from Hushovd; Mark Cavendish won the stage, but his <b>leadout</b> rider, Mark Renshaw, was disqualified from the Tour after headbutting Julian Dean while leading out his teammate.|$|E
25|$|At the Tour of Britain, {{the final}} major event before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Cavendish {{made his first}} {{appearance}} at his 'home' race since 2007. It {{was part of his}} plan to be at peak form before worlds. He was immediately successful. He and <b>leadout</b> man Renshaw were so convincingly the best in the stage 1 sprint that the <b>leadout</b> man finished in second place right behind his sprinter, much like they had in the Champs-Élysées stage at the 2009 Tour de France. Their positions were reversed in the stage 5 sprint, as Renshaw took victory ahead of Cavendish. It was unclear whether Cavendish intentionally gifted the stage to his longtime <b>leadout</b> man, though Renshaw acknowledged afterward that Cavendish was definitely not giving a full effort. The news on the day for the tam was not all good, as Rasmussen was pulled from the event and had his contract terminated due to news that he had missed three doping controls. Rasmussen was later exonerated due to a procedural error {{on the part of the}} UCI. Undeterred, Cavendish closed out the Tour of Britain by winning the very short road race stage into London on its final day. Renshaw, again, took second place, perhaps proving himself the better of each other team's primary sprinter. In October, as the team's time together was winding down, Martin debuted his newly-won world championship rainbow jersey in the stage 1 time trial at the inaugural Tour of Beijing. None of the race's subsequent stages did anything to dislodge the German from the top of the overall standings, making him the first overall winner of the new event.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Oss came {{fifth in}} the Gent-Wevelgem and fourth {{in one of the}} stages of Three Days of De Panne. He was also {{involved}} in his first ever Grand Tour when he came 124th in the Tour de France, he also won the combativity award on Stage 18, for his involvement in the breakaway. He played a key role as a lead out man for sprinter and teammate Elia Viviani in the inaugural USA Pro Cycling Challenge. It was Oss's <b>leadouts</b> that secured Viviani two stage victories and the Green, Points Championship. On Stage 6 into Denver, Viviani rewarded Oss's hardwork by allowing him to win the sprint finish.|$|R
5000|$|From the 1940s to 1960s, {{broadcast}} {{television stations}} typically provided local news programs {{only one to}} two times each evening for 15 minutes (the normal length for many locally produced programs at the time); usually these programs aired as supplements to network-supplied evening news programs or <b>leadouts</b> for primetime programming. Reports featured on local and national television newscasts during this time were generally provided via film or still photography; eventually, videotape began {{to be used to}} provide live coverage of news events. The 1950s also saw the first use of airborne newsgathering; most notably, in 1958, Los Angeles television station KTLA began operating the [...] "Telecopter", a helicopter equipped for newsgathering use that was the most advanced airborne television broadcast device of its time.|$|R
5000|$|This {{stage was}} mostly {{similar to the}} first one. [...] {{teammates}} Mickaël Delage and Olivier Kaisen formed the day's breakaway with UniSA-Australia rider David Kemp. Euskaltel-Euskadi, Team Milram, and Team Saxo Bank tried to send riders to follow, but the peloton did {{not allow them to}} get away. Kemp allowed the Omega Pharma-Lotto riders to take the two intermediate sprints so that he would be allowed maximum points on the Checker Hill climb, allowing his teammate Timothy Roe to keep the white jersey. Kemp then tried to solo for the stage win, but Team Sky and Team HTC-Columbia chased him down, with race leader Greipel again coming away with a stage win. Minor controversy followed, as both Greg Henderson and Danilo Wyss accused other riders (namely Robbie McEwen and Graeme Brown) of poaching their <b>leadouts</b> and therefore causing them to lose finishing positions.|$|R
25|$|HTC-Highroad's squad for the Tour de France was {{centered}} around Cavendish, {{back again to}} try to win the points classification green jersey after finishing second in those standings each of the past two years. Eisel, Renshaw, Bak, and Pate were named as <b>leadout</b> men, with Goss also present to perhaps try for the sprints that may be too difficult for Cavendish. Peter Velits and Tony Martin were named as possible general classification hopefuls, though Martin's true strength was the individual time trial, to be raced on the identical course to the one he won on earlier in the season at the Critérium du Dauphiné. Tour de France debutant van Garderen rounded out the squad.|$|E
25|$|Martin was the {{beneficiary}} at the Volta a Catalunya {{of an injury}} sustained by 's Levi Leipheimer. The American had occupied a podium spot, second, before the flat final stage, but a re-occurrence of an abdominal injury left him physically unable to complete the race. Leipheimer's withdrawal moved Martin onto the event's final podium in third. Kreder claimed a surprise win at the Circuit de la Sarthe, pipping race leader Daniele Bennati {{at the end of}} stage 2 after the Italian had started his sprint early from an early <b>leadout.</b> Zabriskie won the long time trial at the Tour de Romandie. He bettered all the intermediate time checks of early stage leader Richie Porte, and was two seconds better than the Australian at the finish. While Zabriskie has a reputation as a top time trial specialist, this was the first individual time trial in Europe that he had won since the 2006 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, and first victory of any kind since a road race win in the 2010 Tour of California. The team attended the Tour of California with a squad led by two-time runner-up Zabriskie. He effectively lost any chance at winning the race overall in stage 4, when he cracked on the Sierra Road climb and finished 32nd, nearly five minutes down on the day's winner (and eventual Tour winner) Chris Horner. He rebounded two days later to win the Solvang time trial, ahead of three-time winner Levi Leipheimer in a new course-record time. Danielson and Vandevelde had fared somewhat better in the climbing stages and finished the race in third and fourth overall, respectively. Zabriskie's final position was 33rd.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} came the Tour's first summit finish, and Velits and Martin both struggled. Velits lost four minutes and 15 seconds by {{finishing}} 31st, having been {{caught up in}} a crash at one point. Martin lost just over nine minutes by finishing 48th. Velits remained the team's highest-placed overall rider after the stage, but he fell to 14th place. The next two mountain stages were no kinder, as Velits fell to 16th after stage 14 and Martin well out of any possible contention in 35th. Stage 15 was the last stage branded as flat before the traditional flat final stage on the Champs-Élysées. Cavendish and the <b>leadout</b> train did not disappoint, as he took another dominant win, this time over Farrar in second. Stages 18 and 19 could have been problematic for Cavendish. Both were difficult mountain stages with summit finishes, meaning the disqualification time cut was a concern. He did in fact finish outside the time cut on stage 18, but since more than half the peloton did likewise, the group was not disqualified from the Tour. They were each individually assessed a 25-point penalty in the points classification instead. This narrowed Cavendish's lead over José Joaquín Rojas to only 15 points. A similar result happened the next day on Alpe d'Huez, with Cavendish again finishing in the last group on the road and outside the time cut. Again close to half the peloton was in the group, so they were not removed from the Tour, and since Rojas also fell in the group this time, he too was assessed the 25-point penalty. This meant the true effect was essentially nil, effectively cinching the green jersey for Cavendish.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was about}} this time that reports came through of a problem {{at the finish line}} - a bus for the [...] team had become stuck under the {{finishing}} arch. It was too tall to pass through. It disrupted the electronic timing for the stage, but the more pressing problem {{was the fact that the}} finish line was not clear to be covered by the cyclists. Race officials tried to extricate the bus, having no success for several minutes as the riders came nearer and nearer to the finish line. As the peloton passed through the 10 km to go mark, the decision was sent out over race radio for the finish line to be moved to the banner representing 3 km to the (original) finish line. Around this same time, the day's first major crash occurred, sending, among numerous others, 2012 Giro d'Italia champion Ryder Hesjedal off his bicycle. At approximately 6 km to go the original finish, meaning 3 km to go the revised finish line, teams such as [...] and [...] had begun their <b>leadouts.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a micro-electro-kinetic-actuator (MEKA) array for the study {{and control of the}} viscous sublayer of a turbulent boundary layer is presented. Several generations of such MEKA arrays have been fabricated that explore the use of non-conventional MEMS materials such as quartz, polymers or mylar and are combined where needed with conventional MEMS design and fabrication processes. The present study is the first attempt to exploit the potential advantages of using the electrokinetic principle as the basis for a new class of microscale actuators suitable for active sublayer control. Among such advantages are that these actuators have no moving parts, and that they achieve the flow rates required for this type of flow control. Moreover, the inherent problem of matching the length and time scales between microactuators and the physical system being controlled makes the viscous sublayer a natural choice for these types of actuators. The electrokinetic drivers are fabricated inside microchannels, 250 mm to 2 mm in diameter, using a liquid-phase polymerization process that generates 1 µm doped pores. This process greatly simplifies the fabrication {{of a large number of}} actuators, and using this technique we are able to fill 100 % of the 25 [*] 600 microchannels that form the typical MEKA 5 array. The array is fabricated using a novel three-layer design that contains (i) a top layer with the actuator nozzles, electrodes and <b>leadouts,</b> (ii) a center layer containing the individually addressable electrokinetic driver channels in which electrolyte pumping occurs in response to a time-varying electric field that will induce volume displacement in the sublayer and (iii) a bottom layer containing an electrolyte reservoir and common electrode. The functionality incorporated in this three-layer design with independent unit cells demonstrate all the elements needed for turbulent boundary layer control...|$|R
25|$|The team's winning ways {{continued}} at Paris–Nice in March. Goss won the field sprint finish to stage 3, after narrowly missing {{a victory in}} stage 2, maneuvering around riders who fell after 's Peter Sagan crashed on the course's final sharp turn. In the mountainous stage 5, Martin finished with the first group {{on the road to}} assume fourth place {{at the end of the}} day, ten seconds down on race leader Andreas Klöden. This was an advantageous position with the stage 6 individual time trial to come; Martin was viewed as a favorite for the time trial. The next day, Martin handily won the time trial, with only five riders finishing within a minute of his winning time. He took the race lead, with a 36-second lead over Klöden in the overall standings. His advantage largely held steady over the last two days, giving him the overall race crown. The team won the flat first stage of the Volta a Catalunya, but not in the manner by which they regularly win flat stages. New acquisition Smukulis made the morning breakaway and had it stick to the finish. Last shedding former teammate Ben Gastauer of , Smukulis soloed to victory 28 seconds ahead of the charging peloton. It was his first professional victory, and he was visibly emotional as he crossed the finish line. He held the race lead for a second day before giving it up on the high mountain stage 3, as he lost nearly 17 minutes that day. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Albasini won the mountains classification thanks to back-to-back nearly day-long efforts in the breakaways in stages 4 and 5. Also, Martin won the time trial which closed out the event, again besting Klöden, though this time the elder German was the overall race winner. The team was successful on two fronts at the Tour of California. Van Garderen showed solid climbing legs on the race's two summit finishes. Though he was more than a minute back of the stage winner both days, he was well better than the majority of the field, including all his rivals for the youth classification. He won the award at the end of the race by almost six minutes over 's Andrew Talansky. The last stage featured a group sprint finish. Where their <b>leadout</b> train had been outmaneuvered by 's earlier in the race, this time Goss was successfully delivered to the line first. Van Garderen's final overall placing was fifth. Degenkolb and Albasini both found their way into the winner's circle at Bayern-Rundfahrt. First, Degenkolb edged out fellow young German sprinter Marcel Kittel in the finish to stage 2. Albasini won a breakaway sprint the next day, best of a nine-man group. This win gave him the race lead for a day, and he held on to finish on the event's final podium in third place.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} kilometre, José Joaquín Rojas (...) {{attached}} {{himself to the}} back of the [...] <b>leadout</b> train. He opened his sprint with [...] remaining, taking other riders by surprise, and was able to hold them off and take the victory. This was Rojas' first victory since the 2014 Vuelta a Castilla y León.|$|E
500|$|Three riders {{broke free}} of the peloton after [...] — Mikhail Ignatiev, Leonardo Scarselli, and Björn Schröder. Their maximum {{advantage}} was 5'20", but the peloton had no trouble catching them. Ignatiev and Scarselli were absorbed with [...] left to race, while Schröder fought on alone, being caught at around [...] to go. Despite being seven riders deep in the bunch with under [...] to go, Mark Cavendish {{was able to get}} a successful <b>leadout</b> from Edvald Boasson Hagen and Mark Renshaw to pick up his third stage win of the Giro. The <b>leadout</b> was so fast that only 21 riders had {{the same time as the}} stage winner — another 89, including each of the top ten in the General classification (GC), were eight seconds back. Cavendish actually missed the start of the stage, after becoming stuck in the race village due to his habit of lining up on the start of the race at the last minute to avoid press. He was picked up by a Rabobank team car, which was also running late, and brought back to the field by them. He went on to win the stage.|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider can muster on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to try to set up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti never had much of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second day in a row, Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost the wheel of his <b>leadout</b> man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early <b>leadout</b> left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able to come around the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the stage}} being all but certain {{to end in}} a field sprint, Javier Aramendia, Leonardo Giordani, and Olivier Kaisen tried their luck with a {{breakaway}} after just [...] They were able to increase their advantage by two minutes at one point when the peloton was caught behind a closed railroad crossing, and the race jury decided that the breakaway {{would not have to}} stop while the peloton did. When their advantage hit 7'30", the chase, led largely by , began in earnest. Tom Boonen and Mark Cavendish were both gapped off during the chase. Boonen finished 91 seconds back on the day, and though Cavendish did rejoin the leading group, he was not a factor in the sprint finish. The three-man breakaway was caught [...] from the finish line, leaving Kaisen's teammate Vicente Reynès to try a counter-move, but he was never allowed more than 30 seconds' advantage. A large group sprint indeed took place, won by Tyler Farrar after a strong <b>leadout</b> from world champion Thor Hushovd.|$|E
500|$|The near total {{dearth of}} flat, {{sprinter}}-friendly stages {{did not stop}} sprinters Mark Cavendish, Tyler Farrar, and Alessandro Petacchi, from all taking the start. One sprinter who was expected {{to take part in}} the race, 's Andrea Guardini, was not part of the start list. Though his sporting director at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey had promised him a place in the Giro should he win two stages at that event (Guardini did indeed win two stages in Turkey), the team believed he would be better served continuing to take part in somewhat smaller races. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton mainly came from much smaller teams and teams with little overall ambition. [...] and [...] sent two sprinters apiece—Gerald Ciolek and Francesco Chicchi for the Belgian team and Robbie Hunter and Robbie McEwen on the American squad. Giro debutants [...] had among their squad Slovenian sprinter Borut Božič. 's sprinter was Francisco Ventoso, one of the season's most prolific winners to date. The small [...] and [...] also sent sprinters, Roberto Ferrari and 2010 Giro stage winner Manuel Belletti, respectively. The [...] team had intended to send Daniele Bennati, a former winner of the points classification in the Giro d'Italia who had had great success at the recently run Circuit de la Sarthe. After a crash at the Tour de Romandie where he sustained multiple fractures and a lung contusion, he was forced out of the Giro. That squad therefore turned their sprinting hopes to the rider originally set to be Bennati's <b>leadout</b> man, Belgian sprinter Wouter Weylandt.|$|E
500|$|Klemme got the team's first-ever win {{early in}} the spring season, at Le Samyn. After a solo escapee was caught by an elite 12-rider group that came clear of the peloton, Klemme timed his attack on the day's final climb with {{precision}} and stayed out front for victory by eight seconds over Kevyn Ista. The team came to the first monument race of the season, Milan–San Remo, with high ambitions. Cancellara aimed for a second triumph in the race, having previously won the 2008 edition, but he recognized that slipping away unmarked in the race's final kilometers as he did three years prior {{would be difficult to}} do again. He considered Philippe Gilbert to be his principal rival for the race. Cancellara and O'Grady made the day's major selection on the Le Manie climb, after a crash [...] from the finish. O'Grady hit out on the attack a few times shortly {{before the end of the}} race, but it was Cancellara who was present in an eight-rider group that formed on the Poggio which decided the race. These eight riders represented eight different teams, so no one was able to get a proper <b>leadout.</b> After Gilbert, Vincenzo Nibali, and Yoann Offredo opened up the sprint, Cancellara tried to come around them for the win, but was beaten at the line by 's Matthew Goss. Cancellara was deeply disappointed to finish second, feeling that even though he had done one of the best sprints of his life, he had not done adequately to pay off his team's efforts on the day.|$|E
500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, BMC {{was one of only}} two teams to have more than three riders present in the leading group on the road after a crash on the Le Manie climb [...] from the finish effectively split the field in two. With both teams lacking field sprinters, and with sprinters Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, and Heinrich Haussler surviving the split, BMC captain Ballan and 's Vincenzo Nibali struck a deal that they would each send men {{to the front of the}} lead group to help keep it away from the sprinters left behind in the second group, and dislodge the sprinters in the first group if possible. The tactic worked; with domestiques from both these teams, plus , pulling at the head of the leading group, they kept their lead through to the end of the race. Ballan, and Nibali, later figured into a crucial eight-rider selection that took place on the Poggio just a few kilometers from the end of the [...] day of racing. Those eight riders represented eight different teams, so no one had a teammate to perform a proper <b>leadout.</b> After Nibali, Gilbert, and 's Yoann Offredo opened up the sprint, Ballan was gapped off momentarily and could manage only fourth behind race winner Matthew Goss. Van Avermaet had also been with the first group after the split on Le Manie, and occupied first position on the road for the kilometers between the Cipressa and the descent from the Poggio, before he was caught by the select group of eight that finished together at the head of the race.|$|E
500|$|Van Dijk {{started the}} season as usual with the Ladies Tour of Qatar. She won the second stage and {{took the lead in}} the general classification. The day {{afterwards}} teammate Lizzie Armitstead took over the leading jersey. Van Dijk ended the tour in third place in the overall classification. During the first European race of the season, the Omloop het Nieuwsblad, van Dijk escaped from a front group of 15 riders on the Molenberg with 30km to go. Anna van der Breggen {{was the only one who}} was able to follow her. The duo extended their advantage over the cobbled sections that followed, holding off the chase group to the line, where Van Dijk lost the two-up sprint. A few days later Van Dijk rode again strong in the Le Samyn des Dames. In the final kilometers she closed a one-minute gap with the front group. After closing the gap she was the <b>leadout</b> for Chantal Blaak who sprinted to victory. Due to a back injury, Van Dijk could not start in Omloop van het Hageland. In the first World Cup of the season, the Ronde van Drenthe, the team was eager to win. In the final Van Dijk was the lead-out for Armitstead. However, Armitstead lost Van Dijk in the last kilometer. Van Dijk continued sprinting and rode to the third place. She was happy with her result, but found it a shame that the team did not win. During the second World Cup race, the Trofeo Alfredo Bina Van Dijk couldn't ride uphill with the fastest riders and finished eighth, with teammate Armitstead taking the win. For the Tour of Flanders, Van Dijk heard a day before the race [...] she was not as a leader of the team, although Van Dijk won this World Cup race previous year. Because Van Dijk prepared very well for this race she was disappointed, and didn't ride a good race finishing 24th. Van Dijk rode several races in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain in April, May and the begin of the June. The most notable results from these race being a second place in the team time trial in the Energiewacht Tour and a second place in Gooik-Geraardsbergen-Gooik, being outsprinted by Gracie Elvin.|$|E
500|$|Australian riders won each of {{the lesser}} jersey awards. Evans won the points classification, {{represented}} in 2010 with a red jersey in {{a return to the}} original colour scheme for the three minor classifications that reflected the colours of the Italian flag. Evans's victory came about by way of nine top-ten finishes, including a stage win, {{over the course of the}} race. This classification was tightly contested throughout the race; six different riders held the jersey, and it changed hands nine times. Matthew Lloyd of [...] won the green jersey for the mountains classification, taking maximum mountains points during his stage-winning breakaway in stage 6. He made morning breakaways later on in mountain stages to take points on other climbs and consolidate his lead. Porte won the white jersey as best young rider, holding it for all but three stages. Success was widespread among the 22 teams in the race. In sharp contrast to the 2009 Giro, the only rider to win multiple stages in this year's race was Farrar, who took the sprint finishes to stages 2 and 10. , , , , , , , and [...] each won one stage. [...] had two stage wins, first with Wouter Weylandt in a depleted sprint finish to stage 3 in the Netherlands, and two stages later Jérôme Pineau led a winning breakaway across the finish line. 's Chris Anker Sørensen won stage 8 on Monte Terminillo after figuring into a morning breakaway, and their time trial specialist Gustav Larsson won the final race against the clock in Verona. [...] won multiple sprint stages, first with <b>leadout</b> man Matthew Goss when ace sprinter André Greipel missed out on the opportunity, and later Greipel himself took a win. [...] took back-to-back stage wins, first with Petrov in L'Aquila and then with Filippo Pozzato, who won a 10-man sprint after a late breakaway in stage 12. After there had been no Italian stage winners for the first 11 days of racing, Pozzato's stage win was the first of five in a row and six overall for Italian riders. Nibali and Basso were among those stage winners; as they also won the stage 4 team time trial, theirs was the only squad with more than two stage wins. They also won both teams classifications, the time-based Trofeo Fast Team and the points-based Trofeo Super Team. , , and [...] did not win any stages, but Vinokourov's and Arroyo's stints in the pink jersey and Tom Stamsnijder's win in the Traguardo Volante classification meant that they did not come away from the Giro empty-handed. Only , , , , and [...] came away from the Giro with nothing, even though Milram had one of their riders (Paul Voss) wearing the Mountains jersey at some point.|$|E
2500|$|Stage 3 {{the next}} day was one of those more {{straightforward}} flat stages. After the morning's breakaway was caught, some [...] from the finish, Garmin-Cervélo <b>leadout</b> riders hit the front but were quickly displaced by [...] working for Mark Cavendish. However, they made errors negotiating a sharp left-hand turn at [...] to go, and Garmin-Cervélo was able to take first position again. Hushovd led out to [...] to, giving way to Dean who led out to , at which point Farrar began his sprint. With Cavendish losing position due to his teammates' flub earlier, Farrar was easily able {{to make it to the}} line first, taking his first career Tour stage win. After he crossed the line, Farrar made a W with the thumb and forefinger of both hands, in tribute to Weylandt – and lost his balance, nearly falling off his bicycle as a result. This victory matched him Millar earlier in the season at the Giro d'Italia in taking stage wins at all three Grand Tours for his career. Farrar praised his <b>leadout</b> train, particularly Hushovd. Farrar felt that as race leader and world champion, Hushovd was under no real obligation to ride <b>leadout.</b> Vaughters was pleased with the work turned in by Navardauskas, leading the chase of the breakaway and being part of the <b>leadout.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As he {{had been}} in his two seasons with , Haussler was active in the Tour of Qatar in February. After {{finishing}} second to Tom Boonen in stage 1, Haussler won stage 2, outkicking Daniele Bennati at the finish, and moved within one second of Boonen in the overall classification. Though he had won the event's points classification {{in each of the last}} two years, this was Haussler's first ever stage win at the Tour of Qatar. In stage 3, Boonen flatted at a critical moment when the peloton was at its top speed and lost three minutes, leaving the top of the overall standings wide open. Haussler picked up a second consecutive stage win in Mesaieed, and in so doing he also moved into the overall race leadership. He credited the win to the team treating the third stage like a one-day classic, while also mentioning that 's Bernhard Eisel performed an effective <b>leadout</b> for all the sprinters at the finish. Haussler lost the overall lead in stage 4, as 's Mark Renshaw took the stage win and opened a six-second gap with his time bonus at the finish. Haussler was a distant ninth in the event's final stage, meaning the bonus time on offer went wanting and he finished second overall, though winning the points classification for the third year in a row. Similarly continuing 's legacy, the squad won the teams classification as their antecedents also had in each of the previous two editions. Haussler stated that he was pleasantly surprised by his early-season form and hoped it would portend for Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders. At Paris–Nice in March, Haussler won the points classification without winning any stage. He had stage finishes in every position from second through fifth, however. At the concurrent Tirreno–Adriatico, Farrar won the first road race stage after an effective <b>leadout</b> from Hushovd. The next stage was also flat, and Hushovd again performed a <b>leadout</b> that was strong in form, but it was perhaps too strong this time. The world champion opened up a slight gap on Farrar in the final kilometer, and left him to sprint for the line from [...] out. Farrar lost out at the last moment to 's Juan José Haedo.|$|E
2500|$|A mini-attack {{occurred}} on the climb at Vico, but it was pulled back quickly after; in effect, guaranteeing a bunch sprint. [...] tried {{to set up the}} finish for Mark Cavendish, but a miscue on the final corner by <b>leadout</b> men Peter Kennaugh and Geraint Thomas hampered the world champion, allowing Tomas Vaitkus (...) and 's Roberto Ferrari to get through and contest the finish. Behind that, 's sprinter Sacha Modolo hit the tarmac for the second time during the race, having been involved in the stage 3 incident. Ferrari finished stronger, and beat out his chasers for his first Giro win, with [...] rider Francesco Chicchi outdragging Vaitkus for second. Cavendish finished an unhappy fourth, but did take the points classification lead from Vaitkus' team-mate Matthew Goss. There were no other changes to the jersey holders, with Rodríguez holding the overall lead into {{the second half of the}} race.|$|E
2500|$|A {{great number}} of early breakaways were {{attempted}} and neutralized in the stage's first hour. Finally, seven broke away at the [...] mark. The seven, Addy Engels, Maxim Gourov, Patxi Vila, Franck Renier, Eric Berthou, Pedro Horrillo and Mikhail Ignatiev, got a maximum advantage of 2'30", but the peloton easily caught them [...] from the finish line. [...] tried {{to set up the}} sprint for Alexandre Usov, as did [...] for Matteo Tosatto, who lived in the town where the stage finished. AG2R's <b>leadout</b> train took a left-hand turn in the final kilometer too sharply, and left a handful of riders to contest the stage alone. Since the crash occurred within the final , no time was counted as lost. Alessandro Petacchi easily held off Maximiliano Richeze and Matti Breschel for the victory, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol levels in a test given earlier in the race. The overall standings were unchanged by the day's results.|$|E
2500|$|Just 48 riders of the 131 {{who started}} the stage {{remained}} as one to contest the finish in Tanunda. At the finish, it was [...] that featured most prominently, and after a four-man <b>leadout,</b> it was Óscar Freire who advanced down the left-hand {{side of the road}} in the closing stages, and gained [...] their first win of the season, and his first since the 2011 Ruta del Sol for [...] Gerald Ciolek finished second on the stage for , which like Freire, moved him into the top five of the overall classification, which was led once again by Kohler after {{he was part of the}} 48 riders that were in contention. Daniele Bennati finished third for , and the bonus seconds he earned also advanced his position, into sixth overall. After finishing just behind Bennati, 's Edvald Boasson Hagen replaced Greipel as leader of the sprints classification, Matthews held the lead of the youth classification once again, Dennis earned the mountains jersey after earning maximum points on the final climb and Kadri was named most combative rider for the stage.|$|E
2500|$|In stage 5, Pinotti and Sivtsov both {{finished}} with the first large group on the road, over the numerous unpaved or 'white' roads into Orvieto. Their group afforded solo stage winner Pieter Weening sufficient time that he took the next pink jersey, but the two HTC-Highroad men remained extremely well-placed in second and third overall, just two seconds back. Pinotti {{had a bad day}} on Etna in stage 9, finishing five minutes back of stage winner, new race leader, and eventual Giro champion Alberto Contador, and between three and four minutes behind the race's other top riders. The result dropped him to 25th overall, but Sivtsov remained in second place, the only rider within a minute of Contador. This difficult mountain stage nearly brought Cavendish's Giro to an end as well, as his group, which also contained Raboň, Rasmussen, and Renshaw, finished just 30 seconds inside the minimum survival time based on the stage winner's time. Rival sprinter Francisco Ventoso from [...] claimed that Cavendish should have been disqualified anyway, saying that the Manxman had illegally used the race caravan for slipstreams on his ascent of Etna. Stage 10 after the rest day {{was one of the few}} seemingly straightforward sprint stages in this Giro. When former race leader David Millar attacked out of the peloton just outside the [...] to go marker, HTC-Highroad was the team to chase him down. While they did successfully bring him back, this left their vaunted <b>leadout</b> train disorganized. Only Cavendish, Sivtsov, and Pinotti {{finished with}} the front group. Nonetheless, Cavendish was able to surge past Petacchi, who had been left for an early sprint by his <b>leadout</b> man Danilo Hondo, to claim his first victory of the race. He took the opportunity after the stage to address Ventoso's remarks, claiming that because of his star status he is always led by race officials and photographers, even when at the very back of the race. Cavendish added another win in stage 12, the last flat stage before a crushingly difficult final week and a half. He was very nearly caught in the sprint by 's Davide Appollonio, but he edged out the young Italian for a second stage victory. Cavendish, and several other sprinters, left the Giro the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Le Mével and Martin {{were set}} to share {{leadership}} duties at the Giro d'Italia, though about {{a week and a}} half before the race was to begin Martin was pulled due to allergies. Millar, Farrar, Wilson, and Lancaster were named to the squad at that time, with Peterson, Cameron Meyer, Fischer, and Stetina eventually rounding out the squad. The squad held the stage 1 team time trial and subsequently taking the first pink jersey as an immediate goal, having done exactly that in the equivalent stage at the 2008 Giro d'Italia. The team's plan was for Le Mével to ride for the overall, Farrar and Millar for stage wins, and the other riders for support. Stetina made his Grand Tour debut in this race, with his goal simply to finish. The squad finished fifth in the team time trial, coming home with the minimum of five riders together 24 seconds off the winning time set by [...] Farrar was a relatively distant seventh in the group sprint finish to stage 2. He described it as a missed opportunity, with the <b>leadout</b> train faltering at the [...] to go mark, though he anticipated at least three further sprint opportunities in the Giro.|$|E
2500|$|Stage 10, {{while it}} {{contained}} four categorized climbs, was another likely sprint stage. Points leader Gilbert and race leader Thomas Voeckler {{set out on}} the last climb, the fourth-category Cote de Mirandol-Bourgnounac, to try to take the win themselves. The result was HTC-Highroad's support riders had to expend much more effort than usual to ensure that Cavendish was {{at the front of the}} race in the finale, and as such their <b>leadout</b> was less than perfect. It gave former team member André Greipel, now riding for , the opportunity to start his sprint just after Cavendish started his. Cavendish started from a seemingly optimal [...] out, but the German took the victory at the finish line. Cavendish was gracious in defeat, taking the blame himself by saying he [...] "didn't commit enough." [...] The two were again the top two in the sprint the next day in Lavaur, but Cavendish reversed his fate from the day before by dominantly defeating Greipel. After Geraint Thomas had begun to lead out Boasson Hagen, Renshaw jumped from Thomas' wheel to take Cavendish to the front, where the Manxman was first by almost an entire bike length. The victory put him into the green jersey for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, the team came in thinking they had two options for the victory – 2009 winner Cavendish, and the 2011 season's most prolific winner to date Goss. Sporting director Valerio Piva stated that if the race came down to a large field sprint, as it often does, the team's focus would be Cavendish. For {{the second year in}} a row, Cavendish had had a slow start to his season, but stated that he felt he was on good form heading into Milan–San Remo. The race turned out to be atypical of how Milan–San Remo usually plays out. A crash occurred [...] from the finish of the [...] day on Le Manie, one of several small climbs in the profile. This allowed some 45 riders who had been ahead of world champion Thor Hushovd, the man who crashed, to speed clear of the rest of the main field. They quickly took a two-minute advantage and, working cohesively, never gave it up. Goss was the only HTC-Highroad rider to make the split, but his teammates, including Cavendish, who had been caught behind obligingly did nothing to help pull the second group up to the first. Goss effectively stayed in the slipstream of riders like Vincenzo Nibali and Philippe Gilbert, and stayed with the first group on the road over the Poggio where other sprinters like Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, and Heinrich Haussler were unable, despite having made the 45-rider selection earlier in the day. In the finale, eight riders representing eight different teams approached the finish line together. Since no one had a teammate to perform a proper <b>leadout,</b> the final meters were somewhat strange, as the eight riders continually looked around to see who would open up the sprint. Finally, Nibali, Gilbert, and Yoann Offredo did so, but they effectively performed a <b>leadout</b> for Goss, who came around them at the very end of the race for the victory. Goss was the first Australian rider ever to win the race. Afterward, Cavendish stated that he had been feeling ill on the day the race was run, and that even if he had not been caught behind the crash on Le Manie, he would not have had the form to put in a successful sprint. He said he was happy for his teammate's winning effort. The team had hoped to ride for Cavendish at Gent–Wevelgem in March, but repeated mechanical trouble and also a crash left him well short of figuring into the finale. Former Gent–Wevelgem winner Eisel was able to salvage the team's fortunes somewhat by finishing seventh on the day. In April, as the spring season was reaching its height, Cavendish took his third career win at the Scheldeprijs. The Manxman avoided a crash on the final finishing straight, one that doomed the chances for his chief rival Tyler Farrar, and was easily the best sprinter of the 31 riders who finished together at the head of the race.|$|E
2500|$|Following on {{from that}} success, the team took two more stage wins in the Tour of California, held later in May. After stage one was {{cancelled}} {{due to a}} snowstorm and unsafe riding conditions, the second stage was run over a shorter distance, and rain started to fall as the race headed into the finishing circuit in Sacramento, where the team came to the front to assume control for the in-form Swift; he was favored instead of the team's regular sprinter Henderson, who had not raced since the Scheldeprijs in early April, but Henderson was utilised as the <b>leadout</b> man for Swift, and released him to his fifth victory of 2011, securing the first yellow and green jerseys – for the lead of both the general classification and the sprints classification – of the race. The following day, it was Henderson's turn to win a stage, although not in the manner {{that he had been}} accustomed to. Henderson led the sprint from [...] out, but Swift was {{not in a position to}} challenge for the sprint, so it was left to Henderson to bring home the laurels for the team, winning the sprint by a bike length, and assuming the race lead on countback from Swift. Henderson surrendered the race lead on the mountainous fourth stage, however, but both he and Swift took further third place stage finishes before the Tour was complete.|$|E
2500|$|The riders {{remained}} {{together as}} they entered Herning for the final finishing loop of [...] {{in and around the}} city, with no riders being allowed any initiative to get a gap on the field, and thus limiting the chances of somebody getting clear in the closing stages. The lap had been passing without drama, until race leader Taylor Phinney (...) crashed {{a third of the way}} around the lap. Once he got back onto his feet, Phinney suffered the misfortune of dropping his chain and lost over 30 seconds trying to fix the issue, but with help from his team-mates, including Danilo Wyss and Alessandro Ballan, he managed to bridge back up to the main pack ahead of the finish. At the front, [...] were starting to set up their <b>leadout</b> train for Tyler Farrar while [...] had hoped to get Andrea Guardini, the six-stage winner at the Tour de Langkawi earlier in the season, in position for the sprint. As the field rounded the final corner, 's Theo Bos lost control – having clipped the wheel of team-mate Mark Renshaw – and crashed into Alexander Kristoff (...) , and caused a stack-up which reduced the number of contenders for the stage win; 's train was still in position at the front, but Geraint Thomas delivered Mark Cavendish to the line for the incumbent world champion to claim his 31st Grand Tour stage win on the line, ahead of Goss and 's Geoffrey Soupe. Phinney held the leader's jersey after finishing within the main field, while Cavendish took the lead of the points classification from Phinney.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, the team {{was thought to be}} one of the top favorites. They had three potential candidates for victory in Hushovd, Farrar, and Haussler, all of whom had shown good form during the season and Farrar and Haussler had race wins to their credit. They admitted that they each envisioned different scenarios which would lead to their respective potential victories, possibly complicating things for the team, but they remained committed to riding as a team. Each was separately viewed by analysts or fellow riders as a favorite for the day, as well. The race played out differently from these expectations. On the Le Manie climb, [...] from the finish, Hushovd crashed from roughly the middle of the peloton, leading to the race effectively being split in two. The crash also cost Hushovd one of his wheels. While teammate Vansummeren obligingly offered the world champion one of his, Hushovd stated after the race that the crash ended his chances at victory, since he could not pedal at full strength due to a hip injury. Farrar was also caught behind this split, but Haussler was able to make the selection. He had his choice <b>leadout</b> man Klier with him, but he was unable to make the day's final split on the Poggio, finishing the race in 18th place 27 seconds behind the eight-rider group who contested the win. After the race, team manager Vaughters admitted that the race had not gone to plan, and attributed Haussler not making the selection on the Poggio to a lack of endurance stemming from not having ridden a Grand Tour or any single-day race of this length in nearly two full seasons. Vaughters also stated that this race made for a good example of why it is usually folly to designate a leader in advance of a single-day race, since nearly anything can happen on any given day.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{time trial}} went {{about as well}} as the squad could have hoped. They set the best time at the {{intermediate}} time check and at the finish line, the first and only squad to finish under 21 minutes. Though they finished with only five riders, five was all they needed, as the squad's time was taken for the fifth man to cross the line. Pinotti indeed was the first over, and took the first pink jersey. It was the second time in his career he held the Giro race lead, having previously held it for four days in the 2008 Giro d'Italia. He made it clear after the stage that the team's focus for stage 2 would be Cavendish, in the sprint. Given that the Giro awards time bonuses for the first three riders to finish a road race stage, that made it extremely likely that Cavendish would take the pink jersey the next day. The team did work for Cavendish in stage 2, and he did become the new race leader, but he missed out on the stage win. 's Alessandro Petacchi opened the sprint first, to the right of Cavendish's last <b>leadout</b> man Renshaw, leaving Cavendish to take the line to Renshaw's left. Just as Cavendish occupied a position with open road in front of him, Petacchi deviated from his line and rode directly in front of Cavendish for a few meters. When Cavendish tried to go around Petacchi, the Italian again changed his line to stay in front of Cavendish. After a moment, both sprinted with open road in front of them, and Petacchi came across the line first by a matter of millimeters. Cavendish was visibly upset, shouting and gesticulating at Petacchi after they crossed the finish line. Cavendish later explained that his frustration was not directed at Petacchi, but at race officials, since he felt he would be relegated if he had sprinted in a similar manner. However, he also said that he never had the intention of appealing the result. His sporting director Valerio Piva also took that stance, stating that Petacchi's sprint was [...] "not really fair play." [...] The next day, Cavendish made a point of apologizing to Petacchi via Twitter for his outburst after crossing the finish line. Cavendish then rode as race leader on stage 3, the day Wouter Weylandt died, finishing well back after repeated mechanical trouble. Sivtsov, Pinotti, and Lewis remained highly placed overall, staying so after the neutralized fourth stage had no effect on any of the race's standings.|$|E
2500|$|Martin took tenth {{place on}} the first stage, ending at the Mont des Alouettes, staying with the first large group on the road but unable to match the {{accelerations}} of the day's winner Philippe Gilbert. Coming off their win in the team time trial at the Giro d'Italia, and with several of the same riders plus very strong time trialist Martin present, the squad {{was considered one of}} the favorites for the Tour's team test. However, they were unable to duplicate their success from earlier in the season, finishing five seconds slower than their American rivals [...] for fifth {{place on the}} day. Stage 3 was also a day that [...] got the better of them. All appeared to be going well at first, as the team hit the front with strength and numbers once the morning's breakaway was caught. However, they made errors negotiating a sharp left-hand turn at [...] to go, and [...] was able to take first position again. Displaced by his <b>leadout</b> men's errors, Cavendish could only manage fifth in the sprint, behind 's Tyler Farrar. Cavendish rebounded in stage 5, another straightforward sprint stage. While late attacks from Edvald Boasson Hagen and Philippe Gilbert threatened to disrupt the sprint once again, the peloton chased them down, and Cavendish timed his sprint perfectly to take his first win of this Tour. Stage 6 had an undulating, hilly profile, such that the finish was unlikely to suit Cavendish. The team worked for Goss, and the Australian narrowly missed the day's honors, taking second in the final sprint behind Boasson Hagen. The flat seventh stage was perhaps the first of the Tour that went completely to popular expectations, as the HTC-Highroad team provided the strength necessary to bring back the morning breakaway and was ubiquitous in the final few kilometers, dominantly leading Cavendish out to his second win of this Tour. This stage ended at Châteauroux, site of Cavendish's first win in the 2008 Tour de France. The sprint ace was evidently quite aware of this, as he mimicked his victory reaction from three years prior, grabbing his helmt with both hands and painting a shocked expression on his face. Due to a crash involving most of , Martin and Velits entered the top ten overall with this day's results, occupying eighth and ninth place respectively at day's end. Van Garderen's presence in a stage 8 breakaway resulted in him taking the polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification. He was the first American to wear the polka dot jersey during a Tour stage in its history.|$|E
