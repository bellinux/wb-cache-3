5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{earliest}} recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers <b>like</b> <b>Little</b> Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.|$|E
5|$|The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes {{inside the}} CBC is a Canadian non-fiction book written by Richard Stursberg. The {{book is a}} memoir {{detailing}} Stursberg's experience as the vice-president in charge of English services at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) between October 2004 and August 2010. Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch who understood and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with success and failure defined {{by the number of}} people who watch, rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, <b>like</b> <b>Little</b> Mosque on the Prairie and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing broadcasting rights to its competitors.|$|E

They have three jaws (tripartite) that look <b>like</b> <b>little</b> saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. The incision leaves a mark that is an inverted Y inside of a circle. After piercing the skin and injecting anticoagulants (hirudin) and anaesthetics, they suck out blood, consuming up to ten times their body weight in a single meal.|$|E
25|$|Though the Russian Progressive rock scene {{had existed}} since the 1970s, {{it was the}} 2000s when it entered the public eye of Russian rock fans, with bands <b>like</b> <b>Little</b> Tragedies and The Gourishankar being its most obvious representatives. Since 2001 a prog-music festival named InProg was held almost yearly in Moscow. Its {{popularity}} constantly grew and in 2005 it turned from a local festival into an international one. The Russian instrumental rock scene with bands like EXIT project, Disen Gage, Dvar and Kostarev Group also received more recognition at that time.|$|E

25|$|Central Benghazi {{is where}} the {{majority}} of Benghazi's historical monuments are located, and has the city's most popular tourist attractions. Virtually all of Benghazi's theatres, libraries, best clothing stores, markets and old mosques can be found there. The Italian quarter is also located in the centre. The central districts are mostly residential and commercial areas such as Sidi Hsayn. The central suburbs are almost entirely residential and more <b>like</b> <b>little</b> towns in their own right; Al-Quwarsha {{is a good example of}} this. The coastal districts (especially the southern districts) are where Benghazi's beaches can be found. Some sections have become more popular as residential areas in recent years (such as Qanfuda). These areas are still primarily recreational however, and many beach condominium resorts (known locally as chalets) have been built in previous years such as those at al-Nakheel beach, and the Nayrouz condominiums.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 1889, {{just months}} before North Dakota and South Dakota were {{admitted}} to the Union on November 2, 1889, Congress passed an Act which partitioned the Great Sioux Reservation and created five smaller reservations. Blue Horse, Red Cloud and other Oglala Lakota leaders spoke against the Act and refused to sign the bill. Red Cloud referred to provisions of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), arguing that the terms had not been fulfilled, and that payment for what was due must be made before giving up more land. In response, General George Crook disparaged Red Cloud and threatened that the Indians will be swallowed <b>like</b> <b>little</b> fish by the whites unless they agreed to sign the bill. Red Cloud was enraged and asked the Indians who signed the bill and the Commissioners to leave the reservation. Despite the protests and legal arguments of Oglala Lakota leaders, the Great Sioux Reservation was partitioned.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even {{if this is a}} crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look <b>like</b> <b>little</b> houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E

25|$|So {{the layout}} stayed put, {{although}} in 1823-4 Schinkel {{did get to}} rebuild the Potsdam Gate. Formerly {{little more than a}} gap in the customs wall, it was replaced by a much grander affair consisting of two matching Doric-style stone gate-houses, <b>like</b> <b>little</b> temples (a nod to Friedrich Gilly perhaps), facing each other across Leipziger Straße. The one on the north side served as the customs house and excise collection point, while its southern counterpart was a military guardhouse, set up to prevent desertions of Prussian soldiers, which had become a major problem. The new gate was officially dedicated on 23 August 1824. The design also included a new look for Leipziger Platz. Attempts to create a market there to draw off some of the frenetic commercial activity in the centre of the city had not been successful. And so Schinkel proposed {{to turn it into a}} fine garden, although this part of the design was not implemented. It was a rival plan by gardener and landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné (1789–1866), drawn up in 1826, that went ahead in 1828 but with modifications. In later years Lenné would completely redesign the Tiergarten, a large wooded park formerly the Royal Hunting Grounds, also give his name to Lennéstraße, a thoroughfare forming part of the southern boundary of the park, very close to Potsdamer Platz, and transform a muddy ditch to the south into one of Berlin's busiest waterways, the Landwehrkanal.|$|E

500|$|From {{the start}} of the 20th century through the 1970s, the American tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning {{industry}} were based in San Diego, [...] "the tuna capital of the world". San Diego's first tuna cannery was founded in 1911, and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1,000 people. A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from Japan, and later from the Portuguese Azores and Italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods <b>like</b> <b>Little</b> Italy and Point Loma. Due to rising costs and foreign competition, the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|R {{remained}} {{extremely popular}} during the 1950s among black audiences, but the style {{was not considered}} appropriate for whites, or respectable middle-class blacks, because of its suggestive nature. [...] Many popular R songs instead were performed by white musicians like Pat Boone, in a more palatable, mainstream style, and turned into pop hits. By {{the end of the}} 1950s, however, there was a wave of popular black blues-rock and country-influenced R performers gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners; these included Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. Over time, producers in the R field gradually turned to more rock-based acts <b>like</b> <b>Little</b> Richard and Fats Domino.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Walden {{started to look}} for a record label.

On the way to a Pinetoppers studio session, Redding drove for Jenkins, as the latter did not have a driver's license. Jenkins performed with Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and when the session ended early, Redding received the opportunity to perform two songs. The first was [...] "Hey Hey Baby", but studio chief Jim Stewart thought it sounded too much <b>like</b> <b>Little</b> Richard.
