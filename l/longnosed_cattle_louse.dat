50|$|Pediculosis is {{more common}} in cattle than any other type of domesticated animal. This is a {{significant}} problem, as it can cause weight loss of 55 to 75 pounds per animal. Some species of lice infesting cattle include the cattle biting louse (Bovicola bovis), the shortnosed cattle louse (Haematopinus eurysternus), the <b>longnosed</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>louse</b> (Linognathus vituli), and the little blue cattle louse (Solenopotes capillatus).|$|E

5000|$|The {{little blue}} <b>cattle</b> <b>louse</b> {{is the common}} name for the Solenopotes {{capillatus}} in the United States but {{is known as the}} tubercle-bearing louse in Australia. [...] This louse is the smallest of the sucking lice that occur on cattle and is a relatively immobile species. They are found all around the world in distribution but are restricted mainly to areas with domestic livestock. The little blue <b>cattle</b> <b>louse</b> is most often found on the head of its host, primarily the face and jaw region, but sporadically is found on other body parts. It is relatively immobile so typically will not relocate on its host’s body. The louse is spread by direct contact and is considered an ectoparasite.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of zeta-cypermethrin pour-on to control <b>cattle</b> <b>lice.</b> Design Five field trials in south-eastern Australia. Procedure Zeta-cypermethrin pour-on, deltamethrin pour-on and pour-on vehicle were applied to groups of 10 cattle. Lice were counted before treatment and 14, 28, 42 and 56 days after treatment. Results Zeta-cypermethrin pour-on given at 2. 5 mg/kg was equivalent to, or marginally more effective than a deltamethrin pour-on at 0. 75 mg/kg. It eliminated B bovis and H eurysternus and gave good control of L vituli and S capillatus. Zeta-cypermethrin at 1 mg/kg gave good control of B bovis and H eurysternus but was not satisfactory against L vituli and S capillatus. Conclusion Zeta-cypermethrin pour-on, given at 2. 5 mg/kg, is an effective treatment for <b>cattle</b> <b>lice</b> control. Zeta-cypermethrin, and other synthetic pyrethroid pour-ons, are the treatment of choice to control B bovis...|$|R

40|$|The chewing louse Werneckiella equi is an {{ectoparasite}} of donkeys {{and other}} equids. Alphacypermethrin (ACYP) is a pyrethroid insecticide commonly {{used for the}} control of insects of veterinary and public health concerns.

40|$|During last August 1 {{learned that}} the pigs on the College Farm were being troubled with lice. I had for some time been anxious to try the {{kerosene}} emulsion remedy against these disgusting pests as used so successfully {{for the destruction of}} <b>cattle</b> <b>lice</b> last winter and reported upon in Bulletin 5 of this station. Mixtures of kerosene and lard, and lard and sulphur, as ordinarily recommended against parasites upon domestic animals were first tried that I might know from experience how much of a task it would be to use these substances in the usual way. As I had anticipated, it was found to be a tedious operation if many animals were to be treated and especially if they were wild. In fact I {{came to the conclusion that}} any remedy like the preceding where oils or washes are to be applied with a cloth, brush or curry comb, can hardly be practical except in cases where the lice are very abundant or where there are but a few very valuable tame animals that do not object to being handled. At least, this method of treatment would be very unsatisfactory in most cases...|$|R
40|$|Two groups (A and C) {{of range}} cows were treated in February with {{chlorpyrifos}} (16 mL Dursban 44 /cow) {{for the control}} of heavy infestations of the short-nosed <b>cattle</b> <b>louse.</b> Group A was treated in 1977 and group C in 1979 and each treated group was compared with a separate untreated group. Some of the treated cows were identified as carriers of louse infestation (subgroups A 1 and C 1), while others were noncarriers (subgroups A 2 and C 2). The maximum level of reduction in louse populations was 99 % at week 4 posttreatment in subgroup A 1, 99 % from weeks 2 - 16 posttreatment in subgroup A 2, 92 % at week 3 posttreatment in subgroup C 1 and 100 % at weeks 15 - 17 in subgroup C 2. Clinically, the treated cows, which were anemic {{at the time of}} treatment, recovered from anemia during the posttreatment period of 25 weeks for group A and 17 weeks for group C. Remission of anemia also occurred in the two untreated groups, possibly because of natural summer decline in louse population. The treatment had no effect on the whole blood cholinesterase of the cows and the treated cows showed no signs of organophosphorous toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of an eradication programme for lice on {{the prevalence of}} light flecks and spots on cattle hides was studied in 33 dairy cattle herds {{during a period of}} two and a half years.

The prevalence of hides without light flecks and spots increased from 24. 2 % before treatment to 61. 6 % after treatment.

50|$|B. bovis {{is found}} in {{temperate}} climates worldwide. It is most abundant in North America because of the amounts of <b>cattle</b> present.

50|$|Bovicola bovis parasitize cattle {{of any age}} {{and size}} and have not been {{documented}} on alternative vertebrates. The common places on the <b>cattle</b> that the <b>louse</b> can be found are the head, neck, back, and the rear end. These lice are obligate parasites, meaning they require the host to survive. Without the host providing both food and shelter, the louse would die.|$|R

40|$|Beef calves from 2 sources {{entering}} southern Alberta feedlots in {{the winters}} of 1997 - 98 and 1998 - 99, were surveyed {{for the presence}} of lice. A random sample of multiple source (MS), that is, auction market-derived, calves entering commercial feedlots and single source (SS) calves entering a backgrounding feedlot were examined {{for the presence of}} lice at entry to the feedlot. A standardized examination, which involved hair-part examination of 8 louse predilection sites, was conducted on each selected calf to determine prevalence and intensity of infestation. The long-nosed sucking louse, Linognathus vituli, was the most commonly encountered species. This species infested from 57. 8 % to 95. 6 % of the calves selected from both MS and SS calves during both winters. Louse index values, indicating intensity of infestation, for L. vituli ranged from 1 to 243 lice per animal. The chewing louse, Bovicola bovis, was present on MS and SS calves only in the winter of 1998 - 99. The louse index values for B. bovis ranged from 1 to 230 lice per animal. Mixed infestations of the L. vituli and B. bovis were common. The little blue <b>cattle</b> <b>louse,</b> Solenopotes capillatus, was present only on the SS calves in the winter of 1997 - 98. The short-nosed sucking louse, Haematopinus eurysternus, was present at very low intensities, 1 - 2 lice per animal, on 2. 6 % to 4. 4 % of the MS calves during both winters. Comparison of results from the current study with published literature suggests that efforts to determine the economic impact of louse infestations are confounded by the lack of a uniform method to assess louse population levels...|$|R
