50|$|The Central <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Facility</b> {{was created}} by the U.S. Congress in 1998 with the National Credit Union Central <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Facility</b> Act, Subchapter III of the Federal Credit Union Act. The primary purpose of the CLF is to provide loans to credit unions to meet short or long term {{liquidity}} needs. It performs the same general functions for credit unions that the Federal Reserve System performs for member banks.|$|R
50|$|The Central <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Facility</b> {{is backed}} by the credit of the U.S. government. The CLF may borrow up to 12 times its subscribed capital stock and surplus (12 USC 1795f(a)(4)(A)).|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the global financial crisis that started in August 2007, central banks provided extraordinary amounts of liquidity to the financial system. To investigate the effect of central bank <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> on term interbank lending rates, we estimate a six-factor arbitrage-free model of U. S. Treasury yields, financial corporate bond yields, and term interbank rates. This model can account for fluctuations in the term structure of credit risk and liquidity risk.

40|$|Abstract: The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System is a large, complex, and understudied governmentsponsored <b>liquidity</b> <b>facility</b> that {{currently}} {{has more than}} $ 1 trillion in secured loans outstanding, mostly to commercial banks and thrifts. This paper first documents the significant {{role played by the}} FHLB System {{at the outset of the}} ongoing financial crisis and then provides evidence about the uses of these funds by their bank and thrift members. We then identify the trade-offs faced by FHLB member-borrowers when choosing between accessing the FHLB System or the Federal Reserve’s discount window during the crisis. We conclude by describing the fragmented U. S. lender-of-last-resort framework and finding that additional clarity about the respective roles of the various <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> would be helpful...|$|R

50|$|By 1977, {{services}} available to credit union members expanded, including share certificates and mortgage lending. In 1979, a three-member Board replaced the NCUA administrator.

5000|$|Foreign {{exchange}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> {{can help}} reduce {{the risks associated with}} borrowing money in a different currency by creating a line of credit that can be drawn on when the project needs money as a result of local currency devaluation but then repaid when the project has a financial surplus.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{off-balance sheet}} categories are also weighted: they {{will contribute to}} the long-term assets. This is best explained by the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity (revocable and irrevocable line of credit and <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> to clients). Therefore, once the standard is in place, off-balance sheet commitments will need to be funded, within the stable funding.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} support their high senior ratings, SIVs were obliged to obtain {{significant}} capital and <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> (so-called back-stop facilities) from banks to cover some of the senior issuance.

40|$|One of {{the chief}} actions taken by the Federal Reserve in {{response}} to the financial crisis was the introduction or expansion of facilities designed to provide liquidity to the funding markets. A study of the programs suggests that the <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> generated $ 20 billion in interest and fee income between August 2007 and December 2009, or $ 13 billion after taking into account the estimated $ 7 billion cost of funds. Moreover, the Fed took important steps to limit the credit exposure it incurred in connection with the facilities. After the start of the financial crisis in August 2007, the Federal Reserve adopted many measures to mitigate the disruptions in financial markets, including the introduction or expansion of <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities.</b> Many studies have found that the facilities were effective in promoting financial stability during the crisis. 1 In addition, because the facilities were designed according to well-understood lender-of-last-resort principles—the Fed’s loans were well collateralized and generally priced at a premium to the cost of funds—they also earned considerable income...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System {{is a large}} cooperatively owned government-sponsored <b>liquidity</b> <b>facility</b> {{that lends}} predominately to U.

30|$|We {{conclude}} that promoting house ownership {{should be in}} situ or close to the central business district. Incentives {{to the private sector}} to build cheap houses in scale would help increase the supply of housing for low-income families. The location of the new houses is key for the success of the program. Still, access to the financial market is very limited for the poor, so <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> are of little help for this population segment.|$|R

40|$|In 1683 the Bank of Amsterdam {{introduced}} {{a form of}} fiat money that successfully competed with the coinage of the time.

50|$|In 2007, the sub-prime crisis {{caused a}} {{widespread}} liquidity crunch in the CP market. Because SIVs rely on short-dated CP to fund longer-dated assets, {{they need to}} roll over their liabilities, just like Banks do. Unlike standard asset backed commercial paper conduits, SIVs do not have <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> that cover 100% of their outstanding CP.

5000|$|The {{greatest}} single {{objection to}} ILLR is fear of moral hazard, as {{access to a}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>facility</b> may lead countries to opt for bolder policies with less liquidity self-protection (e.g. lower reserves) and, {{in the event of}} a liquidity crisis, to choose to incur debt from the ILLR to avoid default on private debts and preserve creditworthiness. [...] In addition, private risk-taking as well as public risk-taking might increase in a setting characterized by a combination of inadequate macro-prudential regulation and the elimination of systemic risk.|$|R
40|$|In {{the months}} {{preceding}} {{the failure of}} Lehman Brothers in September 2008, banks {{were willing to pay}} a premium over the Federal Reserve's discount window (DW) rate to participate in the much less flexible Term Auction Facility (TAF). We empirically test the predictions of a new signalling model that offers a rationale for offering two different <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities.</b> In our model, illiquid yet solvent banks need to pay a high cost to access the TAF as a way to signal their quality, in exchange for more favourable funding in the future. Less solvent banks access the less costly and more flexible DW in case they experience an unexpected run, paying a higher future funding cost. The existence of two facilities with different characteristics allowed banks to signal their level of solvency, which helped to decrease asymmetric information during the crisis. Using recently disclosed data on access to these facilities, we provide evidence consistent with these results. Banks that accessed TAF in 2008 paid approximately 31 basis points less in the interbank lending market in 2010 and were perceived as less risky than banks that accessed the DW. Our results can contribute to a better design of <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> during a financial crisis...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the corporate crisis, Fryzel proposed {{the creation of the}} Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund to Congress to manage the costs of paying for the corporate credit union failures over time. Fryzel also addressed the severe liquidity challenges facing the credit union industry by requesting and receiving from Congress the authority to increase the borrowing authority of the Central <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Facility</b> from $1.5 billion to $41.5billion.Fryzel worked with staff to develop programs to stabilize the corporate system and prepare extensive contingency plans.In November 2008, Chairman Fryzel and the NCUA Board determined that extensions of credit by the Central <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Facility</b> (CLF) for “other than liquidity needs” were of national economic interest and obtained the concurrence of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury to invoke NCUA’s non-liquidity-needs lending authority through December 31, 2009.On December 9, 2008, Fryzel provided details on the Credit Union Homeowners Affordability Relief Program (CU HARP), unveiled in November, and a complementary program to provide contingent liquidity for the corporate credit union system, the Credit Union System Investment Program (CU SIP). These were new temporary initiatives for CLF extensions of credit to credit unions made to meet system liquidity needs.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{crises in}} {{emerging}} markets {{call into question}} the effectiveness of market discipline for ensuring efficient foreign borrowing. We review arguments that indicate that market discipline is limited by lack of information and may be dangerously distorted by moral hazard induced by official guarantees. Aside from these well-known concerns, we show that the market fails to internalize country risk and panic risk, which leads to inefficient borrowing {{even in the absence of}} traditional distortions. We also discuss optimal tax and trade policy as well as the role of <b>liquidity</b> <b>facilities</b> to address these externalities. ...|$|R

Here, we expound a simple model that integrates inexpensive interest-free <b>liquidity</b> <b>facility</b> within an endogenous leverage circuit. This builds on the technology of ROSCA/ASCRA/mutual/financial cooperative and cultural beliefs indoctrinated in Islam.
