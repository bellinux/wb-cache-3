5|$|Control {{of water}} {{was the primary}} concern in the {{building}} of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction <b>loan,</b> <b>and</b> those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.|$|E
5|$|The Last Judgement was an {{especially}} appropriate subject for setting a relic from the Crown of Thorns.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits granted by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits, we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on the institutional sector Rest of the World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits by the euro area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of Monetary Financial Institutions in Eurosystem and Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits, such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of the institutional sector receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits (4.48 trillion euros), <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> deposits granted and received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|R

5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a <b>loan,</b> <b>and</b> refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm.
