The influences of nanomachining experimental parameters (<b>lateral</b> <b>feed</b> and velocity) on the properties of engineering surface, material removal and chip formation were studied. Results indicated that the cutting depth of nanomachined surface increased as the <b>lateral</b> <b>feed</b> decreased. Insensitivity of cutting depth to velocity at same normal load was revealed. The different chip behaviors of nanomachined surface were investigated through scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results indicated that different lateral feeds caused different chip behaviors. Three typical chip behaviors were characterized as the <b>lateral</b> <b>feed</b> increased. In addition, the chip behavior and the volume of material removed were observed having no evident linear transformation with {{the evolution of the}} velocity by SEM graphics. Furthermore, it was concluded from the chip behaviors in nanomachining process that the material at high loads was removed by plastic deformation with no fracture or crack happened...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the literature, {{the most}} studies {{conducted}} on the flat surface ball-burnishing process have {{been focused on the}} most important classical factors like burnishing speed, <b>lateral</b> <b>feed,</b> and the ball-burnishing load or pressure on the treated surfaces integrity enhancement. In this research, ballburnishing strategies are studied as a new ball-burnishing factor. The aim of this research is to show the improvement of the flat surface integrity of 2017 A-T 451 aluminum alloy using six new ball-burnishing strategies. Ball-burnishing tests were conducted in two passes using the recommended values of the ball-burnishing factors (the penetration depth ab is 40 μm, the linear ball-burnishing speed Vb is 500 mm/min and a <b>lateral</b> <b>feed</b> f of 0. 2 mm). Two ball-burnishing strategies in two successive and perpendicular passes to the machining direction and four ball-burnishing strategies in two crossed passes have been designed and tested to improve the flat surfaces integrity of the samples. The characterization and the micrographic observations of the ball-burnished surfaces show that using the best ball-burnishing strategy leads to a great enhancement in surface quality. The latter is predicted by a gain in average roughness Ra of 81 %, an improvement in the mean spacing of profile irregularities Sm of 34 %, an enhancement in surface Nano-hardness HIT of 17 %, and sub-layer hardness betterment up to a depth of 500 μm...|$|E

The copolymer system studied (vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate) is strongly prone to composition drift due to very different reactivity ratios. An axially dispersed plug flow model, based on classical free radical copolymerization kinetics, was developed for this process and used successfully to optimize the <b>lateral</b> <b>feeding</b> profile to reduce compositional drift.

Typical examples are the emerging broadband wireless networks for customer premises and residential applica-tions that will operate in the millimeter-wave frequency region. The particular property of the considered reflector is its diverging surface instead of the commonly applied converging shape.

The mathematical modeling of the average roughness Ra, of the mean spacing of roughness profile irregularities Sm and of the surface hardness HIT of the treated surfaces was performed by the response surface methodology (RSM). Best ball-burnished surface integrity has been established by the application of optimal ballburnishing studied factors (Vb = 500 mm/min, ab= 40 μm, and f = 0. 2 mm).

Patients with PAOD may experience intermittent claudication, or the pain in limb skeletal muscles due to a decease in blood flow. Collateral arteries {{can act as a}} natural bypass and improve blood flow to hypoxic tissue by creating an alternate route for blood to flow, but not all patients with PAOD have pre-existing collateral networks. Animal studies indicate that tissues without pre-existing collateral networks can form de novo collaterals from capillaries following occlusion of a feed artery. Unfortunately, theses de novo collaterals, termed arterialized collateral capillaries (ACCs) lack functional vasodilation at day- 7 following feed artery occlusion. To induce the formation of ACCs, we ligated the <b>lateral</b> <b>feed</b> artery in the spinotrapzeius muscle in Balb/c mice. We evaluated the potential mechanism of impaired functional vasodilation in immature arterialized collateral capillaries (7 days following occlusion) by measuring endothelial-dependent vasodilation to bradykinin and endothelial-independent vasodilation to isoproterenol and sodium nitroprusside. Vasodilation to both the endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasodilators was impaired in the immature ACCs as compared to the terminal arterioles on the unoperated sham side. Similar responses to the endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell-dependent vasodilations suggest that impaired functional vasodialtion is due to impaired vascular smooth muscle cell function, which is consistent with our preivous research. We speculate that the SMCs of the ACCs are immature and may still be remodeling, rearranging, or modulating phenotype in the newly formed collaterals.

40|$|Lateralization {{is defined}} as a {{behavior}} or mental process displayed by an animal {{in which there is a}} distinctive side preference. Caribbean flamingos have been shown to display lateralization in neck resting behavior (Anderson, Williams, & O‟Brien, 2009), and relationships between this side preference and aggression (Anderson, Williams, & Bono, 2010) and pair-bonding (Williams & Anderson, 2012) have been previously found. The present study investigated whether Caribbean flamingos display lateral behavioral preferences in foot scratching and two types of stamp-feeding behavior, and examined the relationship, if any, between these lateral behaviors and both pair-bonding and aggression. Four of the birds displayed an individual-level lateral preference on one of the two feeding behaviors. Foot scratching preference was related to age such that older birds tended to utilize the right foot more for scratching. Results also suggested that birds who scratch with the left foot are more likely to be involved in, to be targeted in, and to lose fights, suggesting that lateral foot usage during scratching may be somehow related to social behaviors in this species, but as significant lateral scratching preferences were not found, such results must be viewed with caution.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven <b>lateral</b> <b>feed</b> has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|E

This glucostatic theory appeared to be supported by the finding (12) that a single injection of goldthioglucose was followed by the production of ventromedial hypothalamic lesions and the development of hyperphagia and obesity, whereas similar injections of a number of other organic gold derivatives (goldthiomalate, goldthioglycerol, goldthiocaproate, goldthiosorbitol, goldthiogalactose) did not produce these results. The glucostatic theory also appeared to be supported by our recent finding that the administration of goldthioglucose, but not goldthiomalate, is followed by a demonstrable localization of gold in the ventromedial hypothalamic lesion (14, 15). In the studies to be described we have investigated the relationship of the extracellular glucose concentration to the deposition of gold in the mouse hypothalamus after a single intravenous injection of goldthioglucose.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. For distribution systems, failure of an underground cable results in an unscheduled outage. An unscheduled outage costs a utility manpower and materials, and affects their reliability index. Thus, the need for an on-line, non-destructive, incipient fault detection system, which can also predict the remaining life of an underground cable, is prevalent. Such an incipient fault detection system could enable utilities to reconfigure the distribution system or replace the cable before a catastrophic failure. The long term-objective of the research project being conducted by the Power System Automation Laboratory (PSAL) at Texas A&M University is to develop such a non-destructive, on-line monitoring system that can not only detect incipient faults but also predict the remaining life of the cable. Earlier research work conducted by the Power System Automation Lab included the development of two prototype monitoring systems. The first monitoring system was used to monitor field aged and intentionally damaged cable sections in a controlled environment. These controlled monitoring (CE) experiments were conducted at the Downed Conductor Testing Facility at Texas A&M University Riverside Campus. The second monitoring system was used to monitor for short periods of time various cable <b>laterals</b> <b>feeding</b> residential and commercial areas of the Dallas, Texas area.

Our results suggest: 1) repeated emplacement of magma through intrusions below the caldera centre; 2) occasional lateral transfer of magma feeding non-central eruptions within the caldera. Comparison with historical unrest at calderas worldwide suggests that this behavior is common...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} differences in feeding habits of small-sized ichthyofauna among lateral lagoons {{and the river}} channel in a large reservoir. The study was performed in four lagoons and in one sampling site of the main channel in Rosana Reservoir, Paranapanema River, Brazil. The samples were taken in September and November of 2004 and in January, March, May, and August of 2005. Fish were sampled with a 7. 5 m 2 hand net. Five manual throws were made toward aquatic macrophytes stands. The sampling design favored the collection of small-sized fish fauna (juveniles/small-sized species). The stomach contents of 42 species were analyzed. A total of 183 different items were consumed by fish. These items were grouped in 11 food categories, which were used to classify fish into seven trophic guilds. Aquatic insects were consumed by 32 species and were the predominant feeding item. In the river, the most consumed items were aquatic insects, cladocerans, and phytoplankton, whereas in the lagoons aquatic insects, copepods, and cladocerans were the main items. By comparing each trophic guild, the number of insectivores, algivores, and zooplanktivores species was higher in the lagoons than in the river, and the opposite was found only for omnivore fish. Low niche width in all sites indicates high trophic specialization and low niche overlap between pairs of species. Fish assemblage in the <b>lateral</b> lagoons presents <b>feeding</b> habits distinct {{from those of the}} river species, indicating that the coexistence and high abundance of small-sized fish in the sampling sites are explained by their high feeding adaptability, which includes a tendency toward dietary specialization, low feeding overlap, and resource partitioning, along with different temporal resource uses...|$|R
40|$|The large Cerro de Pasco Cordilleran {{base metal}} deposit in central Peru {{is located on}} the eastern margin of a middle Miocene diatreme-dome complex and {{comprises}} two mineralization stages. The first stage consists of a large pyrite-quartz body replacing Lower Mesozoic Pucará carbonate rocks and, to a lesser extent, diatreme breccia. This body is composed of pyrite with pyrrhotite inclusions, quartz, and black and red chalcedony (containing hypogene hematite). At the contact with the pyrite-quartz body, the diatreme breccia is altered to pyrite-quartz-sericite-pyrite. This body was, in part, replaced by pipelike pyrrhotite bodies zoned outward to carbonate-replacement Zn-Pb ores bearing Fe-rich sphalerite (up to 24 mol % FeS). The second mineralization stage is partly superimposed on the first and consists of zoned east-west–trending Cu-Ag-(Au-Zn-Pb) enargite-pyrite veins hosted in the diatreme breccia {{in the western part of}} the deposit and well-zoned Zn-Pb-(Bi-Ag-Cu) carbonate-replacement orebodies; in both cases, sphalerite is Fe poor and the inner parts of the orebodies show typically advanced argillic alteration assemblages, including aluminum phosphate sulfate (APS) minerals. The zoned enargite-pyrite veins display mineral zoning, from a core of enargite- pyrite ± alunite with traces of Au, through an intermediate zone of tennantite, chalcopyrite, and Bi minerals to a poorly developed outer zone bearing sphalerite-galena ± kaolinite. The carbonate-hosted replacement ores are controlled along N 35 °E, N 90 ° E, N 120 ° E, and N 170 ° E faults. They form well-zoned upward-flaring pipelike orebodies with a core of famatinite-pyrite and alunite, an intermediate zone with tetrahedrite- pyrite, chalcopyrite, matildite, cuprobismutite, emplectite, and other Bi minerals accompanied by APS minerals, kaolinite, and dickite, and an outer zone composed of Fe-poor sphalerite (in the range of 0. 05 – 3. 5 mol % FeS) and galena. The outermost zone consists of hematite, magnetite, and Fe-Mn-Zn-Ca-Mg carbonates. Most of the second-stage carbonate-replacement orebodies plunge between 25 ° and 60 ° to the west, suggesting that the hydrothermal fluids ascended from deeper levels and that no <b>lateral</b> <b>feeding</b> from the veins to the carbonate-replacement orebodies took place. In the Venencocha and Santa Rosa areas, located 2. 5 km northwest of the Cerro de Pasco open pit and in the southern part of the deposit, respectively, advanced argillic altered dacitic domes and oxidized veins with advanced argillic alteration halos occur. The latter veins are possibly the oxidized equivalent of the second-stage enargite-pyrite veins located in the western part of the deposit. The alteration assemblage quartz-muscovite-pyrite associated with the pyrite-quartz body suggests that the first stage precipitated at slightly acidic pH. The sulfide mineral assemblages define an evolutionary path close to the pyrite-pyrrhotite boundary and are characteristic of low-sulfidation states; they suggest that the oxidizing, slightly acidic hydrothermal fluid was buffered by phyllite, shale, and carbonate host rock. However, the presence in the pyrite-quartz body of hematite within quartz suggests that, locally, the fluids were less buffered by the host rock. The mineral assemblages of the second mineralization stage are characteristic of high- to intermediate- sulfidation states. High-sulfidation states and oxidizing conditions were achieved and maintained in the cores of the second-stage orebodies, even in those replacing carbonate rocks. The observation that, in places, second-stage mineral assemblages are found in the inner and outer zones is explained in terms of the hydrothermal fluid advancing and waning. Microthermometric data from fluid inclusions in quartz indicate that the different ores of the first mineralization stage formed at similar temperatures and moderate salinities (200 °– 275 °C and 0. 2 – 6. 8 wt % NaCl equiv in the pyrite-quartz body; 192 °– 250 °C and 1. 1 – 4. 3 wt % NaCl equiv in the pyrrhotite bodies; and 183 °– 212 °C and 3. 2 – 4. 0 wt % NaCl equiv in the Zn-Pb ores). These values are similar to those obtained for fluid inclusions in quartz and sphalerite from the second-stage ores (187 °– 293 °C and 0. 2 – 5. 2 wt % NaCl equiv in the enargitepyrite veins; 178 °– 265 °C and 0. 2 – 7. 5 wt % NaCl equiv in quartz of carbonate-replacement orebodies; 168 °– 222 °C and 3 – 11. 8 wt % NaCl equiv in sphalerite of carbonate-replacement orebodies; and 245 °– 261 °C and 3. 2 – 7. 7 wt % NaCl equiv in quartz from Venencocha). Oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions on kaolinite from carbonate-replacement orebodies (! 18 O = 5. 3 – 11. 5 ‰, !D = – 82 to – 114 ‰) and on alunite from the Venencocha and Santa Rosa areas (! 18 O = 1. 9 – 6. 9 ‰, !D = – 56 to – 73 ‰). Oxygen isotope compositions of quartz from the first and second stages have ! 18 O values from 9. 1 to 17. 8 per mil. Calculated fluids in equilibrium with kaolinite have ! 18 O values of 2. 0 to 8. 2 and !D values of – 69 to – 97 per mil; values in equilibrium with alunite are – 1. 4 to – 6. 4 and – 62 to – 79 per mil. Sulfur isotope compositions of sulfides from both stages have a narrow range of ! 34 S values, between – 3. 7 and + 4. 2 per mil; values for sulfates from the second stage are between 4. 2 and 31. 2 per mil. These results define two mixing trends for the ore-forming fluids. The first trend reflects mixing between a moderately saline (~ 10 wt % NaCl equiv) magmatic end member that had degassed (as indicated by the low !D values) and meteoric water. The second mixing indicates condensation of magmatic vapor with HCl and SO 2 into meteoric water, which formed alunite. The hydrothermal system at Cerro de Pasco was emplaced at a shallow depth (~ 500 m) in the epithermal and upper part of a porphyry environment. The similar temperatures and salinities obtained for the first stage and second stages, together with the stable isotope data, indicate that both stages are linked and represent successive stages of epithermal polymetallic mineralization in the upper part of a porphyry system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFood-intake {{control is}} {{mediated}} by a heterogeneous network of different neural subtypes, distributed over various hypothalamic nuclei and other brain structures, {{in which each}} subtype can release more than one neurotransmitter or neurohormone. The complexity of the interactions of these subtypes poses a challenge to understanding their specific contributions to food-intake control, and apparent consistencies in the dataset can be contradicted by new findings. For example, the growing consensus that arcuate nucleus neurons expressing Agouti-related peptide (AgRP neurons) promote feeding, while those expressing pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC neurons) suppress feeding, is contradicted by findings that low AgRP neuron activity and high POMC neuron activity {{can be associated with}} high levels of food intake. Similarly, the growing consensus that GABAergic neurons in the <b>lateral</b> hypothalamus suppress <b>feeding</b> is contradicted by findings suggesting the opposite. Yet the complexity of the food-intake control network admits many different network behaviors. It is possible that anomalous associations between the responses of certain neural subtypes and feeding are actually consistent with known interactions, but their effect on feeding depends on the responses of the other neural subtypes in the network. We explored this possibility through computational analysis. We made a computer model of the interactions between the hypothalamic and other neural subtypes known to be involved in food-intake control, and optimized its parameters so that model behavior matched observed behavior over an extensive test battery. We then used specialized computational techniques to search the entire model state space, where each state represents a different configuration of the responses of the units (model neural subtypes) in the network. We found that the anomalous associations between the responses of certain hypothalamic neural subtypes and feeding are actually consistent with the known structure of the food-intake control network, and we could specify {{the ways in which the}} anomalous configurations differed from the expected ones. By analyzing the temporal relationships between different states we identified the conditions under which the anomalous associations can occur, and these stand as model predictions...|$|R

O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a diferença no hábito alimentar da ictiofauna entre lagoas laterais e o canal do rio num reservatório de grande porte. O estudo foi realizado em quatro lagoas e um ponto no reservatório de Rosana, rio Paranapanema, Brasil. As amostras foram coletadas em setembro e novembro de 2004 e janeiro, março, maio e agosto de 2005. Foram realizados cinco arrastos manuais com uma rede de 7, 5 m 2, junto aos bancos de macrófitas aquáticas. O desenho amostral favoreceu a coleta de peixes juvenis e espécies de pequeno porte. Os conteúdos estomacais de 42 espécies foram analisados. Um total de 183 diferentes itens foi consumido, que foram agrupados em 11 categorias alimentares. Sete guildas tróficas foram estabelecidas. Insetos aquáticos foram consumidos por 32 espécies de peixes, sendo o item alimentar predominante. O padrão alimentar da ictiofauna no rio foi diferente quando comparado as lagoas, como demonstrado na Análise de Correspondência Destendenciada. No rio, os principais itens alimentares foram insetos aquáticos, cladóceros e fitoplâncton, enquanto que nas lagoas os principais itens foram insetos aquáticos, copépodes e cladóceros. Comparando-se cada guilda trófica, o número de espécies de insetívoros, algívoros e zooplanctívoros foi maior nas lagoas do que no rio e o oposto foi encontrado somente para os onívoros. Foram registrados baixos valores de amplitude de nicho, indicando que as espécies apresentam alta especialização trófica, e baixa sobreposição de nicho trófico entre os pares de espécies. Finalmente, este estudo mostra que a coexistência e alta abundância das espécies de peixe de pequeno porte encontrada nas lagoas laterais são explicadas pela adaptabilidade alimentar, o uso temporal dos recursos pelos peixes e pela ampla disponibilidade de alimento existente nas lagoas...|$|R
