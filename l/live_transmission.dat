In {{a telephone interview from}} a <b>live</b> <b>transmission</b> of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque.

Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. Quatermass II {{was one of the}} first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.|$|E

500|$|As the {{shooting}} took place, ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast, while the CBS broadcast was already over. It {{was not until}} 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of {{the shooting}} would begin. [...] ABC's Howard K. Smith had signed off {{the air and the}} closing credits and advertisements were playing over a wide studio shot of the anchors and staff when a voice over alerted the audience several times to stay tuned for a special report. [...] More than four minutes passed before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no <b>live</b> <b>transmission</b> capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white.

500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} <b>live</b> <b>transmission,</b> as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out".

500|$|Plans to {{broadcast}} {{the first ever}} live episode of EastEnders were announced by the BBC on 15 September 2009. Santer initially refrained from discussing the episode's plot, but commented that it would resolve a [...] "big storyline" [...] which would [...] "keep the audience (as well as the cast and crew) guessing until the very last moment." [...] Santer confirmed that Archie's killer would be revealed in the live episode, and that their identity would be kept secret until the night of broadcast, even from the cast member playing them. The EastEnders cast and crew had two weeks to rehearse the episode prior to its <b>live</b> <b>transmission.</b> The script was issued {{on the afternoon of}} 5 February 2010, written by Simon Ashdown. The first read-through took place on 8 February 2010, though producers held back the part of the script revealing Archie's true killer. Ten different possible endings were scripted and rehearsed, each showing one character confessing to the murder. The ten characters were Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), Peggy and Stacey. Santer reiterated that the actor playing the killer would only be told so thirty minutes before the broadcast. He explained that the killer [...] "may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: [...] "In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you're being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why." [...] Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: [...] "They are as desperate to know who did it as the viewers." [...] Actor Charlie Clements, who played Bradley Branning, announced in November 2009 that he would be leaving the soap in 2010. It was later revealed that Bradley would make his last appearance in [...] "EastEnders Live", urged to flee Walford by his father Max and uncle Jack after becoming the prime suspect in the investigation into Archie's murder.|$|E
