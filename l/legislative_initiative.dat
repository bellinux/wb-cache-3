5|$|The Diet had {{legislative}} powers. The <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> was {{possessed by}} the Emperor, along with the Diet executive (six deputies and the Marshal), and all individual deputies. It could debate and pass laws related to many issues {{in the field of}} education, culture, welfare, justice, public works, administration, religion and military. It could also impose supplementary taxes, up to 10% of the direct tax.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> (except {{for the fact that}} the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> to the southern Whigs.|$|E

5|$|The Sejm had {{the right}} to vote on civil, {{administrative}} and legal issues; a simple majority was required to pass laws. With permission from the king, it could vote on matters related to the fiscal system and the military. It {{had the right}} to control government officials, and could prepare reviews and reports on them to present to the king. It had legislative competences in court and administrative law. It could issue laws on currency, taxation and budget, deal with issues related to military conscription (such as its size), and amend the constitution. It had no <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative,</b> as that belong only to the king; however, the Sejm could issue petitions to the monarch with proposed legislation.|$|E
5|$|By the afternoon, the {{majority}} of Soyuz members favoured an immediate vote. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Anatoly Lukyanov, had already departed for Novo Ogarevo {{to take part in}} constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell Gorbachev about the vote. In his place stood Ivan Laptev, a pro-Gorbachev reformer, who did not trust Lukyanov and tried to stall the vote by demanding a statement from the KGB, Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. According to Laptev, the mood was such that if a vote had been taken Pavlov would have won. At the time, both the Soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the Soviet Government and so they too supported Pavlov's program. Soyuz, through a vote, was able to increase the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers, and gave the institution the right of <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> was {{to propose}} a {{dramatic}} increase in spending for the Works Progress Administration in order to increase employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with an economic downturn the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} avenues that FVAP uses to work with states and territories is through <b>legislative</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Each year, FVAP formulates and sends {{recommended}} <b>legislative</b> <b>initiatives</b> to states and territories urging them to adopt those changes. As required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (NDAA FY02), FVAP received reports from state governors and territory officials in 2003, 2004, and 2005 {{on the status of}} FVAP-recommended <b>legislative</b> <b>initiatives.</b> FVAP reviews and forwards these reports to state and territory Congressional delegations and compiles data on the legislative accomplishments.

5|$|The European Parliament (EP) {{shares the}} {{legislative}} and budgetary {{authority of the}} Union with the Council of the European Union (not {{to be confused with}} the European Council). Its 751 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. They represent nearly 500million citizens (the world's second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some sensitive areas, and does not have <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative.</b> It does, however, have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. It has been said that its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the European Parliament is better {{compared}} with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union. This is notable {{in terms of the}} committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative.</b> However, given that in most national parliaments initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals.|$|E
5|$|As secretary, Zahorchak {{implemented}} {{state funding}} for pre-kindergarten and full-day kindergarten, training for principals, and easier ways to transfer college credits from one school to another. He has managed $200million in Accountability Block Grants {{that were used}} for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet {{the specific needs of}} individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291million in 2008–09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274million.|$|E
50|$|NDAA FY02 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) {{made two}} of FVAP’s <b>legislative</b> <b>initiatives</b> {{mandatory}} in all states and territories: (1) {{the acceptance of}} FPCA as a request for ballots for all elections in a calendar year, and (2) {{the removal of the}} “not earlier than” restrictions for registration requests.

5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{exchange}} for approving the Commission, Parliament secured an agreement from Barroso ensuring Parliament's president may attend the Commission meetings and international negotiations. However Barroso resisted Parliament's calls for de facto <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> for Parliament and for a veto power over special representatives.|$|E
25|$|The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937—frequently {{called the}} court-packing plan,— was a <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> {{to add more}} justices to the Supreme Court {{proposed}} by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt shortly after his victory in the 1936 presidential election. Although the bill aimed generally to overhaul and modernize all of the federal court system, its central and most controversial provision would have granted the President power to appoint an additional Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court for every sitting member {{over the age of}} 70½, up to a maximum of six.|$|E

25|$|In 1501, King Aleksander Jagiellończyk {{signed the}} Privilege of Mielnik, {{through which he}} gave the <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> to the Senate of Poland. This {{privilege}} empowered the magnates who sat in the Senate, {{but it did not}} last long, as it was repealed by the general sejms (Poland's parliament) of 1504 and 1505. Nevertheless, another milestone {{in the development of the}} nobles' democracy was achieved in 1505 with the establishment of the constitutional principle of nihil novi, or Nihil Novi nisi commune consensu ("Nothing new without the general consent"). This privilege vastly empowered the entire general sejm (of which the Senate was a part) instead of just the Senate; its crucial part was the statement that no law could be passed without the approval of the entire sejm.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, {{although}} {{not old enough}} to be elected, Clay was appointed a representative of Fayette County in the Kentucky General Assembly. Clay's first <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> was the partisan gerrymander of Kentucky's Electoral College districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for Thomas Jefferson in the 1804 presidential election. Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and Clay unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from Frankfort to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed Felix Grundy, a populist firebrand who unsuccessfully sought to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. Clay defeated Grundy's former initiative, as well as Grundy's attempt to elect John Adair to the Senate. Clay instead backed the successful candidacy of Buckner Thruston, who also hailed from the Bluegrass Region. Clay also advocated for internal improvements, which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.|$|E

500|$|Although the European Parliament has {{legislative}} power that the Council and Commission do not possess, {{it does not}} formally possess <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative,</b> as most national parliaments of European Union member states do. The Parliament is the [...] "first institution" [...] of the EU (mentioned first in the treaties, having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except in a few areas where the special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Finally, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament elects the President of the Commission, and approves (or rejects) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.|$|E
500|$|The competences of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw {{were limited}} {{compared}} to its predecessor, the [...] Sejm of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Further, discussions were limited, as only the members of the five-person strong committees (one for treasury and one for each of the two laws), elected in secret ballot and tasked with the analysis of the proposed legislation, and members of the Council of State, had the right to speak. In practice, the members of the Sejm found a way to overcome this limitation, as after the day session would be officially closed, the deputies would remain in the parliament and start a new discussion.|$|E
