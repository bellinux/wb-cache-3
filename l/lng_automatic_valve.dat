40|$|Most furrow {{irrigation}} systems have low performance due to deep percolation at the upstream end and tailwater runoff at {{the downstream end}} of the field. To eliminate this problem improving {{furrow irrigation}} performance is necessary. Since the inflow discharge has high effect on infiltration along the furrow which consequently affects the application efficiency and water distribution uniformity, {{it would be important}} to apply different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes based on the field data such as field slope, soil texture and furrow length to save water. To produce different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes, an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> which was connected to a stepper motor was designed to change the inflow discharge with time according to the desired inflow hydrograph shape. The experimental field was located at Isfahan University of Technology. A constant head water delivery system to the furrows including the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> was installed in the experimental field and the tests were conducted for different inflow hydrograph shapes. The comparison of the measured furrow inflow discharges with the simulated furrow inflow discharges produced by the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> showed that the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> can produce different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes with high accuracy...|$|R

50|$|In two-pipe steam systems, {{there is}} a return path for the {{condensate}} and it may involve pumps as well as gravity-induced flow. The flow of steam to individual radiators can be modulated using manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Control valves {{can also}} work with {{hydraulic}} actuators ({{also known as}} hydraulic pilots). These types of valves are also known as <b>Automatic</b> Control <b>Valves.</b> The hydraulic actuators will respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open/close the <b>valve.</b> <b>Automatic</b> Control <b>Valves</b> do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close the valve.|$|R

50|$|Another {{factor is}} the {{decision}} to let the airship rise above the cloud layer, causing heating and then expansion of the hydrogen, which triggered <b>automatic</b> <b>valving</b> of the gas. Once the engines were restarted, the ship dived through the cloud into freezing air again and, either because the <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> were jammed open, or because the ship had already lost too much gas above the clouds, it could no longer stay aloft. Although Umberto Nobile {{was the victim of}} a smear campaign after the crash, one criticism of him, from the master airship pilot Hugo Eckener is perhaps justified â€” that Nobile should never have climbed above the cloud layer in the first place.|$|R

5000|$|Two main {{theories}} have been postulated {{as to how}} gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped bracing wire had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or <b>automatic</b> gas <b>valve</b> was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was nearly emptied when an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel. However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach {{there was no indication}} in instruments that a valve had stuck open.|$|R

2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible.
