25|$|<b>Lake</b> <b>fishing</b> for pike {{from the}} shore is {{especially}} effective during spring, when the big pike move into the shallows to spawn in weedy areas, and later many remain there to feed on other spawning coarse fish species to regain their condition after spawning. Smaller jack pike often remain in the shallows for their own protection, and for the small fish food available there. For the hot summer and during inactive phases, the larger female pike tend to retire to deeper water and/or places with better cover. This gives the boat angler good fishing {{during the summer and}} winter seasons. Trolling (towing a fairy or bait behind a moving boat) is a popular technique.|$|E

60|$|But I {{left the}} work of release to the mother bird, {{thinking}} she knew more about it. Next day I {{went back to the}} place, and, after much watching, saw two little loons stealing in and out among the bogs, exulting in their freedom, but silent as two shadows. The mother bird was off on the <b>lake,</b> <b>fishing</b> for their dinner.|$|E
6000|$|These {{earliest}} known men hunted {{the open}} steppes of Europe {{for a hundred}} centuries perhaps, and then slowly drifted and changed before a change of climate. Europe, century by century, was growing milder and damper. Reindeer receded northward and eastward, and bison and horse followed. The steppes gave way to forests, and red deer took the place of horse and bison. There is a {57} change {{in the character of}} the implements with this change in their application. River and <b>lake</b> <b>fishing</b> becomes of great importance to men, and fine implements of bone increased. [...] "The bone needles of this age," [...] says de Mortillet, [...] "are much superior to those of later, even historical times, down to the Renaissance. The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to those of this epoch." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{two days}} longer the party lingered {{by the side}} of the <b>lake</b> <b>fishing</b> and fowling, and then {{returned}} across the desert to the headquarters of Ameres. Two months were spent in examining canals and water courses, seeing that the dykes were strengthened where needed, and that the gates and channels were in good repair. Levels were taken for the construction of several fresh branches, which would considerably extend the margin of cultivation. The natives were called upon to furnish a supply of labor for their formation; but the quota was not furnished without considerable grumbling on the part of the Israelites, although Ameres announced that payment would be given them for their work. At last, having seen that everything was in train, Ameres left one of his subordinates to carry out the work, and then started with his son for Thebes.|$|E

6000|$|There are a {{good many}} trout in the lake, and people can hire the {{privilege}} of fishing for them; and I begged Jone {{to let me go}} out in a boat and fish. He was rather in favor of staying ashore and fishing in the little river, but I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go out and have some regular <b>lake</b> <b>fishing.</b> At last Jone agreed, provided I would not expect him {{to have anything to do}} with the fishing. [...] "Of course I don't expect anything like that," [...] said I; [...] "and it would be a good deal better for you to stay on shore. The landlord says a gilly will go along to row the boat and attend to the lines and rods and all that, and so there won't be any need for you at all, and you can stay on shore with your book, and watch if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dolph found, {{as he had}} suspected, {{that the}} shot from the glen, which had come so near giving him his quietus when on the precipice, was from the party before him. He had nearly crushed one of them by the {{fragment}} of rock which he had detached; and the jovial old hunter, in the broad hat and buck-tail, had fired {{at the place where}} he saw the bushes move, supposing it to be some wild animal. He laughed heartily at the blunder; it being what is considered an exceeding good joke among hunters; [...] "but faith, my lad," [...] said he, [...] "if I had but caught a glimpse of you to take sight at, you would have followed the rock. Antony Vander Heyden is seldom known to miss his aim." [...] These last words were at once a clue to Dolph's curiosity; and a few questions let him completely into the character of the man before him, and of his band of woodland rangers. The commander in the broad hat and hunting-frock, was no less a personage than the Heer Antony Vander Heyden, of Albany, of whom Dolph had many a time heard. He was, in fact, the hero of many a story; being a man of singular humours and whimsical habits, that were matters of wonder to his quiet Dutch neighbours. As {{he was a man of}} property, having had a father before him, from whom he inherited large tracts of wild land, and whole barrels full of wampum, he could indulge his humours without control. Instead of staying quietly at home, eating and drinking at regular meal times; amusing himself by smoking his pipe on the bench before the door, and then turning into a comfortable bed at night; he delighted in all kinds of rough, wild expeditions. He was never so happy as when on a hunting party in the wilderness, sleeping under trees or bark sheds, or cruising down the river, or on some woodland <b>lake,</b> <b>fishing</b> and hunting, and living the Lord knows how.|$|E
