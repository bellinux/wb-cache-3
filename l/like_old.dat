25|$|Indian languages, {{including}} Marathi, {{that belong}} to the Indo-Aryan language family are derived from early forms of Prakrut. Marathi {{is one of several}} languages that further descend from Mahārāshtrī Prakrut. Further change led to the Apabhraṃśa languages <b>like</b> <b>Old</b> Marathi, however this is challenged by Bloch (1970), who states that Apabhraṃśa was formed after Marathi had already separated from the Middle Indian dialect.|$|E
25|$|The rise of Chinese {{immigration}} turned Hong Kong {{into the}} main manhua-ready market, especially with {{the baby boom generation}} of children. The most influential manhua magazine for adults was the 1956 Cartoons World, which fueled the best-selling Uncle Choi. The availability of Japanese and Taiwanese comics challenged the local industry, selling at a pirated bargain price of 10 cents. Manhua <b>like</b> <b>Old</b> Master Q were needed to revitalize the local industry.|$|E

25|$|The Fourth Generation also {{returned}} to prominence. Given their label after {{the rise of}} the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. Wu Tianming, in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors {{under the auspices of the}} Xi'an Film Studio (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films <b>like</b> <b>Old</b> Well (1986) and The King of Masks (1996).|$|E
25|$|Defensive {{armament}} - armour – {{at first}} included the gambeson, then developed into the brigandine and scale armour, followed by hauberk, and then mail with some plate elements, such as breastplates and brassards, and finally panoply, {{which by the}} end of 16th century gained its perfect form, protecting the whole of a knight's body, and sometimes his horse. There were some differences between the rich knights of Małopolska, Wielkopolska or Śląsk and those of Mazowsze, who, because they faced enemies from the East, <b>like</b> <b>Old</b> Prussians, Lithuanians, and Tartars, partially adopted their fighting manners, and lighter armament as well. Even their horses were smaller and lighter.|$|E
25|$|Krysten Ritter {{stars as}} Jessica Jones, a former superhero who opens her own detective agency. Rachael Taylor, Eka Darville, and Carrie-Anne Moss also star, with Mike Colter, Wil Traval, Erin Moriarty, and David Tennant joining {{them for the}} first season, and Leah Gibson and J.R. Ramirez joining with the second season. A version of the series was {{originally}} developed by Rosenberg for ABC in 2010, but the network passed on it. By late 2013, Rosenberg was reworking the series for Netflix as A.K.A. Jessica Jones. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014. Jessica Jones is filmed in New York City, in areas that still look <b>like</b> <b>old</b> Hell's Kitchen.|$|E

25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is <b>like</b> <b>old</b> women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. Surveys from the 1930s show high poultry production, and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. Sheep production saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low sheep production, high cattle production, and very high poultry production. The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general apiculture. The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas <b>like</b> <b>Old</b> Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to animal production.|$|E
25|$|Joppa Road and {{its western}} complement, Old Court Road, {{have been a}} cross-county highway since the 17th century. This highway {{connected}} {{the western part of}} the county to its original county seat of Joppa, which was sited on the Gunpowder River near the modern community of Joppatowne. <b>Like</b> <b>Old</b> Court Road, Joppa Road was improved on its state and county segments in the mid-1920s to form a circumferential paved highway around Baltimore. The state-maintained segment of the highway between Towson and Perry Hall was designated Maryland Route 148. MD 148 was widened in the mid-1930s and again in the late 1930s and 1940s. The highway's role as the primary eastwest highway of Baltimore's northern suburbs was superseded by the construction of I-695 in the late 1950s and early 1960s. MD 148 was removed from the state highway system and all of Joppa Road became a county highway in the early 1960s.|$|E

500|$|Rise Against's musical style {{throughout}} the band's {{career has been}} described by most critics as melodic hardcore, punk rock, and hardcore punk.

500|$|Very little {{background}} music is {{heard in the}} film, a departure for Allen influenced by Ingmar Bergman. Diane Keaton performs twice in the jazz club: [...] "It Had to be You" [...] and [...] "Seems <b>Like</b> <b>Old</b> Times" [...] (the latter reprises in voiceover on the closing scene). The other exceptions include a boy's choir [...] "Christmas Medley" [...] played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside), Tommy Dorsey's performance of [...] "Sleepy Lagoon", and the anodyne cover of the Savoy Brown song [...] "A Hard Way to Go" [...] playing {{at a party in}} the mansion of Paul Simon's character.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, the United States' Library of Congress {{selected}} the film for preservation in its National Film Registry that includes [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" [...] films. The film is often mentioned among the greatest comedies of all time. The American Film Institute lists it 31st in American cinema history. In 2000, they named it second greatest romantic comedy in American cinema. Keaton's performance of [...] "Seems <b>Like</b> <b>Old</b> Times" [...] was ranked 90th {{on their list}} of greatest songs included in a film, and her line [...] "La-dee-da, la-dee-da." [...] was named the 55th greatest movie quote. The screenplay was named the sixth greatest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America, West while IGN named it the seventh greatest comedy film of all time. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted it the forty-second greatest comedy film of all time, and the seventh greatest romantic comedy film of all time. Several lists ranking Allen's best films have put Annie Hall among his greatest work.|$|E
