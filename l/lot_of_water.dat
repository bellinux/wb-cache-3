As it needs <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E
5|$|Achilles was {{refitting}} in May 1916 and did {{not participate}} in the Battle of Jutland although both of her surviving sisters did. Warrior was heavily damaged by German capital ships during the battle, losing 71 crewmen killed and 36 wounded. She took on a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and foundered the following morning after her crew was evacuated. The 2nd Cruiser Squadron was not engaged during the battle {{and did not}} fire a shot. Achilles was assigned blockade duties in the North Sea after the battle and sank the German raider Leopard in early 1917. Both of the surviving ships were briefly transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in late 1917 for convoy escort duties before returning home in early 1918. Achilles began a lengthy refit in February 1918 while Cochrane was based in Murmansk in mid-1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She became stranded in the Mersey on 14 November 1918 and broke in two. The wreck was broken up in place by June 1919. Achilles, the last surviving sister, became a training ship in late 1918 and was sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E

5|$|When sieved {{from the}} water, food is {{swallowed}} and travels through the esophagus where it enters a three-chambered-stomach. The first compartment {{is known as}} the fore-stomach; this is where food gets ground up into an acidic liquid, which is then squirted into the main stomach. Like in humans, the food is mixed with hydrochloric acid and protein-digesting enzymes. Then, the partly digested food is moved into the third stomach, where it meets fat-digesting enzymes, and is then mixed with an alkaline liquid to neutralize the acid from the fore-stomach to prevent damage to the intestinal tract. Their intestinal tract is highly adapted to absorb the most nutrients from food; the walls are folded and contain copious blood vessels, allowing for a greater surface area over which digested food and water can be absorbed. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food; however, the salt content of most of their prey (invertebrates) are similar to that of seawater, whereas the salt content of a whale's blood is considerably lower (three times lower) than that of seawater. The whale kidney is adapted to excreting excess salt; however, while producing urine more concentrated than seawater, it wastes a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which must be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Sevastopol {{joined the}} Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. She {{returned}} fire when the Bolsheviks began to bombard Kronstadt Island and was hit by three 12-inch shells that killed or wounded 102 sailors. After the rebellion was bloodily crushed, she was renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna after the Paris Commune on 31 March 1921. She was refitted several times before she was recommissioned on 17 September 1925. She was refitted again in 1928 at the Baltic Shipyard, in preparation for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet. Her forward funnel was raised and the upper part was angled aft {{in an attempt to}} keep the exhaust gases out of the control and gunnery spaces, while three 3-inch 'Lender' AA guns were added to the roofs of the fore and aft turrets. She received some additional rangefinders and she was given a false bow to improve her sea-keeping ability. She sailed for the Black Sea on 22 November 1929, in company of the cruiser Profintern, encountering a bad storm in the Bay of Biscay. The open-topped bow lacked enough drainage and tended to trap a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which badly damaged both the false bow and the supporting structure. Parizhskaya Kommuna was forced to put into Brest for repairs, which included the removal of the bulwark that retained so much water. Both ships arrived at Sevastopol on 18 January 1930 and Parizhskaya Kommuna became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal (Now known as Skaka) {{and the other}} was through Mesopotamia passing though Raqqa. Since the Muslim forces in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the {{conventional}} route to Syria via Daumat-ul-Jandal because it was a long and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also avoided the Mesopotamian route {{because of the presence of}} Roman garrisons in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. Engaging them at the time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria, was also ruled out since it would mean fighting on two fronts. Khalid selected a rather shorter route to Syria which unconventionally passed though the Syrian Desert. He marched his army though the desert, where traditions tells that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid is said to have solved the water shortage issue using a Bedouin method. Camels were made to drink water after intentionally denying them water for a lengthy time period, encouraging the camels to drink a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at one time. Camels have the ability to store water in their stomach which in turn could be obtained by slaughtering them when necessary. Muslim troops rode entirely on camels and this method became an effective one for the Muslim army.|$|E

25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42¬∞C to 43¬∞C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40¬∞C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog‚Äôs body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems.
