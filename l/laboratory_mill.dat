Milled rice from a <b>laboratory</b> <b>mill</b> and a commercial–scale mill was {{evaluated}} for head rice yield using a shaker {{table and a}} machine–vision system called the GrainCheck.

Percentage head rice was also measured by the FGIS for commercially milled samples to compare the shaker table and the GrainCheck with an official measurement. Head rice yield values were found significantly different between the two instruments for all of the laboratory–milled samples but the mean head rice yield variation was equivalent for both instruments. Commercially milled rice showed that the FGIS and GrainCheck percentage whole kernel measurements were equivalent while the shaker table average was seven percentage points less.

The matrix structure of IDF fraction was destroyed but FTIR structure had no major change after grinding.
