500|$|Bethesda Softworks has {{developed}} RPGs since 1994, in its The Elder Scrolls series. [...] (1996) is notable as a 3D first-person RPG with an expansive world. The series {{drew attention to}} sandbox gameplay, which gives the player wide choices of free-roaming activities unrelated to the game's main storyline. The Elder Scrolls series {{was seen as an}} alternative to the [...] "highly linear, story-based games" [...] that dominated the computer RPG genre at the time, and the series' freedom of play inspired comparisons to Grand Theft Auto III. According to Todd Howard, [...] "I think [...] one of those games that people can 'project' themselves on. It does so many things and allows [...] so many play styles that people can easily imagine what type of person they'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> game." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{insist that}} the show is still more about [...] "kids being kids" [...] and [...] "what it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> [...] in America", stating that the {{introduction}} of a more satirical element to the series {{was the result of the}} two adding more of a [...] "moral center" [...] to the show so that it would rely less on simply being crude and shocking in an attempt to maintain an audience. While profane, Parker notes that there is still an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the child characters, and Time described the boys as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence." [...] Usually, the boys and/or other characters ponder over what has transpired during an episode and convey the important lesson taken from it with a short monologue. During earlier seasons, this speech would commonly begin with a variation of the phrase [...] "You know, I've learned something today...".|$|E

He <b>is</b> too narcissistic <b>to</b> discredit women who <b>are</b> <b>in</b> love with him. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the core of events.

500|$|The book [...] {{includes}} {{an essay in}} which Johnson uses Cartman's actions and behavior as examples when discussing the logical problem of moral evil, and another essay by College of Staten Island professor Mark D. White cited the season two (1998) episode [...] "Chickenlover", in which Cartman is temporarily granted law enforcement powers, in its discussion regarding the command theory of law and what obligates a citizen to obey the law. Essays in the books , Blame Canada! South Park and Contemporary Culture, and Taking South Park Seriously have also analyzed Cartman's perspectives {{within the framework of}} popular philosophical, theological, political, and social concepts. Parker and Stone downplay the show's alignment with any particular political affiliation, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode. In response to the focus on elements of satire in South Park, Parker has said that the main goal of the show is to portray Cartman and his friends as [...] "kids just being kids" [...] as a means of accurately showcasing [...] "what it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> [...] in America".|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E

It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E

For a while, Casanova served as secretary and pamphleteer to Sebastian Foscarini, Venetian ambassador in Vienna. He also became acquainted with Lorenzo Da Ponte, Mozart's librettist, who noted about Casanova, [...] "This singular man never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the wrong." [...] Notes by Casanova indicate that he may have made suggestions to Da Ponte concerning the libretto for Mozart's Don Giovanni.|$|R

500|$|Wright scored his 27th {{goal of the}} season, away at Chelsea in {{the first}} week of April; it took him seven goals short of {{breaking}} Cliff Bastin's career record at Arsenal. A win against Leicester City was Arsenal's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club's chances of finishing second, which came with a spot in the Champions League. Wenger assessed that it was [...] "not impossible to win the title", adding [...] "but when you see Manchester United winning again, realistically you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> their position." [...] A last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored; with Hughes cramped, Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated. It was anticipated [...] "by the game's conventions", Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged, but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner. The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league: [...] "The best team [...] has won. But the race for second place is still open and for many weeks I have thought that was the best we could achieve." [...] A further draw against Coventry City, who were fighting to stay another season in the top-flight, moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United. They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third. Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997, which reignited their chances of finishing second. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County, who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground. In spite of winning by three goals to one, having played with ten men for the majority of the game, they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle.|$|E

2500|$|Claude Lanzmann, {{director}} of the documentary Shoah, gave the film high praise, stating that [...] "it's a very new film, very original, very unusual. It's a film that gives {{a very real sense}} of what it was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the Sonderkommando. It's not at all melodramatic. It's done with a very great modesty". Philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman also praised the film, and he wrote a 25-page open letter to Nemes, which opened with [...] "Your film, ‘Son of Saul,' is a monster.

Browne typically was the front rider <b>in</b> tandem races, <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> control. He <b>was</b> regarded <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners.

[...] Aside from its vast network of sympathetic allies and wandering Culture citizens one {{of the primary}} ways that the Culture keeps track of important events is by the use of practically invisible nanobots capable of recording and transmitting their observations. This technique is described as being especially useful to track potentially dangerous people (such as ex-Special Circumstance agents). Via such nanotechnology, it is potentially possible for the Culture (or similarly advanced societies) to see everything happening on a given planet, orbital or any other habitat. The usage of such devices is limited by various treaties and agreements among the Involved.|$|R
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the band's sixth album went well. The band {{were for the}} most part free of drugs, and their lineup had finally stabilised.

Many of the songs they wrote had overtly political lyrics, Gillespie said the band wished to convey [...] "What it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Britain in this day and age." [...] The album featured multiple guest appearances, including the Chemical Brothers, New Order's Bernard Sumner, and former My Bloody Valentine guitarist Kevin Shields, who had become a semi-permanent member.|$|E

When she first read for the part Holland and Smith felt that [...] "she overacted terribly", but on the second reading she [...] "brought the performance down considerably".

2500|$|Though Stone {{has criticized}} Bush for his administration's 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, the director {{said that he}} was not looking to make an [...] "anti-Bush polemic." [...] Stone compared his goal of the film to that of The Queen, wanting to trace [...] "seminal events in Bush's life." [...] According to the director, [...] "It's a behind-the-scenes approach, similar to Nixon, to give a sense of what it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> his skin. But if Nixon was a symphony, this is more like a chamber piece, and not as dark in tone."

2500|$|Clements and Musker {{had agreed}} from {{very early on}} that the style they were aiming for was {{primarily}} that of Lady and the Tramp (1955), a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents [...] "the pinnacle of Disney's style". [...] "After that, everything started becoming more stylized, like Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians– which are fantastic films as well, but there's a particular style (to 'Lady and the Tramp') that's so classically Disney." [...] Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed {{the style of the}} New Orleans scenes, while Disney's Bambi (1942) served as the template for the bayou scenes. Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds, as according to art director Ian Gooding [...] "Bambi painted what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the forest instead of the forest" [...] so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans.|$|E

He drew inspiration from Buffy the Vampire Slayer noting that [...] "the best metaphors in Buffy came down to, [...] "What's it <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> high school, as a kid?" [...] He felt the fourth series of Torchwood to be [...] "about us and our decisions and our lives, and how we live {{with each other and}} how we die with each other."
