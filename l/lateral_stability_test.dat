Twelve male students {{participated in the study}} (mean ± s: age 12. 7 ± 0. 4 years, mass 40. 7 ± 0; 5. 9 kg, height 1. 50 ± 0. 04 m). Cloth sport shoes, running shoes, basketball shoes, cross-training shoes, and barefoot conditions were investigated in random sequence. Human pendulum and cutting movement tests were used to assess cushioning performance and lateral stability, respectively. For cushioning, the running shoes (2. 06 body weight, BW) performed the best, while the cross-training shoes (2. 30 BW) and the basketball shoes (2. 37 BW) both performed better than the cloth sport shoes (2. 55 BW) and going barefoot (2. 63 BW). For the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> <b>test,</b> range of inversion-eversion was found to be from 3. 6 to 4. 9 °, which was far less than that for adult participants (40 ms) and was unlikely to evoke intrinsic stability failure. In conclusion, the cloth sport shoe showed inferior cushioning capability but the same lateral stability as the other sports shoes for children...|$|E

50|$|The Cierva C.1 was an {{experimental}} autogyro built by Juan de la Cierva in Spain in 1920, {{the forerunner of}} his successful series of autogyros. The C.1 was created by taking the fuselage from a Deperdussin fixed-wing aircraft and mounting two rotors shaft above it. This shaft carried two coaxial contra-rotating rotors, and atop it a fin for increased <b>lateral</b> <b>stability.</b> When <b>tested,</b> the C.1 refused to take off, which Cierva attributed to interference between {{the two sets of}} rotors leading to each set autorotating at a different speed. He considered the possibility of mechanically linking the rotors, but dismissed the idea on the grounds of weight and complexity, and his subsequent efforts would all feature single main rotors. Despite its failure to fly, the C.1 demonstrated the principle of autorotation in a full-sized aircraft for the first time, as it was taxied around the ground.|$|R

By late October, the research program was {{expanded to include}} <b>lateral</b> and directional <b>stability</b> <b>tests.</b> In these tests, the X-3 was abruptly rolled at transonic and supersonic speeds, with the rudder kept centered. Despite its shortcomings, the X-3 was ideal for these tests. The mass of its engines, fuel and structure was concentrated in its long, narrow fuselage, while its wings were short and stubby. As a result, the X-3 was [...] "loaded" [...] along its fuselage, rather than its wings. This {{was typical of the}} fighter aircraft then in development or testing.|$|R
30|$|For small-scaled I-beams, the {{critical}} loads {{obtained from the}} proposed experimental method were in good agreement with those calculated using the analytical equations. The strains in {{the top and bottom}} flanges, which were under compression and tension, respectively, were induced by the in-plane flexure. On the other hand, the compressive strains in the convex side of the beam decreased due to the out-of-plane flexure. Therefore, the neutral axis in the concave side moves from the centroid of the cross-section up to the top flange. The proposed experimental method, validated in the linear and elastic range of material, could be further applied to the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> of flexural members accounting for various parameters, such as material nonlinearity, shapes and sizes of geometry, and boundary conditions.|$|R
30|$|Tests of the <b>lateral</b> and {{torsional}} <b>stability</b> {{are quite}} {{sensitive to the}} experimental conditions, such as support condition, loading system, and material nonlinearity. Moreover, the lateral and torsional buckling test using a full-size beam requires considerable {{time and effort to}} control all these conditions. Even with careful consideration of these factors, unexpected errors, such as a deviation from the designed support, loading, and material conditions, could completely change the experimental results. Therefore, the appropriate loading, support, and material conditions in a full-size test are extremely difficult to achieve. Therefore, this study presented a small-scale experimental method that can control and maintain the loading and support conditions in the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> of beams. The support system was developed to satisfy both the in-plane and out-of-plane restraints and movement conditions. The loading system was designed to retain its initial vertical direction throughout the course of loading and allow the lateral and torsional movement of the specimen at the application point of the load. The experimental method was applied successively to the lateral and torsional buckling of small-scaled I-shaped beams. The proposed experimental methods, which effectively accommodate the changes in the geometry and length of the beam, could contribute to further experimental studies regarding the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> of flexural members.|$|R

40|$|The optimum {{configuration}} parameters of tractor–trailer combinations for <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> performance are proposed {{by adjusting the}} length of dolly and the second trailer’s center of gravity. A linear yaw plane model of vehicle combinations is adopted for dynamic analysis, and the model is calibrated by TruckSim. According to the yaw rate rearward amplification ratio of lateral response index, and combining the simulation results of MATLAB/Simulink, dolly and the second trailer are the dominate factors for <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of vehicle combinations. Simulation {{results show that the}} distance between articulation joints of dolly is 1. 6 [*]m; simultaneously, the rate of distance between front hitch and center of gravity of the second trailer to its front and rear wheelbase is 0. 41 and may gain the best lateral performance.

Since the {{handling}} behaviour of car-trailer combination {{is more complex}} and less predictable than that of non-articulated vehicles, the drivers may lose control of the vehicle in some hasty steering maneuvers. The kinematics of car-trailer combination has been analyzed with a 3 DOF model. A modified Vehicle Dynamics Control system was designed to improve the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of the trailer. The dynamics simulation for <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of car-trailer combination has been performed on the multi-body model.

30|$|Therefore, {{this study}} {{presented}} a small-scale experimental method {{to implement the}} support and loading conditions and minimize the experimental errors when assessing the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> of a beam. An experimental frame was provided to install a specimen and satisfy the loading and support conditions. The frame was also designed to adapt {{the changes in the}} loading and support conditions, as well as the size and length of the beam. A loading transfer system was then provided to retain the initially vertical orientation of the load to a beam undergoing the coupled deformation and rotation. The support condition was also designed to satisfy the in-plane and out-of-plane restraint and movement conditions. Finally, the instrumentation was carried out to measure the variations in the deformation and angle and longitudinal strain in the beam. The lateral and vertical deformations and a rotational angle of the beam were determined from the coupled transformations using the measurement method, which was proposed initially by Zhao et al. (1994, 1995) and later modified by Stoddard (1997), and applied successively by Kalkan (2009) and Hurff (2010). In the present study, the measurement method was expanded to allow easier and more useful instrumentation and data processing. As a result, the proposed experimental and measurement methods using a small-scale model can be applied easily and effectively for the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> of flexural members to evaluate the critical load and the influencing factors, such as geometric, support, and loading conditions, in the field of engineering.|$|R

50|$|In {{aircraft}} design, Dutch roll {{results from}} relatively weaker positive directional stability {{as opposed to}} positive <b>lateral</b> <b>stability.</b> When an aircraft rolls around the longitudinal axis, a sideslip is introduced into the relative wind {{in the direction of}} the rolling motion. Strong <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> begins to restore the aircraft to level flight. At the same time, somewhat weaker directional stability attempts to correct the sideslip by aligning the aircraft with the perceived relative wind. Since directional stability is weaker than <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> for the particular aircraft, the restoring yaw motion lags significantly behind the restoring roll motion. The aircraft passes through level flight as the yawing motion is continuing {{in the direction of the}} original roll. At that point, the sideslip is introduced in the opposite direction and the process is reversed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With a {{classical}} 4 {{degrees of freedom}} linear dynamic model of vehicle-trailer system in the yaw plane, preliminary study on <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> is carried out by means of analyzing system’s damping ratio. The results show that structural parameters have important influence on <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of vehicle-trailer system. Based on that study, a concept of critical velocity with zero damping ratio as an index is present. With the help of MSC. ADAMS, a multi-body dynamic model of a real vehicle-trailer system is built subsequently and the dynamic responses of vehicle-trailer system running on flat road and rough road is simulated respectively. The simulation {{results indicated that the}} characteristics of <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of both of the linear dynamic model and the multi-body dynamic model running on flat road are similar. The critical velocity of multi-body dynamic model running on rough road decreases due to the disturbance from road.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of an automatically controlled glide bomb led also to the attempt of clarifying {{the influence of a}} phugoid oscillation or of any general longitudinal oscillation on the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of a glide bomb. Under the assumption that its period of oscillation considerably exceeds the rolling and yawing oscillation and that c(sub a) is, at least in sections, practically constant, the result of this test is quite simple. It becomes clear that the influence of the phugoid oscillation may be replaced by suitable variation of the rolling-yawing moment on a rectilinear flight path instead of the phugoid oscillation. If the flying weight of the glide bomb of unchanged dimensions is increased, an increase of the flight velocity will be more favorable than an increase of the lift coefficient.
