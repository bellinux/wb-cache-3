5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the lighthouse in 1863-64 by engineer Henry Norris, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, as well as a new lens. The improvements included a red arc of <b>light</b> <b>over</b> the hazardous Pearl Rock region. An additional upgrade was made in 1875 when the lamp was switched out for a four-wick mineral oil burner.|$|E
5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof <b>light</b> <b>over</b> the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Beonna's coins {{are known}} from two {{separate}} hoards, {{as well as}} from a number of individual finds. Until 1968, only five of his coins were known. Several more coins came to <b>light</b> <b>over</b> the next decade, before a hoard of sceattas and other coins were discovered in 1980 at Middle Harling, north-east of Thetford and close to the border between the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. In all, fifty-eight coins have been excavated from Middle Harling, fourteen were found at Burrow Hill (Suffolk) and thirty-five from other places in East Anglia and elsewhere. Over a hundred 'Beonnas' are now known: most of them have been acquired by the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to <b>light</b> <b>over</b> the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E
25|$|Diwali {{is celebrated}} by Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs and Newar Buddhists to mark {{different}} historical events and stories, {{but they all}} symbolise the victory of <b>light</b> <b>over</b> darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, hope over despair.|$|E

25|$|In a fully digital planetarium, {{the dome}} image is {{generated}} by a computer and then projected onto the dome {{using a variety of}} technologies including cathode ray tube, LCD, DLP or laser projectors. Sometimes a single projector mounted near the centre of the dome is employed with a fisheye lens to spread the <b>light</b> <b>over</b> the whole dome surface, while in other configurations several projectors around the horizon of the dome are arranged to blend together seamlessly.|$|E
25|$|OCT {{is based}} on low-coherence interferometry. In {{conventional}} interferometry with long coherence length (i.e., laser interferometry), interference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing {{to the use of}} broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit <b>light</b> <b>over</b> a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (femtosecond lasers). White light {{is an example of a}} broadband source with lower power.|$|E

25|$|The fast lines {{north of}} Harrow and all lines north of Rickmansworth are signalled with LUL signalling, but using four-aspect Network Rail signal heads. The upper two lights are a two-aspect stop signal {{displaying}} either a green or red aspect, the lower two lights a repeater signal {{for the next}} stop signal ahead showing a green or yellow aspect, or no aspect when the stop signal shows a red aspect. Thus they are effectively four-light three-aspect signals with green/red/green/yellow lights from the top, danger being a single red light, caution the top green <b>light</b> <b>over</b> a yellow light, and clear two green lights.|$|E
25|$|The mythical {{stories told}} for Diwali vary {{regionally}} {{and within the}} traditions of Hinduism. Yet, they all point to joy and the celebration of Diwali with lights to be {{a reminder of the}} importance of knowledge, self inquiry, self-improvement, knowing and seeking the good and the right path. It is a metaphor for resisting evil, for dispelling darkness and for compassion to others. Diwali is the celebration of this inner <b>light</b> <b>over</b> spiritual darkness, of knowledge over ignorance and right over wrong. It is a festive restatement of the Hindu belief that the good ultimately triumphs over evil.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{sunlight}} in ozone depletion {{is the reason}} why the Antarctic ozone depletion is greatest during spring. During winter, even though PSCs are at their most abundant, there is no <b>light</b> <b>over</b> the pole to drive chemical reactions. During the spring, however, the sun comes out, providing energy to drive photochemical reactions and melt the polar stratospheric clouds, releasing considerable ClO, which drives the hole mechanism. Further warming temperatures near the end of spring break up the vortex around mid-December. As warm, ozone and -rich air flows in from lower latitudes, the PSCs are destroyed, the enhanced ozone depletion process shuts down, and the ozone hole closes.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, The Crucifucks {{reformed}} {{and did a}} brief national tour, {{including a}} performance at Alternative Tentacles' 20th Anniversary Party. They also released their first CD in nearly a decade, called L.D. Eye with its anti-war chiller <b>Lights</b> <b>Over</b> Baghdad.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{photoreceptor}} cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. Rod cells are sensitive to the intensity of <b>light</b> <b>over</b> a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. Rod cells are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, Deepavali {{is celebrated}} {{publicly}} among {{many of the}} South Asian diaspora cultural groups. A large group that celebrates Diwali in New Zealand {{are members of the}} Indo-Fijian communities who have migrated and settled there. There are main public festivals in Auckland and Wellington, with other events around the country becoming more popular and visible. An official reception has been held at the New Zealand Parliament since 2003. Diwali is celebrated by Hindus. The festival signifies the triumph of <b>light</b> <b>over</b> darkness, justice over injustice, good over evil and intelligence over ignorance. Lakshmi Mata is worshiped. Lakshmi Mata is the goddess of light, wealth and beauty. Special Divali foods are barfi and Prasad.|$|E
25|$|La Comédie de la Mort, {{published}} in 1838, {{is a period}} piece much like Albertus. In this work, Gautier focuses {{on the theme of}} death, which for Gautier is a terrifying, stifling and irreversible finality. Unlike many Romantics before him, Gautier's vision of death is solemn and portentous, proclaiming death as the definitive escape from life's torture. During the time he wrote the work, Gautier was frequenting many cemeteries, which were then expanding rapidly to accommodate the many deaths from epidemics that swept the country. Gautier translates death into a curiously heady, voluptuous, almost exhilarating experience which diverts him momentarily from the gruesome reality and conveys his urgent plea for <b>light</b> <b>over</b> darkness, life over death. Several of these poems have been set as melodies by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Fauré, and Duparc.|$|E
