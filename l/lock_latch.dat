60|$|Joliffe was {{no sooner}} gone, than, before {{a single word}} was spoken between Albert Lee and his page, the former hastened to the door, {{examined}} <b>lock,</b> <b>latch,</b> and bolt, and made them fast, with the most scrupulous attention. He superadded to these precautions that of a long screw-bolt, which he brought out of his pocket, and which he screwed on to the staple {{in such a manner}} as to render it impossible to withdraw it, or open the door, unless by breaking it down. The page held a light to him during the operation, which his master went through with much exactness and dexterity. But when Albert arose from his knee, on which he had rested during the accomplishment of this task, the manner of the companions was on the sudden entirely changed towards each other. The honourable Master Kerneguy, from a cubbish lout of a raw Scotsman, seemed to have acquired at once all the grace and ease of motion and manner, which could be given by an acquaintance of the earliest and most familiar kind with the best company of the time.|$|E
5000|$|The NULMW {{participated in}} the Joint Industry Council for the <b>Lock,</b> <b>Latch</b> and Key Industry, and grew significantly; {{although}} never a large union, it had 7,000 members by 1984.|$|E
50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1889 in Willenhall as the National Amalgamated <b>Lock,</b> <b>Latch</b> and Key Smiths' Trade Society, soon {{renaming}} itself as the National Amalgamated Lock Maker and Metal Workers' Trade Society to better reflect its membership, which peaked at 2,000 in 1900, falling back to only 180 ten years later.|$|E

50|$|The M79 {{is easy to}} operate. To load, the {{grenadier}} {{pushes the}} barrel <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> on the receiver group to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened. A round then may be loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the barrel <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.|$|R
5000|$|DetachmentThe user {{presses the}} unlock {{button on the}} flash body, which, {{by means of a}} lever or a wedge {{mechanism}} disengages the <b>locking</b> <b>latch,</b> enabling the user to slide off the flash from the camera body.|$|R
40|$|Spherical latch {{elements}} distribute load over broad area. Concave and convex latching surfaces {{couple with}} one another to secure payload. Motor-drive pin <b>locks</b> <b>latch</b> in place; for active latch, second motor turns connecting plate attached to concave latch element. Spherical shape of latching elements distributes cargo weight over broad surface so no "hotspots" when cargo secured...|$|R
50|$|In these {{applications}} a latching {{continuity tester}} is used. A more complex device, it detects intermittent opens and shorts {{as well as}} steady-state conditions. These devices contain a fast acting electronic switch (generally a Schmitt trigger) forming a gated astable oscillator which detects and <b>locks</b> (<b>latches)</b> the indicator on an intermittent condition {{with a duration of}} less than a millisecond.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common type of single-shot action, usually found in shotguns, small pistols, and black-powder [...] "elephant" [...] guns, a break action connects the barrel {{assembly}} to the breechblock with a hinge. When a <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> is released, the barrel assembly pivots away from the receiver, opening the breech and, at least on better firearms, partially extracting the spent cartridge.|$|R

50|$|In purely {{mechanical}} plants, {{the levers}} operate the field devices, such as signals, directly via a mechanical rodding or wire connection. The levers are about shoulder height since they must supply a mechanical {{advantage for the}} operator. Cross locking of levers was effected such that the extra leverage could not defeat the <b>locking</b> (preliminary <b>latch</b> <b>lock).</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system, {{useful for the}} transverse connection of strut elements to a common node, comprises a node joint half with a semicircular tongue and groove, and a strut joint half with a semicircular tongue and groove. The two joint halves are engaged transversely and the connection is made secure by the inherent physical property characteristics of <b>locking</b> <b>latches</b> and/or by a spring-actioned shaft. A quick release mechanism provides rapid disengagement of the joint halves...|$|R
5000|$|The Uberti version, {{imported}} by Navy Arms and Cimarron Firearms, has {{external dimensions}} generally {{similar to the}} original 2nd Model Schofield, but the barrel and topstrap are considerably thicker, for additional strength. These replica Model 3 revolvers have lengthened cylinders to accommodate [...]45 Colt and [...]44-40 cartridges. Although there were some problems with the <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> angles in early versions, these were generally corrected or the revolvers were replaced. European reproduction Model 3 revolvers have changes made to their lockwork to meet import regulations. A Uberti produced reproduction was also marketed as the Beretta Laramie.|$|R
50|$|The HW 35 has a <b>locking</b> breech <b>latch</b> {{to ensure}} barrel {{alignment}} after cocking. The lock {{extends from the}} left side of the breech block where the shooters thumb slides it forward during cocking.|$|R
50|$|XKB {{allows a}} {{modifier}} to be <b>locked</b> or <b>latched,</b> other than being in its regular state. Normally, a modifier is active exactly {{when it is}} pressed, like the Shift. However, a modifier may also be locked, like the Caps Lock modifier. When a modifier is locked, it remains active until it is explicitly deactivated. An intermediate condition between regular and <b>locked</b> is the <b>latched</b> state: When a modifier is latched, it remains active, but only until the next non-modifier key is pressed.|$|R
50|$|Pedalboards {{often have}} a cover which protects the effects pedals during transportation. There are many {{varieties}} of pedalboard cases, including homemade DIY pedalboard cases, store-bought pedalboard cases, and, for professional musicians, custom-made pedalboard cases. Hard shell pedalboard-cases have foam padding, reinforced corners, and <b>locking</b> <b>latches</b> which protect the pedals during transport; during onstage performance, with the lid removed, {{the bottom of the}} case is a pedalboard. Most pedalboards have a flat surface where pedals and their power supplies are attached using Velcro or other techniques, and they {{often have a}} removable lid or padding to protect the pedals when they are not being used. Some pedalboards have handles or wheels to facilitate transportation.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} {{modeled after the}} XLR {{connector}} with a circular hard metal shell and a <b>locking</b> <b>latch.</b> The cable plug is always male and is designed to fit over a standard 8P8C modular connector. There are two cable connector versions: one for use during manufacturing of cables, and one that goes over an 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connector on existing cable. The chassis connector is always female and has the standard form factor of an XLR panel connector. The chassis connector allows for use with both an EtherCON connector and a standard 8P8C plug. The chassis connectors are rated for either Cat 5e or Cat 6 compatibility. The cable connector can go over either a Cat 5e or Cat 6 cable.|$|R
50|$|Household {{hardware}} (or simply, hardware) is {{equipment that}} can be touched or held by hand such as nuts, screws, washers, keys, <b>locks,</b> hinges, <b>latches,</b> handles, wire, chains, belts, plumbing supplies, electrical supplies, tools, utensils, cutlery and machine parts. Household hardware is typically sold in hardware stores.|$|R
50|$|After the {{rotation}} is complete, a retractor pushes the protruding bars back into place.

50|$|An {{electric}} {{strike is}} an access control device used for doors. It replaces the fixed strike faceplate often {{used with a}} latchbar (also known as a keeper). Like a fixed strike, it normally presents a ramped surface to the <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> allowing the door to close and latch just like a fixed strike would. However, an electric strike's ramped surface can, upon command, pivot {{out of the way}} when the lock on the door is in the locked position and the door is opened, allowing a user to open the door without operating the mechanical lock or using a mechanical key. After the door is opened past the keeper, the keeper returns to its standard position and re-locks when power is removed or applied, depending upon the strike's configuration.|$|R

40|$|Designing {{scalable}} {{transaction processing}} systems on modern multicore hardware {{has been a}} challenge for almost a decade. The typical characteristics of transaction processing workloads {{lead to a high}} degree of unbounded communication on multicores for conventional system designs. In this tutorial, we initially present a systematic way of eliminating scalability bottlenecks of a transaction processing system, which is based on minimizing the unbounded communication. Then, we show several techniques that apply the presented methodology to minimize logging, <b>locking,</b> <b>latching</b> etc. related bottlenecks of transaction processing systems. In parallel, we demonstrate the internals of the Shore-MT storage manager and how they have evolved over the years in terms of scalability on multicore hardware through such techniques. We also teach how to use Shore-MT with the various design options it offers through its application layer Shore-Kits and Metadata Frontend. 1...|$|R
50|$|The most sturdy {{suitcases}} {{are generally}} constructed from polymers such as nylon {{and have a}} covering that resists gouging and liquid from entering into the interior. The seams can be glued together or stitched with strong nylon thread. Generally the stitched-together suitcases hold up over time {{as compared to the}} glued construction and have a <b>lock</b> or <b>latch.</b>|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{database}} {{systems are}} driven by the assumption that disk I/O is the primary bottleneck, overshadowing all other costs. However, future database systems will be dominated by many-core processors, large main memory, and low-latency semiconductor mass storage. In the increasingly common case that the working data set fits in memory or low-latency storage, new bottlenecks emerge: <b>locking,</b> <b>latching,</b> logging, and critical sections in the buffer manager. Prior work has addressed two of these ‚Äì latching and logging. This paper addresses locking and proposes new mechanisms optimized for modern hardware. We devised new algorithms and methods to improve all components of database locking, including key range locking, intent locks, detection and recovery from deadlocks, and early lock release. Most of the techniques are easily applicable to other database systems. Experiments with Shore-MT, the transaction processing engine we used as the implementation basis, show throughput improvement by factors of 5 to 50. 1...|$|R

50|$|Coiled pins {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and <b>locks,</b> and <b>latches</b> as hinge pins. They {{are also used}} as pivots and axles, for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together‚Äîsuch as a gear and shaft‚Äîand even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use coiled pins in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{demonstrate}} nonstructural hazard mitigation to the industrial community surrounding San Jose State University. A Materials Processing Laboratory which has {{a wide variety of}} experimental equipment was retrofitted in three phases. In Phase I the doors of all wall mounted cabinets were retrofitted with positive <b>lock</b> <b>latches.</b> Lighter equipment and computers placed on laboratory benches were restrained during Phase II. Equipment with low aspect ratios were placed on friction pads, whereas equipment with high aspect ratios were restrained to the countertop or the splash guard with adhesive joints. In Phase III the heavier floor mounted equipment had custom brackets fabricated from Grade A 36 steel flat bars and were anchored to the concrete slab floor with threaded rod anchors installed with a two-part adhesive. Replacement cost of equipment was compared to the mitigation cost. Future work on calculating benefit cost ratios (BCR) is planned. Tours will be provided for engineering students and industry personnel to demonstrate the various approaches to nonstructural hazard mitigation and its benefits...|$|R
50|$|As with <b>locks</b> and <b>latches,</b> key charms also {{evolved from}} {{functional}} key holders into largely symbolic objects that became exquisitely decorated personal accessories. They were passed from mothers to daughters as tokens {{of the responsibility}} women bear for ensuring the good management of household affairs. It was customary for families to celebrate special occasions by adorning their walls with the auspicious animal motifs that often were incorporated into the design of key charms.|$|R

50|$|By making stored {{procedures}} {{the unit}} of transaction and executing them at the partition containing the necessary data, {{it is possible to}} eliminate round trip messaging between SQL statements. Stored procedures are executed serially and to completion in a single thread without any <b>locking</b> or <b>latching,</b> similar to the LMAX architecture. Because data is in memory and local to the partition, a stored procedure can execute in microseconds. VoltDB's stored procedure initiation scheme allows all nodes to initiate stored procedures while ensuring that there is a single serializable global order.|$|R
40|$|Main Memory Database Systems (MMDBs) {{have been}} studied since the 80 s [3, 4], when memory was quite costly ($ 1500 per MByte in 1984). We can now buy memory for about $ 10 per GByte. An {{advantage}} of MMDBs is that serial execution of a non-distributed transaction on a uniprocessor {{from start to finish}} saves the work of disk I/O, <b>locking,</b> <b>latching</b> and deadlock handling [7]. The 2013 Bulletin on Data Engineering [11] had eight articles on recent MMDBs and only three mentioned distributed transactions. Implementing fast, serializable, distributed transactions on an MMDB is difficult, since communication delays typically leave some CPUs idle and reduce total throughput. We began a project in Fall 2011 to improve distributed transactional performance of the open-source MMDB VoltDB system [14], which was based on an earlier academic prototype MMDB H-Store [1]. We developed a low-overhead concurrency method that executes consecutive Prepares with delayed Commits on each node (CPU) and takes Write locks but not Read locks to detect conflicts. We developed an Ordered Escrow Method, a variant of Escrow [14] to greatly speed up transactions with incremental updates. We named our VoltDB modification CVoltDB (C for Concurrency) and proved it supports replica consistency and serializability. Full TPC-B and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate greatly improved performance due to new features in CVoltDB...|$|R
