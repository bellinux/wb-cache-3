The aim is to record as many notes as possible in order to know details about its spread, like from where and to where they travel in general, follow it up, <b>like</b> <b>where</b> a ticket has been seen in particular, and generate statistics and rankings, for example, in which countries there are more tickets.

25|$|The first {{matters to}} {{establish}} were the design principles and layout. Since {{this was to}} be the first non-denominational chapel for a European garden cemetery, there were no existing guidelines. What should it look <b>like?</b> <b>Where</b> would it be most appropriately located within the park? How should it be aligned in the landscape? And which direction should it face? William Hosking, in discussion with George Collison II developed a plan to site the novel chapel {{at the very heart of}} Abney Park foregoing any positioning close to the main entrance. The aim was that, once the pine trees that were planted along the Chapel Ride matured, the chapel would gradually be revealed through a sylvan landscape approach drive. The sinuously designed Chapel Ride was therefore lined with Bhutan Pine trees on its south side, contributing an attractive odoriferous all-year effect. Not only could nature be appreciated, but the main entrance (with its Egyptian revival building style) would not be eclipsed.|$|E

The main point of the law was to not only set down regulations {{on how to make}} the Chinese flag, what it looks <b>like,</b> <b>where</b> it can be flown and how it can be flown. The law also stresses that the national flag is [...] "the symbol and hallmark of the People's Republic of China" [...] and that everyone [...] "shall respect and care for the National Flag." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Milo J. Thatch was originally {{supposed to be}} a descendant of Edward Teach, otherwise known as Blackbeard the pirate. The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration. The {{character of}} Molière was originally intended to be [...] "professorial" [...] but Chris Ure, a story artist, changed the concept to that of a [...] "horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs", said Wise. Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals, as solely action scenes would have to carry the film. Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on-screen character development: [...] "We had more screen time available to do a scene <b>like</b> <b>where</b> Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another's histories. An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed. That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Increased {{mobility}} of birdwatchers ensured that books <b>like</b> <b>Where</b> to Watch Birds by John Gooders became best-sellers. By the 1960s air-travel became feasible and long distance holiday destinations opened {{up with the}} result that by 1965, Britain's first birding tour company, Ornitholidays was started by Lawrence Holloway. Travelling far away also led to problems in name usage, British birds like [...] "wheatear", [...] "heron" [...] and [...] "swallow" [...] needed adjectives to differentiate them in places where there were several related species. The falling cost of air-travel made flying to remote birding destinations a possibility for {{a large number of people}} towards the 1980s. The need for global guides to birds became more relevant and one of the biggest projects that began was the Handbook of the Birds of the World which started in the 1990s with Josep del Hoyo a country doctor in Catalonia, Jordi Sargatal and ornithologist Andy Elliott.|$|E

Cycle tracks in Copenhagen are separated from car lanes by a [...] high stone curb and the sidewalk by another [...] curb. They are by and large of a uniform design, in order to give cyclists a good idea of what any particular route will look <b>like.</b> <b>Where</b> roadside parking is available cycle tracks run {{on the inside of the}} row of parked cars, between parking and the sidewalk, essentially using parked cars as a separation barrier between bicycles and vehicle traffic. As most cars are single occupancy, this also aids to prevent dooring accidents, as the driver exits the car on the opposite side of the cycle track.|$|E
