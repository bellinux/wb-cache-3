5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the variety of}} species and habitats. The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids {{can be seen on}} the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, gray wolves were {{widespread}} {{in many parts}} of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> persecution by farmers. The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 19th century, with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern Asir, northern rocky areas bordering Jordan, or areas surrounding Riyadh.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University hosts notable {{speakers}} each year, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the success}} of the Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications. These are frequently important heads of state who visit Georgetown while in the capital, as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. Many prominent alumni are known to frequent the main campus. The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as Nostra aetate, Pacem in terris, and the Building Bridges Seminar.|$|E
50|$|The World Community Grid <b>largely</b> began <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the success}} of this project.|$|R
30|$|The {{discrepancies}} in ventilatory settings may be <b>largely</b> underestimated <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a frequent lack of monitoring [2].|$|R
25|$|Tactics {{were not}} very {{different}} from the past, but their effectiveness was <b>largely</b> improved <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the professional training of the soldiers.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. <b>Largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited {{became part of the}} Cat Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the diversity of}} species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of {{the area around the}} lake also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 17th century in England, average life {{expectancy}} was only about 35 years, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> two-thirds <b>of</b> all children died {{before the age of}} four. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.|$|R
25|$|The Notitia {{depicts the}} Roman army {{at the end}} of the AD 4th century. Therefore, its {{development}} from the structure of the Principate is <b>largely</b> conjectural <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the lack of other evidence.|$|R
50|$|Ammonium sulfate {{has been}} used as a wood preservative, but due to its {{hygroscopic}} nature, this use has been <b>largely</b> discontinued <b>because</b> <b>of</b> associated problems with metal fastener corrosion, dimensional instability, and finish failures.|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an {{adaptation}} of the novel by the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to Hokkaido, but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today {{to be one of}} the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.|$|E
5|$|The group {{retains a}} high profile <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their {{outrageous}} costumes, {{but also because of}} their frequent work for charitable organizations. The Hogettes have appeared in a national advertising campaign for VISA, and they provide support for many charities, including Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and March of Dimes. They have raised over US$100 million for these and other charitable causes. Despite their philanthropic work, the Hogettes are disliked by some and have even been attacked by fans of opposing teams.|$|E
50|$|Donohue {{syndrome}} {{was first}} identified in 1948 by Canadian pathologist William L. Donohue (1906-1985). The name leprechaunism has been <b>largely</b> abandoned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the perception of}} the name by some parents of patients as insulting.|$|R
50|$|Three {{theories}} exist {{about the}} abandonment of Pampa Grande. However, Shimada explains that these theories have issues because the “available data pertaining to this problematic time period are <b>largely</b> ambiguous <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their fragmentary nature…”.|$|R
50|$|Evelyn is <b>largely</b> {{isolated}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the hours}} {{she has to}} spend caring {{for the children and}} the lack of local intellectual equals. However, she is contacted by a group of other contest-entering mid-western housewives and befriends them.|$|R
5|$|The keel of {{the fourth}} ship of the class was laid at the Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Shipyard on 20 July 1937. She was {{originally}} to have been named Jellicoe, after Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, {{the commander of the}} Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but she was renamed Anson in February 1940. Anson was launched on 24 February 1940 and was completed on 22 June 1942. Completion was delayed <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the inclusion of fire-control radar, and additional anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} city employees, or agents, grew from 40,000 in 2000 to 73,000 in 2013. The city debt grew from €1.6 billion in 2000 to 3.1 billion in 2012, with {{a debt of}} €3.65 billion {{expected}} for 2014. As {{a result of the}} growing debt, the bond rating of the city was lowered from AAA to AA+ in both 2012 and 2013. In September 2014, Mayor Hidalgo announced that the city would have budget shortfall of €400 million, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a cut in support from the national government.|$|E
5|$|While the United States had {{developed}} {{plans for an}} air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat. Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan. This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.|$|E
25|$|Rome would rely on {{brute force}} and sheer numbers when in doubt. The {{soldiers}} {{were trained to}} memorize every step in battle, so discipline and order could not break down into chaos. They were <b>largely</b> successful <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} thought that {{through most of}} Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, euxinia was <b>largely</b> absent <b>because</b> <b>of</b> low {{availability}} of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.|$|R

5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held the high ground, would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy the high ground quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His stance in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators {{in his own party}} and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E
5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. <b>Largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
50|$|The {{habits of}} the Sunda clouded leopard are <b>largely</b> unknown <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the animal's secretive nature. It is assumed that it is {{generally}} solitary. It hunts mainly {{on the ground and}} uses its climbing skills to hide from dangers.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} a shock to most observers, and came about <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> 89% <b>of</b> Labor voters' {{preferences}} went to the CEC. It was seen by contemporary observers as a clear setback to new party leader Mike Ahern in his efforts to stabilise the party ahead of the 1989 election.|$|R
25|$|Some protest {{figures such}} as Svetoslav Nikolov, who was behind the {{initiative}} of setting up tents {{on the western side}} of Parliament on 17 June 2013, declared themselves <b>largely</b> satisfied <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Peevski resignation and the changes to the electoral rules implemented by the Oresharski cabinet.|$|R
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the city}} council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains {{to be the main}} mode of {{transport}} to Holmenkollen Ski Jump during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This will allow 9,000people per hour to be transported to the sports venue. The first T1000 was scrapped on 14 March 2007, and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved six T1000 cars, no. 1002 (T1-2), 1018 (T1-2), 1076 (T1-1), 1092 (T2), 1129 (T3) and 1141 (T4). In 2008, the T2000 were taken out of service while the Holmenkollen Line was being renovated. In 2010, Ruten decided that they would not put back into service, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> high maintenance costs and low availability of spare parts because of the technically complex design and small series. The last T1300 was retired on 22 May 2010, after which only MX3000 units are used on the metro.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven {{was laid}} out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre {{counties}}. Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870, Lock Haven prospered in the 19thcentury <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally {{for such things as}} frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, to make spars for ships. Log driving and log rafting, competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before the founding of the town, the lumber industry was well established.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, he was {{discarded}} {{from the}} communist canon and <b>largely</b> forgotten <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his political background. An {{attempt was made}} by the right-wing in the early 21st century to re-establish him in the curriculum as part of a revision of the national literary canon.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, {{the rapid}} {{economic}} development of post-independence Uganda saw the founding of Diamond Trust Properties Uganda Limited. In 1972, Diamond Trust (Uganda) Limited (DTU) commenced operations as a non-bank financial institution. Between 1972 and the early 1990s, DTU was <b>largely</b> moribund <b>because</b> <b>of</b> political instability.|$|R
