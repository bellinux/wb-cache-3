"Dear Lucy, Your letter gave {{me quite}} a shock, fancy you wanting to draw four pounds {{to buy a}} brooch, ring, bangle, work basket, tea set, etc, etc. [...] I am quite sure Mrs. Henry would expend the money {{carefully}} for you, but I {{must tell you that}} no Aborigine can draw 4/5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require the money to buy comforts...

500|$|The King Supreme debuted with an {{advertising}} campaign {{created by the}} McCaffery Ratner Gottlieb & Lane agency and commercials produced by Aspect Ratio which featured blues legend B.B. King. The ads pushed the company's lunch and dinner periods as {{the best time to}} have the sandwich and had King doing a voice over in which he alternately talked or sang about the sandwiches. The advertisements featured 15- and 30-second television spots in which King is shown sitting on a crescent moon, playing his guitar Lucille while speaking about the products and singing the company's slogan. The 30-second ads were for both the King Supreme and the company's other copycat product, the Egg McMuffin clone called the Egg'Wich Muffin sandwich, while the 15-second ads were for each product individually. On the radio side, 30- and 60-second spots had King discussing the new sandwiches and singing their praise. The tag line for the ads was [...] "BK and BB <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it your way," [...] a variation on the company's motto [...] "Have it your way." ...|$|E

When Brickhouse mentioned this fact to Jones, Jones he asked the mayor how much money the city needed. The mayor replied that he needed $75,000; [...] Jones said, [...] "My clients have $120,000 on deposit in the banks of Little Rock and if the Clearing House will not <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the money, my clients will." [...] After hearing about the conversation, the Clearing House agreed to lend the city the $75,000.|$|E

2500|$|Xiahou Dun's subordinate, Han Hao, led his men {{to outside}} Xiahou's camp, where he gave orders for the other {{officers}} to remain in their respective camps and not make any move. The situation in the other camps became stable. He then headed towards Xiahou Dun's tent and shouted at the hostage-takers, [...] "You murderous traitors, how dare you take the commander hostage! Do you still expect to live? I've received orders to attack the enemy, so I won't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> your way {{just for the sake}} of one officer." [...] With tears in his eyes, he told Xiahou Dun, [...] "This is the law. I've to follow it." [...] Han Hao then ordered {{his men to}} attack the hostage-takers, who were shocked by his response and immediately gave up. The hostage-takers kowtowed and begged for their lives, [...] "We only want to obtain some money for our use and we'll leave after that." [...] Han Hao reprimanded them sternly and had them all executed. Xiahou Dun was saved.|$|E
2500|$|On June 26, 1946, 17-year-old William Heirens {{was arrested}} on {{attempted}} burglary charges when someone saw him breaking into an apartment. As Heirens fled, the building's janitor pursued him and blocked his path out of the building. However, Heirens allegedly pointed the gun he was carrying at the caretaker saying, [...] "Let me get out, or I'll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it in the guts!" [...] The janitor ceased his pursuit. Heirens {{made his way to}} a nearby building to lie low, but a resident spotted him and called the police. As Heirens attempted to escape down a staircase two officers closed in, one {{at each end of the}} staircase. Trapped, Heirens brandished a revolver, perhaps pointing the barrel at one officer. Some reports state that he actually pulled the trigger but the gun misfired. In the police account, Heirens charged them after his gun misfired twice. In Heirens's version, he turned and attempted to run after bluffing with the gun and the cops charged him. A scuffle resulted that ended only when an off-duty policeman dropped three clay flowerpots on Heirens's head, one at a time, from the top of the stairs, rendering him unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E

60|$|Here in Vienna {{in these}} closing days of 1897 one's blood gets {{no chance to}} stagnate. The {{atmosphere}} is brimful of political electricity.
