5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square from above.|$|E

25|$|It {{is likely}} that the design of the tomb {{monument}} itself, which was made almost a decade later, was by Jer√¥me's own hand. The monument is placed in an architectural frame of black and white marble and depicts Mary and Christ <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effigy of the Bishop reclining on a sarcophagus. The portrait of the Bishop in the monument is particularly fine although some have compared it unfavourably with the earlier bust of the Bishop.|$|E

25|$|The altarpiece {{measures}} 375 x 260cm {{when the}} shutters are closed. The upper panels contain lunettes showing prophets and Sibyls <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors {{on the far}} left and right panels flanked by saints. The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; {{this is especially true of}} the faux stone grisaille statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer feel as if the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.|$|E

In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to Bill McLaren, a rugby union broadcaster: [...] "I do not do sportsmen and I certainly do not do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said, [...] warning that memorials are often hastily erected.

Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris. The German and Soviet pavilion sites were opposite each other. On learning (through a clandestine look at the Soviet plans) that the Soviet design included two colossal figures seemingly about to overrun the German site, Speer modified his design to include a cubic mass which would check their advance, with a huge eagle on top <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Soviet figures.

Ozymandias was based on Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt; Moore liked the idea of a character who [...] "us the full 100% of his brain" [...] and [...] " [...] complete physical and mental control".

500|$|Director Winrich Kolbe {{had some}} {{ideas about how}} the {{engineering}} set, suggesting {{that it should be}} a dangerous place with the Voyager crew <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> engine core. Braga compared the idea to the Foucault pendulum in the rotunda at Griffith Observatory. James' designs were not as elaborate as Kolbe suggested, but together with visual effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore they worked out a means of enabling the director to film from above. They raised the set [...] over a blue screen to enable it to be backlit properly. Kolbe had a further impact on the design of the set; he suggested in a production meeting on February 25 that the change of lighting suggesting by James for the bridge should shift from the Starfleet colors to orange in order to maximise the alien effect. James produced a foamcore model of the Dauntless bridge, to both illustrate the final construction and to enable Kolbe to plan out his camera angles while it was still being built.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Chicago Sun-Times, Nelson stated that he had painted Mirth & Girth over the course of one night, standing in his underwear. He said that he had painted it in response to how the city populace revered Washington shortly after his death. Nelson stated, [...] "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." [...] In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of [...] "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned Jesus Christ, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chicago skyline. Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing {{at the time of his}} death. Three weeks after the controversy erupted, in {{an interview}} with the New Art Examiner, Nelson explained that the portrait referenced an existing photograph of Washington holding a cigarette prop at an American Cancer Society event.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} and world designs were handled by art director Kentaro Kagami, and artist and graphics designer Masashi Nakagawa. Leanne {{was the first}} character to be envisioned, before most of the game's concepts had been finalized. The second was Zephyr, who was nicknamed [...] "Boy of the Demonic Possession". The third was Vashyron, who was dubbed [...] "ultimate gentleman". While originally conceived as a [...] "glistening" [...] character, he was reworked as a big brother figure, which in turn led to the scene where he and Zephyr first fight. Rowen's early artwork depict his position as an authority figure <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world from the Zenith System. According to Kagami, his character artwork was created in consultation with Norimoto and Suguro. The three main characters went through multiple design revisions. While Zephyr and Vashyron were designed to reflect the grim environment of Basel, Leanne was meant to contrast against them. Zephyr was initially a lighter, less antagonistic character due to him being younger than Leanne. Unlike other characters, Vashyron's design went through a fairly smooth development process, with his clothing remaining consistent through the design phase. Leanne's clothing {{took a long time}} to finalize: earlier versions of her were based on a concept of her being fashion conscious, but this made her look odd next to the other characters. The small cast was something decided upon at an early stage, along with adjusting the male characters to appear less feminine than others from Japanese RPGs. The latter change was made with a Western audience in mind.|$|E
