5|$|Only 5–10% of <b>levodopa</b> {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much of the {{remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of <b>levodopa</b> to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of <b>levodopa</b> for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with <b>levodopa,</b> often combined with <b>levodopa</b> in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of <b>levodopa.</b> Older controlled-release <b>levodopa</b> preparations have poor and unreliable absorption and bioavailability {{and have not}} demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release <b>levodopa</b> preparation {{does seem to be}} more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of <b>levodopa</b> (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral <b>levodopa</b> when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to <b>levodopa.</b> These were initially used as a complementary therapy to <b>levodopa</b> for individuals experiencing <b>levodopa</b> complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of <b>levodopa</b> therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, <b>levodopa,</b> can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of <b>levodopa</b> temporarily diminishes the motor {{symptoms of}} PD. <b>Levodopa</b> has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Treatment in {{the first}} stage aims for an optimal trade off between symptom control and {{treatment}} side-effects. The start of <b>levodopa</b> treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to <b>levodopa</b> use. However, <b>levodopa</b> is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients whose quality of life is impaired by those symptoms. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of <b>levodopa</b> treatment, so delaying this therapy may not really provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than <b>levodopa.</b> They tend to be more expensive than <b>levodopa.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Levodopa</b> and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when <b>levodopa</b> is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, <b>levodopa</b> should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of <b>levodopa</b> therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than <b>levodopa</b> at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with <b>levodopa</b> increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than <b>levodopa</b> at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and <b>levodopa</b> is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|Three stages may be distinguished: {{an initial}} stage {{in which the}} {{individual}} with PD has already developed some disability requiring pharmacological treatment, a second stage associated with the development of complications related to <b>levodopa</b> usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or <b>levodopa</b> treatment may predominate.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of <b>levodopa,</b> which reduced their use dramatically. <b>Levodopa</b> was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of <b>levodopa</b> use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to <b>levodopa</b> for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive <b>levodopa.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication <b>levodopa</b> (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once <b>levodopa</b> becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
5|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and <b>levodopa.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} <b>levodopa,</b> with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of <b>levodopa</b> after years of use. In people taking <b>levodopa,</b> the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (<b>levodopa</b> or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of <b>levodopa</b> and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as <b>levodopa,</b> and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Selegiline delays {{the time}} point when the L-DOPA (<b>levodopa)</b> {{treatment}} becomes necessary from about 11 months to about 18 months after diagnosis, which is beneficial despite not being definitive evidence of neuroprotection. The rationale for adding selegiline to <b>levodopa</b> is {{to decrease the}} required dose of <b>levodopa</b> and thus reduce the motor complications of <b>levodopa</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|Controlled, slow-release {{versions}} of Sinemet and Madopar {{spread out the}} effect of the <b>levodopa.</b> Duodopa is a combination of <b>levodopa</b> and carbidopa. Slow-release <b>levodopa</b> preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate-release preparations.|$|E
25|$|The on-off {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained <b>levodopa</b> treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of <b>levodopa</b> handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of <b>levodopa</b> dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of <b>levodopa</b> with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of <b>levodopa.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Levodopa</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid-20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967, {{and the first}} large study reporting improvements in people with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with <b>levodopa</b> was published in 1968. <b>Levodopa</b> brought about {{a revolution in the}} management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation emerged as a possible treatment, and it was approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging {{the therapeutic}} effects of <b>levodopa.</b> It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, {{have been used}} to complement <b>levodopa.</b> However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and <b>levodopa</b> (Stalevo).|$|E
25|$|Diazepam may {{block the}} action of <b>levodopa</b> (used in the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease).|$|E
25|$|<b>Levodopa</b> (L-Dopa), a drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease, improves parkinsonian symptoms in a small percentage of MSA patients. A recent trial reported that only 1.5% of MSA patients experienced a less than 50% improvement when taking <b>levodopa,</b> and even this was a transient effect lasting less than one year. Poor response to L-Dopa has been suggested as a possible element in the differential diagnosis of MSA from Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline and rasagiline) {{increase}} {{the level of}} dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum. Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking <b>levodopa</b> when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than <b>levodopa.</b> Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced, although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. Although an initial study indicated selegiline in combination with <b>levodopa</b> increased the risk of death, this has been later disproven.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to <b>levodopa</b> since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to <b>levodopa,</b> but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, as an adjunct to <b>levodopa,</b> in a few countries such as Japan.|$|E
25|$|The current {{mainstay}} of manganism treatment is <b>levodopa</b> and chelation with EDTA. Both have limited and at best transient efficacy. Replenishing the deficit of dopamine with <b>levodopa</b> {{has been shown}} to initially improve extrapyramidal symptoms, but the response to treatment goes down after 2 or 3 years, with worsening condition of the same patients noted even after 10 years since last exposure to manganese. Enhanced excretion of manganese prompted by chelation therapy brings its blood levels down but the symptoms remain largely unchanged, raising questions about efficacy of this form of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Based upon five case reports, {{valproic acid}} may have {{efficacy}} in controlling {{the symptoms of}} levodopa-induced DDS that arise {{from the use of}} <b>levodopa</b> for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Based upon five case reports, {{valproic acid}} may have {{efficacy}} in controlling {{the symptoms of}} the dopamine dysregulation syndrome that arise from the treatment of Parkinson's disease with <b>levodopa.</b>|$|E
25|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, so {{it is common to}} experience constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period of}} time than normal). A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and plenty of water. <b>Levodopa</b> and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when <b>levodopa</b> is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while in advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, <b>levodopa</b> is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and gastrostomy in the worst cases.|$|E
25|$|Agonists produce significant, {{although}} mild, {{side effects}} including somnolence, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes, side effects appear {{even at the}} minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different agonist or kind of drug. When compared with <b>levodopa,</b> while they delay motor complications, they control worse symptoms. Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years. They are also more expensive. Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects, more common in older patients. All this has led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to <b>levodopa</b> in the latter. Agonists at higher doses have also been related {{to a wide variety of}} impulse-control disorders.|$|E
25|$|Selegiline {{is used to}} {{help control}} the {{symptoms}} of Parkinson's disease in people who are taking <b>levodopa</b> and carbidopa combination (Sinemet). Selegiline may help people with PD by stopping the effects of levodopa/carbidopa from wearing off, and increasing {{the length of time}} levodopa/carbidopa continues to control symptoms.|$|E
