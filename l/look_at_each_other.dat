5|$|At {{the party}} that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her, but is unable to hurt her feelings. She is {{becoming}} infatuated with him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda that she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's request. Elphaba herself arrives, wearing the hat Galinda gave her, a witch's hat. The other students laugh and stare while Elphaba awkwardly dances on her own. Galinda feels terrible, and goes to dance with Elphaba. Soon everyone joins them, and the two girls <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in a new light.|$|E
5|$|Several weeks later, Jimson {{is fired}} {{from his job}} for {{slapping}} his manager and is deported back to India. The following day, Mahesh and Baby challenge him to a hand-to-hand combat. After {{a few minutes of}} fighting, Mahesh pins down Jimson and Baby declares him the winner. Mahesh visits Jimson in a hospital on the next day and introduces himself to his mother in front of Jimsy. He admits his love for Jimsy and asks Jimson for his sister's hand in marriage, as Jimson and his mother <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in disbelief. In the credits, Mahesh is seen joining with Jimsy.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E

25|$|Except for {{the woman}} whose face is {{completely}} {{turned away from the}} viewer, all of the other faces in the painting are to one degree or another in shadow, including that of the dog.

25|$|Staring {{at others}} is {{generally}} discouraged by most nudist and naturist groups, and {{could result in}} eviction if someone complains that it made them uncomfortable. In {{the early days of}} naturism in the U.S. (1930s-1950s), the rules at many resorts stipulated that when conversing, you must only <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> face to face. On the other hand, staring has been acceptable at the largely abandoned female beauty contests (see below).|$|E

25|$|The Sesame Street Muppets {{characters}} Bert and Ernie {{share their}} names with the cop and the taxicab {{driver in the}} film. Longtime Muppets writer and puppeteer Jerry Juhl said he believed there was no connection {{and that this was}} a coincidence. The episode Elmo Saves Christmas (1996), which featured a clip from the film, pokes fun at the persistent reports of a connection, having them <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in disbelief as George calls Bert and Ernie by name.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 2000, {{after the}} New York Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers on Game 4 of the 2000 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, Francesa and Russo {{intended}} {{to board a}} plane to Indianapolis to host Mike and the Mad Dog there. However, the flight got cancelled and the next flight did not have first class seats available. Since Francesa only rode planes with first class seats, {{he walked away from}} the airport and went to the studio. This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, that was their worst fight ever. The duo didn’t talk, or even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> during commercial breaks for 2 and a half months. Francesa said he went on vacation in the summer of 2000 and told WFAN to figure something out because he refused to work with Russo again when he returned.|$|E
25|$|One SEAL, {{unaware of}} Coffey's plan at the time, helps {{to locate the}} warhead, stopped on a ledge several {{thousand}} feet down the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will {{only be able to}} communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice keeping him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With nearly no oxygen left in the system, Bud types out that he knew this was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and takes his hand. He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife, and the two <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with understanding.|$|E

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{play and}} {{bet on the}} Dallas board game (which Kevin had for sale). As the {{instruction}} booklet is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras {{that he has the}} money, stating, [...] "And that... is Dallas", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement.|$|E
500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with the eyes of a friend".|$|E
500|$|Like many {{emerging}} American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did {{not occur}} evenly. It largely {{took place on the}} city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered {{on the south side of}} town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from The New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms: [...] "Apartheid is complete. The two cities <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> across a golf course." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Greg Daniels. Daniels had previously directed the episodes [...] "Basketball" [...] and [...] "The Dundies". [...] "The Client" [...] was written by Paul Lieberstein, who acts on the show as human resources director Toby Flenderson. The idea for Jan and Michael to have a romantic relationship was conceived by Steve Carell {{as far back as}} the filming of the pilot episode. According to writer and producer Greg Daniels [...] "it was like he (Michael) was turned on by his teacher." [...] Writer and actor Paul Lieberstein said that the first idea that anybody came up for the episode was the final shot, where Jim and Michael <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and shake their heads, suggesting that they had been through similar experiences. The rest of the episode was written to lead to that scene. The scene where Oscar tells a story about a date getting a background check on him was based on an actual date that Paul Lieberstein went on.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. They <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man {{with a pair of}} binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. She looks at the polo player over her shoulder and sings the lines [...] "I got my eye on you / And I can’t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks into the hallway and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> while saying their lines {{and he tried to}} encourage them to look at one another, so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E

500|$|This theme {{resonated}} with other {{visitors to the}} site. The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between [...] "two dominations <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> across the valley", the ruins of Volubilis and [...] "the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco". She saw the dead city as representing [...] "a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways." [...] In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as [...] "more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." [...] As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis {{as a symbol of}} civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that [...] "in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society". Fortunately for Morocco, [...] "the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. Hilaire Belloc, too, spoke of his impression being [...] "rather one of history and of contrast. Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition." ...|$|E
2500|$|The three {{arrive at}} Kirby Plaza, where Micah Sanders and Molly Walker are located. [...] Claire sees the trio coming, {{and father and}} {{daughter}} reunite.

2500|$|It becomes {{apparent}} {{that there is}} a huge social gulf between Jimmy and Alison. Her family is upper-middle-class military, perhaps verging on upper class, while Jimmy is decidedly working class. He had to fight hard against her family's disapproval to win her. [...] "Alison's mummy and I took one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and from then on the age of chivalry was dead", he explains. We also learn that the sole family income is derived from a sweet stall in the local market—an enterprise that is surely well beneath Jimmy's education, let alone Alison's [...] "station in life".|$|E
