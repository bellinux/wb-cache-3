Modeling procedure was improved to avoid unnecessary computational cost. The study then focused on examining the behavior of composite slabs with respect to variable slenderness. It is found that at slenderness ratio 7. 0, the slab behavior changes between compact and slender. Finally, the study explored the use of shear bond-slenderness equation by plotting a linear regression line. The application of shear bond-slenderness equation enables the prediction of the shear-bond strength of any number of slabs utilizing the same profile from only two sets of test data.

40|$|In {{order that}} future GNSS can fulfil the most {{demanding}} availability, integrity and accuracy requirements of some applications, new techniques combating some sources of errors have to be developed. The multipath propagation is the most harmful phenomenon to pseudorange measurements because {{it can not be}} mitigated using differential corrections. Moreover, the GNSS could also be exposed to the effects of the interferences and robust receivers able to cope with them should be designed. In this paper two different methods of using an antenna array are presented. Firstly, the direct signal delay estimates provided by a DLL are used to iteratively adapt a beamformer that minimises the mean square error between the code autocorrelation and the response to the received signal of a matched filter to the code. This method takes profit of the synergy that exists between the delay estimation and the beamforming. That is to say, the delay estimation improves thanks to the spatial filtering carried out by the beamformer, and the beamforming is more effective when the direct signal delay estimate is more accurate. This beamformer makes use of the knowledge of the direct signal direction-of-arrival and it do not suffer from the desired signal cancellation phenomenon. Secondly, some changes in the formulation of the previous beamformer lead to a very interesting result. The above mentioned mean square error {{can be used as a}} new discrimination function, which plays the role of the cross-correlation between the input and the code in a conventional DLL. This discrimination function uses the spatial diversity to discriminate the signals in the spatial domain overcoming the inherent <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> resolution that the code bandwidth imposes. It is important to note that the presented techniques can be applied to any array geometry and their computational burden is lower than those techniques based on direction-of-arrival estimation. 1...|$|E

The consortium {{is made up}} of 40 institutes from 10 European countries, and includes all the groups that have developed the pilot projects, ANTARES, NEMO and NESTOR. The KM 3 NeT telescope will consist of a three-dimensional array of optical modules arranged on vertical detection units (DUs), anchored to the sea ﬂoor and held in tension by submerged buoys. The time resolution of this detector has to be known with great accuracy since the angular resolution of the track reconstruction depends on the accurate measurement of the relative arrival times of Cherenkov photons reaching the photon sensors. The intrinsic, unavoidable <b>limitation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> resolution (chromatic dispersion and PMT transit time spread) imply that the calibration system of a water-based neutrino telescope must provide a precision at the nanosecond level. The experience with the ANTARES deep sea neutrino telescope has shown that a distributed system of external light sources illuminating the photon detectors with short (∼ 5 ns FWHM) time-referenced light ﬂashes is very useful to ensure the time calibration of the detector and to measure water optical properties. Whilst the basic timing calibration concept applied in ANTARES will be retained, the larger spacing between photo-detectors required in a cubic-kilometer-scale detector results in modiﬁed requirements for the KM 3 NeT system. A three-dimensional system of optical emitters has been studied: several LED models have been tested, and four models preselected as suitable for use in KM 3 NeT were incorporated into ANTARES for in-situ testing.
