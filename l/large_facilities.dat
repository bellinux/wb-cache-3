25|$|An {{underground}} {{power station}} is generally used at <b>large</b> <b>facilities</b> and {{makes use of}} a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake.

25|$|The nation also {{benefited from}} economies of scale. Although {{medium-sized}} and small enterprises generated {{much of the}} nation's employment, <b>large</b> <b>facilities</b> were the most productive. Many industrial enterprises consolidated to form larger, more efficient units. Before World War II, large holding companies formed wealth groups, or zaibatsu, which dominated most industry. The zaibatsu were dissolved after the war, but keiretsu—large, modern industrial enterprise groupings—emerged. The coordination of activities within these groupings and the integration of smaller subcontractors into the groups enhanced industrial efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Northern Cyprus has {{traditionally}} been an attraction for beach holidays, partly thanks to its reputation as an unspoiled area. Its mild climate, rich history and nature are seen as sources of attraction. A significant sector of eco-tourism has been developed in Northern Cyprus, as tourists visit it for birdwatching, cycling, walking and observing flowers in the wild. It is praised for its relative safety, and especially for the Karpass Peninsula, its well-preservation. The peninsula is home to several sorts of tourism: it hosts the Bafra Tourism Area as a center for beach-goers, where four luxurious and large hotels were built until 2014, several facilities and regular festivals that highlight its rural qualities and exhibit local traditions, a remote natural park, the Kantara Castle attracting sightseers, and a marina that was built to host international yachts and boats, along with <b>large</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
25|$|LNG is most cost {{efficiently}} {{produced in}} relatively <b>large</b> <b>facilities</b> due to economies of scale, at sites with marine access allowing regular large bulk shipments direct to market. This requires a secure gas supply of sufficient capacity. Ideally, facilities are located {{close to the}} gas source, to minimize the cost of intermediate transport infrastructure and gas shrinkage (fuel loss in transport). The high cost of building large LNG facilities makes the progressive development of gas sources to maximize facility utilization essential, and the life extension of existing, financially depreciated LNG facilities cost effective. Particularly when combined with lower sale prices due to large installed capacity and rising construction costs, this makes the economic screening/ justification to develop new, and especially greenfield, LNG facilities challenging, even if these could be more environmentally friendly than existing facilities with all stakeholder concerns satisfied. Due to high financial risk, it is usual to contractually secure gas supply/ concessions and gas sales for extended periods before proceeding to an investment decision.|$|E

The silicate slag {{is a useful}} construction material. The fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in water fluoridation. More problematic is a [...] "mud" [...] containing significant amounts of white phosphorus. Production of white phosphorus is conducted in <b>large</b> <b>facilities</b> {{in part because it}} is energy intensive. The white phosphorus is transported in molten form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation; train derailments at Brownston, Nebraska and Miamisburg, Ohio led to large fires. The worst incident in recent times was an environmental contamination in 1968 when the sea was polluted from spillage and/or inadequately treated sewage from a white phosphorus plant at Placentia Bay, Newfoundland.|$|E
2500|$|The Fischer–Tropsch {{process has}} been applied in {{large-scale}} gas–liquids and coal–liquid facilities such as Shell's Pearl GTL facility in Ras Laffan, Qatar. Such <b>large</b> <b>facilities</b> are susceptible to high capital costs, high operation and maintenance costs, the uncertain and volatile price of crude oil, and the involvement of potentially environmentally damaging processes. In particular, the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of [...] "stranded gas", i.e., sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with conventional gas pipelines and LNG technology; otherwise, the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable. Several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so-called stranded gas reserves.|$|E
2500|$|Ozone {{cannot be}} stored and transported like other {{industrial}} gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and {{must therefore be}} produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes.

The regime of typical gas pressures is around [...] absolute in oxygen and [...] absolute in air. Several megawatts of electrical power may be installed in <b>large</b> <b>facilities,</b> applied as one phase AC current at 50 to 8000Hz and peak voltages between 3,000 and 20,000 volts.

2500|$|With {{the need}} for soldier health a growing concern, places for the sick {{to go in the}} army were {{starting}} to show up. [...] Dates ranged from AD 9 to AD 50, but this is when the first evidence of hospitals was seen in archeological remains. [...] These hospitals were specific places for only military members to go to if they were injured or fell ill. [...] Similar hospitals were set up for slaves in areas where slaves were used in large numbers. Military hospitals were permanent structures set up in forts. [...] These buildings had clear patient rooms and were designed to accommodate large numbers of soldiers. [...] The size of these hospitals varied based on their location. [...] Some of the <b>large</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as the hospital in Hod Hill England, was large enough to accommodate roughly 12% of the force within the hospital. [...] In more stable areas such as Inchtuthil in Scotland, there was room for as little as 2% of the force within the hospital. [...] In areas with more conflict there were larger medical facilities as they saw more casualties. [...] These hospitals were solely designed {{for the use of the}} military. [...] If a civilian fell ill or needed surgery they would likely go to the physician’s home and stay, not a hospital. [...] Prior to these permanent structures there were tents set up as mobile field hospitals. [...] Soldiers suffering from severe wounds were brought to these for treatment. [...] These were quickly assembled and disassembled as the army moved. [...] The tents served as a precursor for the permanent structured hospitals. [...] These permanent hospitals and mobile treatment centers were a relatively new concept in this time period.|$|E
