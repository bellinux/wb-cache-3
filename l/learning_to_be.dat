In August 1894, he passed his examination for Second Mate and accepted a post as third officer on a tramp steamer of the Welsh Shire Line. Two years later, he had obtained his First Mate's ticket, and in 1898, he was certified as a Master Mariner, qualifying him to command a British ship anywhere in the world.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{months after}} Percy Jackson's defense of Mount Olympus in The Last Olympian, Percy finds himself alone {{and on the}} run from monsters in {{southern}} California without his memories. Under the initial guidance of Lupa, the wolf-goddess and protector of ancient Rome, he makes his way toward Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod training camp and counterpart to the Greek demigod's Camp Half-Blood. Upon arriving, he is again attacked by several Gorgons, (Stheno and Euryale) and successfully defends a disguised goddess Juno as well as the camp {{with the help of the}} guards on duty. Because he protected her during the attack, Juno announces his arrival with her approval, identifying that Percy is a son of Neptune. She further tells him privately that he can only regain his memory by <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hero again and successfully survive the challenges he encounters at camp.|$|E

40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> a core competence, {{identified}} by the EU, for future citizens of Europe. However there is little consensus on what <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>is,</b> and {{how it should be}} ‘taught’ and assessed. This study explores the findings from three related projects, in China, Italy, Spain and England which used the Effective Lifelong <b>Learning</b> Inventory <b>to</b> explore the <b>learning</b> power of students in primary classrooms. The study shows that <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> culture specific and that extensive efforts should be put into the professional learning and practices of teachers if <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> become a key outcome of education and training across Europe...|$|R

25|$|Simon was {{interested}} in how humans learn and, with Edward Feigenbaum, he developed the EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, {{one of the first}} theories of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning. Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise. With Fernand Gobet, he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model. The theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise.|$|E
25|$|Francis Bacon often {{gathered}} {{with the}} men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing. Bacon's alleged connection to the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books. However, others, including Daphne du Maurier in her biography of Bacon, have argued {{that there is no}} substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Frances Yates does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's New Atlantis portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.|$|E
25|$|Beatty's early {{education}} concentrated on horsemanship, hunting and <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a gentleman. Beatty {{had a close}} relationship with his elder brother Charles, who became his ally against their oppressive and overbearing father. They remained close throughout life, {{so much so that the}} only time Beatty felt despair was at his brother's death. Beatty later wrote to his wife about Charles, we lived together, played together, rode together, fought together. His brothers would later join the British Army, but early on young David developed an interest in ships and the sea and expressed a desire to join the Royal Navy. In 1881 Beatty's grandfather died and David Longfield succeeded to the 18th century mansion, 'Borodale', outside Enniscorthy, in County Wexford. After retiring from the army David Longfield established a business training horses first in Cheshire and then at 'The Mount', near Rugby, Warwickshire. On inheriting and following the death of his wife at 'The Mount', David Longfield returned to Ireland abandoning the training business.|$|E

[...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity."

In his Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, Diogenes Laërtius (3rd century AD) cites the statement of Aristoxenus (4th century BC) that the Delphic Themistoclea taught Pythagoras his moral doctrines: [...] "Aristoxenus says that Pythagoras got most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea." [...] Porphyry (c. 234–305 AD), who calls her Aristoclea (Aristokleia), wrote: [...] "He (Pythagoras) taught much else, which {{he claimed to have}} learned from Aristoclea at Delphi." [...] Ancient authorities furthermore note the similarities between the religious and ascetic peculiarities of Pythagoras with the Orphic or Cretan mysteries, or the Delphic oracle.|$|E
2500|$|Under materialism or even {{embodiment}} values, or in {{any system}} that recognizes the validity of ecology as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, Earth. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words, [...] good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as [...] "not good enough", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied with them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called satisfaction.|$|E

Both Kettle Falls and Old Inchelium were later flooded by the rising waters after the construction of Grand Coulee Dam (which also prevented salmon from reaching the Upper Columbia). His book also described the forced changes {{of life for the}} Sin Aikst/Lakes as conditions forced them away from traditional patterns and how they worked to preserve elements of their traditions.
