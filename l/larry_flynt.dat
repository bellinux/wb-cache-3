5|$|The {{daughter}} of Hank Harrison and psychotherapist Linda Carroll, Love had an itinerant early life. She spent her formative years in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, {{where she was}} in a series of short-lived bands before being cast in two films by British director Alex Cox. After forming Hole in 1989, she received substantial attention from underground rock press for the group's debut album, produced by Kim Gordon. Hole's second release, Live Through This (1994), gave her high-profile renown with critical accolades and multi-platinum sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Miloš Forman's The People vs. <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt</b> (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, she saw further mainstream success with the release of Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), which was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, a Christian {{organization}} {{asked for}} the removal of a poster which advertised the film The People vs <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt</b> by Miloš Forman.

25|$|Flynt {{created his}} privately held company <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt</b> Publications (LFP) in 1976. LFP {{published}} several other magazines and also controlled distribution. LFP launched Ohio Magazine in 1977, and later its output included other mainstream work. LFP sold the distribution business, {{as well as}} several mainstream magazines, beginning in 1996. LFP started to produce pornographic movies in 1998, through the Hustler Video film studio, that bought VCA Pictures in 2003. In 2014, Flynt said his print portfolio made up only 10% of his company's revenue, and predicted the demise of Hustler due to competition from the Internet.|$|E

50|$|Before {{her film}} {{industry}} work, Gail Thackray was a Page 3 girl (glamour model) for the British tabloid press.

50|$|In one of {{the most}} bizarre episodes of the magazine's history, the {{subscriber}} list for Big Brother got mixed up with Taboo, one of <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt's</b> hardcore magazines: Big Brother subscribers were sent pornography, and those who subscribed to Taboo got a skate magazine. This incident was parodied on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in which {{one of the}} band members was delivered an issue of Big Brother live on stage, suggesting that he subscribed to Taboo and received it in error.|$|R
25|$|He {{was convicted}} of several murders, and {{received}} six life sentences, {{as well as the}} death sentence. He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt</b> in 1978 and Vernon Jordan Jr., the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those cases. Because Franklin repeatedly changed his accounts of some crimes, and was not charged in some cases in which he was suspected, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid schizophrenic who was not fit to stand trial.|$|E
25|$|Flynt {{has been}} embroiled in many legal battles {{regarding}} {{the regulation of}} pornography and free speech within the United States, especially attacking the Miller v. California (1973) obscenity exception to the First Amendment. He was first prosecuted on obscenity and organized crime charges in Cincinnati in 1976 by Simon Leis, who headed a local anti-pornography committee. He was given a sentence of 7 to 25 years in prison, but served only six days in jail; the sentence was overturned on appeal following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, as well as judicial and jury bias. One argument resulting from this case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981. Flynt made an appearance in a feature film based on the trial, The People vs. <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt,</b> playing the judge who sentenced him in that case.|$|E

After RIP ceased publication, Rock Tales began {{running as a}} one-page true-stories comic strip on the inside back cover of each issue of Spin (magazine), founded by Flynt rival Bob Guccione Jr., publisher of Penthouse Magazine. Rock Tales appears to have ceased as of the December 2012 issue of Spin (magazine), its final newsstand edition before the print publication was cancelled and the periodical moved to website-only status.|$|R
500|$|In 1975, Oui {{magazine}} gave Keating the {{top spot}} on its [...] "Enemies of pornography" [...] list. Hamilton County prosecutor Simon L. Leis, Jr. put Ohio pornographer <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt</b> on trial in 1976 for pandering obscenity and for engaging in a form of organized crime. Local public opinion ran against Flynt. Flynt was convicted on both counts and received the maximum sentence of 7 to 25 years in prison. While the conviction was later overturned on appeal, the verdict again established Cincinnati's community standards in this regard, and even after Keating left for Arizona, his influence remained in Cincinnati being a center of anti-pornography fervor. In the 1996 biopic, The People vs. <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt,</b> which reportedly exaggerated Keating's role in the prosecution and trial, Keating was portrayed by actor James Cromwell. Attempts to show Vixen! in Cincinnati would continue, but by the late 1990s it was still illegal to do so.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a [...] "sexier marquee name" [...] like Matt Damon to {{increase}} the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton a candidate for the role, based on the actor's performance in the 1996 film The People vs. <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt.</b> Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Man on the Moon. The actor was cast in Runaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton a $2.5million salary to attract him to Fight Club. Norton could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary (Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job).|$|E
500|$|After Hole's {{world tour}} {{concluded}} in 1996, Love made {{a return to}} acting, first in small roles in the Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Basquiat and the drama Feeling Minnesota (1996), before landing the co-starring role of Larry Flynt's wife Althea in Miloš Forman's critically acclaimed 1996 film The People vs. <b>Larry</b> <b>Flynt.</b> Despite Columbia Pictures' reluctance to hire Love due to her troubled past, she received critical acclaim for her performance in the film after its release in December 1996, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress. Critic Roger Ebert called her work in the film [...] "quite a performance; Love proves {{she is not a}} rock star pretending to act, but a true actress." [...] She won several other awards from various film critic associations for the film. During this time, she also modeled for Versace advertisements and appeared in Vogue Italia.|$|E
