5000|$|A rose {{engine lathe}} is a {{specialized}} kind of geometric lathe. The headstock rocks {{back and forth}} with a rocking motion or along the spindle axis in a pumping motion, controlled by a rubber moving against a rosette or cam-like pattern mounted on the spindle, while the <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> rotates. Rose engine work can make flower patterns, as well as convoluted, symmetrical, multi-lobed geometric patterns. The patterns it produces are similar to that of a Spirograph, in metal. No other ornamental lathe can produce these [...] "rose" [...] patterns. The decoration produced by a rose engine lathe is called guilloche. It sometimes confused with [...] "jewel finishes" [...] or engine turning, a much cheaper process of making swirly marks in metal by a rotating abrasive peg or pad, which is repeatedly applied to the surface to make a pattern of overlapping circles. Jewel finishes used to be common on stereo faceplates and automobile interiors.|$|E
50|$|Ornamental turning is {{believed}} to have originated in Bavaria {{in the latter part of}} the 15th century when it consisted mostly of rose-work, being done by using a cam or template (called a rosette) mounted on the <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> and allowing the headstock to rock under tension of a spring or weight, to follow the contour on the edge of the rosette: also the spindle was allowed to slide to and fro endwise under tension of another spring, or weight, to follow the contour on the face of the rosette. Thus, as the work was rotated it rocked and traversed so that the cutting tool produced wavy lines upon the surface or the cylinder. Before the end of the 18th century, cutting tools were generally hand-held or clamped to a fixed 'rest'. The slide rest, which allows the cutter to slide along the rest under control of a leadscrew, although invented before 1480, was not in general use until much later. It is clear from surviving examples of their work that the skill of the early turners was highly developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated lathes are checked against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (deviation from circularity). These deviations are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> chuck jaws. The position of the signalling device during the <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine deviations from circularity during the <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.

The data obtained using the apparatus can be used by students to select the optimal preload level for a spindle. The apparatus was designed as four subsystems (one for each measurement) that were integrated into a cohesive measurement system. The apparatus is designed to be as small, light, and user-friendly as possible, in order for students to use it effectively. The apparatus is capable of measuring bearing preload up to 10, 000 lbs with a linearity of 0. 05 % and radial error motion with an accuracy of +/- 0. 00012 in. (3 [mu]m).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the dynamic response and optimal {{design of a}} <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> under experimentally measured random cutting force excitations. The optimal design is based on minimizing the maximum mean square displacement response of the workpiece under the action of random cutting forces. The stochastic partial differential equation of motion characterizing {{the behavior of a}} lathe spindle-workpiece system is formulated based on the Euler-Bernoulli equation. A finite element method using beam elements is used for free vibration analysis to compute the undamped mode shapes and the natural frequencies of the spindle-workpiece system. The workpiece support at the running center has been modelled as hinged or fixed support and the theoretical results are compared with the laboratory experiments to classify the nature of the support condition. Based on the results, the end condition at the running center is classified as hinged. The effect of varying the spindle-bearing stiffness on the natural frequencies and mode shapes are also presented. The forced vibration of the spindle-workpiece system is studied by first investigating the nonstationary random response of a workpiece subjected to a constantly varying cutting tool contact in a turning operation. The results indicate that the workpiece response at the cutting tool is not significantly influenced by the tool feed rate for normal turning operations. A modal analysis in conjunction with the finite element technique is then used to calculate the mean square displacement of the workpiece. The experimentally calculated power spectral density of the cutting forces is used as the input excitation to the mathematical model. A parametric study of the effect of bearing stiffness and damping, bearing spacing, sectional rigidity, and external damper on the mean square displacement is presented. An optimal design of a <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle</b> using a direct search optimization technique with bearing stiffness and spacing, and spindle cross-sectional diameter as design variables, has been carried out.

40|$|When a soft {{polishing}} tool is compressed on a stiff workpiece of curved surface, {{the contact}} {{area is a}} piece of the curved surface. In the process of aspheric surface polishing, the machining speed is always provided by the rotational speed of the spindle of a computer numerical control lathe. Yet, the polishing tool is usually made rotating to remove cutting scraps and broken abrasives from the contact area. The rotational speed of the polishing tool would change the distribution state of the relative speed in the whole contact area, and it would definitely change the volume of material removal in the surface of the workpiece. This article studies how the rotational speed of the polishing tool changes the distribution state of the relative speed in the whole contact area and material removal in the volume of the surface of the workpiece.

[4] presented a reliability optimization design method considering the failure caused by overlarge static deformation of the CNC <b>lathe</b> <b>spindle,</b> so that reliability was improved and reliability robustness increased at the same time. CNC lathes are traditionally regarded as series systems [5], and it’s commonly seen in some researches that failures of different subsystems are independent, which means that failure of a certain subsystem cannot be influenced by any other subsystem. However, according to engineering experience and practical situation, failure independence hypothesis is not accurate enough [6], which may cause unnecessary costs. Problems such as changes in environment or uneven distribution of materials may lead to the same variation tendency of subsystems’ reliability, resulting in fluctuation of the reliability of the lathe. Failure of a subsystem is not only related to fatigue caused by long time operation, but also related to failures of other systems, which is so-called failure correlation [7, 8]. Therefore, failure correlation should be given full consideration when assessing reliability of CNC lathes.|$|E
