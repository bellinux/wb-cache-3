50|$|The Rhinluch {{was formed}} {{during the last}} ice age and its post-glacial period. About 16,000 years ago, the Eberswald urstromtal was formed by the meltwaters of the glacial ice sheet as they drained away to the sea. Later, this broad river valley dried up as the ice sheet retreated during the late ice age. In the land that makes up the present-day Rhinluch, lakes {{initially}} formed in individual places, especially where there were dead ice kettle holes. Over the course of time, these became bogs through the natural silting up process. In addition, during the post-glacial period, there was a widespread formation of swamps (Versumpfungsmooren) on the sands of the urstromtal. Not until man appeared, however, did these moors become pastures and meadows as a result of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures.</b> The easternmost outlier of the Rhinluch is the Kremmener Luch.|$|E

A major hypothesis tested is that investment in productivity enhancing and conservation techniques are influenced by land tenure systems. The theoretical analysis and empirical results generally reveal that land tenure differences significantly influence farmers’ decisions to invest in <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> and conservation <b>measures.</b> Furthermore, reduced-form productivity regressions show that tenure differences do affect land productivity. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of {{perceived}} land tenure security in China on farmers' decisions to invest in relatively long-term <b>land</b> quality <b>improvement</b> <b>measures,</b> taking into account the potential endogeneity of tenure security. Design/methodology/approach – Data from a survey held in 2008 and 2010 among 259 households in Minle County, Gansu province, covering the years 2007 and 2009, are used to estimate the factors affecting land levelling investments, irrigation canal investments and perceived land tenure security. The authors use the 2 SCML technique and the IVLS method to estimate a selection model and a non-limited regression model, respectively, and use IVP methods to examine the robustness of the results. Findings - The authors' results indicate that perceived land tenure security significantly affects self-governed investments but does not affect individual investments in <b>land</b> quality <b>improvements.</b> In particular, the authors find that households that consider land certificates as important for protecting land rights invest significantly more in irrigation canals construction and maintenance. The authors' results further provide evidence that individual investments in <b>land</b> quality <b>improvement</b> contribute to higher perceived land tenure security. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the available literature on the relationship between land tenure security and land investments by examining the role of perceived (instead of formal) land tenure security and by making a distinction between individual household investments and self-governed land investments. The authors' results provide an explanation for the phenomenon that land readjustments still take place in some parts of China, but not in other...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{structure}} index {{is a method}} to evaluate the physical status of the soil {{and the effect of}} the farming system on soil structure. The index consists of three parts. One part where basic soil physical requirements are checked, a farming system part where yearly measures by the farmer are evaluated and finally a soil structure field test. In the first part, basic agricultural <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> such as drainage, subsoiling etc. are evaluated. In the second part, the effect of the farming system on soil structure is summarized in an index with three positive factors and three negative factors. Plant root production, organic material (straw etc.) and e 1 rying of the soil profile are considered positive and bare nonfrozen soil, number of passages in the field and subsoil compaction is considered having a negative effect on soil structure and soil physical properties. The different factors are corrected by e 1 ifferent coefficients and the total effect is summarized in the index. The soil structure field test consists of a couple of simple field tests that together give a good picture of the soil structure. The field tests enable the farmer to ass ess and monitor the structure of the soil. The two first parts are today gathered in a programme in Excel format but shall be developed into a more user friendly format.

40|$|Pakistan is {{the fourth}} largest cotton {{producing}} country. Cotton and cotton products contribute about 3. 2 % to GDP and 60 - 65 % to foreign exchange earnings of the country. In this dissertation three important aspects of cotton production and marketing are focused, i. e. adoption and impact of Bt cotton, land rights’ influence on farmers’ decision to invest in <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> and efficiency level, and cotton farmers’ market participation. Cross sectional data was collected from 325 cotton farmers in Pakistan during 2007. The Propensity score matching approach was employed to estimate the adoption and impact of Bt cotton technology. The empirical results indicate that Bt cotton adopter farmers were getting 50 - 60 kgs per acre higher yields, household income was higher {{in the range of}} Rupees 16500 - 17000, while the demand for pesticide was less in the range of 0. 62 - 0. 68 liters. The probability of adopters being poor was found to be lower by 13 - 14 %. The land rights results indicate that owner cultivated lands exhibit the higher levels of technical, allocative and economic efficiency compared to fixed-renters and sharecroppers. The net returns are positive and significant for the farmers selling at market compared to farmers selling at farm gate. From the empirical results it can be concluded that targeting the small scale farmers with Bt cotton technology can help them a way out of poverty, as well as land reforms in favour of tenants and small scale farmers can help them increase their efficiency level. Similarly, regarding farmers’ market participation, small-scale farmers can be linked to the markets by investing in human capital, improving the village infrastructure and readdressing the formal credit programme...|$|E

Conventional methodology in land reclamation condition (LR) assessment is based on qualitative analysis of information from: (i) network of piezometer wells (e. g., groundwater table and salinity) and (ii) sampling sites (e. g. soil salinity). This method has certain disadvantages {{in terms of the}} time, approach and cost required for objective assessment and interpretation of LR condition. Moreover, the LR condition is affected by variable environmental conditions and management factors such as soil texture, fertility, water availability, drainage density and so on, among others. How can the available data from different organizations be integrated? What are the relationships amongst the factors? These are major issues which are not easily resolved. It is, however, only through an integrated, multi-level, approach that both the land and water management and the existing interactions amongst the individual components of the landscape can be evaluated. Therefore, it is often advantageous to aggregate several indicators into an index allowing different factors {{to be taken into account}} simultaneously in order to monitor the state of the environment. In response to these problems, main goal of this study is to explore and review existing assessment methods used in Uzbekistan to assess and map land reclamation condition and find out environmentally sensitive areas, on which further <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> can be taken. The soil (texture), land condition (groundwater table) and water availability (distance to the irrigation systems) have found as main factors effecting on LR condition throughout the study region. The simplicity of approach with available data allows to identify, combine and understand the influencing factors on LR condition for better management of the land and its resources. ...|$|E

In strongly eroded ter-rains, a considerable part of agricultural roads are transformed into ravines, {{as a result of}} their inap-propriate location in the terrain relief. Hence the arrangement and hardening of rural roads remains an essential component of formation of arable areas on eroded terrains. Correct derivation of the roads, which need the protective measures or even re-projecting improves the state of the road net-work in economically effective way, as it allocates the available resources to the most threatened areas. The article presents a study on the actual state of the net of rural roads on loess upland terrain of Mielnica watershed. The analysis, performed on digital spatial data within GIS software, revealed considerable needs for improvements of rural roads on investigated area. Basing on the results, the map of <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> has been de-veloped, presenting a spatial base for a decision support system for future <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> and allocation of economical resources for the mana-gement of rural surface communication network in rural-environmental plans.

An {{important question is}} thus how landowners would respond to regulations and mandates concerning <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> Based on a landowner survey, we analyse landowner choices under certain <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> regulations, using the currently dominant choice of leasing land for agricultural use as the benchmark. The results indicated that land leasing {{will continue to increase}} in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandates and search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups were identified based on their land use choices.

As the Main construction projects were completed, the purpose of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts Has shifted from facilities construction to operation and maintenance of them. However, the recent social situation has brought great changes in circumstance to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts. In both urban and agricultural areas around local cities, urbanization has progressed so rapidly and widely that agricultural land has decreased through conversion into urban use. That causes pollution of irrigated water and difficulties in maintenance of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities.

40|$|To {{guarantee}} {{safe and}} secure food production in the future we are dependent on farming systems which maintain good soil quality and fertility, The physical condition of our soils, which is an important parameter when discussing soil quality and fertility, has degenerated in the last decades, One {{of the main reasons}} for this degeneration is the development of Swedish agriculture which has lead to larger machines, more specialised units, less variation in crop rotations etc, This has lead to a growing {{need to be able to}} define and measure soil fertility and quality, Researcher (PhD) Kerstin Berglund and professor emeritus Waldemar Johansson at the Department of Soil Science, Swedish University of Agriculture have developed a soil structure index, The index is a way to estimate the sustainability of farming systems and the physical status of the soils, The index consists of three different parts, One part evaluates long term effects of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures,</b> one takes annual farming practises in consideration and the last part is a soil structure test applied in the field. The purpose of this Master degree is to evaluate the soil structure index and its different parts, This evaluation of the index have been done according to two main principles. In the first part the influence of one distinct parameter on soil structure was evaluated. All other parameters remained the same. In the second part two different farming systems where several parameters differed were analysed and compared. Results from the evaluation lead to the conclusion that the soil structure index works well. Index results also correlated well with field and laboratory results, This shows that it is possible to evaluate the effect different farming systems have on soil structure, without using expensive and time-consuming field and laboratory methods. Index and field-tests do not give an exact diagnosis on soils physical status but a hint on how the farming system will affect soil structure on a long term basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Meta Robi district, West Shewa Zone, Oromia Regional State to {{identify}} the types and sources of feeds, constraints in feed production, transportation, utilization and supply, estimate annual feed produced, maintenance requirement, annual feed balance and determine the mineral status of natural pasture and soil samples. Secondary data sources and field observations, key informants discussions and semi-structured questionnaire interview were employed to generate data. The district was stratified into upper, mid and lower altitudes and a total of 90 respondents (upper= 30, mid= 30 and lower= 30) were randomly selected and interviewed individually. Samples of feed and soil were collected from three altitudes during the dry and wet seasons and their mineral concentrations were determined. The results of the study indicated that the major feed resources were grazing of natural pasture (58. 9 %), wheat straw (42. 4 %), barley straw (30 %) and hay (21. 1 %). During the dry season, 90 % of the respondents feed their animal crop residues, hay (58. 8 %) and stubble grazing (56. 1 %). Natural pasture was the major feed source during the wet season. Most respondents (46. 7 %) had their own natural pasture lands, 86. 7 % produced crop residues from their crop land whereas only 25. 6 % were producing improved forages. The major constraints related to livestock feed were shortage of grazing land, absence of feed processors and retailers, shortage of technologies in feed production and lack of awareness of the respondents. The total maintenance DM of feed requirement of the animals per year in the district was 388, 859. 8 tons while the actual DM of feed production was 212, 047. 15 tons. The total DM of feed produced per year fulfilled the maintenance requirement of the animals only for 6. 54 months of the year. Concentrations of most minerals in the soil were above the critical level of plant growth and most macro minerals in the feed were below the requirement of dairy animals while micro minerals were above the requirement of dairy animals except Mn. Alternative feed production technologies such as development of improved forages, efficient feed utilization technologies (eg. provision of chopper) and natural pasture <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> should be taken. To compensate the mineral deficiency of natural pasture, improved forages with better yield and mineral contents should be provided for livestock. Provision of common salt and/or locally available natural soil as mineral source should be encouraged. Global Affairs Canad...|$|E
40|$|Poverty {{among the}} small {{cultivators}} in the Philippines remains widespread despite a general increase {{in per capita}} income {{during the last three}} decades. At the same time, the degradation of agricultural land resources, as sources of daily subsistence for the rural workers, is progressing. Past policy studies on the alleviation of rural poverty in the developing countries have centered on the issue of increasing food production and expanding economic growth but gave little attention to the issue of constraints imposed by degradation of agricultural land resources. Only in recent years have there been increasing focus on the relationship between rural poverty and environmental degradation. Inquiry is, however, often done by simplistic one way causal relationships which, although often illuminating, does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the different interacting processes that create rural poverty and land degradation. Thus, policies ensuing from such analyses provide only short-term gains without effecting lasting improvement in the living conditions of the small cultivators. ^ This dissertation examines the complex interrelationships between rural poverty and land degradation and attempts to explain the inefficacy of broad development programs implemented in alleviating rural poverty and reversing deterioration of land resources. The study uses the case of the Philippines for empirical validation. The analysis employs computer simulation experiments with a system dynamics model of a developing economy consisting of an agricultural sector whose microstructure incorporates processes influencing: agricultural production; disbursement of income; changes in the quality of agricultural land resources; demographic behavior; and rural-urban transfer of real and monetary resources. The system dynamics model used in this study extends the wage and income distribution model of Saeed (1988) by adding to it decision structures concerning changes in the quality of agricultural land resources and rural-urban interaction. ^ The study concludes that development programs advancing growth in agricultural production and providing technological, organizational, and financial assistance to target poor groups would not deliver long-term improvement in the economic conditions of the poor peasants unless distribution of land is altered. Similarly, policies promoting land improvement and conservation measures in an economic environment where land ownership remains skewed do not produce lasting betterment of agricultural land quality. It has been shown that a policy, which discourages the separation of land ownership from cultivatorship by imposing a tax on income accrued from absentee ownership, is therefore very critical in promoting land ownership among small cultivators and changing unequal land and income distribution. However, in order to sustain the improvement in the economic and environmental conditions of the small cultivators, this policy of taxing rent income must be complemented by policies that: (1) promote increases in agricultural production; (2) provide technological, organizational, and financial assistance to the small farmers; and (3) promote <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures.</b> ...|$|E
