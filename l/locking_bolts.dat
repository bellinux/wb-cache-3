For shear force loaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> connections the possible failures will be listed and the accompannying arithmetical verification presented. Due to the variety of fiber plastic composites, whose selection mainly depends on the type and amount of the load, in this project trial-based assessments are determined and the capacities to withstand certain stresses are investigated. The investigation is focused on the determination of the compliances and the ultimate interface pressure, the shear and bearing stress experiments for the experimental determination of the bearing stress coeddicient as well as the use of the statistic test planning and evaluation in respect to the use of slip-restiant preloaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> connections. Finally, the experimental determined stress restiance (ultimate surface pressure, ultimate bearing resistance, slip resistance) are compared with the calculated stress resistance and literature values...|$|R

50|$|All but the {{simplest}} safes {{are designed to}} protect against drilling attacks through the implementation of hardplate steel (extremely wear-resistant) or composite hardplate (a casting of metal such as cobalt-vanadium alloys with embedded tungsten carbide chips designed to shatter the cutting tips of a drill bit) within the safe, protecting the locking mechanism and other critical {{areas such as the}} <b>locking</b> <b>bolts.</b> The use of hardplate ensures that conventional drilling is not successful when used against the safe. Drilling through hardplate requires the use of special-purpose diamond or tungsten-carbide drill-bits.

50|$|Some high-security safes {{use what}} is called a glass relocker. It is a piece of {{tempered}} glass mounted between the safe door and the combination lock. It has wires attached to the edges. These wires lead to randomly located, spring-loaded bolts. If an attempt is made to penetrate the safe, the penetrating drill or torch breaks the glass and releases the bolts. These bolts block the retraction of the main <b>locking</b> <b>bolts.</b> To drill a safe with a glass relocker, side, top, or rear drilling may be necessary. Many modern high-security safes also incorporate thermal relockers in conjunction with glass-based relockers (usually a fusible link as part of the relocker cabling), which also activate when the temperature of a safe exceeds a certain level as a defense against torches and thermal lances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Prevention of slack in {{fastening}} bolt {{has been an}} important researching subject since fatigue failure can be generally caused by loosening nut. According to the above reason, the super <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> with double screw mechanism, which is non-loosening, has been developed for preventing such kind of bolt failure. The objects of the present study are as follows: (1) To clarify the fatigue strength characteristics. (2) To investigate the initiation and propagation behaviour of fatigue crack regarding to the thread root of first pitch. In addition, the mechanism of “fatigue strength of super <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> ” is also discussed in this paper and it is confirmed that this bolt shows excellent fatigue strength and non-loosening properties...|$|R

25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|R

30|$|The reaming {{technique}} was preferred as it enabled insertion of larger nails, thus providing higher fracture stability. The reaming {{strategy was to}} measure the canal and ream sequentially until a diameter 1.5  mm wider than the nail selected was reached. A fracture table was used but the limbs held in traction boots instead of skeletal traction. The distal <b>locking</b> <b>bolts</b> were inserted using a free hand technique; a Kirschner wire was positioned at the locking hole of the nail with X-ray assistance and drilled over with a cannulated drill before insertion of the distal locking screw. A 3 -cm distance between the fracture line and the locking screw was considered a safe distance. Lateral X-rays were also used {{in an attempt to}} avoid procurvatum or recurvatum deformities in fracture alignment.|$|E
