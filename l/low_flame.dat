One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia is {{sometimes}} proposed {{as a practical}} alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines. Its high octane rating of 120 and <b>low</b> <b>flame</b> temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production. Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{pyrotechnic}} compositions, {{for example}} MTV, give a great flame emission upon combustion and yield a temperature-dependent signature {{and can be}} understood as gray bodies of high emissivity (~0.95). Such payloads are called blackbody payloads. Other payloads, like iron/potassium perchlorate pellets, only yield a <b>low</b> <b>flame</b> emission but also show temperature-dependent signature. Nevertheless, the lower combustion temperature as compared to MTV results in a lower amount of energy released in the short-wavelength IR range. Other blackbody payloads include ammonium perchlorate/anthracene/magnesium and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binder.|$|E

25|$|Kerosene {{is often}} used in the {{entertainment}} industry for fire performances, such as fire breathing, fire juggling or poi, and fire dancing. Because of its <b>low</b> <b>flame</b> temperature when burnt in free air, the risk is lower should the performer come in contact with the flame. Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing, as it produces an unpleasant (to some) odor, which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration. Ethanol was sometimes used instead, but the flames it produces look less impressive, and its lower flash point poses a high risk.|$|E

A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{has changed}} her lyrical focus over the years, {{becoming}} {{the subject of}} analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies. David Ritz compared Jackson's musical style to Marvin Gaye's, stating, [...] "like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain." [...] Much of her success {{has been attributed to}} [...] "a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge." [...] Ritz also stated, [...] "The mystery is the <b>low</b> <b>flame</b> that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear." [...] During the 1980s, her lyrics embodied self-actualization, feminist principles, and politically driven ideology. Gillian G. Gaar, author of She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock & Roll (2002), described Control as [...] "an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free." [...] Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture (2010) author Jessie Carney Smith wrote [...] "with that album, she asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person, from an ingénue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity." [...] Referring to Rhythm Nation 1814 as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007) wrote [...] "It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." ...|$|E
50|$|The rice is rinsed a {{few times}} in water and drained until the water turns from milky to clear. The rice should be soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking. The unsoaked rice takes 25 minutes to parboil, whereas the soaked grains take only 15 minutes. Rice should be {{parboiled}} till al dente. Remove the pot from the flame and transfer the rice in a sieve to drain the boiling water. Then transfer the rice back into the pot, and cover it with a lid, to prevent the steam from escaping.

[...] An external leather belt on this wheel ran a second jack-shaft, which powered the distributor and keyboard matrix conveyor and escapements through additional belting off this shaft. [...] Gas fired pots, {{such as in the}} illustration below, were most common in the earlier years, with the pot being thermostatically controlled (high flame when under temperature and <b>low</b> <b>flame</b> when up to temperature), and then a second smaller burner for the mouth and throat heating, or else, with the more modern installations running on 1500 watt electric pots with an initially rheostat controlled mouth and throat heaters (several hundred watts on the electric models)(to keep the lead and tin type metal liquified just prior to being cast) to precisely adjust temperature. [...] Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized 1/2 horsepower motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s. [...] The large machines also had the so-called 'double pot', with either larger gas burners, or else 2250 watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters. [...] The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual rheostat adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.|$|E

6000|$|... 1529. Rarefaction {{of the air}} wonderfully favours {{the glow}} phenomena. A brass ball, {{two and a half}} inches in diameter, being made {{positively}} inductric in an air-pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter, when the pressure was reduced to 4.4 inches of mercury. By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with this light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inches in diameter, and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the phenomena, at high degrees of rarefaction, were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over the positive ball, and gradually increased in brightness, until it was at last very luminous; and it also stood up like a <b>low</b> <b>flame,</b> half an inch or more in height. On touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame was affected, assumed a ring form, like a crown {{on the top of the}} ball, appeared flexible, and revolved with a comparatively slow motion, i.e. about four or five times in a second. This ring-shape and revolution are beautifully connected with the mechanical currents (1576.) taking place within the receiver. These glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted in beauty by a spark discharge at the conductor (1551. Note.).|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to clarify flame characteristics through the evaluation of critical mole fractions at flame extinction and edge-flame oscillation of <b>low</b> strain rate <b>flames</b> using the global strain rate, velocity ratio, and burner distance as experimental variables. The transition from a shrinking flame disk to a flame hole was verified through gradient measurements of the maximum flame temperature. Evidence of edge-flame oscillation in flame disks was also found using numerical simulations in zero and normal gravity. The main mechanisms of flame extinction and edge-flame oscillation were analyzed by comparing the energy fractions in the energy equation. For <b>low</b> strain rate <b>flame</b> disks, radial conduction heat loss rather than flame radiation was a significant contributor to flame extinction and even edge-flame oscillation. This was experimentally demonstrated by evaluating the critical mole fraction at flame extinction and edge-flame oscillation, as well as measurements of the flame temperature gradient along the flame disk surface. These results suggest that <b>low</b> strain rate <b>flame</b> responses are determined not only by one-dimensional flame responses, but also by multi-dimensional flame responses such as radial conduction heat loss. The results also show that extinction of <b>low</b> strain rate <b>flames</b> is more probably due to multi-dimensional heat losses than to radiative extinction...|$|R

50|$|A {{length of}} pipe is {{perforated}} {{along the top}} and sealed at both ends - one seal {{is attached to a}} small speaker or frequency generator, the other to a supply of a flammable gas (propane tank). The pipe is filled with the gas, and the gas leaking from the perforations is lit. If a suitable constant frequency is used, a standing wave can form within the tube. When the speaker is turned on, the standing wave will create points with oscillating (higher and lower) pressure and points with constant pressure (pressure nodes) along the tube. Where there is oscillating pressure due to the sound waves, less gas will escape from the perforations in the tube, and the flames will be lower at those points. At the pressure nodes, the flames are higher. At the end of the tube gas molecule velocity is zero and oscillating pressure is maximal, thus <b>low</b> <b>flames</b> are observed. It is possible to determine the wavelength from the flame minimum and maximum by simply measuring with a ruler.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this note to present an {{evaluation}} of the experimental evidence for and against "anomalous" temperatures of OH in flames. Experimental studies have been carried out on <b>low</b> pressure <b>flames,</b> and on flames burning at atmospheric pressure. The results have usually been interpreted by using relations which are applicable only to isothermal systems. Attempts to correct for self-absorption have been made by using isointensity methods. For spectral lines with Doppler contour it has been demonstrated by quantitative calculations that the isointensity methods do not correct for self-absorption unless self-absorption is weak. In particular, Shuler's method, without allowance for the effect of frequency on intensity, has been shown to yield nonlinear plots for strong self-absorption and to be inferior to conventional procedures in the absence of self-absorption. Extensive studies on the effect of self-absorption in falsifying experimental data have been carried out by Cowan and Dieke. We have recently attempted to estimate absolute emission intensities for OH in <b>low</b> pressure <b>flames</b> by using data obtained by Oldenberg and Rieke. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study of}} nitrogen-diluted non-premixed {{counterflow}} flames with finite burner diameters investigates {{the important role}} of the outer-edge flame on flame extinction through experimental and numerical analyses. It explores flame stability diagrams mapping the flame extinction response of nitrogen-diluted non-premixed counterflow flames to varying global strain rates in terms of burner diameter, burner gap, and velocity ratio. A critical nitrogen mole fraction exists beyond which the flame cannot be sustained; the critical nitrogen mole fraction versus global strain rate curves have C-shapes for various burner diameters, burner gaps, and velocity ratios. At sufficiently high strain-rate flames, these curves collapse into one curve; therefore, the flames follow the one-dimensional flame response of a typical diffusion <b>flame.</b> <b>Low</b> strain-rate <b>flames</b> are significantly affected by radial conductive heat loss, and therefore flame length. Three flame extinction modes are identified: flame extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge flame with or without oscillations at the outer-edge flame prior to the extinction, and flame extinction through a flame hole at the flame center. The extinction modes are significantly affected by the behavior of the outer-edge flame. Detailed explanations are provided based on the measured flame-surface temperature and numerical evaluation of the fractional contribution of each term in the energy equation. Radial conductive heat loss at the flame edge to ambience is the main mechanism of extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge <b>flame</b> in <b>low</b> strain-rate <b>flames.</b> Reduction of the burner diameter can extend the flame extinction mode by shrinking the outer-edge flame in higher strain-rate flames. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
