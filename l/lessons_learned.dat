5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E

5|$|The CSM {{for this}} flight, number 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module.

Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the troops}} {{returned}} from France, the British Army began implementing <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from the campaign and re-organizing formations. As part of this, the army's five motor divisions (made up of two brigades) were to be reformed as regular infantry divisions (made up of three brigades). As a result, the 66th Infantry Division was disbanded on 23 June. The 197th Infantry Brigade {{was transferred to the}} 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, the 198th Infantry Brigade went to the 1st London Division, and the 199th Infantry Brigade was assigned to the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division.|$|E

British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.|$|E

A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> in Block I development.|$|E

In early March 1919, after nearly four months in Adenau, the 47th was ordered {{to the area of}} Remagen on the Rhine. On the morning of the move, Middleton had breakfast with General Pershing's aide, Colonel George Marshall, who had come to Adenau the day before to inform Middleton of his regiment's new orders.|$|E

Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited for senior command {{in part because of}} his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{class was}} the fifth of 11 {{separate}} classes planned by the United States Navy between 1906 and 1919, a total of 29 battleships and 6 battlecruisers. Virtually the entire American battle line was being designed from pre-dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs. The design of the New York-class battleship originated in the 1908 Newport Conference, {{which resulted in a}} new method for battleship design, with the General Board taking {{a more active role in}} the design process of ships, and the navy's Board on Construction would implement the design instead of creating it.

5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> {{from a series of}} experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
