The papers were served on Beth Twitty, his former wife, who announced her intention to oppose the petition.

5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples {{would be open to}} constitutional challenge. They also recommended a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> of partnership for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{paternity}} {{of children}} {{born out of}} adultery {{has been seen as}} a major issue. Modern advances such as reliable contraception and paternity testing have changed the situation (in Western countries). Most countries nevertheless have a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> that a woman's husband is the father of her children who were born during that marriage. Although this is often merely a rebuttable presumption, many jurisdictions have laws which restrict the possibility of legal rebuttal (for instance by creating a legal time limit during which paternity may be challengedsuch as a certain number of years from the birth of the child). Establishing correct paternity may have major legal implications, for instance in regard to inheritance.|$|E

Regarding laws of sexuality, religious challenges include masturbation (which may be regarded as “seed wasting”), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation (niddah) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. An additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father’s identity is determined by a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> (chazakah) of legitimacy: rov bi'ot achar ha'baal - a woman's sexual relations {{are assumed to be}} with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father.

In 1998 Brian Dalton was charged with creation and possession of child pornography under an Ohio obscenity law.

60|$|The king, Sir, {{has been}} by the Constitution {{appointed}} sole {{judge of the}} merit for which a pension is to be given. We have a right, undoubtedly, to canvass this, as we have to canvass every act of government. But there is a material difference between an office to be reformed and a pension taken away for demerit. In the former case, no charge is implied against the holder; in the latter, his character is slurred, {{as well as his}} lawful emolument affected. The former process is against the thing; the second, against the person. The pensioner certainly, if he pleases, has a right to stand on his own defence, to plead his possession, and to bottom his title in the competency of the crown to give him what he holds. Possessed and on the defensive as he is, he will not be obliged to prove his special merit, in order to justify the act of legal discretion, now turned into his property, according to his tenure. The very act, he will contend, is a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption,</b> and an implication of his merit. If this be so, from the natural force of all <b>legal</b> <b>presumption,</b> he would put us to the difficult proof that he has no merit at all. But other questions would arise in the course of such an inquiry,--that is, questions of the merit when weighed against the proportion of the reward; then the difficulty will be much greater.|$|E

"My lords, {{this is the}} <b>legal</b> <b>presumption.</b> It would, in addition, be {{easy for}} me to show, in a {{thousand}} facts, that not only the sovereign of Leaphigh, but most other sovereigns, are and ever have been, destitute of the faculty of a memory. It might be said to be incompatible with the royal condition to be possessed of this obtrusive faculty. Were a prince endowed with a memory, he might lose sight of his high estate, in the recollection that he was born, and that he is destined, like another, to die; he might be troubled with visions of the past; nay, the consciousness of his very dignity might be unsettled and weakened by a vivid view of the origin of his royal race. Promises, obligations, attachments, duties, principles, and even debts, might interfere with the due discharge of his sacred trusts, were the sovereign invested with a memory; and it has, therefore, been decided, from time immemorial, that his majesty is utterly without the properties of reason, judgment, and memory, as a legitimate inference from his being destitute of a conscience." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{know that}} over-laboring {{a point of}} this kind has the direct {{contrary}} effect from what we wish. We {{know that there is}} a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> against men, quando se nimis purgitant; and if a charge of ambition is not refuted by an affected humility, certainly the character of fraud and perfidy is still less to be washed away by indications of meanness. Fraud and prevarication are servile vices. They sometimes grow out of the necessities, always out of the habits, of slavish and degenerate spirits; and on the theatre of the world, it is not by assuming the mask of a Davus or a Geta that an actor will obtain credit for manly simplicity and a liberal openness of proceeding. It is an erect countenance, it is a firm adherence to principle, it is a power of resisting false shame and frivolous fear, that assert our good faith and honor, and assure to us the confidence of mankind. Therefore all these negotiations, and all the declarations with which they were preceded and followed, can only serve to raise presumptions against that good faith and public integrity the fame of which to preserve inviolate is so much the interest and duty of every nation.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} make sense of the {{existence}} of such rules and presumptions and their potential with a view to contributing to debates on a more coordinated or structured enforcement of abuse regulation provisions on a global scale. With that purpose, it compares the setup and role of <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> of dominance/monopolisation and of abusive behaviour as benchmarks for antitrust enforcement in both EU and U. S. law. Section two of the paper identifies and distinguishes two different categories of legal techniques (short-cut rules and evidentiary presumptions) facilitating the enforcement of abuse regulation. General policy and case law evolutions allow to infer that both legal systems seemingly attest to a move away from short-cut rules in favour of evidentiary presumptions. In the U. S., the latter kind of presumptions are also even more limited in scope and scale. Section three will summarily address those evolutions in relation to both legal orders. Section four questions to what extent a reliance on different regulatory enforcement techniques in both legal orders could provide fertile ground for convergence amongst EU and U. S. abuse practices and whether the development of effectively converging <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> actually offers a way forward for emerging and more established competition law jurisdictions across the globe. Focus will particularly be put on <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions,</b> as they have become seemingly more important in both legal orders over the past two decades. Peer reviewe...|$|R

[...] "He has done his duty, and it remains {{for you to be}} equally conscientious. You are, in this case, the judges of the law and the fact; but it is a part of my functions to inform you what they both are. By the law, the king is supposed to have no faculties. The inference drawn by counsel, that, not being capable of erring, the king must have the highest possible moral attributes, and consequently a memory, is unsound. The constitution says his majesty CAN do no wrong. This inability may proceed from a variety of causes. If he can do NOTHING, for instance, he can do no wrong. The constitution does not say that the sovereign WILL do no wrong--but, that he CAN do no wrong. Now, gentlemonikins, when a thing cannot be done, it becomes impossible; and it is, of course, beyond the reach of argument. It is of no moment whether a person has a memory, if he cannot use it, and, in such a case, the <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> is, that he is without a memory; for, otherwise, nature, who is ever wise and beneficent, would be throwing away her gifts.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you were}} here last summer," [...] began Prince, leaning forward over his desk, [...] "you brought me a piece of news that astounded me, as it did many others. It was the {{assignment}} of Dr. West's property to Mrs. Saltonstall. That was something there was no gainsaying; it was a purely business affair, and involved nobody's rights but the assignor. But this was followed, {{a day or two}} after, by the announcement of the Doctor's will, making the same lady the absolute and sole inheritor of the same property. That seemed all right too; for there were, apparently, no legal heirs. Since then, however, it has been discovered that there is a legal heir--none other than the Doctor's only son. Now, as no allusion to the son's existence was made in that will--which was a great oversight of the Doctor's--it is a fiction of the law that such an omission is an act of forgetfulness, and therefore leaves the son the same rights as if there had been no will at all. In other words, if the Doctor had seen fit to throw his scapegrace son a hundred dollar bill, it would have been legal evidence that he remembered him. As he did not, it's a fair <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> that he forgot him, or that the will is incomplete." ...|$|E
6000|$|He triumphantly {{showed that}} the branch of the royal immunities that was chiefly {{affected}} by the offence of the prisoner at the bar, was very clearly connected with {{the rights of the}} king's conscience. [...] "The attributes of royalty," [...] observed the sagacious advocate, [...] "are not to be estimated {{in the same manner as}} the attributes of the subject. In the sacred person of the king are centred many, if not most, of the interesting privileges of monikinism. That royal personage, in apolitical sense, can do no wrong: official infallibility is the consequence. Such a being has no occasion for the ordinary faculties of the monikin condition. Of what use, for instance, is a judgment, or a conscience, to a functionary who can do no wrong? The law, in order to relieve one on whose shoulders was imposed the burden of the state, had consequently placed the latter especially in the keeping of another. His majesty's first-cousin is the keeper of his conscience, as is known throughout the realm of Leaphigh. A memory is the faculty of the least account to a personage who has no conscience; and, while it is not contended that the sovereign is relieved from the possession of his memory by any positive statute law, or direct constitutional provision, it follows, by unavoidable implication, and by all legitimate construction, that, having no occasion to possess such a faculty, it is the <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> he is altogether without it.|$|E

60|$|As to {{the fact}} in which these parties are so well agreed, that the {{experiment}} {{ought to have been}} made for the satisfaction of this country, (meaning the country of England,) it were well to be wished that persons of eminence would cease to make themselves representatives of the people of England, without a letter of attorney, or any other act of procuration. In legal construction, the sense of the people of England is to be collected from the House of Commons; and though I do not deny the possibility of an abuse of this trust as well as any other, yet I think, without the most weighty reasons and in the most urgent exigencies, it is highly dangerous to suppose that the House speaks anything contrary to the sense of the people, or that the representative is silent, when the sense of the constituent, strongly, decidedly, and upon long deliberation, speaks audibly upon any topic of moment. If there is a doubt whether the House of Commons represents perfectly the whole commons of Great Britain, (I think there is none,) there can be no question but that the Lords and the Commons together represent the sense of the whole people to the crown and to the world. Thus it is, when we speak legally and constitutionally. In a great measure it is equally true, when we speak prudentially. But I do not pretend to assert that there are no other principles to guide discretion than those which are or can be fixed by some law or some constitution: yet before the legally presumed sense of the people should be superseded by a supposition of one more real, (as in all cases where a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> is to be ascertained,) some strong proofs ought to exist of a contrary disposition in the people at large, and some decisive indications of their desire upon this subject. There can be no question, that, previously to a direct message from the crown, neither House of Parliament did indicate anything like a wish for such advances as we have made or such negotiations as we have carried on. The Parliament has assented to ministry; it is not ministry that has obeyed the impulse of Parliament. The people at large have their organs through which they can speak to Parliament and to the crown by a respectful petition, and though not with absolute authority, yet with weight, they can instruct their representatives. The freeholders and other electors in this kingdom have another and a surer mode of expressing their sentiments concerning the conduct which is held by members of Parliament. In the middle of these transactions this last opportunity has been held out to them. In all these points of view I positively assert that the people have nowhere and in no way expressed their wish of throwing themselves and their sovereign at the feet of a wicked and rancorous foe, to supplicate mercy, which, from the nature of that foe, and from the circumstances of affairs, we had no sort of ground to expect. It is undoubtedly the business of ministers very much to consult the inclinations of the people, but they ought to take great care that they do not receive that inclination from the few persons who may happen to approach them. The petty interests of such gentlemen, their low conceptions of things, their fears arising from the danger to which the very arduous and critical situation of public affairs may expose their places, their apprehensions from the hazards to which the discontents of a few popular men at elections may expose their seats in Parliament,--all these causes trouble and confuse the representations which they make to ministers of the real temper of the nation. If ministers, instead of following the great indications of the Constitution, proceed on such reports, they will take the whispers of a cabal for the voice of the people, and the counsels of imprudent timidity for the wisdom of a nation.|$|E

In this context, the public entity is usually able to demonstrate that it was bargaining in good faith if the offer made was based on an independent appraisal.
