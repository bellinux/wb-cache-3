40|$|<b>Mold</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of {{the colored}} {{plastics}} based on partially crystalline polymers {{is a well-known}} phenomenon and {{is assumed to be}} caused by pigment-induced crystallization of polymers. A systematic investigation has been carried out for a variety of organic pigments in polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (HDPE) systems in order to clarify the correlation between the nucleation effect due to pigments and the <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Special attention was paid to the onset temperature of crystallization for both PP and HDPE systems as monitored by DSC (differential scanning colorimeter). In parallel, the crystallization rate was also studied in the isothermal process by depolarization method for PP while by dilatometry for HDPE systems. As a result, the <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is found to become more significant as the onset temperature is higher and the crystallization rate is faster. This tendency is well correlated with the formation of small spherulites (diameter: less than 1 mum). These results lead us to conclude that the organic pigments in colored plastics serve as a nucleation a-ent for partially crystalline polymers to form small spherulites, causing the <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage</b> to occur.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} work {{it has been}} shown that FEA {{software}} like ANSYS may play an important role in predicting cast defect before the actual casting. Transient thermal analysis and Couple-Field analysis in ANSYS can predict temperature distribution and thermal stress distribution in the casting after solidification very accurately. This fact has been proved by validating a transient thermal analysis which has been published in a reputed journal. After validating the thermal analysis, work has been extended to Couple-Field Analysis for thermal stress and shrinkage. After doing Couple-field analysis on sand mold, few modifications have been simulated and tested whether they are better than the configuration considered in the base paper. As first modification sand has been replaced by mullite and it has been seen that the <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is less but the cast shrinkage is more. Thermal stress in the mullite mold is less than the sand mold. For the sand-mullite composite <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is least as well as shrinkage for the cast is also least.

To examine the effects of species, wood flour derived from four species, ponderosa pine, loblolly pine, maple, and oak, was used as a filler for polypropylene at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 % by weight wood flour.

40|$|Modern {{foundries}} increasingly use chemically-bonded no-bake sand cores and molds {{because they}} provide ease of molding, good surface finish, and collapsibility. One {{of the most popular}} binder systems is oil urethane no-bake comprising three parts: alkyd resin, catalyst, and crosslinking agent. Their amounts and ratios can influence <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> and thereby dimensional quality of the resulting casting. With rising emphasis on net-shape casting, {{there is a need to}} optimize the binder composition to minimize the dimensional errors, while achieving the desired bench life, stripping time and hardness. This work investigates the effect of binder composition on the dimensions of chemically-bonded sand cores (25 mm diameter and 100 mm length) with respect to time. The maximum shrinkage of 0. 15 % over length was observed when resin content was 2. 4 % by weight of sand. The rate of shrinkage was higher with increase in the amount of catalyst. Core hardness and reduction in weight were also measured followed by SEM studies to gain a better understanding of the underlying phenomena, including formation of resin bridges between compacted sand particles and evaporation of solvent.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{experimental and}} theoretical {{study of the}} residual thermal stresses has been carried out. The final stress profiles along the thickness were measured in an amorphous and a semi-crystalline injection molded polymer using the layer removal technique. The two materials exhibited drastically distinct residual profiles. Furthermore, processing parameters such as melt and coolant temperatures, pressure history, and mold thickness were found to modify the profiles. In order to elucidate the findings, two models were derived. The two-dimensional free <b>mold</b> <b>shrinkage</b> model was developed to provide a rapid estimation of thermal stresses and the main features of their profile. A more complex model was developed by integrating the stress analysis with the simulation of the complete injection molding cycle by McKam. This model accounts for the fountain flow effect, the crystallization, and the PVT behavior of the material. With {{the help of the}} model predictions, explanations were provided for the occurrence of various regions in the residual stress profiles. Transitions or reversal of the regions under variable conditions or material properties were observed to be mainly determined by the ratio of the thermal to the pressure effects. Using these concepts, practical conclusions were drawn for controlling the residual stresses. As an alternative for optimization of injection molding with respect to residual stresses, inverse methods were developed to calculate the pressure history or the initial temperature distribution required to produce a prescribed residual stress distribution. These methods were tested using direct solutions with added errors and experimental stress data...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} tasks in designing plastic parts, especially those that are fiber reinforced, is to predict shrinkage and warpage of the <b>molded</b> parts. <b>Shrinkage</b> and warpage result from material inhomogeneities caused by flow induced fiber orientation, curing, poor thermal mold lay-out, and processing conditions. Shrinkage and warpage are directly related to residual stresses which result from locally varying strain fields that occur during the curing or solidification stage of a manufacturing process. This paper presents research conducted in modeling, analysis and process simulation of the thermomechanical behavior of compression molded fiber reinforced composite parts. The theory behind shrinkage and warpage of fiber reinforced composite parts is described first, followed by a description of finite element/finite difference simulation of the thermo-mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced composites during a partâ€™s manufacturing process. A coupled temperature and stress simulation program with a three-noded shell element formulation was developed to calculate the residual stress build-up during curing and solidification stages of a compression molding process.

40|$|Lamellar {{cast iron}} {{is a very}} {{important}} technical alloy and the most used material in the casting production, and especially in the automotive industry which is the major consumer. Beside the many great properties, it is inclined to form casting defects of which some can be prevented, and some may be repaired subsequently. Shrinkage porosity is a randomly returning problem, which is difficult to understand and to avoid. This defect is a volumetric deficiency which appear as cavities inside the casting in connection to the casting surface. Another frequent defect is the metal expansion penetration. This defect is a material surplus squeezed to the casting surface containing sand inclusion from the <b>mold</b> material. <b>Shrinkage</b> porosity is usually mentioned together with metal expansion penetration as the formation mechanism of both defects have common roots. It is also generally agreed, that these type of defects are related to the volumetric changes occurring during solidification. Additionally, the formation of these defects are in connection with the coherency of the primary austenite dendrites. The purpose of this work was to develop knowledge on factors affecting a volume-change related casting defect formation in order to minimize the presence of these defects in engine component production. This was done by extending the existing solidification investigation methods with novel solutions. Introduction of expansion force measurement in the determination of dendrite coherency combined with multi axial volume change measurement refine the interpretation of the solidification. Comparison of registered axial and radial linear deformation in cylindrical samples indicated an anisotropic volume change. Different methods for dendrite coherency determination have been compared. It was shown that the coherency develops over an interval. Dependent on the added inoculant the coherency is reached at different levels of fractions of a solidified primary phase. It is also shown, that inoculation has an effect on the nucleation and growth of the primary phase. Quantitative image analysis has been performed on the primary phase in special designed samples designed to provoke shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration. It was found, that the inter-dendritic space varies within a casting. This was explained by the coarsening of the primary dendrites which originates from differences in the local time of solidification. QC 20131210 </p...|$|R

Dry-blended Zimbabwean graphite composites showed the lowest surface resistivity at all graphite contents, with a surface resistivity of 105 Î©/square at 10 wt% loading. Although rotomolded powders obtained following the melt compounding of Zimbabwean graphite exhibited higher resistivity values, the variability was much lower.
