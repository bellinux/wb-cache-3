This special low-smoke cable is typically referred to as plenum cable or Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH or LS0H) cable. While twisted pair cable for networking and telephone service is the most common form of plenum cable, coaxial cable also needs to be plenum-rated for safety.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} the harmonic disturbances in <b>low-voltage</b> <b>cables</b> feeding large LED loads is reported. A {{frequency domain analysis}} on several commercially-available LEDs was performed to investigate the signature of the harmonic current injected into the power system. Four-core cables and four single-core cable arrangements (three phases and neutral) of small, medium, and large conductor cross sections, with the neutral conductor cross section approximately equal to the half of the phase conductors, were examined. The cables were modelled by using electromagnetic finite-element analysis software. High harmonic power losses (up to 2. 5 times the value corresponding to an undistorted current of the same rms value of the first harmonic of the LED current) were found. A generalized ampacity model was employed for re-rating the cables. It {{was found that the}} cross section of the neutral conductor {{plays an important role in}} the derating of the cable ampacity due to the presence of a high-level of triplen harmonics in the distorted current. The ampacity of the cables should be derated by about 40 %, almost independent of the conductor cross sections. The calculation have shown that an incoming widespread use of LED lamps in lighting could create significant additional harmonic losses in the supplying low-voltage lines, and thus more severely harmonic emission limits should be defined for LED lamps...|$|R

The modulated voltage level at the output of the PRT can then be injected into the optical fiber via the usual type of transmitter.

In each PLC network cluster, one base station is designed to serve all the connected subscribers, which share the same channel to access the network. The access to the network {{is controlled by the}} scheduler implemented in the base station. This scheduler has to allocate the available resources to the users requiring a connection {{in the form of an}} allocation table. This allocation table has to take into account which kind of service is requested to provide the resources to the subscribers in accordance with the QoS requirements. In addition, the scheduler has to operate in real time. This task is especially important when the network capacity is not enough to fulfill the requirements from all the users. Therefore, the performance of the network strongly depends on scheduling strategy used to do the bandwidth allocation and the connection management. In this thesis, the strategies for scheduling based on the evaluation of the benefit of the solutions are studied. An Evolutionary Algorithm, NSGA-II, is used to maximize two confronted objectives, benefit and fairness, managing the constrained network capacity.

40|$|Micro-generations {{and future}} grid usages, such as {{charging}} of electric cars, raises major challenges {{to monitor the}} electric load in <b>low-voltage</b> <b>cables.</b> Due to the highly interconnected nature, real-time measurements are problematic, both economically and technically. This entails an overload risk in electricity networks when cables must be disconnected for maintenance reasons or are accidentally damaged. Therefore, it is of great interest for electricity grid providers to anticipate the load in networks and quicker detect failures. However, computing the electric load in cables requires computational intensive power flow calculations and live consumption measurements. Today’s view of the grid is usually based on on-field documentation of cables, fuses, and measurements by technicians and therefore often outdated. Thus, the electric load is usually only simulated in case of major topology variations. However, live measurements of smart meters provide new opportunities. In this paper we present a novel approach for a near real-time electric load approximation by deriving in live the current electric topology and cable loads from smart meter data. We leverage the models@run. time paradigm to combine live measurements with topology characteristics of the grid. Our approach enables to approximate the load in cables, {{not only for the}} current grid topology, but also to simulate topology changes for maintenance purposes. We showed that this allows a near real-time approximation while remaining very accurate (average deviation of 1. 89 % compared to offline power-flow calculation tools). Developed with a grid operator, this approach will be integrated in a monitoring and warning system and as an embeddable solution for on-field simulation...|$|R

40|$|Communications play a {{key role}} in modern smart grids. New {{functionalities}} that make the grids ‘smart’ require the communication network to function properly. Data transmission between intelligent electric devices (IEDs) in the rectifier and the customer-end inverters (CEIs) used for power conversion is also required in the smart grid concept of the low-voltage direct current (LVDC) distribution network. Smart grid applications, such as smart metering, demand side management (DSM), and grid protection applied with communications are all installed in the LVDC system. Thus, besides remote connection to the databases of the grid operators, a local communication network in the LVDC network is needed. One solution applied to implement the communication medium in power distribution grids is power line communication (PLC). There are power cables in the distribution grids, and hence, they may be applied as a communication channel for the distribution-level data. This doctoral thesis proposes an IP-based high-frequency (HF) band PLC data transmission concept for the LVDC network. A general method to implement the Ethernet-based PLC concept between the public distribution rectifier and the customerend inverters in the LVDC grid is introduced. <b>Low-voltage</b> <b>cables</b> are studied as the communication channel in the frequency band of 100 kHz– 30 MHz.

The channel noise is also studied by measurements. Theoretical signalto- noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity analyses and practical data transmission tests are carried out to evaluate the applicability of the PLC concept against the requirements set by the smart grid applications in the LVDC system. The main results concerning the applicability of the PLC concept and its limitations are presented, and suggestion for future research proposed...|$|R

The network is organized according to the actual available infrastructure of the electrical power lines. The whole B-PLC network can be organized as a multicell system. Each B-PLC cell contains a base station providing access to all subscribers and connected itself to the backbone network. Each cell requires an amount of transmission capacity for serving its subscribers. The transmission in a cell may crease interference to the others; therefore some of them cannot utilize the same frequency or time slot at the same time. Because the bandwidth requirements from each cell are dynamically changed, e. g. users turn on or off, {{it is necessary to}} propose and apply dynamic bandwidth management mechanisms to organize the limited bandwidth between multiple B-PLC cells.

40|$|Due to the {{widespread}} use of electronic power converters, <b>low-voltage</b> high-frequency <b>cable</b> models are being increasingly applied in industry, automobile or aeronautics applications among others. It is known that depending on switching frequency, cable configuration and length, transient overvoltage effects comprising a wide frequency range from dc up to several tens of MHz can appear. However, to accurately reproduce the wide-band frequency response, such models often require the use of ladder networks, thus being necessary to adjust the values of a relatively large number of R, L and C components, which is a complex task. This paper is focused to solve this problem, which is done by applying an iterative genetic algorithm (IGA) optimization approach. From a set of experimental short circuit and open circuit tests the high-frequency cable model of a given cable configuration is obtained, whose parameters are fitted by means of the proposed IGA-based method.

40|$|Electric cables are passive {{components}} used extensively throughout nuclear power stations to perform numerous safety and non-safety functions. It {{is known that}} the polymers commonly used to insulate the conductors on these cables can degrade with time; the rate of degradation being dependent on {{the severity of the}} conditions in which the cables operate. Cables do not receive routine maintenance and, since it can be very costly, they are not replaced on a regular basis. Therefore, to ensure their continued functional performance, it would be beneficial if condition monitoring techniques could be used to estimate the remaining useful life of these components.

Inside the containment area, cables operate in harsh environments, characterized by relatively high temperature and gamma-irradiation. As these cables are related to fundamental safety systems, they {{must be able to}} withstand unexpected accident conditions and, therefore, their condition assessment is of utmost importance as plants age and lifetime extensions are required. Nowadays, the integrity and functionality of these cables are monitored mainly through destructive test which requires specific laboratory. The investigation of electrical aging markers which can provide information {{about the state of the}} cable by non-destructive testing methods would improve significantly the present diagnostic techniques. This work has been made within the framework of the ADVANCE (Aging Diagnostic and Prognostics of <b>Low-Voltage</b> I&C <b>Cables)</b> project, a FP 7 European program. This Ph. D. thesis aims at studying the impact of aging on cable electrical parameters, in order to understand the evolution of the electrical properties associated with cable degradation. The identification of suitable aging markers requires the comparison of the electrical property variation with the physical/chemical degradation mechanisms of polymers for different insulating materials and compositions. The feasibility of non-destructive electrical condition monitoring techniques as potential substitutes for destructive methods will be finally discussed studying the correlation between electrical and mechanical properties. In this work, the electrical properties of cable insulators are monitored and characterized mainly by dielectric spectroscopy, polarization/depolarization current analysis and space charge distribution. Among these techniques, dielectric spectroscopy showed the most promising results; by means of dielectric spectroscopy it is possible to identify the frequency range where the properties are more sensitive to aging. In particular, the imaginary part of permittivity at high frequency, which is related to oxidation, has been identified as the most suitable aging marker based on electrical quantities. ...|$|R
