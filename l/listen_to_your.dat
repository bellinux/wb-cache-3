500|$|In {{response}} to Donald Trump's candidacy, Pussy Riot released {{the song and}} video [...] "" [...] in October 2016. The video depicts a dystopian world where Trump, played {{by one of the}} band members, is the president. Trump enforces his values through beatings, shaming, and branding of victims delivered by stormtroopers. As the thugs torture their victims, Pussy Riot sings the following lyrics: [...] "Let other people in/ <b>Listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> women/ Stop killing black children/ Make America great again". [...] "Make America Great Again" [...] appears on the album xxx. Jonas Akerlund directed this video.|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of these defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir men payset de conserver mon honneur, por écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E

News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E

Feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, the spokeswoman of the National Organization for Women (NOW), angrily called for Madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting the opposite point of view. Alfred Moran, {{the executive director of}} Planned Parenthood of New York City, also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy. Recalling how his agency's clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of Madonna's style, Moran said that the song's message is [...] "that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise—don't preach to me, Papa.

[...] Taylor ended the review with positive feedback for Madonna's vocals, likening them to those for the Evita album, along with commending the chorus. In a different article for Billboard talking about the song's remixes, Paoletta described the track as [...] "effervescent blast of psychedelic electronica". Writing for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Gino DeLa Paz found it [...] "cute but forgettable". Gwen Ihnat, from the entertainment website The A.V. Club, labeled it as [...] "Madonna's best song that never appeared {{on one of her}} regular albums [...] a psychedelic pop confection that offered a few of her most indelible hooks". Ihnat also wrote that [...] "although less ethereal than 1998's Ray of Light, [...] is just as dance-floor ready [...] dance flute has never sounded so enticing, and Madonna's voice so sweetly seductive". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis listed the track [...] "as one of the singer's more memorable moments, coupling 1960s go-go rock with 1990s electronica, resulting in nothing less than a true slice of old fashioned rock & roll"; Promis also praised the two Calderone mixes.|$|E

[...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So do the best you can, <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> favorite band, bury your head in the sand, before it all begins again.

Los Angeles Times music critic Enrique Lopetegui wrote that the album is [...] "basically {{a continuation of the}} singer's favorite turf - ... woman-melting ballads."

The power ballads in the album are [...] "Que Tú Te Vas", [...] "Abrázame", [...] "Un Día Más", and the title track.

500|$|Following the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787, a {{fatigued}} Washington {{returned to}} his estate, Mount Vernon. He seemed intent on resuming his retirement and letting others govern the nation with its new frame of government. The American public at large, however, wanted no one but Washington to be the nation's first president. The first U.S. presidential campaign was in essence what today would be called a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. Letters poured into Mount Vernon informing him of public sentiment and imploring him to accept; [...] from former comrades in arms, and from across the Atlantic. Gouverneur Morris urged Washington to accept, writing [...] " [...] thirteen horses now about to be coupled together, {{there are some of}} every race and character.

[...] Alexander Hamilton {{was one of the most}} dedicated in his efforts to get Washington to accept the presidency, as he foresaw himself receiving a powerful position in the administration. The comte de Rochambeau urged Washington to accept, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, who exhorted Washington to [...] "not to deny your acceptance of the office of President for the first years." [...] Washington replied [...] "Let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame, who have a keener relish for them, or who may have more years, in store, for the enjoyment."

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants.
