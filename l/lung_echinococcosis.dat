40|$|Goal of research: to {{evaluate}} efficiency of videothoracoscopy in {{diagnosis and treatment}} of patients with injuries and emergency diseases ща chest organs. Material and methods: Study wasbased on treatment results analysis of 2111 patients with injuries and chest organs emergency diseases, who were treated at Republican Research Centre of Emergency Medicine in 2001 - 2014. Chest trauma made up 1396 (66, 1 %) victims. There were 477 (22, 6 %) patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. At the stages of initial diagnosis, the radiologic evaluations, CT investigations and videothoracoscopies were performed. In chest trauma patients the videothoracoscopy underwent in 844 cases, in spontaneous pneu# mothorax this method was employed in 290 patients. Complicated forms of <b>lung</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> were observed in  238 (11, 3 %) patients and complicated forms of <b>lung</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> were evident in 72 patients. Results. Videothoracoscopy and video-assisted interventions allowed to eliminate lungs and pleura pathology in 1206 (57, 1 %) patients, whereas the traditional methods were effective only in 905 cases (42, 9 %). Conclusions. Investigation methods such as multiplanar radioscopy, radiography, chest CT and videothora-coscopy must be included into algorithm of diagnosis and surgical treatment of chest injuries and emergency diseases of chest organs. At chest trauma the videothoracoscopy allows to avoid broad thoracotomy from 9, 4 % to 4, 7 % of cases, to reduce the frequency of repeated interventions from 17, 4 % to 0, 5 % and diminish a number of early postsurgery complications from 25, 4 % to 10, 9 %. Videothoracoscopy of chest traumas allows to reduce frequency of repeated interventions from 19, 8 to 1, 7 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{persistence}} {{and levels of}} antibodies in 280 patients at different intervals following surgery for echinococcosis are described. Post-operative antibody levels were investigated by means of four immunodiagnostic methods, namely, the complement fixation, latex agglutination, indirect haemagglutination, and intradermal tests. After surgical removal of the cysts the tests became negative in some patients, whereas in others they remained positive for many years. As the post-operative period increased, the percentage of positive results fell and this fall was faster in <b>lung</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> than in liver echinococcosis. The titres obtained with the serological tests decreased {{at the same rate}} as the percentage of positive results, but the intradermal test remained positive, with an unchanged titre, for many years. In the case of secondary echinococcosis, medium and high titres predominated in all the tests. These immunological investigations during the post-operative period make it possible to evaluate the results of surgery and, to some extent, to clarify the prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Hydatid cysts {{are usually}} {{located in the}} liver and <b>lungs.</b> Skeletal <b>echinococcosis</b> is {{relatively}} rare {{and that of the}} rib is exceptional. Less than 50 cases of costal echinococcosis {{have been reported in the}} literature so far. To our knowledge, only one case report of thoracic outlet syndrome due to echinococcal cyst in the first rib was described in 1995. Accurate pre-operative diagnosis is important but may be challenging in some cases. Reported here is a case of echinococcosis of the first rib in a young adult who was presented with thoracic outlet syndrome. Plain chest radiograph, CT scan and MRI were performed. The imaging features were suggestive of a solitary aneurysmal bone cyst and the differential diagnosis included echinococcosis of the first rib. The lesion was completely resected and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of echinococcosis...|$|R
40|$|The fox {{tapeworm}} Echinococcus multilocularis causes human alveolar echinococcosis, commonly affecting the liver. However, in ∼ 1 % of cases, systematic {{spread of the}} disease involves the brain as well. A patient had a 6 -year history of liver and <b>lung</b> alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> that was considered not suitable for surgery, and treatment with albendazole was introduced. After the appearance of neurologic disturbances, an intracranial mass lesion was demonstrated by radiologic imaging. The lesion was surgically removed, and histologic analysis revealed metacestode tissue of E. multilocularis. Despite the surgical resection of the lesion, the patient died of progression of systemic alveolar echinococcosis. The authors highly recommend implementing neurologic monitoring to the follow-up algorithm for patients with systemically disseminated alveolar echinococcosis. When neurologic symptoms occur, radiologic imaging of the brain should be obtained immediately. Surgery should be considered for all intracranial echinococcal lesions, unless the lesion is located in the eloquent brain area...|$|R
40|$|Pancoast {{syndrome}} {{remains a}} rare presentation of pulmonary diseases. Even in endemic area of <b>echinococcosis,</b> <b>lung's</b> hydatid cyst is seldomly revealed by this syndrome. We report {{a case of}} a 38 year old male patient who presented to our department with neck and left superior limb pain associated with palmar muscle atrophy and Horner's syndrome. Radiological investigations suggested the diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the left lung apex which was confirmed by surgical excision and pathological examination of the lesion. This case highlights an uncommon etiology of Pancoast syndrome which might mislead physicians in their practice...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: The {{most common}} {{parasitic}} <b>lung</b> disease is <b>echinococcosis,</b> and usually young male patients suffer from this disease. Lung involvement {{is more common}} in children, and {{it is important to consider}} this involvement as a diagnosis. Anesthesia and surgical management are always challenging for both Anesthesiologist and surgeon.   Case: In this case we report successful anesthetic and surgical management of a giant hydatid cyst in the lung of an eight-year-old boy. Conclusion: Successful anesthetic management during hydatid cyst surgery of lung in pediatrics using cuffed endobronchial tube is possible if the anesthesiologist and the surgeon are swift, well-coordinated, and synchronized...|$|R
