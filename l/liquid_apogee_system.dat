50|$|The BT-4 is a {{pressure-fed}} liquid {{rocket engine}} designed and manufactured by IHI Aerospace of Japan.

Two other Orbital ATK products that use the BT-4 due to their leverage of the GEOStar-2 platform are the Cygnus spacecraft and the Antares Bi-propellant Third Stage (BTS).|$|R
50|$|On February 22, 1990 at 23:19 UTC, Superbird-2 launch {{failed and}} the {{satellite}} was lost. Thus, Superbird-B1 was rushed and delivered in just 19 months. On February 26, 1992 at 23:58:10 UTC Superbird-B1, the fourth private communications satellite of Japan to orbit, was launched aboard an Ariane 44L along Arabsat-1C.

The 702MP was designed for satellites in the middle-level power ranges, supporting payloads ranging from 6 to 12 kilowatts.

5000|$|The {{satellite}} vehicle's <b>Liquid</b> <b>Apogee</b> Engine (LAE) {{provided by}} IHI failed {{to raise the}} orbit after two attempts. To solve the problem, the perigee altitude was raised to 4700 km (2900 miles) with twelve firings of the smaller Aerojet-provided Reaction Engine Assembly thrusters, originally intended for attitude control during the LAE engine burns. [...] From this altitude, the solar arrays were deployed and the orbit was raised toward the operational orbit {{over the course of}} nine months using the 0.27 Newton Hall thrusters, also provided by Aerojet, a form of electric propulsion which is highly efficient, but low thrust. This took much longer than initially intended due to the lower starting altitude for the HCT maneuvers. This led to program delays, as the second and third satellite vehicle LAEs were analyzed. The investigation into the propulsion anomaly has been completed (but not publicly released [...] ) and the remaining satellites were declared flight ready. A Government Accounting Office report released in July 2011 stated that the blocked fuel line in the <b>Liquid</b> <b>Apogee</b> Engine was most likely caused by a piece of cloth inadvertently left in the line during the manufacturing process.|$|R

On a XIPS equipped 702 satellite, four 25 cm thrusters provide economical station keeping, needing only 5 kg of fuel per year, [...] "a fraction of what bipropellant or arcjet systems consume". An XIPS-equipped satellite {{can be used for}} final orbit insertion, conserving even more payload mass, as compared to using a traditional on-board <b>liquid</b> <b>apogee</b> engine.|$|R

5000|$|The Yuanzheng-1 (YZ-1) (...) is a restartable rocket {{upper stage}} {{developed}} by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) used as a fourth stage to enable the Long March 3B and Long March 3C launch vehicles to deploy payloads directly to high energy orbits like medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary orbit (GSO). Since the Long March third stage cannot restart, it cannot circularize a GSO orbit from a geostationary transfer orbit. The YZ-1 was designed for restart capability, and to remain operational for more than 6 hours required to reach the transfer orbit apogee for the circularization burn.
