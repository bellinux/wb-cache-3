40|$|In {{experiments}} with single-layer plasma crystals, one often observes extra particles {{outside of the}} main layer after injecting particles into plasma. Those particles, which can be agglomerates or contaminations, sometimes move at a high speed, disturb the lattice, and create wave patterns in it. When the extra particle speed {{is higher than the}} sound speed of the lattice, the disturbance forms a Mach cone. The Mach cones and wakes associated with extra particles moving beneath the <b>lattice</b> <b>layer</b> (downstream of the flow of ions) were well studied in the past decade. In the present work, we study {{for the first time the}} interaction of a single-layer plasma crystal with charged extra particles located above it (upstream of the flow of ions). Upstream extra particles tend to move between the rows of particles in the crystal, accelerate to supersonic speeds, and excite attraction-dominated Mach cones and wakes in the crystal. We attribute the particle - <b>lattice</b> <b>layer</b> attraction to the ion wake formed underneath the upstream extra particle...|$|E

We show that the Kondo effect does not only change the density of states of the f-electron layers, but is also the cause of pronounced resonances at the Fermi energy in the density of states of the non-interacting layers in the superlattice, which are between the f-electron layers. Remarkably, these resonances strongly depend on the structure of the superlattice; due to interference, the density of states at the Fermi energy can be strongly enhanced or even shows no changes at all. Furthermore, we show that by inserting the Kondo <b>lattice</b> <b>layer</b> into a three-dimensional (3 D) metal, the gap of the Kondo insulating state changes from a full gap to a pseudo gap with quadratically vanishing spectral weight around the Fermi energy.
