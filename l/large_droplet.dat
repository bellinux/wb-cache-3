In the present study, we investigate the effect of size differences between suspended components on the segregation behavior, by a two-dimensional numerical simulation for binary dispersed suspensions of fluid droplets of two different sizes subjected to a plane Poiseuille channel flow. The small and <b>large</b> <b>droplets</b> are assumed to have equal surface tensions and equal viscosity ratios of internal to external fluids. The time evolutions of the lateral positions of <b>large</b> and small <b>droplets</b> relative to the channel centerline were computed by changing the area fraction of the small droplets in a mixture with a constant total area fraction. The <b>large</b> <b>droplets</b> are found to migrate closer to the channel centerline and the small droplets are found to migrate closer to the channel wall compared to the corresponding lateral positions in mono-dispersed suspensions at the same area fractions, although the mean lateral positions of the <b>large</b> and small <b>droplets</b> in mono-dispersed suspension are comparable. This segregation behavior as well as the margination of small droplets are enhanced when the size difference between <b>large</b> and small <b>droplets</b> is increased and the area fraction of <b>large</b> <b>droplets</b> is increased. These results may arise from higher tendencies for the <b>large</b> <b>droplets</b> to approach the channel centerline compared to the small droplets, which consequently expel small droplets from the central region toward the channel walls...|$|R

5000|$|Chemical {{separation}} on the microscale {{can be used}} in both {{biological and}} chemical analysis. As an analytical tool, a chemical separation technique, like HPLC, can be coupled to a microfluidic device. Droplet-based microfluidic devices coupled to HPLC have high detection sensitivity, use low volumes of reagents, have short analysis times, and minimal cross-contamination of analytes, which make them efficient in many aspects. One basic use of HPLC in droplet-based microfluidics is chemical separation by HPLC, which is then connected to a device that creates microliter sized droplets of each eluted compound. With this system, it is possible to create <b>large</b> <b>droplet</b> libraries of different compounds in a centralized location. [...] However, there are problems associated with microscale chromatography, like HPLC. These problems include dispersion of separated bands, diffusion, and “dead volume” in channels after separation. One way to bypass these issues is the use of droplets to compartmentalize separation bands, which combats diffusion and the loss of separated analytes. An advantage to using HPLC coupled to a microfluidic device is that more than one separation can be coupled. For example, 2D separation (two-dimensional chromatography) is possible with these devices (i.e. HPLC x LC, LC x LC, and HPLC x HPLC).|$|E

This study was intended to: (1) document the existing capability of the IRT to produce a <b>large</b> <b>droplet</b> icing cloud, and (2) study the effect of various parameters on <b>large</b> <b>droplet</b> ice accretions. Results are presented from a study of the IRT's capability to produce large droplets with MVD of 99 and 160 microns. The effect of the initial water droplet temperature on the resultant ice accretion was studied for different initial spray bar air and water temperatures. The initial spray bar water temperature was found to have no discernible effect upon the <b>large</b> <b>droplet</b> ice accretions. Also, analytical and experimental results suggest that the water droplet temperature is very nearly the same as the tunnel ambient temperature, thus providing a realistic simulation of the <b>large</b> <b>droplet</b> natural icing condition. The effect of temperature, droplet size, airspeed, angle-of attack, flap setting and de-icer boot cycling time on ice accretion was studied, and will be discussed in this report. It was found that, in almost all of the cases studied, an ice ridge formed immediately aft of the active portion of the de-icer boot.

The silicon MCE chips consisted of numerous asymmetric through holes with a characteristic cross-sectional size of 20 μm to 50 μm, each consisting of a microslot and a circular microchannel (MC).

The detachment behavior of the <b>large</b> <b>droplets</b> generated from the asymmetric through holes was analyzed and discussed based on results obtained by real-time optical microscopy.
