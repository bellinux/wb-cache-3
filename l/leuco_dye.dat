50|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{oxidation}} being triggered during manufacture of the discs, {{and in order to}} avoid the need for operating in inert atmosphere, the leuco dyes are further chemically modified to their blocked forms. Such blocked leuco dyes are the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> precursors that form the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> by a slow, controlled chemical reaction. Leucomethylene blue can be reacted with triisopropylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, forming triisopropylsilyloxycarbonylleucomethylene blue (TIPSOCLMB), which is stable in presence of air oxygen. In presence of nucleophile reagents, e.g. water, the blocked <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> compound undergoes hydrolysis, releasing the unblocked <b>leuco</b> <b>dye.</b> This reaction is slow (several days to a week), and the hydrolytic compound is supplied either as atmospheric moisture, or in the formulation of the resin.|$|E
50|$|An {{application}} of leuco dyes {{is in the}} Duracell battery state indicators. A layer of a <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> is applied on a resistive strip to indicate its heating, thus gauging the amount of current the battery is able to supply. The strip is triangular-shaped, changing its resistance along its length, therefore heating up a proportionally long segment {{with the amount of}} current flowing through it. The length of the segment above the threshold temperature for the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> then becomes colored.|$|E

50|$|The {{two common}} {{approaches}} {{are based on}} liquid crystals and <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes.</b> Liquid crystals are used in precision applications, as their responses can be engineered to accurate temperatures, but their color range is limited by their principle of operation. <b>Leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> allow wider range of colors to be used, but their response temperatures {{are more difficult to}} set with accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Four {{different}} types of imaging chemicals are used in thermally sensitive papers: <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes,</b> developers, sensitizers and stabilizers.|$|R
50|$|The {{reactive}} layer {{contains a}} polymer resin {{that acts as}} a carrier for a suitable <b>leuco</b> <b>dye,</b> which, upon contact with atmospheric oxygen, oxidizes to form an opaque or semi-opaque material.|$|E
50|$|Crystal violet lactone (CVL) is a <b>leuco</b> <b>dye,</b> a lactone {{derivate}} {{of crystal}} violet 10B. In pure state it is a slightly yellowish crystalline powder, soluble in nonpolar or slightly polar organic solvents.|$|E

50|$|Spiro {{forms of}} lactones and oxazines are {{frequently}} used as <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes,</b> frequently displaying chromism—reversible structural change between forms {{giving rise to}} colorless and colored appearances, especially in solution.|$|R
50|$|Substances {{that can}} change color due {{to a change in}} {{temperature}} are called thermochromes. There are two types of thermochromes: liquid crystals (used in mood rings) and <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> (used in Hypercolor T-shirts).|$|R
50|$|Thermochromic inks or dyes are {{temperature}} sensitive compounds, {{developed in}} the 1970s, that temporarily change color with exposure to heat. They come in two forms, liquid crystals and <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes.</b> <b>Leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> are easier {{to work with and}} allow for a greater range of applications. These applications include: flat thermometers, battery testers, clothing, and the indicator on bottles of maple syrup that change color when the syrup is warm. The thermometers are often used on the exterior of aquariums, or to obtain a body temperature via the forehead. Coors Light uses thermochromic ink on its cans now, changing from white to blue to indicate the can is cold.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} timing can {{be further}} controlled by addition of other substances. As the diffusion rate of oxygen through the polymer layer {{is more or less}} constant, a supply of suitable antioxidants (e.g. organometallic compounds) which react with the oxygen preferentially to the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> leads to gradual depletion of the antioxidant compound. Only after the antioxidant is consumed, the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> starts being oxidized, achieving the period of delay of the reaction onset, followed by a rapid reflectivity degradation. Stannous ethylhexanoate can be used here as the antioxidant organometallic. Various resin-soluble tin(II) and iron(II) compounds can be used, e.g. chelates and fatty acid salts. Other usable compounds are e.g. hydroquinones, alkylhydroxylamines, dithionates, reducing saccharides (e.g. glucose), α-hydroxyketones (e.g., hydroxyacetone), substituted boron hydrides and silicon hydrides.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the first}} dye used in {{carbonless}} copy papers, {{and it is still}} widely used in this application. It is also the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> component in some thermochromic dyes, e.g. in the Hypercolor line of clothing. One of its novel uses is a security marker for fuels.|$|E
50|$|The {{rate of the}} deblocked <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> {{oxidation}} {{is dependent}} on the pH of the resin polymer matrix. By adding basic compounds (e.g. 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2 octane (DABCO), or other amines), the pH is increased, and the reaction rate increases correspondingly. Correspondingly, by adding strong protic acids (e.g. camphorsulfonic acid), the reaction rate can be decreased and the lifetime of the disc prolonged.|$|E
50|$|The colored bubble {{solution}} uses special <b>dyes</b> called <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes.</b> For instance, the purple bubble uses a chemical called crystal violet lactone. After the bubble pops, the colored splatter disappears with friction, water or exposure to air.|$|R
50|$|Exposure to {{ultraviolet}} radiation, solvents {{and high}} temperatures reduce the lifespan of <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes.</b> Temperatures above about 200 - 230 C typically cause irreversible damage to leuco dyes; a time-limited exposure of some types to about 250 C is allowed during manufacturing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> {{are used}} in {{applications}} where temperature response accuracy is not critical: e.g. novelties, bath toys, flying discs, and approximate temperature indicators for microwave-heated foods. Microencapsulation allows their use in wide range of materials and products. The size of the microcapsules typically ranges between 3-5 µm (over 10 times larger than regular pigment particles), which requires some adjustments to printing and manufacturing processes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> (from the Greek leukos: white [...] ) is a dye {{which can}} switch between two {{chemical}} forms; {{one of which}} is colorless. Reversible transformations can be caused by heat, light or pH; resulting in examples of thermochromism, photochromism and halochromism respectively. Irreversible transformation typically involve reduction or oxidation. The colorless form is sometimes referred to as the leuco form.|$|E

An applicator, such as a felt pen, uses a composition containing a clear <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> that is developed by color-triggering compounds in the paper substrate.|$|E
50|$|Some of the dyes {{used are}} {{methylene}} blue, prussian blue, brilliant cresyl blue, Toluidine Blue O, Basic Blue 3, Methylene Green, Taylor's Blue, Janus Green B, Meldola's Blue, Thionin, Nile Blue, and Celestine Blue. The <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> is prepared by chemical reduction using a suitable reducing agent. The method commercially used by Flexplay and SpectraDisc employs methylene blue reduced by sodium dithionite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leuco</b> <b>dyes,</b> in general, provide little color when melted {{unless they}} are melted in {{conjunction}} {{with one or more}} organic acids. Examples of organic acids suitable for thermochromic papers are phenols such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and Bisphenol S (BPS). Other suitable acidic materials are sulfonyl ureas such as BTUM and Pergafast 201. Zinc salts of substituted salicylic acids, such as zinc di-tert-butylsalicylate have also been commercially used as developers.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{reaction}} of solutions of the <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> crystal violet lactone and N-benzoyl leuco methylene blue with acid-treated montmarillonite (as occurs with carbonless copying papers), most of the offered ye is intercalated within the interlayers of the montmorillonite structure remaining after acid attack. This phenomenon was demonstrated by XRD and also by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. During acid treatment, octahedral cations are dissolved from exposed edges of the montmorillonite lamellae and amorphous ilica builds up in these areas. As a result, the BET(N 2) specific surface area increases from ~ 60 mZ/g to ~ 300 mZ/g and, consequently, the theoretical reactivity towards <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes.</b> Nevertheless, only small quantities of the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the amorphous ilica. The excellent colour intensity and, in particular, the resistance to fading {{in the light of}} the montmorillonite dye complexes may be explained by the protected position of the dye molecules within the interlayers of the montmorillonite. Montmoril lonite is capable of intercalating organic molecules between its unit layers (Fahn, 1963) and such compounds with long-chain quaternary alkyl ammonium ions have attained much importance in the paint industry as thixotropic and thickening agents (Fahn & Buckl, 1968). Reactions of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite are also becoming important in their capacity as colour developers in the acceptor sheet of carbonless copying papers (von Raven & Fended, 1980; Fenderl &von Raven, 1982). The present paper describes the results of an investigation into {{the reaction}}s of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite to form light-resistant stable complexes. Particular aspects examined were the amount of dye uptake as a function of time, and the physical and chemical changes occurring in the acid-activated montmoril lonite as a result of dye adsorption...|$|R
50|$|The {{paper is}} {{impregnated}} with a solid-state mixture of a dye and a suitable matrix; {{a combination of}} a fluoran <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> and an octadecylphosphonic acid is an example. When the matrix is heated above its melting point, the dye reacts with the acid, shifts to its colored form, and the changed form is then conserved in metastable state when the matrix solidifies back quickly enough (a process known as thermochromism).|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} a <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> is the crystal violet lactone, which in its lactone form is colorless or {{slightly}} yellowish, but in low pH, when it is protonated, it becomes intensely violet. Other examples are phenolphthalein and thymolphthalein, colorless in acidic to neutral pH, but becoming pink and blue in alkaline environment. Other example are many redox indicators, which undergo reversible color change between colored and colorless form at a specific electrode potential.|$|E
50|$|The {{residual}} oxygen {{can be removed}} from the substrates used for disc manufacture by storing them under vacuum or oxygen free atmosphere (e.g. pure nitrogen) {{for a period of time}} (hours to days). Alternatively, an oxygen scavenger (e.g. iron(II) salts, tin(II) salts, or organometallic compounds) can be added to the polymer formulation, reacting with the oxygen present in the polymer matrix in shorter timeframe than the hydrolysis of the blocked <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> takes.|$|E
50|$|Thermochromic dyes {{are based}} on {{mixtures}} of <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> with suitable other chemicals, displaying a color change (usually between the colorless leuco form and the colored form) in dependence on temperature. The dyes are rarely applied on materials directly; they are usually {{in the form of}} microcapsules with the mixture sealed inside. An illustrative example is the Hypercolor fashion, where microcapsules with crystal violet lactone, weak acid, and a dissociable salt dissolved in dodecanol are applied to the fabric; when the solvent is solid, the dye exists in its lactone leuco form, while when the solvent melts, the salt dissociates, the pH inside the microcapsule lowers, the dye becomes protonated, its lactone ring opens, and its absorption spectrum shifts drastically, therefore it becomes deeply violet. In this case the apparent thermochromism is in fact halochromism.|$|R
40|$|Identification of viable vat dye {{candidates}} of a trichromatic series (compatible red, {{yellow and}} blue colorants) plus an orange {{based on the}} developed single-stage acid <b>leuco</b> vat <b>dyeing</b> process for unmodified polypropylene (PP) flat woven fabrics has been achieved with adequate fastness properties to washing, crocking and dry-cleaning: C. I. Vats Orange 1, Yellow 2 and Red 1 have been certified, whereas Vat Blue 6 is a marginal candidate. Vat Blue 1 has been demonstrated {{to be a viable}} colorant for dyeing of PP fiber as a single colorant. Molecular dynamics simulation and solubility parameter (SP) approaches have been utilized to screen the potential vat dye candidates for generic PP coloration. Experimental K/S results have exhibited good correlation with the predicted mixing energy of acid leuco vat dyes-PP fiber and the calculated dyes' SP's. The low SP/mixing energy acid <b>leuco</b> vat <b>dyes</b> (e. g., C. I. Vat Red 1) have shown better color-yield/fastness properties than the high SP/mixing energy vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Brown 1), exhibiting that increasing difference of SP between the vat dye and the PP fiber, coupled with a higher mixing energy of dye-PP blend, resulted in decreased interactions between the two. For example, C. I. Vat Brown 1 with its high SP and calculated mixing energy with PP gave least color yield than the certified vat dyes, all with lower SP's and mixing energies. Cross-section micrographs of the dyed fibers revealed the absence of "ring-dyeing". Experimentally determined kinetic parameters such as affinity of dyeing and heat of dyeing quantified the presence of interaction between acid <b>leuco</b> vat <b>dyes</b> and PP fiber. Tensile test and X-ray crystallinity results have confirmed that dyeing process did not alter the tensile strength and modulus of the dyed PP textiles significantly. PP Fabrics dyed with simulated continuous dyeing processes (pad-steam and pad-dry heat) demonstrated good color yields and levelness with adequate fastness to crocking, washing and dry cleaning. Ph.

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} how {{the design process}} used by a textile printmaker practitioner requires further modification when the sun, uncontrollable by nature, is used to activate thermochromic <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes,</b> a dynamic surface variable. In {{the context of the}} use of the sun as the dynamic activator, the investigation is focussed on design applications of sun-screening textiles for both indoor and outdoor use. The work has been divided into two categories: the use of solar technology as a direct heater and as an indirect heat source using photovoltaic solar cells to power heat circuitry. The research has resulted in a set of recommended guidelines for textile printmaker practitioners for use when working with textile designs to create dynamic effects with thermochromic dyes, moving light and shadow imageries, in some cases utilising heat circuits activated using photovoltaics. The effect of the individual components of the design process is to allow creation of both dynamic imageries on the textile surface and ‘an extended imagery’, which at times may co-exist within two or three-dimensional space. This thesis, additionally, discusses the ability of the textile designer to achieve an intended aesthetic outcome, when working with an uncontrollable parameter, such as the sun, in comparison with the ‘traditional’ textile print design process...|$|R
50|$|At low temperatures, {{the mixture}} is a solid. The weak acid forms a colored complex with the <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> by causing the lactone ring {{in the center of}} the dye {{molecule}} to open. At high temperatures, above 24-27 °C, the solvent melts and the ammonium salt dissociates, allowing it to react with the weak acid. This reaction increases the pH, which leads to closing of the lactone ring of the dye to convert it to its colorless (leuco) form.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} the paper is coated with a {{solid-state}} mixture of a dye and a suitable matrix; {{a combination of a}} fluoran <b>leuco</b> <b>dye</b> as an example. When the matrix is heated above its melting point, the dye reacts with the acid, shifts to its colored form, and the changed form is then conserved in a metastable state when the matrix solidifies back quickly enough.

30|$|Xanthenes {{and their}} {{derivatives}} have received special attention {{due to their}} diverse array of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral activities [1, 2, 3]. Furthermore, these compounds {{can be used as}} <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> [4], in laser technology [5] and as pH-sensitive fluorescent materials for the visualization of biomolecular assemblies [6]. Because of their wide range of synthetic, industrial and pharmacological applications, there are several reports in the literature for the synthesis of these types of compounds. 1, 8 -Dioxo-octahydroxanthene derivatives are one of the important types of xanthenes that could be easily prepared from the reaction of aromatic aldehydes with dimedone and/or cyclohexadione. Various catalysts were reported for the promotion of this reaction including SbCl 3 /SiO 2 [7], SiO 2 -R-SO 3 H [8], MCM- 41 -SO 3 H [9], p-dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid [10], triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride [11], diammonium hydrogen phosphate [12] and silica-supported Preyssler nanoparticles [13], silica sulfuric acid [14], Amberlyst- 15 [15] and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) [16] are examples. However, these methods suffer from one or more disadvantages such as: long reaction times, low yields, use of toxic solvents, requirement of the excess amounts of the reagents/catalysts and harsh reaction conditions. Therefore, it is important to find more efficient catalysts and methods for the synthesis of these types of compounds.|$|R
40|$|Certain leuco dyestuffs {{are known}} to exhibit a {{brilliant}} color by reaction with a phenolic developer; 2 -[(4 -hydroxyphenyl) sulfonyl]-phenol (BPS) is a well-known developer for black <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> such as 6 -(diethylamino) - 3 -methyl- 2 -(phenylamino) - spiro[isobenzofuran- 1 (3 H), 9 -[9 H]-xanhen]- 3 -one (ODB) in thermosensitive papers. Although BPS is a small molecule (molecular weight: about 250), it is thermally stable as characterized by a high melting point of about 184 °C. Furthermore, the stability of BPS is also extended to the 1 : 1 “leuco/developer” system. In this connection, structure analysis of BPS {{has been carried out}} in order to elucidate the stability of BPS itself as well as its leuco/developer system. Then, we found that one BPS molecule is hydrogen bonded to four different neighboring ones, forming an OH¯O two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network. This ensures a high thermal stability of BPS. On the other hand, in the ODB/BPS system, only one of the four hydrogen bonds in BPS is used for the formation of the 1 : 1 ODB/BPS colorant while the remaining three hydrogen bonds keep the network. As for the tinctorial strength in spin-coated ODB/BPS, the color intensity is found to be limited to about 70 % of the maximum available value. This is because there is a fraction of ODB molecules, whose lactone ring is still closed owing to the steric hindrance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree simple, {{accurate}} and highly sensitive indirect spectrophotometric {{methods have been}} developed for the determination of oxcarbazepine (OXC) in both pure and in pharmaceutical preparations. The methods are based on the oxidation of oxcarbazepine by a known excess of cerium(IV) in acid medium. This was followed by the determination of unreacted cerium(IV), which oxidizes <b>leuco</b> <b>dyes</b> to colored dyes in the same acid medium. In method A, an unreacted cerium(IV) oxidizes leuco crystal violet to crystal violet dye which is measured at 580 nm. A bluish-colored malachite green with a maximum absorption at 610 nm is developed in method B. In method C, cerium(IV) oxidizes leuco xylene cyanol FF to blue colored xylene cyanol FF having absorption maximum at 610 nm. In all these methods, the amount of cerium(IV) reacted corresponds to the amount of OXC and the absorbance is found to decrease linearly with OXC concentration. Beer’s law was obeyed in the concentration range of 0 – 2. 5, 0 – 2. 0 and 0 – 2. 5 μgml− 1 for methods A, B and C, respectively, and the corresponding molar absorptivity values are 3. 86 × 104, 4. 41 × 104 and 2. 16 × 104 lmol− 1 cm− 1.
