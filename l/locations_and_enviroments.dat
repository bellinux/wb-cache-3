Appeals to better and more environmental science, better law and governance and to the logic of the market, in order to re-establish certainty and order in global management, are only partly successful.

Various experimental factors affecting the pretreatment and LC-MS procedures were optimzed, respectively. Using slected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode in LC-MS analysis, the acquired calibration curves were strictly linear with the value of r 2 more than 0. 996 for the eight targeted analyses. The obtained data expressed as relative standard deviations (RSDs), for the within-laboratory reproducibility and repeatability were less than 6. 9 % and 7. 9 %, respectively.
