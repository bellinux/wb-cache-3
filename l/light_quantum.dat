5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a <b>light</b> <b>quantum</b> with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E

25|$|Einstein was {{the first}} {{physicist}} to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (h) would require a rewriting {{of the laws of}} physics. To support his point, in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a <b>light</b> <b>quantum</b> (see photon and wave–particle duality). Bohr {{was one of the most}} vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein because he saw it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers. Bohr disliked it because it made the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary. He did not like a scientist's having to choose between equations.|$|E
25|$|Modern optics {{encompasses}} {{the areas of}} optical science and engineering that became popular in the 20th century. These areas of optical science typically relate to the electromagnetic or quantum properties of light but do include other topics. A major subfield of modern optics, quantum optics, deals with specifically quantum mechanical properties of <b>light.</b> <b>Quantum</b> optics is not just theoretical; some modern devices, such as lasers, have principles of operation that depend on quantum mechanics. Light detectors, such as photomultipliers and channeltrons, respond to individual photons. Electronic image sensors, such as CCDs, exhibit shot noise corresponding to the statistics of individual photon events. Light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, too, cannot be understood without quantum mechanics. In the study of these devices, quantum optics often overlaps with quantum electronics.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, the German {{physicist}} Max Planck {{was studying}} black-body radiation {{and suggested that}} the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in [...] "packets" [...] of energy. In his 1901 article [...] in Annalen der Physik he called these packets [...] "energy elements". The word quanta (singular quantum, Latin for [...] ) was used before 1900 to mean particles or amounts of different quantities, including electricity. In 1905, Albert Einstein suggested that electromagnetic waves could only exist as discrete wave-packets. He called such a wave-packet the <b>light</b> <b>quantum</b> (German: das Lichtquant). The name photon derives from the Greek word for light, [...] (transliterated phôs). Arthur Compton used photon in 1928, referring to Gilbert N. Lewis. The same name was used earlier, by the American physicist and psychologist Leonard T. Troland, who coined the word in 1916, in 1921 by the Irish physicist John Joly, in 1924 by the French physiologist René Wurmser (1890-1993) and in 1926 by the French physicist Frithiof Wolfers (1891-1971). The name was suggested initially as a unit related to the illumination of the eye and the resulting sensation of light and was used later in a physiological context. Although Wolfers's and Lewis's theories were contradicted by many experiments and never accepted, the new name was adopted very soon by most physicists after Compton used it.|$|E

2500|$|In 1900 Max Planck, {{attempting}} to explain {{black body radiation}} suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these [...] "lumps" [...] of light energy [...] "quanta" [...] (from a Latin word for [...] "how much"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of <b>light</b> <b>quanta</b> to explain the photoelectric effect, and suggested that these <b>light</b> <b>quanta</b> had a [...] "real" [...] existence. In 1923 Arthur Holly Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called Compton scattering) {{could be explained by}} a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 Gilbert N. Lewis named these <b>light</b> <b>quanta</b> particles photons.|$|R

2500|$|Light behaves in {{some respects}} like {{particles}} and in other respects like waves. Matter—the [...] "stuff" [...] of the universe consisting of particles such as electrons and atoms—exhibits wavelike behavior too. Some light sources, including neon lights, give off only certain frequencies of <b>light.</b> <b>Quantum</b> mechanics shows that light, along with all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, comes in discrete units, called photons, and predicts its energies, colors, and spectral intensities. A single photon is a quantum, or smallest observable amount, of the electromagnetic field because a partial photon has never been observed. More broadly, quantum mechanics shows that many quantities, such as angular momentum, {{that appeared to be}} continuous in the zoomed-out view of classical mechanics, turn out to be (at the small, zoomed-in scale of quantum mechanics) quantized. Angular momentum is required to take on one of a set of discrete allowable values, and since the gap between these values is so minute, the discontinuity is only apparent at the atomic level.|$|E
