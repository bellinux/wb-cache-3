25|$|A general {{increase}} in the number of lymphocytes is known as <b>lymphocytosis,</b> whereas a decrease is known as lymphocytopenia.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis. This increase is most commonly caused by inflammation. There are four major causes: increase of production in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues. Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or <b>lymphocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in lymphocyte concentration {{is usually a}} sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person). A high lymphocyte count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of Bordetella pertussis, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as <b>lymphocytosis,</b> with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.|$|E
25|$|Oral dryness {{may also}} be caused by mouth breathing, usually caused by partial {{obstruction}} of the upper respiratory tract. Examples include hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Irradiation of the salivary glands often causes profound hyposalivation. Alcohol {{may be involved in}} the cause of salivary gland disease, liver disease, or dehydration. Smoking is another possible cause. Other recreational drugs such as methamphetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens, or heroin, may be implicated. Rarer causes include diabetes (dehydration), hyperparathyroidism, cholinergic dysfunction (either congenital or autoimmune), salivary gland aplasia or atresia, sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (due to antiretroviral therapy, but also possibly diffuse infiltrative <b>lymphocytosis</b> syndrome), graft-versus-host disease, renal failure, hepatitis C virus infection, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytosis</b> is {{a feature}} of infection, {{particularly}} in children. In the elderly, lymphoproliferative disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphomas, often present with lymphadenopathy and a <b>lymphocytosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Persistent {{polyclonal}} B-cell <b>lymphocytosis</b> (PPBL) is {{an anomaly}} {{of the human}} immune system characterized by mildly elevated levels of white blood cells (called leukocytosis), chronic, stable absolute polyclonal B-cell <b>lymphocytosis,</b> elevated polyclonal IgM and binucleated cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{requisite}} <b>lymphocytosis</b> of {{this disease}} is typically 2-20x109/L.|$|E
5000|$|Duodenal <b>lymphocytosis,</b> {{sometimes}} called lymphocytic duodenitis, lymphocytic duodenosis, or duodenal intraepithelial <b>lymphocytosis,</b> {{is a condition}} where an increased number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes is seen in biopsies of the duodenal mucosa when these are examined microscopically. It is often a feature of coeliac disease but {{may be found in}} other disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytosis</b> is an {{increase}} in the number of lymphocytes in the blood. In adults, <b>lymphocytosis</b> is present when the lymphocyte count is greater than 4000 per microliter (4.0 x 10(9)/L), in older children greater than 7000 per microliter and in infants greater than 9000 per microliter. Lymphocytes normally represent 20 to 40% of circulating white blood cells.|$|E
50|$|Diffuse infiltrative <b>lymphocytosis</b> {{syndrome}} {{occurs in}} HIV positive patients with low CD4 counts.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the methods}} of {{diagnosing}} tropical spastic paraparesis are MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and lumbar puncture (which may show <b>lymphocytosis).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytosis</b> {{is a high}} {{lymphocyte}} count. It can {{be caused}} by an infection, blood cancer, lymphoma, or autoimmune disorders that are accompanied by chronic swelling.|$|E
50|$|Causes of {{relative}} <b>lymphocytosis</b> include: age less than 2 years; acute viral infections; connective tissue diseases, thyrotoxicosis, Addison's disease, and splenomegaly with splenic sequestration of granulocytes.|$|E
50|$|CLL {{is usually}} first {{suspected}} by {{a diagnosis of}} <b>lymphocytosis,</b> an increase in a type of white blood cell, on a complete blood count test. This frequently is an incidental finding on a routine physician visit. Most often the lymphocyte count is greater than 4000 cells per microliter (µl) of blood, but can be much higher. The presence of <b>lymphocytosis</b> in an elderly individual should raise strong suspicion for CLL, and a confirmatory diagnostic test, in particular flow cytometry, should be performed unless clinically unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|Arterial blood gases {{may reveal}} {{hypoxemia}} when {{tested in a}} lab. Respiratory alkalosis may also be present. [...] Peripheral <b>lymphocytosis</b> can be observed. A lung biopsy may also be indicated.|$|E
50|$|In {{untreated}} coeliac disease, villous atrophy is {{more common}} in children younger than three years, but in older children and adults, it is common to find minor intestinal lesions (duodenal <b>lymphocytosis)</b> with normal intestinal villi.|$|E
50|$|Monoclonal B-cell <b>lymphocytosis</b> (MBL) is a {{condition}} that resembles chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but {{does not meet the}} criteria for CLL, and does not require treatment. However, CLL requiring treatment develops at the rate of 1.1% per year.|$|E
50|$|In early {{clinical}} studies, {{the activity}} of ibrutinib has been described to include a rapid reduction in lymphadenopathy accompanied by a transient <b>lymphocytosis,</b> suggesting that the drug might have direct effects on cell homing or migration to factors in tissue microenvironments.|$|E
50|$|The drug is {{generally}} well tolerated. The only common side effect is nausea (in 2% of patients). Less common side effects (<1%) include headache, increased or lowered blood cell counts (granulocytopenia, anaemia, <b>lymphocytosis,</b> monocytosis), increased liver enzymes, and allergic reactions.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocytopenia, or lymphopenia, is the {{condition}} of having an abnormally low level of lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a white blood cell with important functions in the immune system. The opposite is <b>lymphocytosis,</b> which refers to an excessive level of lymphocytes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytosis</b> {{is usually}} {{detected}} when a {{complete blood count}} is obtained. If not provided the lymphocyte count can be calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell (WBC) count by the percentage of lymphocytes found in the differential count. The lymphocyte count can also be directly measured by flow cytometry.|$|E
50|$|MBL {{has been}} found in less than 1% of {{asymptomatic}} adults under age 40, and in around 5% of adults older than 60. Exact numbers depend on the population studied and the sensitivity of the diagnostic technique.Like CLL, it appears to be more common in males.It is also a common finding among older adults with unexplained <b>lymphocytosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Clonal {{hematopoiesis}} {{is sometimes}} {{compared to the}} unrelated blood disorders of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and monoclonal B-cell <b>lymphocytosis</b> (MBL) to which it bears similarities in its apparent priming for more advanced hematologic disease combined {{with a lack of}} symptoms and overall low risk of progression. The acquisition of additional mutations can cause CHIP to transform into the related blood disorders MDS and AML.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis. This increase is most commonly caused by inflammation. There are four major causes: increase of production in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues. Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or <b>lymphocytosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When {{duodenal}} <b>lymphocytosis</b> {{is associated}} with other features of coeliac disease, in particular positive antibodies, or HLA-DQ2/8 and a family history, treatment with a gluten-free diet produces an improvement in IEL numbers. [...] Diarrhoea, thyroiditis, weakness and folate deficiency were other predictors {{of the development of}} gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease, which developed in 23 of 85 patients over 2 years in one series.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{disrupted}} signaling pathways, {{synthesis of}} chemokines will be affected. This will prevent the infected cell from producing them and thereby inhibiting recruitment of neutrophils. Under normal circumstances, alveolar macrophages and other lung cells produce {{a variety of}} chemokines. PT {{has been found to}} inhibit the early transcription of keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and LPS-induced CXC chemokine. Eventually, PT causes <b>lymphocytosis,</b> one of the systemic manifestations of whooping cough.|$|E
50|$|Digestive enzymes {{can break}} casein down into {{peptides}} that have some biological activity in cells and in laboratory animals though conclusive causal effects on humans {{have not been}} established. Although {{they have not yet}} been proven to be formed in the human digestive system, there are associations between serum levels of β -casomorphins and the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, histamine release, stimulation of food intake, specifically high-fat foods, and <b>lymphocytosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Individuals with BENTA disease have {{polyclonal}} B cell <b>lymphocytosis</b> (i.e. excess B cells) {{developing in}} infancy, {{in addition to}} splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Patients may have low serum IgM and mildly anergic T cells. These features likely contribute to the mild immunodeficiency seen with BENTA disease. Patients are generally susceptible to recurrent sinopulmonary and ear infections in childhood, and may be more susceptible to certain viruses including Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, and molluscum contagiosum.|$|E
