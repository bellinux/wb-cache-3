50|$|When a <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> propagates {{perpendicular}} to magnetic field (e.g. in a magnetized plasma), {{it can become}} elliptized. Because a <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> is some combination of in-phase X & O modes, and because X & O waves propagate with different phase velocities, this causes elliptization of the emerging beam. As the waves propagate, the phase difference (δ) between EX & EO increases.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} Faraday {{rotation}} is as follows: When a <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> is propagating along {{a magnetic field}} line,it is de-composed into left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized components. The phase difference between them as theyexit the plasma causes the recombined <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> to rotate its polarization direction. In MST, we launch two co-propagating, counter-rotating waves to probe the plasma. We then measure the phase {{difference between these two}} beams, which will be twice the Faraday rotation angle.|$|E

In this paper, we consider <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> transverse electric <b>wave</b> solutions to the electromagnetic wave equation:∇×E=iωH;∇×H=−iωE. Using Clebsch functions and differential geometric techniques the author is able to give {{a discussion of the}} most general possible forms of propagation of <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> A zero curvature condition (which asserts that the Clebsch functions necessary to represent the solutions are expressible in terms of Cartesian variables) reduces the study of vector PDEs to nonlinear PDEs, which may be solved in special cases. The benefit is that the Clebsch representation is the one that is the most useful for analyzing the structure of the flow. This method of analysis is now a feasible solution method due to the tremendous advances in mathematical software allowing one to compute curvatures, given metric functions.
