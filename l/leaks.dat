5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial <b>leaks</b> and spinal <b>leaks.</b> The {{vast majority of}} <b>leaks</b> are spinal. Cranial <b>leaks</b> occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal <b>leaks</b> occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF <b>leaks</b> cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{pipelines}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular ways of delivering gas phases as shown by numerous examples in hydrocarbon transportation systems in Arctic regions, oil and gas production facilities in onshore and offshore wells, and municipal gas distribution systems in urban areas. A gas <b>leak</b> from pipelines can cause serious problems not only because of the financial losses associated but also its social and environmental impacts. Therefore, establishing an early <b>leak</b> detection model is vital to safe and secure operations of such pipeline systems. A <b>leak</b> detection model for a single gas phase is presented in this study by using material balance and pressure traverse calculations. The comparison between two steady states, with and without <b>leak,</b> makes it possible to quantify the magnitude of disturbance in two <b>leak</b> detection indicators such as the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) and the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) in a broad range of <b>leak</b> locations (x <b>leak)</b> and <b>leak</b> opening sizes (d <b>leak).</b>  The results from the fit to large-scale experimental data of Scott and Yi (1998) show that the value of <b>leak</b> coefficient (C D), which is shown to be the single-most important but largely unknown parameter, ranges from 0. 55 to 4. 11, and should be a function of Reynolds number (N Re) which is related to <b>leak</b> characteristics such as <b>leak</b> location (x <b>leak),</b> <b>leak</b> opening size (d <b>leak),</b> <b>leak</b> rate (q <b>leak)</b> and system pressure. Further investigations show that between the two <b>leak</b> detection indicators, the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) is superior to the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) because of larger disturbance, if the pressure drop along the pipeline is relatively small compared to the outlet pressure; otherwise, the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) is superior to the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out).

40|$|Threshold <b>leak</b> {{sizes and}} <b>leak</b> rates were {{calculated}} {{for a number of}} liquid food products exhibiting a wide range of surface tension and viscosity values. From this data, one can see that mathematically, under typical pressure differentials generated in food packages (≤ ± 34. 5 kPa), a <b>leak</b> will never start through a 2 µm defect. The calculated <b>leak</b> rates were compared to calculated evaporation rates. The evaporation rate exceeds the <b>leak</b> rate at lower sized microholes (2, and 5 µm diameter) under typical pressure differentials found in food packages. If the liquid, typically aqueous in food products, is evaporating off faster than the <b>leak</b> itself, then there will be solids left behind that could effectively plug the <b>leak.</b> The critical <b>leak</b> size is the size micro-defect that allows microbial penetration into the package. The critical <b>leak</b> size of air-filled defects was found to be 7 µm at all pressures tested.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Leak</b> {{detection}} {{is always}} interesting research topic, where <b>leak</b> location and <b>leak</b> rate are two pipeline <b>leaking</b> parameters {{that should be}} determined accurately to overcome pipe <b>leaking</b> problems. In this research those two parameters are investigated by developing transmission pipeline model and the <b>leak</b> detection model which is developed using Artificial Neural Network. The mathematical approach needs actual <b>leak</b> data to train the <b>leak</b> detection model, however such data {{could not be obtained}} from oil fields. Therefore, for training purposes hypothetical data are developed using the transmission pipeline model, by applying various physical configuration of pipeline and applying oil properties correlations to estimate the value of oil density and viscosity. The various <b>leak</b> locations and <b>leak</b> rates are also represented in this model. The prediction of those two <b>leak</b> parameters will be completed until the total error is less than certain value of tolerance, or until iterations level is reached. To recognize the pattern, forward procedure is conducted. The application of this approach produces conclusion that for certain pipeline network configuration...|$|R

5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect <b>leaks</b> in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the <b>leaks</b> is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for <b>leaks</b> with a hand-held device.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>leak</b> before break (LBB) {{concept is}} widely used in {{designing}} pipe lines in nuclear power plants. According to the concept, the amount of <b>leaking</b> liquid from a pipe should be more than the minimum detectable <b>leak</b> rate of a <b>leak</b> detection system before catastrophic failure occurs. Therefore, accurate estimation of the <b>leak</b> rate is important to evaluate {{the validity of the}} LBB concept in pipe line design. In this paper, a program was developed to estimate the <b>leak</b> rate through circumferential cracks in pipes in nuclear power plants using the Henry–Fauske flow model and modified Henry–Fauske flow model. By using the developed program, the <b>leak</b> rate was calculated for a circumferential crack in a sample pipe, and the effect of the flow model on the <b>leak</b> rate was examined. Treating the crack morphology parameters as random variables, the statistical behavior of the <b>leak</b> rate was also examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} crack morphology parameters have a strong effect on the <b>leak</b> rate and the statistical behavior of the <b>leak</b> rate can be simulated using normally distributed crack morphology parameters...|$|R

Spontaneous Ca 2 + sparks are thought {{to play a major role}} in SR Ca 2 + <b>leak.</b> In this study, we determined the quantitative contribution of sparks to SR Ca 2 + <b>leak</b> and tested the hypothesis that non-spark mediated Ca 2 + release also contributes to SR Ca 2 + <b>leak.</b> We simultaneously measured spark properties and intra-SR free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]SR) after complete inhibition of SERCA with thapsigargin in permeabilized rabbit ventricular myocytes. When [Ca 2 +]SR declined to 279 ± 10 μm, spark activity ceased completely; however SR Ca 2 + <b>leak</b> continued, albeit at a slower rate. Analysis of sparks and [Ca 2 +]SR revealed, that SR Ca 2 + <b>leak</b> increased as a function of [Ca 2 +]SR, with a particularly steep increase at higher [Ca 2 +]SR (> 600 μm) where sparks become a major pathway of SR Ca 2 + <b>leak.</b> At low [Ca 2 +]SR (< 300 μm), however, Ca 2 + <b>leak</b> occurred mostly as non-spark-mediated <b>leak.</b> Sensitization of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) with low doses of caffeine increased spark frequency and SR Ca 2 + <b>leak.</b> Complete inhibition of RyR abolished sparks and significantly decreased SR Ca 2 + <b>leak,</b> but did not prevent it entirely, suggesting the existence of RyR-independent Ca 2 + <b>leak.</b> Finally, we found that RyR-mediated Ca 2 + <b>leak</b> was enhanced in myocytes from failing rabbit hearts.
