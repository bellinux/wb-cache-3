40|$|We {{study the}} long {{standing}} {{issue of whether}} markets can supply banks with sufficient liquidity or whether markets should be complemented with a lender of last resort (LOLR). For this purpose, we develop an extended version of the recent model of Holmström and Tirole (1998) on the supply of liquidity to firms. H&Ts original model analyses liquidity supply to firms that are facing solvency shocks. We apply their framework to banking and extend the framework to admit the analysis of problems associated with transitory <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows,</b> even absent any change in a bank's value. Our premise is that the scope for moral hazard may increase in connection with <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows.</b> Moral hazard, which we interpret as the possibility of laxity in banks' monitoring of firms, may increase with <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows</b> because banks need to increase their monitoring efforts in order to safeguard their own interests. The model illustrates many key aspects the classical LOLR debate. The model shows how moral hazard limits of banks’ ability to borrow from markets to cover <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflows.</b> It also predicts banks’ demand for liquid reserves and the economies associated with centralization of reserves in a liquidity pool when the holding of liquid reserves entails opportunity costs. Finally, the model enables discussion of viable lending policies for the LOLR and contrasts these with the ‘Bagehotian principles’, which are still widely used as benchmark criteria in evaluating LOLR operations. liquidity; lender of last resort; banking; central banking...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the efficiency of}} financial intermediation and the propagation of business cycle shocks in a model of long-term relationships between entrepreneurs and lenders lenders may be constrained in their short-run access to liquidity. When liquidity is low, relationships are subject to breakups that lead to loss of joint surplus. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>outflows</b> cause damage to financial structure by breaking up relationships, and damage persists due to frictions {{in the formation of}} new relationships. Feedbacks between aggregate investment and the structure of intermediation greatly magnify the effects of shocks. For large shocks, financial collapse may become inescapable in the absence of external intervention. ...|$|E
40|$|We use {{a unique}} and {{comprehensive}} data set on open-end real estate funds in Germany to study a liquidity crisis that hit this industry between 2005 and 2006. Since this industry is comparably unregulated our data set permits us to contrast competing explanations of liquidity crisis. We find that fundamental factors matter for the <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflow</b> in normal times. During the crisis, however, they do not play a role. During the panic only strategic complementarities drive withdrawals. Furthermore, we find that funds with a higher load fee suffer from substantially larger outflows in the crisis period, while a higher load fee reduces gross outflows in normal times. As institutional investors predominately invest in funds with a low load fee this {{is in line with}} recent theory arguing that complementarities are mitigated by the involvement of large institutional investors who can at least partially correct for the coordination failure resulting from complementarities.

40|$|This study uses a {{switching}} regression framework {{with known}} sample separation {{to analyze the}} effects of corporate income taxation on investment in case of binding and non-binding financial constraints. By employing two different sample splitting criteria, payout behavior and the ratio of liabilities to total assets, I show that the elasticity of capital to its user costs in an auto-distributed-lag model is underestimated in case of neglecting the presence of financial constraints. For unconstrained firms, the elasticity of capital to its user costs is around - 1. For financially constrained firms the elasticity is statistically not different from zero. For the latter group instead, the results prevail by using the effective average tax rate to measure <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflow</b> through taxation that corporate taxation affects investment through changing internal finance. In addition, this study helps to understand the methodological differences between auto-distributed-lag and error-correction models.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a description of}} a new so called liquidity coverage requirement and its possible relations with securitization positions in Europe. The author indicates that European securitization transactions performed significantly better during the financial crisis than American ones. Because of this fact they could be treated as an alternative channel to finance the real economy. The new regulations matter in this context, regulations designed with an aim to diminish the probability for similar crises in the future. One of the most important sets of regulations is the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) where the liquidity coverage requirement has been inserted. In LCR, {{for the first time in}} European rules, the advantages of securitization have been noticed so that certain securitizations are recognized as possible partial insurance in credit institutions against <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflow</b> during 30 calendar days. The research question is: could this recognition of securitization have – together with work performed by the ECB and European Commission – an influence on a recovery of securitization markets in Europ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} the {{connection}} between the Eurozone's balance of payments crisis and the TARGET 2 balances. These balances represent mutual clearing relationship of the individual euro area member states to the European Central Bank inside the TARGET 2 system, which serves as a heart of the Eurozone's payment settlements. In fact, the central banks of the core countries hold significant positive balances while the peripheral central banks accumulated substantial negative positions. The TARGET 2 balances appeared mainly {{as a consequence of the}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>outflow</b> from the peripheral countries to the core due to the large imbalances in fundamental factors such as the NCA deficits, net foreign debt, public and private debt or competitiveness. The development of the balances was further facilitated via uneven liquidity provisions from the Eurosystem, as the peripheral countries effectively financed their balance of payments disequilibrium by issuing new liquidity that almost immediately moved to the core. The banking systems of the core started to operate in the liquidity excess status as the monetary base increased in 2011 and 2012. Assets with questionable quality collateralized the increasing refinancing operations in the periphery as the collateral requirements were repeatedly lowered. It resulted in an increase in the credit risk of these operations primarily in the periphery countries. This situation, among many others presented in this thesis, raises further questions about the parameters of the future single monetary policy as well as the continuance of the European monetary union...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reach the {{objective}} of supplying some relevant information regarding the <b>liquidity</b> inflows and <b>outflows</b> during a financial exercise, the total cash flow analysis must include the analysis of result cashable from operation, of payments and receipts related to the investment and of financing decisions of the last exercise, {{as well as the}} analysis of treasury variation (of cash items). The management of total cash flows ensures the correlation of current liquidness flows as consequence of receipts with the payments ’flows, in order to provide payment continuity of mature obligations...|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the factors {{affecting}} the liquidity of selected bank sectors, {{as well as their}} size groups, using panel regression analysis. For higher complexity of the results, multiple dependent variables are used: <b>liquidity</b> creation, <b>outflow</b> and net change. The values are calculated based on the specific method of liquidity risk measurement – gross liquidity flows. The results indicate both multiple effects of some factors on the given variables, as well as isolated influence of factors on a single liquidity form or size group. Thus, when looking for determinants using just one form of liquidity, such as creation, the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the influence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions. The results also point to the differing behaviours of the size groups and their different sensitivity on the factors; smaller banks have shown higher sensitivity on macroeconomic variables. Higher flexibility in regulation could lead to higher optimization...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores factors behind Canadian banks'' {{relative}} resilience in {{the ongoing}} credit turmoil. We identify two main causes: a higher share of depository funding (vs. wholesale funding) in liabilities, {{and a number of}} regulatory and structural factors in the Canadian market that reduced banks'' incentives to take excessive risks. The robust predictive power of the depository funding ratio is confirmed in a multivariate analysis of the performance of 72 largest commercial banks in OECD countries during the turmoil.
