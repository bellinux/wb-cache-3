5000|$|In later interviews, Tom Petty {{admitted}} that Epstein's behavior had become unpredictable: [...] "He was just degenerating {{on us to}} the point where we thought keeping Howie in the band was actually doing him more harm than getting rid of him. His personal problems were vast and serious." [...] He was interred at Second Home Cemetery in Greenfield, Wisconsin. Petty wrote the following in an article for Rolling Stone in response to Epstein's death: [...] "...there's a great sadness, because Howie was never not a Heartbreaker. He just got to where he couldn't do it anymore...It's <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a tree dying in the backyard. And you're kind of used to the idea that it's dying.

He then stated that he had [...] "made a giant masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds" [...] (the WGN call letters used by the Chicago television station as well as its sister radio station are an acronym for [...] "World's Greatest Newspaper", in reference to the flagship newspaper of their corporate parent, the Tribune Company's Chicago Tribune). He then held up a glove (similar to the one worn by Michael Jackson at the time) and said, [...] "My brother is wearing the other one." [...] After putting the glove on, he continued, [...] "But it's dirty! It's <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> bloodstains on it!" [...] He then removed the glove and threw it down.|$|E
