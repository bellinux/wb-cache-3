5|$|Blaster Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation and location of the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> order to advance to later <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E

The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem.

The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous.
