The albums under the <b>label</b> are mainly composed by Key's signature composers: Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi. Three of the singles feature songs sung by Lia and one album, Love Song, features the singer Riya from Eufonius. Three drama CDs have been released as well.|$|E

30|$|In the following, the {{principles}} of the algorithm are explained. The details can be found in [22]. The algorithm is based on the raw <b>labels</b> of the cover classes M otherese, N eutral, E mphatic, and A nger. Any <b>labels</b> of the rare other classes are omitted. A chunk is <b>labelled</b> as belonging to N eutral if at least 60 % of the raw <b>labels</b> are N eutral. If this is not the case, the number of <b>labels</b> M otherese is compared to the number of <b>labels</b> E mphatic and A nger. If M otherese has the majority and at least 40 % of all raw <b>labels</b> within the chunk belong to M otherese, the chunk is <b>labelled</b> as M otherese. Otherwise, if there are more E mphatic and A nger <b>labels</b> than M otherese <b>labels,</b> the number of E mphatic <b>labels</b> is compared to the number of A nger <b>labels.</b> If there are more E mphatic <b>labels</b> and if at least 50 % of all words within the chunk belong either to E mphatic or to A nger, the chunk is <b>labelled</b> as E mphatic. If it is the other way round, that is, if there are more A nger <b>labels</b> than E mphatic <b>labels,</b> the chunk is <b>labelled</b> as A nger. The different thresholds are defined heuristically by examining the resulting chunk <b>labels.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the problem}} of {{assigning}} <b>labels</b> to nodes of a dynamic XML tree such that the <b>labels</b> encode all ancestor-descendant relationships between the nodes and the document-order between the nodes. Such <b>labeling</b> facilitates efficient XML query processing. A number of <b>labeling</b> schemes have been designed for this task. These schemes can be broadly classified into (1) Static <b>Labeling</b> Schemes and (2) Dynamic <b>Labeling</b> Schemes. While static schemes generate short <b>labels,</b> their performance degrades in update intensive environments. Dynamic schemes have nice update performance, but their size of <b>labels</b> is high. A good <b>labeling</b> scheme should generate concise <b>labels</b> and should perform better when there are arbitrary updates on the XML tree. In this paper, we present a new <b>labeling</b> scheme called Sector-based <b>Labeling</b> (SL) scheme which <b>labels</b> nodes with sectors. We analyze the proposed SL scheme and show that it generates smaller <b>labels</b> than the static schemes and has update performance as good as the dynamic schemes. We conduct experiments and show that the obtained results substantiate our analyses. ...|$|R
5|$|Key Sounds <b>Label</b> is a Japanese {{independent}} record <b>label</b> {{formed in}} 2001 as {{a brand of}} the publishing company VisualArt's. Key Sounds <b>Label</b> was formed to catalog and release music related to visual novels produced by the brand Key, also under VisualArt's, known for developing such titles as Kanon and Air. Excluding two albums and one single that were released by Key and VisualArt's before the label's formation, the majority of releases on the <b>label</b> all have a basis from one of Key's titles. There are other albums and singles on the <b>label</b> {{not directly related to}} the visual novels, such as two singles by Lia and one album by Riya. Unlike typical record labels, Key Sounds <b>Label</b> does not license any of the artists featured on albums and singles released on the <b>label.</b>|$|E
