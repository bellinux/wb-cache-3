The systemization will serve as a basis for identifying main interactions between wages and other <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>components,</b> such as <b>labour</b> supply and demand and <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> disequilibrium. The article presents major concepts formulated within neo-classical and Keynesian theories, <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> segmentation theories, efficiency wage theory, rent-sharing and rent-extraction theories, theory of job search, and search-and-matching models. One of the conclusions arising from the discussion is that the evolution of contemporary <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> is a challenge for researchers seeking wage formation models adequately describing the real-life circumstances...|$|R

In particular, it investigates the peripheral workforce in the hotel industry, as defined by Guerrier and Lockwood (1989). While previous research has examined the flexible firm from a range of perspectives such as pay flexibility (Walsh, 1993), temporal flexibility (Walsh and Deery, 1997) and gender segregation (Bagguley, 1991), this study {{examines the}} precariousness of the hotel peripheral workforce in relation to access to the internal <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> (ILM). The study examines the perceptions of employees in relation to the ILM components of training, promotional opportunities and job security. A sample of 287 non-supervisory hotel employees from seven Central Business District (CBD) Melbourne hotels was surveyed. These respondents were grouped into peripheral and non-peripheral clusters according to widely accepted labour force segmentation criteria. Various statistical techniques, including discriminant analysis, were used to assess differences between the clusters in terms of internal <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>components</b> and employee attitudes. The findings question previous research that propose clearly defined workforce groups in the hotel sector.

40|$|Main {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to show the recent trends of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> issues regarding gender inequality in the countries that {{are still in the}} transition to the market oriented economy. Transition to competition has effected in increasing the level of unemployment to economically active population, with the higher consequence for females than for males, from which some females have left <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> and they became inactive in job searching. In this paper we analyze and compare gender gaps through the main <b>components</b> of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> trends as level of education, active participation in <b>labour</b> <b>market,</b> occupational segregation, employment and unemployment for both genders of the countries that are still in transition like Albania, FYR of Macedonia and Kosovo in comparison with EU countries. Given that closer are these countries in joining the EU; higher are the requirements for increasing the level of employment targets and in approving and implementing social policies on gender equality in <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> according to the EU legislations. Methodology used in this paper is through case studies by using secondary data from the most recent labour force surveys (LFS) of transition countries in South East Europe and comparing them with the EU targets. Also regarding occupational segregation by gender the Duncan & Duncan Index is calculated. The study shows that depending on the stages that countries are in transition earlier or latter, the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>components</b> regarding gender are more comparable and closer with the targets of the EU countries, and that occupational segregation is higher in the transition countries where the unemployment level of females is in the higher range...|$|R
40|$|Education {{is a key}} {{determinant}} of earnings, as several South African studies have confirmed. Years of schooling completed, however, provides an imperfect approximation of the effective level of education achieved, mainly due to variations {{in the quality of}} education received. This study addresses this issue by, {{for the first time in}} South Africa, incorporating quality of education in the modelling of earnings. Differences in quality of education are viewed as a form of pre-labour market discrimination. By decomposing the wage gap before and after controlling for educational quality, more accurate estimates of the true levels of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> discrimination are obtained. The main hypothesis tested is that controlling for quality will reduce the component of the wage gap ascribed to <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> discrimination. The results show a systematic decrease in the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> discrimination <b>component</b> with increased adjustments for quality of education. Almost half of the previous <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> discrimination can be explained by differences in quality, yet the proportion of racial wage differentials ascribed to <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> discrimination is still found to be significant. The clear implication is that current estimates of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> discrimination are exaggerated and a more careful analysis of earnings is required to re-assess the levels of discrimination in the South African <b>labour</b> <b>market.</b> earnings functions, <b>labour</b> <b>market,</b> discrimination, education, South Africa...|$|R

These are difficult and complex problems, and their implementation {{takes a long time}} both at the preliminary and the execution stage. The <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> is a <b>component</b> of the restructuring process. It has been found out that this market is quite differentiated in particular administrative provinces of Poland. There is needed a coordination of studies on the restructuring process, the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> and unemployment. It also appears necessary to intensify such studies on the macro scale (i. e. that of the entire country) and in regional cross-sections. More attention has been given in the analysis to the restructuring process taking place in the regions of Łódź, Wałbrzych and Silesia. The industries in these regions have been classified as the so-called sunset industries, which must be partly liquidated and deep structural changes must be caried out there.

40|$|Although New Zealand has had {{an active}} CGE {{modelling}} community since the 1980 's, a multi-regional CGE model for the country has not been developed until now. This thesis presents a prototype multi-regional CGE model to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a comprehensive model that captures the benefits of modelling agent behaviour with a bottom-up approach. The prototype model is built upon bottom-up regional micro-foundations and New Zealand data is used to operationalise a particular implementation of the model. The thesis fills an important gap in the New Zealand CGE modelling literature as none of the models in current use have a structure involving bottom-up regional modelling. The method of implementation is also a key contribution, utilising a maximum-entropy approach to overcome data shortages. An illustrative simulation of a natural disaster that strikes the Wellington central business district demonstrates {{the strengths of the}} bottom-up multi-regional approach - that the model can capture differential effects across regions of shocks that occur at the regional level, and incorporate flow-on and feedback effects between regions. Sensitivity testing of the substitution elasticity between domestic sources of products reinforces the importance of empirically-estimated parameters in CGE models. The basic model is extended in two ways. The first is to introduce modelling of distribution services as has been done in the ORANI and subsequently FEDERAL models. The key structural difference here is that products identified as distribution services are required to facilitate movement of other products from seller to buyer. Thus there are no opportunities to substitute away from these services if they become relatively more expensive. To implement the additional structure, sets of coefficients are specified to control technical possibilities in the usage of the distribution services. These include switches that can dictate, for example, that wholesale trade is only involved in the delivery of tangible products, that retail trade is only used by in-region purchasers, and that transport is required for moving physical products across regional borders or to exporters. That these assumptions can be integrated seamlessly into the database highlights the strength of the maximum-entropy approach used to generate the multi-regional input-output database. Simulations of an oil price shock show that the regional assumptions surrounding the distribution networks are material to the results. The second extension to the model is the addition of a module to control the degree of inter-regional labour mobility. Essentially the user is given the ability to specify the extent to which households respond to regional real wage di erences by moving to regions with relatively higher rates. Therefore, in short-run simulations labour can be made more mobile than capital, while in the long-run it can be less mobile than capital. The module also introduces additional structure to link populations, households, and <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>components.</b> One important element of this new structure is a link back to the endogenous labour supply theory of the basic model. Publicly available demographic and <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> data are used to implement the mobility module. The importance of a mobility response to relative real wage changes is explored in an illustrative application looking at the impact of regionally-concentrated immigration flows. The simulations suggest that population movements can work to dissipate the welfare effects of such migration inflows...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the earnings differential {{between males and females}} in Indonesia. This research also seeks to determine whether the female work force obtains extra benefit in terms of wage earnings on the basis of better education, marital status, working experience, residential location and region. The data used in this study come from the 1989, 1999 and 2009 Indonesian National Labour Force Surveys (Sakernas) on households. In order {{to investigate}} the gender earnings differential, Oaxaca’s (1973) decomposition method is employed. The result shows that the estimated coefficients of education variables are generally higher for females than for males. These results highlight that the effect of education on earnings increases as educational level advances. The return to university education is higher than all other levels of education, whereas sub-primary education has the lowest rate of return to education for male and female workers. The gender gap decomposition results suggest that favouritism towards men exists in the Indonesian <b>labour</b> <b>market.</b> The discrimination <b>component</b> is quite high, which clearly indicates the existence of discrimination in the Indonesian <b>labour</b> <b>market.</b> The results reveal that the degree of discrimination is still quite significant against females in all regions in Indonesia. Among factors that influence gender wage gap and discrimination in the country, education was found to be more important in influencing the earnings of females than males.

Finally, putting the unemployed under pressure to find employment, without providing them with realistic job opportunities on the demand side, does not improve their chances of finding employment...|$|R
40|$|Factor {{markets that}} {{function}} well are a crucial {{condition for the}} competitiveness and growth of agriculture. Institutions and regulation may give rise to agricultural <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> heterogeneity, which could have important effects on {{the functioning of the}} <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> and other agricultural factor markets in EU member states. This paper first defines the institutional framework for the <b>labour</b> <b>market,</b> and then presents a brief literature review of previous studies of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> institutional frameworks. Based on the literature, a survey to characterise agricultural <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> was undertaken, which was implemented for a selection of EU 27 and EU candidate countries, with responses based on expert opinion. The survey data were then used to construct indices of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> flexibility/rigidity for the countries examined. These indices were used to make inter-country <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> comparisons and to draw inferences about the institutions and functioning of the agricultural <b>labour</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{literature}} {{arguing that}} countries with high employment protection legislation have worst <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> performance. Yet, the overall impact of the crisis on France’s <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> was comparatively limited. To solve this puzzle, this paper makes four points. First, it shows that France’s <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> problems have not historically been about high EPL. Second, the crisis in France was not as acute as in the Euro area. Third, {{the costs of the}} crisis were concentrated on certain <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> groups. Finally, the government introduced several <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies in response to the crisis and <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> dualisation increased despite falling policy dualism. While deregulation seems – if anything - to have made matters worse, the government also introduced short-time work schemes, prolonged unemployment benefits, and extended active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies. Overall this paper advances our understanding of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> performance and policies in France during the crisis...|$|R
