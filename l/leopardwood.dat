50|$|Flindersia maculosa is {{a tree in}} {{the citrus}} family. It is found in arid and semi arid areas in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Because of the spotted bark, it {{is known as the}} <b>leopardwood</b> or leopard tree.|$|E
50|$|The trunk can be {{smooth and}} glossy, of an {{attractive}} orange/brown or pinkish/mauve colour, or green where bark {{has recently been}} shed. Other times, the bark sheds irregularly resulting in a mottled trunk, similar to the spotted gum and the <b>leopardwood.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nectar {{from the}} buds, and gum from the bark {{has been used}} to make a sweet drink. The drink from the gum {{has been used as a}} remedy for diarrhea. Being drought {{resistant}} and attractive, the <b>Leopardwood</b> is an ornamental tree for drier areas.|$|E
50|$|Plants growing {{here have}} adapted to the {{semi-arid}} climate. They include species of Acacia, the desert bloodwood, weeping pittosporum and <b>leopardwood.</b> Wildflowers of the daisy family are prominent after rain. Animals seen here include western grey kangaroo and feral goats. Wedge-tailed eagles are often seen flying above the mountain.|$|E
50|$|The plains {{were once}} lightly forested with mainly gum, coolibah, box, wilga, belah, myall, Cypress pine and <b>leopardwood</b> trees. Many {{of these early}} timbers were used for {{buildings}} and fences. The region is renowned for its good merino sheep with 21 micron wool and quality beef cattle. Although this is marginal, graziers {{have been able to}} diversify into farming. Large scale clearing has become broadacre farming, producing premium grade wheat, oats, barley and fodder crops.|$|E
50|$|Acacia cana {{is found}} in New South Wales western plains e.g near white cliffs, The Sturt National Park and Merindee. It is also found {{as far north as}} central Queensland at Avadale. These areas are {{woodlands}} that can be widely scattered that are made up of sandy soils and gibber plains (desert pavement). This acacia species grows in this type of habitat as the it can associates with mugla species (different acacia family), <b>leopardwood</b> (Flindersia maculosa) and belah (Casuarina cristata).|$|E
50|$|Areas {{associated}} with semi-permanent water support shallow freshwater sedgelands. Bimble box grows in periodically flooded depressions on sandplains and alluvial plains. On dryland areas there are extensive woodlands of belah, black oak, western rosewood and <b>leopardwood.</b> A relatively large expanse of Whitewood - Western Rosewood low woodland occurs on the stony tablelands. There are small patches of supplejack dominated woodland and Western Peneplain woodlands dominated by coolibah and beefwood or ironwood. Gidgee and occasionally Whitewood tall shrublands, mulga (Acacia spp.) communities and Aeolian dunefields comprising patches of gum coolibah woodland also occur.|$|E
50|$|Acacia loderi {{is found}} in inland southeastern Australia, mainly in far western New South Wales, from White Cliffs {{in the north of}} the tip of northwestern Victoria in the south, east to Hillston and west through the Darling River basin and Broken Hill into eastern South Australia, growing in solonized brown or red soils in mostly flat country. It forms a {{dominant}} component of Acacia loderi shrubland, where it is found with such trees as black oak (Casuarina pauper), inland rosewood (Alectryon oleifolius) and <b>leopardwood</b> (Flindersia maculosa), and an understory of chenopods and grasses.|$|E
40|$|The {{vegetation}} of the Central Division of New South Wales (lat. 31 °– 33 ° S, long. 146 ° 30 ’– 149 ° E) {{was classified}} and mapped (Cobar–Nyngan–Gilgandra, Nymagee–Narromine–Dubbo 1 : 250 000 mapsheets) {{as part of}} the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service wheat-belt mapping series. The vegetation classification was derived using traditional air photo interpretation and quantitative analysis of data from 428 field sites. Analyses included hierarchical classification in PATN to define floristic groups, then Fidel and ANOSIM to elucidate the characteristic species of the groups and explore the consistency of these relationships at various levels of similarity. Maps and descriptions show the floristic composition and structure, the geographic distribution of assemblages, the current extent, and shape and degree of connectivity of vegetation and changes in native woody vegetation cover over time. 22 vegetation units were defined, 19 were woodlands and forests dominated by eucalypts including Eucalyptus populnea subsp. bimbil — P 4 Poplar Box Woodlands and P 16 Simple Poplar Box Woodlands; Eucalyptus largiflorens — R 3 Black Box Woodlands; Eucalyptus microcarpa — P 12 Woodlands on Jurassic Sandstone and P 13 Grey Box Woodlands; Eucalyptus camaldulensis — R 1 River Red Gum Forests and Woodlands; Eucalyptus intertexta — P 14 Red Box, Poplar Box and Pine Woodlands, U 1 Red Box, Poplar Box, Pine and Green Mallee Woodlands and U 2 Red Box, Poplar Box and Pine Woodlands on Granite Hillslopes; Eucalyptus dwyeri — U 3 Dwyer’s Red Gum Low Open Woodland on Granite Crests, H 1 Dwyer’s Red Gum, Ironbark and Green Mallee Woodlands and H 9 Dwyer’s Red Gum Open Woodlands on Granite Hills; Eucalyptus viridis — H 2 Green Mallee Woodlands; Eucalyptus morrisii — H 6 Grey Mallee Open Woodlands; Mallee — H 7 Mallee Woodlands on Rolling Hills and P 1 Mallee Woodlands on Plains; Eucalyptus dealbata — H 8 Tumble-down Red Gum Woodlands on Basalt Hills; and Eucalyptus chloroclada — P 15 Dirty Red Gum, Pine and Poplar Box Woodlands. These eucalypt woodlands exhibit diversity in structure and associated species composition. Two tall open shrublands of Acacia pendula — R 5 Myall Woodlands and Flindersia maculosa — P 11 <b>Leopardwood</b> Open Shrublands and a woodland dominated by Callitris glaucophylla — P 6 White Cypress Pine Woodlands are included in the mapping. The current extent of native woody vegetation is 1. 2 million ha (29...|$|E
