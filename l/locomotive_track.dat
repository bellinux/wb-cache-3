The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (The canal's fiscal year runs from October through September.) This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and {{in the numbers of}} Panamax vessels passing through the canal, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009. Tonnage for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 320.6, 326.8 and 340.8 million PC/UMS tons carried on 13,660, 13,481 and 13,874 transits respectively.The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has invested nearly US$1 billion in widening and modernizing the canal, with the aim of increasing capacity by 20%.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the poor stationarity of traction locomotive during the operation mode switching, with rotor flux oriented vector control theory based on, torque model control strategy is adopted. It can overcome the DC bus pumping as Locomotive deceleration and barking. In this system, output torque can be controlled directly, experiments verify the system has good performance of stability and reliability, which can meet the traction locomotive control requirements. An Electric locomotive is one kind of important mining carry equipment for mines traction, the power drive gradually uses AC drives instead of DC drives[1]. The power source of the traction system mostly is {{in the end of}} the grid, for this reason, voltage fluctuations as the loads changing, and the power quality is poor too.

All <b>locomotives,</b> <b>track,</b> and accessories of the main product line function in rain and snow allowing nearly anyone to have an outdoor garden railroad.

Apparently, an LGB controller was once caught in a flood in early spring; not only was it completely submerged, but the water actually froze solid around it the next day when the temperature dropped. After the controller thawed out, it was taken inside and set next to a heater to dry and the product apparently worked fine, as if nothing had happened.|$|R
