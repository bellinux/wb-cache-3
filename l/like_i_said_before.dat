[...] Nairn scored the first regular season goal for the Reign during the team's first league match against Chicago Red Stars on April 14, 2013 with a diving header on a cross from forward, Liz Bogus. Nairn led the team in assists and was a leading-scorer. She finished the regular season with five assists and three goals.|$|E

"I hadn't {{gone far}} when I {{came to a}} place pretty much <b>like</b> this, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> and when <b>I</b> was lookin' at the view--for I'm fond of a fine view, it takes a man's mind off trappin' an' victuals somehow--I heerd a most awful screech, an' then another. A moment later an' the ornithologist busted out o' the bushes with his long legs goin' like the legs of a big water-wagtail. He was too fur off to see the look of his face, but his hair was {{tremendous}} to behold. When he saw the precipice before him he gave a most horrible yell, for {{he knew that he}} couldn't escape that way from whatever was chasin' him. I couldn't well help him, for there was a wide gully between him an' me, an' it was too fur off for a fair shot. Howsever, I stood ready. Suddenly I seed the critter face right about an' down on one knee like a pair o' broken compasses; up went the shot-gun, an' at the same moment out busted a great old grizzly b'ar from the bushes. Crack! went my rifle at once, but I could see that the ball didn't hurt him much, although it hit him fair on the head. Loadin' in hot haste, I obsarved that the ornithologist sat like a post till that b'ar was within six foot of him, when he let drive both barrels of his popgun straight into its face. Then he jumped a one side with a spurt like a grasshopper, an' the b'ar tumbled heels over head and got up with an angry growl to rub its face, then it made a savage rush for'ard and fell over a low bank, jumped up again, an' went slap agin a face of rock. I seed at once that it was blind. The small shot used by the critter for his leetle birds had put out both its eyes, an' it went blunderin' about while the ornithologist kep' well out of its way. I knew he was safe, so waited to see what he'd do, an' what d'ye think he did?" ...|$|R

I am very happy that we got him (Taulava). With him on the team, it improves our team in a flash. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> if we can fast-track things, we will.

5000|$|The band's sound {{has changed}} since the release of this EP, and the band {{acknowledges}} this change. Many fans like the sound from Glitz better than the band's LP, Whisper War, but the band realizes they had to mature at some point. Alex DeLeon {{had this to say}} about the change in the band's sound:"(We) have definitely grown from (the Glitz songs) and our music now is much different. Since then, us and our old guitarist have also gone our separate ways. We are now more soulful and poppy, I think I have finally found my niche and groove in this band and with the songs. Although, the new stuff is way different from our older material, I think that our old fans will still dig it. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> we just play the music we love and feel and hopefully people like it half as much as we do. I have been listening to a lot of Brian McKnight, Maroon 5, Joss Stone, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, and Robin Thicke lately." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gaffney {{is one of}} many bull {{riders who}} {{describe}} Little Yellow Jacket {{as one of the great}} bucking bulls in history. He believes his success was predestined. [...] "He had the heart of a champion," [...] Gaffney said. [...] "I think, he was born that way." [...] Little Yellow Jacket actually had the heart and all of the makings of a bull that a judge uses to mark a bull's score. [...] "He had intensity and power and, according to Gaffney, 'he was a full load.'" [...] Add to all of this his power that came from weighing between 1,700 to 1,800 pounds throughout his career. [...] "Nothing was in short supply for him," [...] said Gaffney, who described Little Yellow Jacket's first move out of the chute as being a [...] "slump jump" [...] that included a hop, skip and a hesitation. [...] "I had been on him several times previous to that final day, in Nampa, where I eventually got him rode," [...] Gaffney said. [...] "I had him the week before in Colorado Springs and he had that, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> that signature move ― that step out, hop and skip and kind of rock you back on your (butt) and then just bring you down over the front end." [...] He then explained, [...] "I really made an effort of over extenuating my posture when I left that day, in Nampa, and that was key because once he did get in the spin he still did wind up, have the kick and the speed and the power ― that old saying is 'you get tapped off' and I was there. [...] "I pulled a foot and helped myself out. I was feeling great and gave that aggressiveness that I want to have when I was in the position I was." [...] Thus, history was made on April 24, 2004, at the Idaho Center, in Nampa, Idaho."He was the ultimate bull," [...] Gaffney said. [...] "He had the attitude and the heart and everything else." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I am feeling so, so {{emotional}} because I {{had such}} a difficult season this year, with so many up and downs. I came here because VW phoned me {{to ask me to}} do the race, and I am sure some people were not 100 per cent sure that I was able to do it. Actually, today, I proved that I am still competitive. After such a difficult season to be on top again is unbelievable. It shows that you should keep fighting, and I am really proud of this victory especially after this difficult season. I think Jean-Karl drove an unbelievable race today. I am not saying this because I won, but he is in his first year here and I really struggled so much to overtake. I was 120 per cent on every corner of every lap, and I think he made a mistake. This allowed me to close a little bit the gap and get a little bit closer on the race track. This was his only mistake of the weekend and it cost him the victory because I was really pushing hard and I couldn't overtake him. He drove an excellent race, we had exactly the same car and he showed today that he is a fantastic and really talented driver - because it was really difficult for me today. I have the experience, it is my third Macau, it is his first Macau. He is sad, but I was sad last year, and I am the first one who can understand him, but if he is coming back he will win for sure. BeforeI came here, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I think everybody was thinking that I was pretty much dead. So re-opening my career with a victory in Macau will for sure help me. Nothing is done because it is a lot a question about money now. We will see next year if I have the chance to race in a professional way. I will probably take my chance. I will work with my management to sort things out and I am sure we will try to take the best option. We will see." [...] Edoardo Mortara, on a lap record and his life-changing Macau victory. After his victory in the qualification race, Vernay started from pole position with Ericsson starting alongside, with Mortara and Bottas on row two. Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars. Once again, Ericsson made an awful getaway, with Bottas and Mortara both slotting in behind a fast-starting Vernay. Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing the wall and the two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again nudging the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry on up the hill, until he crashed {{at the entrance to the}} Solitude Esses. His car rebounded off the wall, and into direct line of the rest of the field. No less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension. Also taken out in the incident were the third Carlin of Hartley, the Premas of Coletti and Zampieri, the Fortecs of Rosenzweig and McKenzie, and Ho. Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end. Vanthoor, with a damaged front wheel after his collision with Chilton, stopped just short of the accident site, and was thus able to continue in the race.|$|E
