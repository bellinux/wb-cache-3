40|$|Abstract: For an {{assembly}} line, {{it is necessary}} to minimize the cycle time for processing a partially ordered set of operations V = 1, [...] ., n on a set of m linearly ordered working stations. The number m of stations and the initial processing times t = (t 1, [...] ., tn) of the operations V are given. However, for a subset V ̃ ⊆ V of the manual operations j ∈ V ̃, it is impossible to fix the processing times tj for the whole life cycle of the assembly line. On the other hand, for each automated operation i ∈ V V ̃, the processing time ti is fixed. We investigate the stability of an optimal <b>line</b> <b>balance</b> b 0 of the assembly line with respect to variations of the processing times tj, j ∈ V ̃. It is shown how to calculate the stability radius ρb 0 (t) of an optimal <b>line</b> <b>balance</b> b 0, i. e., the maximal value of simultaneous independent variations of the processing times of the manual operations with keeping the optimality of the <b>line</b> <b>balance</b> b 0.

50|$|In {{practice}} {{it is not}} possible to obtain the quoted theoretical maximum throughput rate for machines in a placement system. It is necessary to derate the theoretical numbers to obtain realistic values, due to unexpected downtime, board load and unload time and machine configuration. Other factors include PWB size, component mix, and the requirement for more complex vision recognition for fine-pitch components. There are many techniques of derating. Global derating considers system-wide stops, slow-downs and set ups as well as machine factors. To calculate the amount of global or system derating, one should take the average of the number of total components placed per hour in a long period (i.e. an entire product shift). Regularly scheduled stops should be included when determining the level of global derating the system requires.Rigorous derating, which considers each piece of equipment in service for a particular product individually, must be conducted by specific machine model for the <b>line</b> <b>balancing.</b> Rigorous derating values are necessary for full optimization of the process.|$|E
5000|$|Grouping genetic {{algorithm}} (GGA) is an {{evolution of the}} GA where the focus is shifted from individual items, like in classical GAs, to groups or subset of items. The idea behind this GA evolution proposed by Emanuel Falkenauer is that solving some complex problems, a.k.a. clustering or partitioning problems where a set of items must be split into disjoint group of items in an optimal way, would better be achieved by making characteristics of the groups of items equivalent to genes. These kind of problems include bin packing, <b>line</b> <b>balancing,</b> clustering {{with respect to a}} distance measure, equal piles, etc., on which classic GAs proved to perform poorly. Making genes equivalent to groups implies chromosomes that are in general of variable length, and special genetic operators that manipulate whole groups of items. For bin packing in particular, a GGA hybridized with the Dominance Criterion of Martello and Toth, is arguably the best technique to date.|$|E
50|$|From {{the high}} speed machine, the board transits to a {{precision}} placement machine. These pick-and-place machines often use high resolution verification cameras and fine adjustment systems via high precision linear encoders on each axis to place parts more accurately than the high-speed machines. Furthermore, the precision placement machines {{are capable of}} handling larger or more irregularly shaped parts such as large package integrated circuits or packaged inductor coils and trimpots. Unlike the rapid placers, precision placers generally do not use turret mounted nozzles and instead rely on a gantry-supported moving head. These precision placers rely upon placement heads with relatively few pickup nozzles. The head sometimes has a laser identifier that scans a reflective marker on the PC Board to orient the head to the board. Parts are picked up from tape feeders or trays, scanned by a camera (on some machines), and then placed in the proper position on the board. Some machines also center the parts {{on the head with}} two arms that close to center the part; the head then rotates 90 degrees and the arms close again to center the part once more. The margin of error for some components is, in many cases, less than half a millimeter (less than 0.02 inches). The process is a little slower than rapid placement, necessitating careful <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> when setting up a job, lest the precision placement machine become a production bottleneck.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a stuffing box pressure equalization <b>line</b> (<b>balance</b> <b>line)</b> to lower stuffing box pressures.

In addition, the algorithms to balance the line, i. e. COMSOAL and the current factory method, are compared. The research enquiry is investigated by computer simulation. An experimental design with 3 factors, namely <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> methods, <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> algorithms, and conveyor speeds, are conducted to evaluate the significance ofthe factors measured {{by the number of}} stations, line efficiency, output, and throughput time. It is found that the number of stations used in the multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> is less than the single-model one.
