Recent years have seen these businesses increasingly showcased at farmers markets, popular street food events and food festivals including Birmingham Independent Food Fair.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds <b>like</b> <b>two</b> bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as <b>like</b> <b>two</b> coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E

5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together <b>like</b> <b>two</b> s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 Mets {{returned}} to the playoffs, but the Phillies, who finished in sixth place in the division with a 65–96 record, beat the Mets 8 times in 18 games, the third-best record against them of any team in the league. The Mets won their second division title in {{three years in a}} game against the Phillies, and <b>like</b> <b>two</b> years before, did it at home. In the postseason, the Mets lost to the eventual champion Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked <b>like</b> <b>two</b> Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, {{and one of them was}} purchased by a fan.|$|E

5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped <b>like</b> <b>two</b> opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E

The light generation volume is shaped <b>like</b> <b>two</b> intersecting cones, and the luminous intensity falls off exponentially moving towards the centre of the lamp. Xenon-mercury short-arc lamps have a bluish-white spectrum and extremely high UV output. These lamps are used primarily for UV curing applications, sterilizing objects, and generating ozone.|$|E
