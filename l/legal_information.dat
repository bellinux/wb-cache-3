25|$|Mercier, a Montreal journalist, {{started to}} realize how much {{corruption}} and integration into the community the group had one he began to follow one of the assault cases through the courts. The case was involving {{one of the young}} Dubois brothers and a merchant from St. Henri who had been beaten after he had refused to pay his daily receipt to the brothers’ hold up men. Mercier believed that the Dubois Brothers were getting help from someone on the inside as the victim was almost sentenced and the Dubois brother had only received a small fine. The Dubois Brothers also received permits, swung votes to which person they wanted through intimidation and were able to get judges to give reduced sentences. They had corrupted a journalist in order to have the journalist change information they needed and report information they wanted out but with his change of careers, due to the company finding out about his corruption, the Dubois Brothers turned him into their lawyer opening an office and giving them <b>legal</b> <b>information.</b> They were able to corrupt politicians, the police, judges and lawyers according to Mercier causing them a vast integration into society.|$|E
