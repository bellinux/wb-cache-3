5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, {{including}} Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde <b>lay</b> <b>the</b> Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north still <b>lay</b> <b>the</b> great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain.|$|E

A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.|$|E
