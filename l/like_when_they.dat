5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government officials will likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E
25|$|By X3, the X-Universe {{consists}} of around 160 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations {{and up to}} four gates. The game is open-ended, allowing the player to go where they <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> like, doing whatever they like; a player is limited only by their in-game status and resources. As such, a driving force {{of the game is}} to acquire credits (the universal currency) and status.|$|E
500|$|When Leslie {{notes to}} the camera crew {{that they seem to}} be getting along just <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> made love five years earlier, she realizes he was drunk then too. When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans to turn into a park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with The Triangle, Bachmann {{reflected on the}} album: [...] "When we first came out we had that energy. It's a weird thing that you can't put your finger on... I listened to Icky Mettle, and I almost cringe when I hear it. But what the people probably <b>liked</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> heard that record was the energy we were putting out." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966), Jim Shooter, 14 {{years old}} at the time, wrote his first Legion story. Soon thereafter, Shooter became the regular writer of the Legion stories, with Curt Swan, and later Win Mortimer, as artist. Shooter wrote the story in which Ferro Lad died – the first [...] "real" [...] death of a Legionnaire (although Lightning Lad had been {{believed}} dead for a while before) – and introduced many other enduring concepts, including the Fatal Five, Karate Kid, Princess Projectra, Shadow Lass, the Dark Circle, Mordru and the [...] "Adult Legion", a conjecture regarding what the Legionnaires would be <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> grew up.|$|E

5000|$|Organization: Mandler (1967) gave {{participants}} {{a pack of}} word {{cards and}} asked them to sort them into any number of piles using any system of categorisation <b>they</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> were later asked to recall as many of the words as they could, those who used more categories remembered more words. This study suggested that the organization of memory is one of its central aspects (Mandler, 2011).|$|R

50|$|Applicants {{felt that}} they had highest fit with an {{organization}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could add information not covered during the interview that they wanted to share.

Applicants like to be given contact information if follow up information is needed, the interviewer making eye contact, and asking if the applicant was comfortable.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{had never}} seen the like. He had never been in gentlefolks' rooms but when the carpets were all up, and the {{curtains}} down, and the furniture huddled together under a cloth, and the pictures covered with aprons and dusters; and he had often enough wondered what the rooms were <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were all ready for the quality to sit in. And now he saw, and he thought the sight very pretty.|$|E
60|$|He bids us {{pray for}} {{that because it}} will bring blessings. Blessings to every soul of man who desires to be good and true.

You see, the Spaniards seized these islands a little before they discovered Cuba, and I wanted {{to find out what the}} men who built these beautiful homes here were really <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had work on hand. As one would have fancied, the grave, ceremonious Don who posed as a most punctilious gentleman at home became a very different kind of person when he went to Mexico. The original Adam showed up there. It's a useful lesson to any one silly enough to idealise the man she is going to marry." ...|$|E

60|$|I had {{got back}} again to that rich and {{beautiful}} port where I had looked after Mercantile Jack, and I was walking up a hill there, on a wild March morning. My conversation with my official friend Pangloss, by whom I was accidentally accompanied, took this direction as we took the up-hill direction, because the object of my uncommercial journey was to see some discharged soldiers who had recently come home from India. There were men of HAVELOCK's among them; there were {{men who had been}} in many of the great battles of the great Indian campaign, among them; and I was curious to note what our discharged soldiers looked <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were done with.|$|E
60|$|Now that {{everyone}} had become Christian, and bad or worldly {{people were not}} afraid {{to belong to the}} Church for fear of persecution, there was often sin and evil among them. Many who grieved at this shut themselves up from the world in the most lonely places they could find—little islands, deep woods, mountain tops, or rocks, and the <b>like.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> lived alone they were called hermits, when there were many together they were called monks, and the women who thus lived were nuns. Many such monasteries there were in Greece, especially one upon Mount Athos—that peninsula that Xerxes tried to cut off—and most of these have continued even to our own time.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Mitchell 'ad a {{few words}} to say about it next day, but Gerty told 'er to save 'er breath for walking upstairs.

They went out looking at the shops, George thinking that that was the cheapest way of spending an evening, and they were as happy as possible till Gerty saw a brooch she liked so much in a window that he couldn't get 'er away.|$|E

60|$|How {{much more}} {{deceitful}} than her lover {{is the little}} nursery governess. The moment she comes into sight {{she looks at the}} post-office and sees him. Then she looks straight before her, and now she is observed, and he rushes across to her in a glory, and she starts--positively starts--as if he had taken her by surprise. Observe her hand rising suddenly to her wicked little heart. This is the moment when I stir my coffee violently. He gazes down at her in such rapture that he is in everybody's way, and as she takes his arm she gives it a little squeeze, and then away they strut, Mary doing nine-tenths of the talking. I fall to wondering what they will look <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> grow up.|$|E
6000|$|... 313. I {{also call}} all these fools or knaves, that have thus made it any thing of their {{business}} to affirm {{any of the things}} afore-named of me; namely, That I have been naught with other women, or the <b>like.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> have used the utmost of their endeavours, and made the fullest inquiry that they can, to prove against me truly, that there is any woman in heaven, or earth, or hell, that can say, I have at any time, in any place, by day or night, so much as attempted to be naught with them; and speak I thus to beg my enemies into a good esteem of me? No, not I: I will in this beg belief of no man: believe or disbelieve me in this, all is a-case to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not onreasonable; {{though she}} had her faults.

There was a little steel in her temper, it's true, and, as old Hutter is pretty much flint, they struck out sparks once-and-a-while; but, on the whole, they might be said to live amicable <b>like.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> did kindle, the listeners got some such insights into their past lives, as one gets into the darker parts of the woods, when a stray gleam of sunshine finds its way down to the roots of the trees. But Judith I shall always esteem, as it's recommend enough to one woman to be the mother of such a creatur' as her darter, Judith Hutter!" ...|$|E
