5|$|On May 8, 2003, Environmental Protection Agency {{recognized}} NASA as {{the first}} federal agency to directly use <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> to produce energy at one of its facilities—the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground {{was built}} between 1995 and 2004 over the former Sai Tso Wan Landfill. During the construction, the former {{landfill}} underwent {{a series of}} restoration works. A final capping layer was added to prevent leakage; a <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> control system was used to deploy methane from the decomposed rubbish as fuel, and a leachate management system was built to collect leachate for further processing. The recreation ground started its operation on 30 April 2004.|$|E
5|$|Biogas, or <b>landfill</b> <b>gas,</b> is a biofuel {{produced}} {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
50|$|As the {{smallest}} stable cyclic siloxane, D4 {{is one of}} the most abundant siloxanes in the environment, e.g. in <b>landfill</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Landfill</b> <b>gases</b> (LFG) are {{produced}} due to biodegradation of organic fraction of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) when water comes in contact with buried wastes. The conventional clay cover is still practiced to mitigate the percolation of water in landfills in India. Gas extraction systems in <b>landfill</b> for <b>gas</b> collection are used but are much expensive. Thus, “Phytocapping” technique {{can be one of}} the alternatives to mitigate <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> and to minimize percolation of water into the landfill. Indian plants with locally available soil and municipal solid waste can be tested for the purpose of methane mitigation, heavy metals remediation from leachate. Methane oxidation due to vegetation can be observed compared to non-vegetated landfill. Root zone methane concentrations can be monitored for the plant species...|$|R
25|$|Municipal biomass sources include {{solid waste}} and {{municipal}} wastewater. Decomposition of biomass produces gas that is 50% methane and 50% carbon dioxide. Thus, conversion of <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> to energy can reduce overall environmental impacts.|$|R
25|$|Gases are {{produced}} in landfills {{due to the}} anaerobic digestion by microbes. In a properly managed landfill this gas is collected and used. Its uses range from simple flaring to the <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> utilization and generation of electricity. <b>Landfill</b> <b>gas</b> monitoring alerts workers {{to the presence of}} a build-up of gases to a harmful level. In some countries, <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> recovery is extensive; in the United States, for example, more than 850 landfills have active <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> recovery systems.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic archaea are {{responsible}} for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include <b>landfill</b> <b>gas,</b> biogas, and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these {{are referred to as}} biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to enteric fermentation, particularly in cattle. <b>Landfill</b> <b>gas</b> is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an explosion hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. Biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like <b>landfill</b> <b>gas,</b> biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Biogas can be {{recovered}} from {{mechanical biological treatment}} waste processing systems. <b>Landfill</b> <b>gas,</b> a less clean form of biogas, is produced in landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential greenhouse gas.|$|E
5000|$|After these {{projects}} are operational, {{the company will}} have five [...] "landfill conversion facilities which capture and convert dangerous <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> to pipeline-quality renewable natural gas." [...] The gases will go to fueling transit buses.|$|R
50|$|SEPA's testing, {{analysis}} and interpretation of samples covers {{a wide range of}} environments throughout Scotland, including contaminated land, fresh and saline waters, soils and sediments, sewage and industrial effluents, leachates, fauna and biota, and <b>landfill</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Remediation efforts require {{continuous}} {{collection and}} treatment of <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> and liquids. Potentially injurious gases rise from decomposing garbage and organic matter; while water, seeping from trash, mixes with toxic compounds and creates leachate. The gas collection system extracts gas from deep inside the landfill and burns it. In 2002, EPA installed micro-turbines which convert <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> into electricity for operating site systems. Environmentally friendly, the micro-turbines send their emissions towards the gas treatment system, destroying all contaminants. For landfill liquids, a series of wells and pipes captures leachate, directing it towards a leachate treatment plant. After the treatment, the liquids filter into the sanitary sewer.|$|R
25|$|Renewable energy {{encompasses}} wind, biomass (such as <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> {{and sewage}} gas), hydropower, solar power (thermal and photovoltaic), geothermal, and ocean power. These renewable sources serve as alternatives to conventional power generation such as coal power, oil power, {{and natural gas}} power.|$|E
25|$|Qualifying {{renewable}} energy sources include solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave or tidal energy, biomass, or biomass-based waste products, including <b>landfill</b> <b>gas.</b> Qualifying systems are those installed after September 1999. The RPS applies to all investor-owned utilities. Municipal and cooperative utilities may voluntarily elect to offer customer choice.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is used as}} part of {{the process}} to treat biodegradable waste and sewage sludge. As part of an integrated waste management system, anaerobic digestion reduces the emission of <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as maize.|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} Epe landfill, all the {{landfills}} in Lagos are underlain by attenuative and compacted soils which {{can serve as}} seals and prevent further migration of <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> thereby enhancing their beneficiation potentials upon proper capping.|$|R
50|$|<b>Landfill</b> <b>gases</b> have an {{influence}} on climate change. The major components are CO2 and methane, {{both of which are}} greenhouse gas. In terms of global warming potential, methane is over 25 times more detrimental to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Landfills are the third largest source of methane in the US.|$|R
50|$|Final {{cover is}} a {{multilayered}} system of various materials which are primarily {{used to reduce}} the amount of storm water that will enter a landfill after closing. Proper final cover systems will also minimize the surface water on the liner system, resist erosion due to wind or runoff, control the migrations of <b>landfill</b> <b>gases,</b> and improve aesthetics.|$|R
25|$|Construction is {{underway}} for Velocys’ commercial reference plant incorporating its microchannel Fischer-Tropsch technology; ENVIA Energy's Oklahoma City GTL project being built adjacent to Waste Management's East Oak landfill site. The project is being financed by {{a joint venture}} between Waste Management, NRG Energy, Ventech and Velocys. The feedstock for this plant will be a combination of <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> and pipeline natural gas.|$|E
25|$|Grimsby is {{beginning}} to develop as a renewable energy centre, and generates more electricity from solar, wind, biomass and <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> {{than anywhere else in}} England. The town makes 28 per cent of the electricity it uses from green sources. Its proximity to the biggest cluster of offshore wind farms in Europe, have brought around 1,500 jobs to the area, most of these are in turbine maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{heat source}} may be {{provided}} by the combustion of a fuel and, since the combustion products do not mix with the working fluid and hence do not {{come into contact with}} the internal parts of the engine, a Stirling engine can run on fuels that would damage other engines types' internals, such as <b>landfill</b> <b>gas,</b> which may contain siloxane which can deposit abrasive silicon dioxide in conventional engines.|$|E
50|$|Sustainable {{harvesting}} and use {{of renewable}} resources (i.e., maintaining a positive renewal rate) can reduce air pollution, soil contamination, habitat destruction and land degradation. Biomass energy is derived from six distinct energy sources: garbage, wood, plants, waste, <b>landfill</b> <b>gases,</b> and alcohol fuels. Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy {{since the advent of}} burning wood to make fire, and wood remains the largest biomass energy source today.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{official}} fuel mix statistics {{by the state}} of Washington for Seattle City Light show approximately 89.6% hydroelectric, 4.3% nuclear, 3.6% wind, 0.9% coal, 0.9% other (including biomass, natural gas, petroleum and waste), and 0.7% <b>landfill</b> <b>gases.</b> City Light's portfolio of energy sources includes electricity purchased through long-term contracts with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The remaining power comes from a mixture of sources.|$|R
40|$|Estimating odor {{emissions}} from landfill sites {{is a complicated}} task because of the various chemical and biological species that exist in <b>landfill</b> <b>gases.</b> In this study, the relative concen-tration of ethanol and other odorous compounds emitted from the working surface at a land-fill in China was analyzed. Gas sampling was conducted at the landfill {{on a number of}} selected days from March 2012 to March 2014, which represented different period...|$|R
25|$|At {{the height}} of California's 2001 energy crisis, BWP {{unveiled}} a mini-power plant at its landfill. It marked the world's first commercial landfill power plant using Capstone microturbine technology. Ten microturbines run on naturally occurring <b>landfill</b> <b>gas,</b> producing 300 kilowatts of renewable energy for Burbank. That's enough energy to serve the daily needs of about 250 homes. The landfill {{is located in the}} Verdugo Mountains in the northeastern portion of the city.|$|E
25|$|Rotting {{food and}} other {{decaying}} organic waste allows methane and carbon dioxide to seep {{out of the ground}} and up into the air. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and can itself be a danger because it is flammable and potentially explosive. In properly managed landfills, gas is collected and utilized. This could range from simple flaring to <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> utilization. Carbon dioxide is the most widely produced greenhouse gas. It traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.|$|E
25|$|Apple Energy, LLC is {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016, Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity. In {{addition to the}} company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity. Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.|$|E
40|$|<b>Landfill</b> <b>gases,</b> {{predominantly}} methane {{and carbon}} dioxide, {{are produced by}} the biodegradation of organic wastes. Biodegradation occur, if the water comes {{in contact with the}} buried waste. Techniques such as clay capping are used to minimise percolation of water into the <b>landfill,</b> or <b>gas</b> collection system installed to reduce methane emission into the atmosphere. The use of clay cap has proven not effective in avoiding percolation of water and the gas extraction technique is found expensive for many landfills in Australia. Thus a new technique “Phytocapping ” is being trialled at Rockhampton’s Lakes Creek Landfill. Results from this study show that Phytocaps can reduce surface methane emission 4 to 5 times more than the adjacent un-vegetated site, and the thick cap (1400 mm) reduces surface methane emission 45 % more than the thin cap (700 mm). The root zone effects of 19 tree species on methane emission were also examined...|$|R
30|$|Methane {{is lighter}} than air and can {{accumulate}} beneath structures and buildings, resulting in vegetational stress and toxicity due to H 2 S and VOCs, corrosion due to CO 2 —created acidity, greenhouse gases and air emissions. It is explosive above 5 – 15  % by volume and causes subsurface migration offsite (up to 150  m). Nonetheless, attenuative and compacted soils serve as seals and can prevent further migration of <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> thereby enhancing their beneficiation potentials. All the landfill areas are underlain by these soils except in Epe.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, most {{landfills}} are monitored for {{at least}} 3 to 4 decades {{to ensure that no}} leachate or <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> escape into the community surrounding the landfill site. In contrast, bioreactor landfill are expected to decompose to level that does not require monitoring in less than a decade. Hence, the landfill land can be used for other purposes such as reforestation or parks, depending on the location at an earlier date. In addition, re-using leachate to moisturise the landfill filters it. Thus, less time and energy is required to process the leachate, making the process more efficient.|$|R
25|$|If {{materials}} are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed {{and used for}} electricity production. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with coal and natural gas While incineration produces more greenhouse gas emissions than landfilling, the waste plants are well-fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> is recovered for electricity production.|$|E
25|$|Landfills {{are often}} the most {{cost-efficient}} way to dispose of waste, especially in countries like the United States with large open spaces. While resource recovery and incineration both require extensive investments in infrastructure, and material recovery also requires extensive manpower to maintain, landfills have fewer fixed—or ongoing—costs, allowing them to compete favorably. In addition, <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> can be upgraded to natural gas—landfill gas utilization—which is a potential revenue stream. Another advantage is having a specific location for disposal that can be monitored, where waste can be processed to remove all recyclable materials before tipping.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and <b>landfill</b> <b>gas</b> recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} the research results on development national emissions {{factor for the}} Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) Source Category “ 6 A Solid Waste Disposal on Land”. The obtained results offer the opportunity to improve the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies and Emission Factors for assessing the GHG emissions originated from waste sector. The article contains relevant information on composition of <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> at managed and unmanaged solid waste disposal sites, {{as well as the}} municipal solid waste composition results, investigated during one year in the Republic of Moldova: from autumn, 2004 to summer, 2005...|$|R

50|$|Over the years, many {{communities}} {{have used the}} river banks as dumps to create levees that would keep the river from flooding adjacent lands during occasional years with heavy winter rains. Three dump sites about 2 mi upstream from the mouth came {{under the control of}} the Ventura Regional Sanitation District by 1988. The district used the <b>landfill</b> <b>gases</b> to produce electricity until 2001. As the landfill aged and its contents decomposed, the release of gas became intermittent and the gases from the recovery system are burned off in a flare. The defunct power plant was built just upstream of the Victoria Avenue bridge, the second crossing upstream from the ocean.|$|R
