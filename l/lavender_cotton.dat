50|$|Phytophthora tentaculata is a plant {{pathogen}} that causes root and stalk rot. It was first isolated in 1993 in a nursery in Germany infecting Chrysanthemum, Verbena and Delphinium ajacis. It {{has since been}} found infecting a Verbena in Majorca, Spain in June 2001 but {{was thought to be}} restricted to nurseries in Germany and the Netherlands. Other species have since been found to be infected, Santolina chamaecyparissus (<b>Lavender</b> <b>cotton)</b> in Spain in 2004, Gerbera jamesonii in Italy 2006, and Aucklandia lappa in China in 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{the experimental}} data of the extraction of the volatile oil from six aromatic plants (coriander, fennel, savoury, winter savoury, <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> and thyme) was performed using five mathematical models, based on differential mass balances. In all cases the extraction was internal diffusion controlled and the internal mass transfer coefficienty (k(s)) {{have been found to}} change with pressure, temperature and particle size. For fennel, savoury and <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender,</b> the external mass transfer and the equilibrium phase also influenced the second extraction period, since k(s) changed with the tested flow rates. In general, the axial dispersion coefficient could be neglected for the conditions studied, since Peclet numbers were high. On the other hand, the solute-matrix interaction had to be considered in order to ensure a satisfactory description {{of the experimental}} data...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lavender</b> <b>cotton</b> (Santolina chamaecyparissus L.) shoot cuttings, {{obtained}} from two-year-old mother plants, were rooted in five different media under an unheated foil tunnel. Two ready-made and widely recommended media were used: Hartmann peat substrate and Ceres peat-coconut substrate, {{as well as}} three prepared mixtures: high peat + mineral soil, high peat + perlite and high peat + sand. The influence of medium type {{on the number of}} rooted cuttings {{and the quality of the}} root system was assessed for two cultivation times during a three-year study after eight weeks from the date of cutting. As far as the ready-made rooting substrates are concerned, Ceres peat-coconut substrate turned out to be better when compared with the Hartmann substrate. The number of high quality rooted cuttings was larger when media containing high peat mixed with either mineral soil or sand were used in comparison with the mixture of high peat and perlite...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> {{has many}} {{potential}} uses. Most commonly, {{the flowers and}} leaves are made into a decoction used to expel intestinal parasites. An oil used in perfumery can also be extracted from the plant. Branches may be hung up in wardrobes to repel insects, and leaves are also suitable for use in pot pourri and in herbal tobacco substitutes.In cosmetics it {{is used as a}} tonic.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Great Plat" [...] {{combined}} the patterned {{features of a}} parterre with the hardy herbaceous planting espoused by Miss Jekyll. Lutyens also designed the orangery about 50m east of the main house between 1904–09, which is now Grade I listed, as are the garden walls, paving and steps on the south front of the house. On {{either side of the}} Great Plat are raised terraces with brick water channels. The eastern area is laid out as a Dutch garden laid out with perennial plants such as Large white flowering Yucca gloriosa as groups used vertical elements alternate with purple colored flowering dwarf Lavender (Lavandula), catmint (Nepeta) or silvery colored Zieste (Stachys), <b>Cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> (Santolina), China Rose (Rosa chinensis) or Fuchsia (Fuchsia magellanica).|$|R
40|$|The {{volatiles}} from Coriandrum sativum L., Satureja montana L., Santolina chamaecyparissus L., and Thymus vulgaris L. {{were isolated}} by hydrodistillation (essential oil) and supercritical fluid extraction (volatile oil). Their effect on seed germination and root and shoot {{growth of the}} surviving seedlings of four crops (Zea mays L., Triticum durum L., Pisum sativum L., and Lactuca sativa L.) and two weeds (Portulaca oleracea L. and Vicia sativa L.) was investigated and {{compared with those of}} two synthetic herbicides, Agrocide and Prowl. The volatile oils of thyme and <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> seemed to be promising alternatives to the synthetic herbicides because they were the least injurious to the crop species. The essential oil of winter savory, on the other hand, affected both crop and weeds and can be appropriate for uncultivated fields...|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} Fish indeed used very little {{gardening}} help. She squeezed her writing around working 18-hour days on developing {{and maintaining the}} garden, even doing dry stone walling and path-laying herself. Her silver garden caught {{the heat of the}} day, and her damp, shady garden used a stream that ran behind an old malthouse. The silver-leafed wormwood Artemisia absinthium 'Lambrook Silver' is still a popular variety. Other varieties named after her garden include the spurge Euphorbia characias ssp. wulfenii 'Lambrook Gold', the <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> Santolina chamaecyparissus 'Lambrook Silver', and the primrose Primula 'Lambrook Mauve'. She hunted out several rare old double forms and single and named coloured forms of primrose. There are varieties of Pulmonaria, Penstemon, Bergenia, Dicentra, Hebe, Euphorbia characias and Hemerocallis named after her. She is credited with aptly naming the variety Astrantia major subsp involucrata 'Shaggy' on discovering it in her garden.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the studies carried out in our laboratories on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of volatile oils from seven aromatic plants: pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.), fennel seeds (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), savory (Satureja fruticosa Béguinot), winter savory (Satureja montana L.), <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> (Santolina chamaecyparisus) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris), is presented. A flow apparatus with a 1 L extractor and two 0. 27 L separators was built to perform studies at temperatures ranging from 298 to 353 K and pressures up to 30. 0 MPa. The best compromise between yield and composition compared with hydrodistillation (HD) was achieved selecting the optimum experimental conditions of extraction and fractionation. The major differences between HD and SFE oils {{is the presence of}} a small percentage of cuticular waxes and the relative amount of thymoquinone, an oxygenated monoterpene with important biological properties, which is present in the oils from thyme and winter savory. On the other hand, the modeling of our data on supercritical extraction of volatile oil from pennyroyal is discussed using Sovová’s models. These models have been applied successfully to the other volatile oil extractions. Furthermore, other experimental studies involving supercritical CO 2 carried out in our laboratories are also mentioned...|$|R
5000|$|Bowles {{gave his}} name to upwards of forty {{varieties}} of plant, and there are others that originated with him. For example, he named a hellebore 'Gerrard Parker' after a local art master, Crocus tommasinianus 'Bobbo' after the boy who first spotted it and Rosmarinus officinalis 'Miss Jessopp's Upright' (Miss Jessopp's Upright Rosemary) after a gardening neighbour, Euphemia Jessopp, for whom he also named the small white Crocus x jessoppiae in 1924. Erysimum 'Bowles' Mauve' was among [...] "200 plants for 200 years" [...] chosen by the RHS to mark its bicentenary in 2004 and, {{to coincide with the}} hundredth anniversary of the Chelsea Flower Show in 2013, was shortlisted (from among introductions between 1973-83) as one of ten [...] "plants of the centenary". Other significant introductions included Viola 'Bowles' Black', <b>cotton</b> <b>lavender</b> 'Edward Bowles' (Santolina pinnata subsp. neopolitana), and Bowles' golden sedge (Carex stricta 'Aurea'), which he found on Wicken Fen and has been described by another doyen of plantsmen, Christopher Lloyd, as [...] "a plant to treasure, its colour changing in unexpected ways". Vita Sackville-West cited the yellow and brown Crocus chrysanthus 'E.A. Bowles' as among the first bulbs to flower in her garden at Sissinghurst in January or early February, while, in the nuttery there, Bowles' golden grass (Milium effusum 'Aureum') is interspersed in spring with wood anemones and white bluebells. Another spring plant, the slow growing Muscari (grape hyacinth) 'Bowles's Peacock', was commended by Richard Hobbs, holder of the British National Plant Collection of Muscari, as [...] "charming and small ... but with superb peacock-blue flowers, which in a pot are easily admired at close quarters".|$|R
