40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the problems/difficulties that academics in a Turkish university encounter while using English as a lingua franca. The data were garnered through survey questionnaires filled out by 27 academics based in a Turkish university in the southwest of Turkey. The findings demonstrated that academics dramatically needed and used English in non-native contexts and mainly with non-native speakers of English for various reasons and purposes. Moreover, {{it was found that}} participants experienced a large number of misunderstandings and difficulties in the use of English for work-related purposes, and they resented {{the fact that they had}} to take English proficiency exams for academic promotion. The results are discussed in relation to those of previous studies of similar scope. The study concludes with suggestions posed for the improvement of academics ’ verbal and academic writing skills and the issue of <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> <b>examination</b> policies...|$|E
30|$|Foreigners unskilled in Japanese {{may have}} had access to fewer {{information}} resources than respondents with Japanese language proficiency, but this {{did not have an}} impact on whether they were more or less likely to be confused due to conflicting or differing information. It may be expected that increasing information resources would increase the chances of encountering, and thus being confused by, conflicting or differing information, but the results found here showed little difference in the ratio of respondents who cited this information-gathering difficulty, regardless of nationality or <b>language</b> <b>proficiency.</b> <b>Examination</b> of information importance shows that, after the first day, concerns about radiation level and risk were predominant among all groups. Considering that respondents skilled in Japanese only were just as confused as respondents completely unskilled in Japanese, who were obtaining Japanese-language information through various means of unknown quality, then {{it stands to reason that}} this information gathering-related difficulty was not caused by the media mode or language used, but that the original information was the source of confusion and conflict. Previous nuclear disasters have demonstrated the need for accurate, timely, and transparent information dissemination during a crisis (Lester 1983). In the case of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, failure to meet these standards may have further compounded the difficulties faced by foreigners residing in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{widespread}} application of <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> <b>examinations</b> and their gate-keeping function, {{it is of}} utmost importance for researchers and test developers alike to identify and eliminate any facet of these tests which could be a potential source of invalidity or unreliability.

The present body of literature indicates {{that there has been}} no investigation into the order of skills in <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> tests. What is more, two established <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> tests, namely the International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) present their skills in different sequences.

40|$|The {{intent of}} the present study was to examine the {{strength}} of the relationship between <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> in English and the 9 types of intelligences.

The primary objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between multiple intelligences and <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> among the Iranian Ph.

The second objective of the study was to explore whether one of the intelligence types or a combination of intelligences are predictors of <b>language</b> <b>proficiency.</b> Finally, the study aims at investigating the effect of sex on <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> and types of intelligences. To fulfill this objective, a 100 -item <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> test and a 90 -item multiple intelligences questionnaire were distributed among 278 male and female Iranians taking part in the Ph. D Entrance exam to Shiraz University. The data gathered were analyzed descriptively utilizing central tendency measures (mean and standard deviation). Moreover, the collected data were analyzed inferentially using correlation, regression analysis and independent t-test. The results indicated that there is not a significant relationship between <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> and the combination of intelligences in general and the types of intelligences in particular. Similarly, the results revealed no significant difference between male and female participants regarding <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> and types of intelligences.

It also attempted to determine whether there was a difference in English <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> across Vietnamese <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> as well as whether there was a relationship between English <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> and Vietnamese <b>language</b> <b>proficiency.</b> One hundred twenty six subjects were selected based on the fact that they had participated in the said bilingual education program and that the scores they had obtained on the Language Assessment Scales (LAS) which measured their proficiency in English and Vietnamese were available for both kindergarten and second grade. These children's school records were examined in view of noting their LAS scores, sexes, birthdates, and SES. Statistical treatments used were analysis of covariance and Spearman's rho correlation. Tukey post-hoc tests were calculated where appropriate. The results indicated that: (1) for Vietnamese <b>language</b> <b>proficiency,</b> girls scored higher than boys, middle- and high-SES students scored higher than low-SES students, but no significant difference was found between the scores of older students and the scores of their younger counterparts; (2) for English <b>language</b> <b>proficiency,</b> females scored higher than males, older students scored higher than younger students, and scores increased linearly with SES increment; (3) there was a significant difference in English <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> across Vietnamese <b>language</b> proficiency; (4) there was a significant positive relationship between English <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> and Vietnamese <b>language</b> proficiency; and (5) the subjects enjoyed a marked gain in English but suffered a significant loss in Vietnamese...|$|R

Additionally, the study attempted to fmd out the relationship between the ESL learners' overall <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> performance and their frequency of use of reading strategies of the overall and three sub-categories of reading strategies namely, global, problem- solving and support strategies. The research design is a cross sectional survey research which used the Survey of Reading Strategies (SORS) questionnaire developed by Mokhtari and Sheorey (2002). The independent variable was the <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> of the ESL learners and the dependent variable was the metacognitive awareness of ESL learners, measured in terms of their ratings of the three sub-categories of reading strategies. Data obtained from the questionnaire were analyzed using One-way ANOVA, independent sample t-test and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. The findings of this study revealed that the high and low <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> students were active reading strategy users. High <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> students used problem solving strategies with higher frequency than global and support strategies while low <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> students used problem -solving and support strategies with higher frequency than the global strategies. Next, the results seemed to suggest that high and low <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> students used somewhat similar frequency of overall, global, problem-solving and support strategies.

Undergraduate Engineering students attending a university in Hong Kong were asked to assess the English <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> of their peers - among other assessment criteria, such as preparation, content, organisation, and delivery - as exhibited in the seminar, oral presentation and written report of an integrated group project.
