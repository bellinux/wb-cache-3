5|$|In 1917, the 6th Aero Squadron {{was created}} in Honolulu, with Captain John F. Currey as its commander. Although 50 were assigned, only 49 arrived; one deserted en route.

When Currey was transferred to Washington, command of the squadron was given to Captain John B. Brooks and then Major Hugh J. Knerr, who built hangars and a runway.

An informal association of businesses, the Joppenbergh Mountain Advisory Group (JMAG), began working with the WVLT to create a land use policy. The WVLT began having monthly meetings with the JMAG, and with town and state departments; its stated goal was to combine Joppenbergh's development with the rehabilitation of the adjacent railroad trestle and subsequent expansion of the rail trail. In late September 2012, the WVLT held a hearing on a proposed land use plan that would allow deer hunting on the property beginning in 2013, and would prohibit entry into several caves on the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Community land trust: A {{community}} <b>land</b> <b>trust</b> is {{a nonprofit}} corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing, community gardens, civic buildings, commercial spaces and other community assets {{on behalf of a}} community. “CLTs” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability, economic diversity and local access to essential services.|$|E

40|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} open {{space in the}} United States have been conducted by <b>land</b> <b>trusts,</b> government programs, and private landowners. Most <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> protect specific resources or environmental values, such as wetlands or Civil War battlefields. In a time of economic recession, budget cuts, and reduced funding from grants and private donations, land conservation efforts have waned. Yet, the need for conservation is as pertinent as ever, and the opportunity is ripe given the 150 th Anniversary of the Civil War (2011 - 2015). Collaborative partnerships between <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> and environmental organizations can lessen these hardships and present mutually beneficial opportunities for conservation. This project presents a strategic GIS approach, the Connecting Future Partners Process (CFPP), which layers “shapefiles ” of various environmental values within federally-defined Civil War battlefield boundaries. By utilizing this process, historic <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> can identify environmental values present on battlefields and establish partnerships with conservatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} based on my closing {{presentation}} at the Washburn Law Journal 2 ̆ 7 s 2015 symposium entitled “The Future of Housing [...] Equity, Stability and Sustainability. ” It explores how land banks and <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> promote social goods, including socioeconomic integration, by connecting with and shielding against, respectively, market forces. Both engage in stewardship of land. Land banks take temporary ownership of vacant, abandoned properties {{in order to make}} them available for productive use. <b>Land</b> <b>trusts</b> hold <b>land</b> indefinitely to ensure a social purpose is met. Community <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> hold <b>land</b> for a purpose that is responsive to the human environment, often permanently affordable housing in areas where affordable housing is rare to nonexistent. Land banks encourage people with choices to move into neighborhoods beset by abandonment and poverty. Community <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> allow lower-income residents to become long-term members of neighborhoods otherwise inaccessible to them. Land banks reduce transaction costs to get the market moving. <b>Land</b> <b>trusts</b> increase transaction costs in order to protect affordable housing and other public goods against elimination by market-driven transfers. The use by these two publicly minded real estate market interventions of opposing tools in starkly different types of neighborhoods raises the following questions: First, do they meet somewhere in the middle? Second, does sustaining neighborhoods of choice hinge on the handoff of some critical mass of real property from land banks to <b>land</b> <b>trusts?</b> The answers to these both questions are negative, if we focus our attention solely on the work done directly by land banks and <b>land</b> <b>trusts.</b> The neighborhoods that warrant the housing stewardship activity of <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> are just too different from those needing the help of land banks to talk of a continuum of care between the two poles of community land resource control. But, if land banking and its conceptual counterpart, “land trusting”, are thought of more broadly as the strategic adjustment of transaction costs for the promotion of social goods, such as residential socioeconomic integration, then an array of intermediate possibilities present themselves. The essay begins with a brief examination of the importance of residential socioeconomic integration and how it might be advanced appropriately. After looking at some misconceptions about the market’s role in segregating neighborhoods by class, I then explore how land banks and <b>land</b> <b>trusts</b> intervene to move neighborhoods toward a healthy diversity. The essay concludes with a discussion of land banking and, particularly, <b>land</b> <b>trusting</b> as alternatives to formal stewardship that nevertheless also foster the needed diversity of housing types, land tenure types, and ultimately, resident socioeconomic status to sustain neighborhoods of choice...|$|R
