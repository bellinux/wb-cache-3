5|$|INS Shakti is {{the third}} tanker {{of the same name}} of the navy. The first Shakti had a {{displacement}} of 3,000 tonnes and was commissioned during World War II. She was in service with the Indian Navy from 29 January 1954 and decommissioned on 31 December 1967; whilst the second Shakti, a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> built by a German yard, was commissioned on 21 February 1976 and decommissioned on 21 July 2007, after more than 31 years of naval service.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt {{excavating}} a dried-up lagoon {{known as}} Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces {{of an ancient}} harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles. And in 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what {{is believed to be}} the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King Cheops on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of Suez).|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{structures}} are available: small <b>ships,</b> <b>large</b> <b>ships,</b> and stations. The size, resource requirements, {{and availability of}} blocks depends {{on the type of}} structure they are attached to. Small ships do not allow assemblers or refineries, whereas <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> cannot use gatling guns, instead using the AI-controlled gatling or missile turret variations. Blocks attached to a small ship are considerably smaller and require fewer resources than those attached to <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> or stations (for example, light armor requires 25 steel plates on a station, but only one on a small ship). Stations use the same blocks as <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> and can be converted into <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> using a control terminal; however, they are immobile and can instead be physically anchored to terrain voxels.|$|R

5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> heading {{directly}} {{towards them}} {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated {{it would take a}} year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E

5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and tugboat assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest salvage tugboat capable of towing a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> off a beach, Salvage Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. Salvage Chief had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar for an additional two days. Salvage Chief did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the grounding occurred.|$|E
5|$|ODST {{takes place}} in the 26th century, when humans under the command of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) are locked in a war with a theocratic {{alliance}} of alien races known as the Covenant. During the events of the 2004 video game Halo 2, the Covenant discover the location of Earth and launch an assault on the city of New Mombasa in Africa. Though the UNSC manages to repel most of the fleet, a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> hovers over the city, depositing an invasion force. The ship eventually retreats via a slipspace jump, creating a massive shockwave. While the rest of Halo 2s storyline follows the ship to an ancient installation identical to the first Halo, ODST focuses on the aftermath of the shockwave, while the Covenant still occupy the city.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> came within sight directly ahead.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ultra <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} of scale economies, but whether they successfully getting into service depend on cargo flow, shipping distance, port efficiency and constraints, etc. The study constructs a two-objective model to determine the optimal ship size and sailings frequency and analyze the shipping economies of ultra <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> by minimizing shipping costs and inventory costs. The results show the Pareto optimal solutions of the two-objective model and optimal ship size and sailings frequency with respect to each level of inventory costs and shipping costs. The sensitivity analysis shows the optimal ship tends to be large as route flow increases. Furthermore, the economies and possibility of using ultra <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> tend to increase, as port efficiency improves, shipping distance increases, the ports of call decreases, or the relative costs of <b>large</b> <b>ships</b> decrease.

5|$|The Action of 31 March 1800 was a naval {{engagement}} of the French Revolutionary Wars fought between a Royal Navy squadron and a French Navy ship {{of the line}} off Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. By March 1800 Valletta, the Maltese capital, had been under siege for eighteen months and food supplies were severely depleted, a problem exacerbated by the interception and defeat of a French replenishment convoy in mid-February. In an effort to simultaneously obtain help from France and {{reduce the number of}} personnel maintained in the city, the naval commander on the island, Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, ordered his subordinate Contre-amiral Denis Decrès to put to sea with the <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> of the line Guillaume Tell, which had arrived in the port shortly before the siege began in September 1798. Over 900 men were carried aboard the ship, which was to sail for Toulon under cover of darkness on 30 March.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{maintained}} a blockade off Malta {{since the beginning}} of the siege, ostensibly led by Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson, who by March 1800 was defying a direct order from his superior officer Lord Keith by remaining in Palermo with his lover Emma, Lady Hamilton. In his absence the blockade was under the command of Captain Manley Dixon of HMS Lion and Nelson's flag captain Sir Edward Berry, who were notified of Decrés' departure by the patrolling frigate HMS Penelope and gave chase. The <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> of the line was initially only attacked by Penelope, which manoeuvered around Guillaume Tells stern, causing severe damage and delaying the French ship sufficiently for Berry to bring his squadron into action. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Decrés continued to fight for more than three hours, fighting off two British ships but ultimately unable to resist the combined weight of Berry's attacks. Casualties and damage were severe on both sides, and the defiance of the French ship was celebrated in both countries as a brave defence against overwhelming odds.|$|E
5|$|The Hawkins-class cruiser was {{designed}} to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a <b>large</b> <b>ship</b> to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders. The design was also given high freeboard {{to allow it to}} maintain its speed in heavy weather. Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.|$|E
50|$|When {{she entered}} service Oriana {{was one of}} the <b>largest</b> cruise <b>ships</b> in the world, and the <b>largest</b> <b>ship</b> built in Germany since 1914.
