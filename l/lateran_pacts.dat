25|$|The pope {{resides in}} Vatican City, an {{independent}} state within the city of Rome, {{set up by the}} 1929 <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts</b> between the Holy See and Italy. As popes were sovereigns of the papal states (754–1870), so do they exercise absolute civil authority in the microstate of Vatican City since 1929.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations for the {{settlement}} of the Roman Question began in 1926 between the government of Italy and the Holy See, and in 1929 they culminated in the agreements of the three <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts,</b> signed for King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini and for Pope Pius XI by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri in the Lateran Palace (hence the name by which they are known).|$|E
25|$|Not {{only has}} the Temporal power of the Papacy, lost since 1870, been {{restored}} {{in the form of}} the Vatican City State, but also much new research has been done on the subject of Papal coins, and with it many new discoveries. Moreover, the whole legal and operational basis for the issue of papal coinage has been twice substantially modified, once by the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts</b> and once with the introduction of the euro.|$|E
40|$|Richard Bosworth, in this superb {{biography}} of Italy’s Duce, {{is critical of}} ‘the great man in history’ and intentionalist approaches that vest all power, initiative and control in leaders, {{particularly in the case}} of Mussolini, a leader more driven by, and adaptive to, events than driven by them. Unlike Hitler, the Duce was impelled by no credo, his Fascism was vague, undefined and opportunistic, his politics governed not by ideology but by compromises and deals, by short-term tactics not long-term strategies and goals. Thus the man whose only consistent position until he came to power may have been virulent and vociferous anti-clericalism signed the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pact</b> with the papacy in 1929. Bosworth would, however, agree with the young Robert Menzies that Mussolini was a charismatic leader...|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{making such}} attacks, Mussolini tried to win popular support by appeasing the Catholic {{majority}} in Italy. In 1924, Mussolini saw {{that three of}} his children were given communion. In 1925, he had a priest perform a religious marriage ceremony {{for himself and his}} wife Rachele, whom he had married in a civil ceremony 10 years earlier. On 11 February 1929, he signed a concordat and treaty with the Roman Catholic Church. Under the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pact,</b> Vatican City was granted independent statehood and placed under Church law—rather than Italian law—and the Catholic religion was recognized as Italy's state religion. The Church also regained authority over marriage, Catholicism could be taught in all secondary schools, birth control and freemasonry were banned, and the clergy received subsidies from the state and was exempted from taxation. Pope Pius XI praised Mussolini, and the official Catholic newspaper pronounced [...] "Italy has been given back to God and God to Italy." ...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{explores the}} {{features}} {{and the history}} of the Catholic educational and mass market publishing as a militant model of religious education, which especially underwent a relevant structural and organizational development under the Fascism after the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pact.</b> Through the analysis of sources and documents, such as the editorial lists of the publishers, the data contained in the Catholic journal «Il Ragguaglio» – which was founded in 1930 with the aim of coordinating the action and growth of Catholic publishers – but especially through the meticulous examination of the yearly directory of the Italian publications (Catalogo generale della libreria italiana) as to the period 1920 - 1938, the publishing houses and their production are mapped in detail, in a first categorization of the enterprises, the distribution network, the religious institutions and orders directly involved in publishing activity, the literary genres, first and new ones, and so on. The results, and the limits, of this attempt of establishing and modernizing the educational mass market Catholic publishing are analyzed. In this framework, the role played by this publishing emerges, as well as that played by the culture and the ethical-religious and educational model which were linked to it, also in relation to, and opposition to, the process of nationalization and the educational strategies for the masses instituted by the totalitarian fascist regime...|$|R
25|$|The {{provisional}} {{capital of}} Italy had been Florence since 1865. After defeating the papal forces in 1870, the Italian government {{moved to the}} banks of the Tiber a year later. Victor Emmanuel installed himself in the Quirinal Palace. Rome became once again, {{for the first time in}} thirteen centuries, the capital city of a united Italy. Rome was unusual among capital cities only in that it contained the power of the pope and a small parcel of land (Vatican City) beyond national control. This anomaly was not formally resolved until the <b>Lateran</b> <b>pacts</b> of 1929.|$|E
25|$|As the Socialist Party {{moved to}} more {{moderate}} positions, {{the ranks of}} the PCI increased in numbers, and the Communist party surpassed the Christian Democracy (DC) in the European election of 1984, barely two days after Berlinguer's death, that likely drew sympathy in the population. Huge crowds attended Berlinguer's funeral. That was to be the only time the Christian Democracy was not the largest party in a nationwide election they participated in. In 1984, the Craxi government revised the 1927 <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts</b> with the Vatican, which concluded the role of Catholicism as Italy's state religion.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the capture}} of Rome in 1870 from French forces of Napoleon III, Papal troops and Zouaves, {{relations}} between Italy and the Vatican remained sour for the next sixty years with the Popes declaring themselves to be prisoners in the Vatican. The Roman Catholic Church frequently protested {{the actions of the}} secular and anticlerical-influenced Italian governments, refused to meet with envoys from the King and urged Roman Catholics not to vote in Italian elections. It would not be until 1929 that positive relations would be restored between the Kingdom of Italy and the Vatican after the signing of the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1929, Mussolini {{signed a}} <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pact</b> with the Roman Catholic Church. Intended {{to set down}} {{the rights of the}} Catholic Church in Italy, it was signed one year before the {{founding}} of the School of Fascist Mysticism. The religious component recalls the experiments in government-created religions during the French Revolution: Joseph Fouché's attempts to install a Cult of Reason, and Maximilien Robespierre's attempts to install a Cult of the Supreme Being, during the Reign of Terror. Fouché and Robespierre had the goal of eliminating the Roman Catholic Church in France and replacing it with a secular, state-organized religion. Mussolini denied that this was the goal of Fascist mysticism, or that it in any way represented a conflict with Roman Catholicism. At the time, nearly all Italians belonged to Roman Catholic Church, and the Pope was Italian and Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church ran nearly all schools, hospitals, and many other institutions in Italy, and was powerful around the world. Shortly after the founding of the School of Fascist Mysticism, Mussolini began suppression of Catholic organizations, including the laypersons' Azione Cattolica organization, deemed to be interfering in the cultural and social activities {{under the control of the}} state. In 1931, the Pope was compelled to issue a public, formal papal encyclical, Non abbiamo bisogno, denouncing the [...] "pagan idolatry of the state" [...] being introduced to Italy by Mussolini.|$|R
25|$|In 1929 Mussolini {{signed the}} <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts</b> with the Roman Catholic Church (with which Italy {{had been in}} {{conflict}} since the annexation of Rome in 1870), leading {{to the formation of}} the tiny independent state of Vatican City. He was initially on friendly terms with France and Britain, but the situation changed in 1935–36, when Italy invaded Ethiopian Empire despite their opposition (Second Italo-Abyssinian War); because of this and of the ideological affinities with the Nazi party led by Hitler. It was a main part of the Axis Powers in World War II with allies being Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany as the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis.|$|E
25|$|Pius IX was {{the last}} pope {{who was also a}} secular ruler as monarch of the Papal States, ruling over he ruled over some 3 million people. In 1870 the Papal States were seized by force of arms by the newly founded Kingdom of Italy. The matter was only {{resolved}} in international law by the Lateran Treaty (also known as the <b>Lateran</b> <b>Pacts</b> or Lateran Accords), agreed in 1929 between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See, the latter receiving financial compensation for the loss of the Papal States, in substitution of which Italy recognized the Vatican City State as an independent territorial state which is the expression of a sovereign entity in International law known as the Holy See. The latter, as before, maintains diplomatic relations with many other states.|$|E
