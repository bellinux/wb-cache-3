5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only <b>look</b> <b>for</b> food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not <b>look</b> <b>for</b> food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
