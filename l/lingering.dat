40|$|We {{propose a}} framework, called <b>LINGER,</b> {{for the support}} of {{co-operative}} creation and distribution of information contents in ve-hicular networks. The goal of <b>LINGER</b> is to dispatch and confine information in localized areas of a mobile network with no infras-tructure availability and minimal protocol overhead. <b>LINGER</b> se-lects mobile nodes in a distributed, cooperative way and lets them act as “information bearers”, ensuring uninterrupted information availability to as many nodes as possible in a desired region. Sim-ulation results in vehicular scenarios with realistic node mobility prove that <b>LINGER</b> successfully drives information toward a tar-get area from a far away source and keeps it local with negligible overhead. Further tests with a beaconing application leveraging the <b>LINGER</b> framework show that a mobile information bearer may be as reliable as an infrastructure-based access point in providing ser-vice to users. Finally, in a large-scale scenario, <b>LINGER</b> is proven to be effective for delay-tolerant broadcast applications. 1...|$|R

5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done.
