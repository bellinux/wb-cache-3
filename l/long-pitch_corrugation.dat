40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper lies on {{monitoring}} of the track sections with rail corrugations caused by wheel sliding. Short waves on the running surface of the rail head on low rail are typical for this defect. <b>Long-pitch</b> <b>corrugation</b> is a significant cause of vibration and noise pollution in the railway infrastructure. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the formation and development of this imperfection of the rails. Measurements were carried out in curves of small radii on several tracks in the Czech Republic. In addition to the measurement of the surface of the rail head a number of supplementary parameters was evaluated for each section, such as curve radius, superelevation, track gauge etc. and the speed of passing trains as well. This paper describes rail corrugation defect and its development. Our early results are presented in the Conclusions...|$|E
