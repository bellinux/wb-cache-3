The Copenhagen convention is more precise in terms of uniquely defining the specific suits denoted than standard Michaels cuebids.

This goes against the Law of Total Tricks, which states the three level {{should have at least}} a nine card fit.|$|R

40|$|Producers in a {{perfectly}} competitive industry compete to obtain shelf {{space at the}} retail <b>level.</b> <b>Barring</b> contract observability problems, slotting allowances are observed in equilibrium. Producers charge a high wholesale price, but give back their profits via up-front payments to retailers. However, if the individual supplier-retailer wholesale price terms are unobservable by competitors, then resale price maintenance will be seen, but the coverage will not be universal. The equilibria can be ranked by the usual social welfare criteria. Resale price maintenance, though worse than simple marginal cost wholesale pricing, yields greater surplus than the slotting allowance equilibrium...|$|R

In some states, {{they may also be}} barred from voting after a sentence has been completed and, at the federal <b>level,</b> <b>barred</b> from owning firearms, like all felons.|$|R
