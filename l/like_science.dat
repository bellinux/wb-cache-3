He has published more than 400 papers and articles in journals <b>like</b> <b>Science,</b> Nature, The New England Journal of Medicine and many more. His research has been recognized with numerous awards over the years, including being named as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. One of his publications, Sensation and Perception, (co-authored with Lawrence Ward and James T.

25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes {{the idea that there}} could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects <b>like</b> <b>science.</b> Sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{primary education}} in national-type primary schools, some students from SJK(C) {{may choose to}} study in a Chinese independent high school. Chinese independent high schools are funded mostly by the Malaysian Chinese public, with UCSCAM (United Chinese School Committees Association of Malaysia, also known as Dong Jiao Zong after its Chinese acronym) as the overall co-ordination body. Students in Chinese independent high schools study in three junior middle levels and three senior middle levels, similar to the secondary schools systems in mainland China and Taiwan; each level usually takes one year. Like the students in public secondary schools, students in Chinese independent high schools are put into several streams <b>like</b> <b>Science</b> or Art/Commerce in the senior middle levels. However, some schools recently provided unique streams like Electrical Engineering, Food and Beverage Studies or Arts Design. The medium of instruction in Chinese independent high schools is Mandarin and uses simplified Chinese characters in writing.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1940 Louis Silberkleit, {{who already}} had two titles on the market (Science Fiction and Future Fiction, both edited by Charles Hornig), added a third, titled Science Fiction Quarterly, with the {{intention}} of including a full-length novel in every issue. [...] Silberkleit obtained reprint rights to some of the lead novels from Gernsback's Science Wonder Quarterly that had appeared a decade earlier. [...] The new magazine was added to Hornig's responsibilities, {{but by the end of}} the year Hornig had moved to California and all three titles were given to Robert W. Lowndes to edit.

500|$|Stephen Russell Davies {{was born}} on 27 April 1963 at Mount Pleasant Hospital in Swansea. His father, Vivian Davies (1925–2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929–1999), were teachers. Davies was the {{youngest}} of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode. He described his mother's experience as [...] "literally ... <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction" [...] and an early inspiration for his writing career. As a child, Davies was almost always referred to by his middle name. He grew up in a household that [...] "never switched the TV off" [...] until after closedown, and he subsequently became immersed in dramas such as I, Claudius and Doctor Who. One of his first memories, at the age of three, was the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Tenth Planet. He was also an avid cartoonist and comics enthusiast, and purchased series such as Asterix and Peanuts.|$|E
500|$|Students take {{classes to}} be {{effective}} Christian leaders, including [...] "Bible study and 'soul-winning', English, speech, drama, and music", which are seen as important to [...] "read and proclaim the Word". Academy teachers establish their authority through discipline and teach [...] "the truth" [...] as established by [...] "facts" [...] from the Bible. Bible passages {{are associated with the}} subject matter in a process called [...] "integration". The academy uses science books from Bob Jones University as an alternative to books that promote secular humanism, which is described as [...] "the 'official religion' of the public school system". The Bob Jones science books associate the Bible with science, and often comment the relationship between God's intelligence and the intricacies of nature. Classes <b>like</b> <b>science,</b> social studies, and math are viewed as less important for the goal of making Christian professionals apart from their training to do [...] "everything a sinner can do, better". Some classes are [...] "memorization and recitation"-focused, reflecting an inelastic view of knowledge, which the academy believes to be fixed as based in biblical inerrancy. Their biggest external influence on curriculum is new books, which may affect how classes are taught, though the content ("the truth") remains the same.|$|E

2500|$|Acquiring the {{television}} rights to Frank Herbert's original six Dune novels, Executive producer Richard P. Rubinstein envisioned the complex material adapted in a miniseries format, {{as he had}} done previously with Stephen King's The Stand and The Langoliers. He told The New York Times in 2003, [...] "I have found there's a wonderful marriage to be had between long, complicated books and {{the television}} mini-series. There are some books that just can't be squeezed into a two-hour movie." [...] Around the same time Rubenstein was first developing the material, the Sci Fi Channel's president, Bonnie Hammer, was spearheading a campaign for the channel to produce [...] "blockbuster miniseries on a regular basis". Frank Herbert's Dune was the first in 2000, followed by Steven Spielberg's Taken in 2002, and Frank Herbert's Children of Dune and Battlestar Galactica [...] in 2003. Rubenstein called his two Dune miniseries [...] "science fiction for people who don't ordinarily <b>like</b> <b>science</b> fiction" [...] and suggested that [...] "the Dune saga tends to appeal to women in part because it features powerful female characters".|$|E
2500|$|According to Oxford University Press, the {{inequality}} {{toward women}} is “endorsed within cultures and entrenched within institutions [...] hold power to reproduce that inequality”. There are various gendered barriers in social networks that prevent women from working in male-dominated fields and top management jobs. Social networks {{are based on}} the cultural beliefs such as schemas and stereotypes. According to social psychology studies, top management jobs {{are more likely to have}} incumbent schemas that favor “an achievement-oriented aggressiveness and emotional toughness that is distinctly male in character”. Certain gender stereotypes assume women to be less worthy and less competent than men so they are not qualified for the top management jobs. However, when the women try to prove their competence and power, they often face obstacles. They are likely to be seen as dislikable and untrustworthy when they are excelled at tasks viewed as masculine. Also, women are likely to face the denial of credit for their achievements. Social networks and gender stereotypes provide many contributions to the injustices that women have to face in their workplace and the limitations when they try to advance in male-dominated jobs and top management jobs. Women in professions <b>like</b> <b>science,</b> technology, and other related industries are likely to encounter the gendered barriers in their careers. Based on the meritocratic explanations of gendered inequality, “as long as the people accept the mechanisms that produce unequal outcomes,” all the outcomes will be legitimated in the society. When women try to deny the stereotypes and the discriminations by becoming “competent, integrated, well-liked”, the society is more likely to look at these impressions as selfishness or “being a whiner”. In the United States, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides opportunities for women to achieve to a wide range of education programs and activities by prohibiting sex discrimination. The law states “No person in the United Stated shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance”.|$|E

[...] Now, no doubt a little learning is a dangerous thing, when it makes some shallow conceited fellow fancy he knows all about everything. But I can truly say, that the more you really do know about this earth, the more your astonishment at it will grow--for the more you understand about trees and animals, clouds and seas, the less you will find you understand about them. The more you read about them and watch them, the more infinitely and inexpressibly wonderful you find them, and the more you get humbled and awestruck at the boundless wisdom and love of Our Father in Heaven, and Christ the Word of God who planned and made this wondrous world, and the Holy Spirit of God who is working this wondrous world. I tell you, my friends, that as St. Paul says, [...] "If a man will be wise, let him become a fool that he may be wise." [...] Let him go about feeling how short-sighted, and stupid, and ignorant he is--and how infinitely wise Christ the Word of God is, by whom all things were made, to whom all belong. Let him go about wondering day and night, always astonished more and more, as everything he sees gives him some fresh proof of the glory of God; till he falls down on his knees and cries out with the Psalmist, [...] "Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that Thou so regardest him?" [...] When I consider Thy Heavens, even the work of Thine hands, I say, What is man? and yet Thou madest man to have dominion over the works of Thine hands, and hast put all things in subjection under his feet--the fowl of the air and the fishes of the sea, and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas. O Lord, our Governor, how excellent is Thy name in all the world. In comparison of Thee what is man's wisdom? What is man's power? Thou alone art glorious, for by Thee are all things, and for Thee they were made, and are created, that Thou mightest rejoice in the works of Thy own hands, and bless the creatures which Thy love has made! ...|$|E
