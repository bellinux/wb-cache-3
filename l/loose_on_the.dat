5|$|In {{the early}} days of Wyoming most of the land was in public domain, which was open to stock raising as an open range and farmlands for homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open range by large ranches. Each spring, round-ups were held to {{separate}} the cattle belonging to different ranches. Before a roundup, an orphan or stray calf was sometimes surreptitiously branded, which was the common way to identify the cow's owners. Lands and water rights were usually distributed to whoever settled the property first, and farmers and ranchers had to respect these boundaries (the doctrine was known as Prior Appropriation). However, as more and more homesteaders moved into Wyoming, competition for land and water soon enveloped the state, and the cattle companies reacted by monopolizing large areas of the open range to prevent newcomers from using it. They also forbade their employees from owning cattle for fear of additional competition, and threatened anyone they suspected to be rustlers.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, with Speed behind him. Two laps later, Harvick had moved into fourth position; Jamie McMurray, who began the race in eleventh, had moved up four positions to seventh place. By lap six, Ambrose began to reduce the lead of Johnson, and Martin got <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same lap but regained control of his car. On lap nine, Stewart passed Martin for fourth. One lap later, Ambrose passed Johnson to become the new race leader. On lap 13, Johnson retook the lead off Ambrose. After having made three positions early, Harvick moved up into second position by passing Ambrose. On lap 16, Ambrose's car suffered a flat tire and came into the pit road.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{protection}} {{training is}} unnecessary {{because they are}} natural guard dogs and always have been. As with every breed, obedience training is very important. The Neapolitan is very tolerant of pain due to the breed's early fighting background and the fact the skin is <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body, so {{it is important to}} routinely check for health problems, as a Neapolitan may not behave differently when injured or ill. They also are renowned for drooling especially after drinking or if they get excited.|$|E
25|$|Vic Edelbrock Sr. {{was born}} in a small farming {{community}} of Eudora, Kansas in 1913. After the family grocery store burned down in 1927, he left school at the age of 14 to help support the family by ferrying Model T Fords from Wichita to the many outlying farms in the area. The frequent stops to replace parts that shook <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> region's dirt roads made him an expert in impromptu repair work. Soon after, he found work in a local repair shop, working as an auto mechanic.|$|E

Only one of these modern narrow-gauge diesels, the last narrow-gauge diesel locomotives built for a North American customer, was delivered to the White Pass. The five diesels sold to Colombia were not used there as they were too heavy, and were re-acquired in 1999 â€“ one was nearly lost at sea during a storm as it broke <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barge and slowly rolled towards the edge.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 BBC Radio 5 {{broadcast}} {{reported the}} site is contaminated with toxic chemicals including benzene hexachloride and mercury, held in open containers or <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.

In 2009, the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based pollution monitoring lab, released test results showing pesticide groundwater contamination up to three kilometres from the factory. Also in 2009, the BBC took a water sample from a frequently used hand pump, located just north of the plant. The sample, tested in UK, was found to contain 1,000 times the World Health Organization's recommended maximum amount of carbon tetrachloride, a carcinogenic toxin.|$|E
25|$|After Goro's {{defeat at}} the hands of {{eventual}} champion Liu Kang, all hell breaks <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, and Scorpion, one of only seven tournament survivors, teams up with Sub-Zero and the thunder god Raiden in holding back Shang Tsung's army, then kills Sub-Zero and disappears. In Mortal Kombat II (1993), Scorpion learns that Sub-Zero has somehow returned, and plans to compete in the second tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao Kahn. He tracks his nemesis down but notices, in the process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in battle. Scorpion realizes {{that this is not the}} original Sub-Zero but instead his younger brother, who was sent to complete the elder Sub-Zero's failed mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, Scorpion vows to serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother.|$|E

25|$|Double world {{champion}} Alain Prost's McLaren {{had been having}} problems all weekend with the Frenchman finding the McLaren MP4/5 hard to set up, and when his two stop strategy was ruined by a clutch failure, {{he knew he had}} to continue the race having made just one of his scheduled two pit stops on the notoriously abrasive Rio circuit. He finished second. Nigel Mansell secured a surprising win for the Scuderia, with no problems despite ongoing gearbox faults all weekend and a lack of winter testing (Mansell also had the steering wheel come <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back straight and had to have it changed in his final stop, which luckily was scheduled for the end of that lap). The final step of the podium was taken by local MaurÃ­cio Gugelmin. Grand Prix debutant Johnny Herbert, Derek Warwick and Alessandro Nannini scored the remaining points. Warwick was desperately unlucky. He lost over 20 seconds in a slow pit stop and only finished 17.8 seconds behind Mansell at the finish suggesting a win (which would have been both his and Arrows' first) or podium place had gone begging.|$|E
25|$|The British Grand Prix {{was seen}} as a turning point, being {{dominated}} by Red Bull with Vettel leading home Webber, in dry conditions. Button was not on the podium {{for the first time this}} season, finishing sixth. Red Bull also dominated the following German Grand Prix with Webber taking his first pole and race win, despite being given a drive through penalty. Ferrari were also showing signs of improvement, Felipe Massa finishing third in what would be his final race of the season. He was hospitalised after being hit on the helmet by a flying spring when he was travelling at 162 mph in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. The accident overshadowed the race, with a lightly-fueled Fernando Alonso on pole retiring early in the race, which was won by Lewis Hamilton. Jaime Alguersuari finished his dÃ©but race ahead of Buemi, the Toro Rosso test driver replacing the fired SÃ©bastien Bourdais. Post-race, the Renault team received a suspension for the European Grand Prix, for an incident where Alonso's tyre came <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> race track following a pit-stop error. An appeal overturned the decision, and the team raced in Valencia.|$|E
25|$|Schutz' next venture, however, was a {{financial}} disaster. In January 1577 Schutz assisted Giovanni Battista Agnello, a Venetian then living in London, in the assaying {{of a black}} stone which had been picked up lying <b>loose</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of Hall's Island by Robert Garrard during Sir Martin Frobisher's first voyage to the Canadian Arctic {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage. Agnello's claim that the stone was gold-bearing (apparently confirmed or at least accepted by Schutz) caused government officials to authorise a second voyage by Frobisher to Baffin Island. Schutz accompanied Frobisher's ships to Meta Incognita, where he is said to have found a 'great ruby stone' which Frobisher promised to present to the Queen in Schutz's name, but which was apparently not heard of again after it came into Frobisher's hands. In August 1577 Schutz, Robert Denham and Gregory Bona, in a brick-lined furnace built for the purpose, assayed black ore mine at the Countess of Warwick's Island, (now Kodlunarn Island) in Frobisher Bay. Back in England, between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 Schutz performed three 'great proofes' of the black ore brought back from this second voyage. Agnello and Kranich were also brought in to assay the ore, and Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. It was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to Â£50 per ton.|$|E
