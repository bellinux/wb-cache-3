5|$|Kelsey wanders {{from the}} tour and {{attempts}} to phone Maria, but disturbs an unknown beast, the Bane Mother, to the annoyance of the staff, to which Wormwood orders the alarms switched off and Sarah Jane killed. Maria attempts to phone Kelsey, but sets off the alarms again, causing the Archetype to escape, transferring the focus upon him. Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, and although they are surprised to see each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey. When they arrive back on Bannerman Road, Sarah warns Maria not to get involved as her <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> dangerous.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} spring, Johnny Town-mouse pays Timmy Willie a visit. He complains of the dampness {{and finds}} {{such things as}} cows and lawnmowers frightening. He returns to {{the city in the}} hamper of vegetables after telling Timmy country <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> quiet. The tale ends with the author stating her own preference for country living.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{the great}} hall, Guthere is {{planning}} to launch the first attack. Garulf counsels him not to do so, saying that Guthere's <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> valuable. Guthere proceeds anyway, and asks who holds that door. Sigeferth replies to Guthere's taunt from within, showing that the attack is being mounted at Door A. Sigeferth {{is said to be}} a lord of the Secgena; in Widsith a Sæferð or Sasferth is said to be lord of the Sycges or Secgan, apparently referring to the same character. The two sides fight at that door, and Garulf, the counsellor, and many of the attackers die. It is not clear what happens to Guthere whom he counselled. Garulf the counsellor is said to be Guthlaf's son; it is not clear whether or not this is the same Guthlaf who holds the door as a defender at Door B.|$|E
25|$|He was {{ten years}} old when his {{grandfather}} died and his mother ascended to the throne. His childhood and youth were lived quietly, as he was a mere infante in the shadow of his elder brother José, Prince of Brazil and 14th Duke of Braganza, the heir-apparent to the throne. Folklore has John as a rather uncultured youth, but according to Jorge Pedreira e Costa, he received as rigorous an education as José did. Still, a French ambassador of the time painted him in unfavorable colors, seeing him as hesitant and dim. The record of this period of his <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> vague for historians to form any definitive picture. Little is known of the substance of his education. He surely received instruction in religion, law, French, and etiquette, and would presumably have learned history through reading the works of Duarte Nunes de Leão and João de Barros.|$|E
500|$|Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times says [...] "By positing a Johnsonesque {{power broker}} and master schemer who wields cabalistic {{influence}} behind the scenes, House of Cards assigns order and purpose to what, in real <b>life,</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> often just an endless, baffling tick-tack-toe stalemate." [...] NPR's Eric Deggans says that Underwood [...] "blends velvety charm and mesmerizing menace {{like no other}} character on television".|$|E

60|$|Harvey {{had never}} heard Disko talk so long, and {{collapsed}} with burning cheeks; but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he was taught at school, and <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> short {{to keep track of}} every lie along the coast.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{accounts}} {{attribute the}} nickname Sleepy to a blood pressure disorder or narcolepsy.

500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dawkin's Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit analogizes the above.

Dawkin's counter-argument is that such a God would himself be complex — the [...] "Ultimate" [...] Boeing 747 — and therefore require a designer.|$|E

60|$|So Rose {{had grown}} {{away from her}} friend. She felt it dimly the first week. She felt it vividly {{on the morning after}} the concert, and it troubled her.

60|$|But Flora had {{remained}} firm. <b>Life</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> short! She {{did not get}} on well with Clara.

2500|$|Mirroring Seurat's work, Rimbaud {{writes of}} the circus sideshow as a {{reflection}} of contemporary life: [...] "their bantering or their terror lasts one minute, or whole months." [...] Robert Herbert suggested an alternative poem that more closely parallels the mood of Parade, Jules Laforgue's Soir de carnaval: [...] "Oh, <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> sad, incurably sad / At festivals here and there I have always sobbed: / 'Vanity, vanity, all is only vanity!' /—Then I think: where are the ashes of the psalmist?" [...] Seurat almost certainly knew both poems, writes Herbert, [...] "and either—or both—could have inspired him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people." [...] He later alluded to Cameron in his review of Me and Orson Welles, where he described witnessing a famous director chew out an assistant for his own error.|$|E
2500|$|The record, by all accounts, sold poorly and {{received}} mixed reviews {{in the music}} press. Hoppus and Barker continued touring on the Honda Civic Tour and commenced work on a second +44 album. The August 2008 death of friend and producer Jerry Finn deeply affected Hoppus, who referred to Finn as a lifelong friend and mentor. The following month, Barker and collaborator Adam Goldstein (aka DJ AM), {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving Barker and Goldstein the only survivors. Hoppus immediately boarded a plane to the burn unit, and DeLonge reconnected with the duo under the tragic circumstances. When the band regrouped in the studio for a day, past acrimony vanished with near immediacy. Regarding these experiences, Hoppus wrote, [...] "The events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> short." [...] In February 2009, the band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{approached}} and Tarzan removed the weapon and hurled {{it after the}} other. At the mention of his name Tarzan had noted the sickly pallor that overspread {{the features of the}} Hun.

5000|$|It appears however that army <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> {{much for}} him, as the [...] "rigors of march" [...] {{eventually}} obliged him {{to apply to}} be posted away from front line duty.

2500|$|The socialite {{introduced}} a lifestyle brand in 2004, helping {{to design a}} purse collection for the Japanese label Samantha Thavasa. A jewelry line designed by Hilton was sold on Amazon.com; {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "create a line that was beautiful and very high quality, yet affordable and available to everyone". The jewelry was [...] "inspired by Hilton's personal style—feminine, flirtatious and glamorous—with heart, star and cross motifs." [...] In the fall of 2004 Hilton released an autobiography co-written by Merle Ginsberg, , with color photos and advice on life as an heiress. The book was seventh on The New York Times Best Seller list. Her quote, [...] "Dress cute wherever you go; <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> short to blend in", was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in September 2009. Hilton was involved in creating a perfume line by Parlux Fragrances. Originally planned for a small release, high demand led to increased availability by December 2004. Its introduction was followed by a 47-percent increase in Parlux sales, primarily of the Hilton-branded perfume. After this success Parlux released several more perfumes with her name, including fragrances for men. Hilton published her second book, , in 2005; that year she {{introduced a}}nother fragrance, Just Me.|$|E
2500|$|Five of {{the songs}} on Armageddon are written by Sebastian alone, while the others {{have at least one}} co-writer. Sebastian began writing songs which appear on the album almost two years before its release, and {{performed}} two of them, [...] "Summer Love" [...] and [...] "Keeper", while touring as a support act on Lionel Richie's Australian and New Zealand tour in March 2011. Both are pop songs, with [...] "Keeper" [...] having a reggae feel. [...] "Summer Love" [...] is about bittersweet feelings for a lost love, and [...] "Keeper" [...] is about finding that special love, the one who is a keeper. [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy", released as the lead single in November 2012, is an upbeat pop song Sebastian wrote after he encountered an angry motorist in Los Angeles. Discussing the inspiration for the track he explained he could sometimes be caught up {{in a little bit of}} [...] "glass half empty" [...] in his life, and wrote the song as a reminder to himself and hopefully to others that <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> short to stress about the small things. Sebastian showcased two more songs, [...] "Amnesia" [...] and [...] "Armageddon", at the [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] media launch in December 2011. [...] "Amnesia" [...] is a soulful pop ballad about the anguish of coping with a broken relationship. Sebastian says of the power ballad [...] "Armageddon", [...] "The title track might sound pretty dark, but it's actually about not taking love for granted, and living like tomorrow is the last day on earth".|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I {{think that one of the}} most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, and it will be a very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public <b>life,</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E
