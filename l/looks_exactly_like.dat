5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E

25|$|Bicycle {{historian}} David V. Herlihy {{documents that}} Lallement {{claimed to have}} created the pedal bicycle in Paris in 1863. He had seen someone riding a draisine in 1862 then originally {{came up with the}} idea to add pedals to it. It is a fact that he filed the earliest and only patent for a pedal-driven bicycle, in the US in 1866. Lallement's patent drawing shows a machine which <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Johnson's draisine, but with the pedals and rotary cranks attached to the front wheel hub, and a thin piece of iron over the top of the frame to act as a spring supporting the seat, for a slightly more comfortable ride.|$|E

She’s just brilliant and fearless and she does about 90 per cent of the stunts. I think part of the element of Darla is how strong she is and how fierce she can be and Lisa definitely adds to that element.

Jerry explains he subconsciously painted Leslie while thinking about powerful women. Instead of being embarrassed, Leslie feels empowered by the painting.

500|$|As for the insanity, {{historians have}} noted that many {{religious}} leaders the past have exhibited behavior that <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> insanity. Flanigan emphasizes that Riel exemplified the tradition of religious mystics involved in politics, especially those with {{a sense that the}} world was about to be totally transformed by their religious vision. In his case it meant his delivering the Métis from colonial domination.

500|$|... "Momentum Deferred" [...] {{was written}} by screenwriters Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller. In the first several drafts of the episode, it was {{initially}} called [...] "This is the Night Mail," [...] {{which was based on}} a poem by W.H. Auden. The episode completed the [...] "gun arc" [...] storyline, which began with Olivia hurtling out of her SUV in the season premiere and being too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery, and ended with the killing of the shapeshifter posing as Charlie Francis. Miller and Stentz elaborated, [...] "I think it's Jeff Pinkner who described the first several episodes as the gun arc. Because really the gun played out until Olivia was whole again. Her actions with the gun in all of those episodes symbolized where she was on the journey. And it culminates in her being able to use it to kill someone who <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> her best friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Mermaid supervising animators {{included}} Glen Keane and Mark Henn on Ariel, Duncan Marjoribanks on Sebastian, Andreas Deja on King Triton, and Ruben Aquino on Ursula. Originally, Keane {{had been}} asked to work on Ursula, as he had established a reputation for drawing large, powerful figures, such as the bear in The Fox and the Hound (1981) and Professor Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective (1986). Keane, however, was assigned as one of the two lead artists on the petite Ariel and oversaw the [...] "Part of Your World" [...] musical number. He jokingly stated that his wife <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Ariel [...] "without the fins." [...] The character's body type and personality were based upon that of Alyssa Milano, then starring on TV's Who's the Boss? and the effect of her hair underwater was based on both footage of Sally Ride when she was in space, and scenes of Stoner in a pool for guidance in animating Ariel's swimming.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E
500|$|In , Jason Thompson {{referred}} to Monkey Punch's original manga as [...] "a crazy, groovy 1960s world of dynamite and backstabbing, hippies and gangsters", and considered it [...] "a fascinating homage to Mad magazine and a four star example of comics as pure comedy." [...] He rated the series {{four out of}} four stars. Allen Divers of Anime News Network (ANN) praised the strong writing and action; however, {{he felt that the}} art was too primitive. Otaku USAs Daryl Surat was also put off by the art, saying he couldn't tell most character apart and had a hard time figuring out what he was looking at. In The Rough Guide to Manga, Jason S. Yadao highlighted the example of how Lupin wearing a hat <b>looks</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Zenigata. However, he considered it a successful plot device in once chapter that while it may take several attempts to understand, eventually pays off. He included the series in his list of 50 essential manga. Many of the first volumes of the English edition of the Lupin III manga released by Tokyopop made it onto ICv2's list of top 50 graphic novels, as well as later volumes from the series.|$|E

She talks of how she can feel Angel, and slowly her memory begins to return. In the episode [...] "First Impressions", Angel begins having romantic dreams about his maker. The dreams sap his strength. In [...] "Dear Boy", Angel is shocked to see Darla walking the streets.

She claims she is DeEtta Kramer. When she runs away from him, she walks outside into the sunlight, meaning Darla has not only been resurrected, but is now human. However, Darla and Lindsey's plan to convert Angel back to evil fails. In the end, Wolfram & Hart bring in Drusilla to make Darla a vampire again after her syphilis returns and she starts to die. Ironically, she is turned back into a vampire as she accepts her fate after a failed attempt by Angel to save her. Drusilla and Darla unsuccessfully attack Angel and leave Los Angeles.|$|E
