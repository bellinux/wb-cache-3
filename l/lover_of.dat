5|$|Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as {{the type}} {{specimen}} {{of a variety}} of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).|$|E
