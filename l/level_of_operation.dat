Macros are completely integrated with a full-scale interpreted compile-time language that also guides processing. TeX's macro <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> is lexical, but it is a built-in facility of TeX, that makes use of syntax interpretation. Comparing with most widely used lexical preprocessors like M4, it differs slightly, as the body of a macro gets tokenized at definition time, that is, it is not completely raw text. Except for a few very special cases, this gives the same behaviour. The TeX macro language has been successfully used to extend TeX to, for instance, LaTeX and ConTeXt.|$|E

Metal working industry {{is one of}} the nine industry categories appeared m Sri Lanka. Operation Management practices are identified as one of the advance management techniques that Can be applied in order to Increase the industrial output and productivity. This research Has been carried out in order to find out the current <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management practices Implemented Sn Lankan metal working Industry.

The questionnaire was developed to cover seen COI' 1 ponents <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management, i. e. operations strategy, product design, process selection and capacity planning, facility lay out, 1 ob design, inventory management, and other management techniques. The expectation of the questionnaire was to have qualitative data of the sample companies. Data from thirty-mo metal working companies were taken for this study. The results were analyzed in two ways First the results were analyzed under individual components <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management in order to explore the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management practices implementation under each component. In addition, the results were analyzed as a hole, to analyze the overall <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management practices implementation in Sri Lankan metal working industries. According to the results the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management implementation in SriLankan metal working lndust 1 y is relatively low. Compared to each component, facility lay out is the lowest component in implementation It was revealed that there is a relationship between operations management implementation and duration in the business. According to the analyses the duration of II to 15 years can be considered as matured period <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management implementation in the metal working industry. That is the period, which recorded the highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management pr: 1 ctices The results show that there 1 s a relationship between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management implementation and the number of employees in an organization It was revealed that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management implementation increases with the number of employees.

50|$|When {{operated}} as an accelerator for fixed-target experiments, the SPS can accelerate a beam to 450 GeV, {{before the}} beam is extracted within seconds (or {{a small fraction}} of a second when used to accelerate a bunches for injection into LHC). However, when operated as a collider, the beam has to be stored in the beam line for hours and the dipole magnets of the accelerator must keep a constant magnetic field for a longer time. To prevent overheating the magnets, the SpS would only accelerate the beams to a center-of-mass energy of 315 GeV. This limit could however be overcome by ramping the magnets between 100 GeV and the machines maximum capacity of 450 GeV.The SpS would accelerate the beams to 450 GeV, keeping them as this energy for a time limited by the heating of the magnets, then decelerate the beams to 100 GeV. The pulsing was operated {{in such a way that}} the average dispersion of power in the magnets did not exceed the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> at 315 GeV.
