40|$|Abstract [...] This {{research}} {{proposes a}} {{use of an}} agent-based intelligent simulator to numerically examine {{the influence of a}} transmission <b>line</b> <b>limit</b> on the dynamics of a wholesale power market. In the proposed simulator, all agents are equipped with learning capabilities. The power market is structured by multiple zones which are connected by transmission lines. The following business implications are found in this study. (a) The learning speed of reinforcement learning depends upon a dynamic change of market price. (b) The market price and volatility of electricity is increased by a <b>line</b> <b>limit.</b> The increase is influenced by not only a capacity limit but also a zone structure and an amount of demand. (c) The average price and volatility of electricity are influenced by the number of capacity-limited links. (d) There is no major difference between day ahead (DA) and real time (RT) markets in terms of the influence of a <b>line</b> <b>limit.</b> (e) There is a slightly increasing trend in average DA and RT market prices along with the percentage reduction of a current <b>line</b> <b>limit...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new sensor {{provides}} an absolute position measurement. A schematic {{view of a}} motorized linear-translation stage that contains, at each end, an electronic unit that functions as both (1) a non-contact sensor that measures the absolute position of the stage and (2) a non-contact equivalent of a limit switch that is tripped when the stage reaches the nominal <b>limit</b> <b>position.</b> The need for such an absolute linear position-sensor/limit-sensor unit arises {{in the case of}} a linear-translation stage that is part of a larger system in which the actual stopping position of the stage (relative to the nominal <b>limit</b> <b>position)</b> must be known. Because inertia inevitably causes the stage to run somewhat past the nominal <b>limit</b> <b>position,</b> tripping of a standard limit switch or other limit sensor does not provide the required indication of the actual stopping position.
