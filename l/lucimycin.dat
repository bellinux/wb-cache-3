50|$|<b>Lucimycin</b> (INN, {{also known}} as lucensomycin and etruscomycin) is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic synthesized by the bacterium Streptomyces lucensis. It belongs {{to the group of}} polyene antimycotics and was first isolated in the 1960s. It has seen only limited clinical use.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} identification, cloning, {{heterologous}} expression and functional characterization {{of a novel}} antifungal peptide named <b>lucimycin</b> from the common green bottle fly Lucilia sericata. The <b>lucimycin</b> cDNA was isolated from a library of genes induced during the innate immune response in L. sericata larvae, which are used as therapeutic maggots. The peptide comprises 77 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 8. 2 kDa and a pI of 6. 6. It is predicted to contain a zinc-binding motif and to form a random coil, lacking beta-sheets or other secondary structures. <b>Lucimycin</b> was active against fungi from the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota, {{in addition to the}} oomycete Phytophtora parasitica, but it was inactive against bacteria. A mutant version of <b>lucimycin,</b> lacking the four C-terminal amino acid residues, displayed 40 -fold lower activity. The activity of <b>lucimycin</b> against a number of highly-destructive plant pathogens could be exploited to produce transgenic crops that are resistant against fungal diseases...|$|E
40|$|The larvae of {{the common}} green bottle fly Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) {{have been used for}} centuries to promote wound healing, but the {{molecular}} basis of their antimicrobial, debridement and healing functions remains largely unknown. The analysis of differential gene expression in specific larval tissues before and after immune challenge could be used to identify key molecular factors, but the most sensitive and reproducible method qRT-PCR requires validated reference genes. We therefore selected 10 candidate reference genes encoding products from different functional classes (18 S rRNA, 28 S rRNA, actin, beta-tubulin, RPS 3, RPLP 0, EF 1 alpha, PKA, GAPDH and GST 1). Two widely applied algorithms (GeNorm and Normfinder) were used to analyze reference gene candidates in different larval tissues associated with secretion, digestion, and antimicrobial activity (midgut, hindgut, salivary glands, crop and fat body). The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was then used to boost the larval immune system and the stability of reference gene expression was tested in comparison to three immune genes (<b>lucimycin,</b> defensin- 1 and attacin- 2), which target different pathogen classes. We observed no differential expression of the antifungal peptide <b>lucimycin,</b> whereas the representative targeting Gram-positive bacteria (defensin- 1) was upregulated in salivary glands, crop, nerve ganglion and reached its maximum in fat body (up to 300 -fold). The strongest upregulation in all immune challenged tissues (over 50, 000 -fold induction in the fat body) was monitored for attacin- 2, the representative targeting Gramnegative bacteria. Here we identified and validated a set of reference genes that allows the accurate normalization of gene expression in specific tissues of L. sericata after immune challenge...|$|E
40|$|The larvae of {{the common}} green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) produce {{antibacterial}} secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. Recent developments in insect biotechnology {{have made it possible}} to use these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. Here, we report the application of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins secreted into wounds. Our data confirm that L. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of AMPs. L. sericata AMPs include not only lucifensin and <b>lucimycin</b> but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. We identified 47 genes encoding putative AMPs and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis. Against Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Micrococcus luteus (Gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected AMPs were tested in combination. The AMPs that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages...|$|E
