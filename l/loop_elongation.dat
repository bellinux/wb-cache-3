40|$|AbstractFcabs (Fc antigen binding) are crystallizable {{fragments}} of IgG where the C-terminal structural loops of the CH 3 domain are engineered for antigen binding. For {{the design of}} libraries it is beneficial to know positions that will permit <b>loop</b> <b>elongation</b> to increase the potential interaction surface with antigen. However, the insertion of additional loop residues might impair the immunoglobulin fold. In the present work we have probed whether stabilizing mutations flanking the randomized and elongated loop region {{improve the quality of}} Fcab libraries. In detail, 13 libraries were constructed having the C-terminal part of the EF loop randomized and carrying additional residues (1, 2, 3, 5 or 10, respectively) in the absence and presence of two flanking mutations. The latter have been demonstrated to increase the thermal stability of the CH 3 domain of the respective solubly expressed proteins. Assessment of the stability of the libraries expressed on the surface of yeast cells by flow cytometry demonstrated that <b>loop</b> <b>elongation</b> was considerably better tolerated in the stabilized libraries. By using in silico loop reconstruction and mimicking randomization together with MD simulations the underlying molecular dynamics were investigated. In the presence of stabilizing stem residues the backbone flexibility of the engineered EF loop as well as the fluctuation between its accessible conformations were decreased. In addition the CD loop (but not the AB loop) and most of the framework regions were rigidified. The obtained data are discussed with respect to the design of Fcabs and available data on the relation between flexibility and affinity of CDR loops in Ig-like molecules...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we have {{determined}} the thermodynamic {{parameters of the}} reduction of four different variants of Thiobacillus versutus amicyanin by electrochemical techniques. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters were determined of the low-pH conformational change involving protonation of the C-terminal histidine ligand and the concomitant dissociation of this histidine from the Cu(I) ion. In these variants, the native C-terminal loop containing the Cys, His, and Met copper ligands has been replaced with the corresponding polypeptide segments of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin, Populus nigra plastocyanin, Alcaligenes faecalis S- 6 pseudoazurin, and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans rusticyanin. For the reduction reaction, each loop invariably holds an entropic memory of the mother protein. The thermodynamics of the low-pH transition vary in a fashion that is species-dependent. When present, the memory effect again shows a large entropic component. In particular, <b>loop</b> <b>elongation</b> tends to favor {{the formation of the}} Cu(I) -His bond (hence disfavors His protonation, yielding lower pK(a) values) probably due to an increased flexibility of the loop in the reduced state. Overall, it appears that both reduction and low-pH transition are loop-responsive processes. The spacing between the ligands mostly affects the change in the conformational freedom that accompanies the reaction...|$|E
40|$|The Src {{family of}} {{tyrosine}} kinases (SFKs) regulate numerous aspects of cell growth and differentiation and {{are under the}} principal control of the C-terminal Src Kinase (Csk). Csk and SFKs share a modular design with the kinase domain downstream of the N-terminal SH 2 and SH 3 domains that regulate catalytic function and membrane localization. While the function of interfacial segments in these multidomain kinases are well-investigated, {{little is known about}} how surface sites and long-range, allosteric coupling control protein dynamics and catalytic function. The SH 2 domain of Csk is an essential component for the down-regulation of all SFKs. A unique feature of the SH 2 domain of Csk is the tight turn in place of the canonical CD loop in a surface site far removed from kinase domain interactions. In this study, we used a combination of experimental and computational methods to probe the importance of this difference by constructing a Csk variant with a longer SH 2 CD loop to mimic the flexibility found in homologous kinase SH 2 domains. Our results indicate that while the fold and function of the isolated domain and the full-length kinase are not affected by <b>loop</b> <b>elongation,</b> native protein dynamics that are essential for efficient catalysis are perturbed. We also identify key motifs and routes through which the distal SH 2 site might influence catalysis at the active site. This study underscores the sensitivity of intramolecular signaling and catalysis to native protein dynamics that arise from modest changes in allosteric regions while providing a potentia...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{based on}} Fourier descriptors that was previously validated {{has been applied}} to 13 writers in order to quantify the polymorphism degree of the shape of the loops of the handwritten characters a, d, o and q. In a first step, the discriminating power of the parameters extracted from these letters was investigated. The loop of the letter d appeared to be the most discriminant with a correct classification rate of 82. 4 %, whereas the least discriminant one was the loop of the letter o (69. 7 %). The second aim {{of the study was to}} extract grouping characteristics which make it possible to discriminate between writer sets, whatever the letter. Trends in the writing of loops could effectively be shown: the 13 writers of the study were separated into five main groups according to the shape and surface of their loops. The most discriminating features between the writer groups were the importance of the <b>loops</b> <b>elongation</b> and the surface of the loops. Finally, the differences between writers belonging to distinct groups could be characterized more precisely, and differences between writers belonging to the same group were revealed; the individual writings were distinguished by the variability of the parameters of shape and surface of their loops and the morphological distances between its different letters. The correct classification rates reached in this study suggest that carrying out an expertise of fragmentary samples of handwriting comprising only some loops is completely possible...|$|R

Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand breaking load varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun black threads were stronger than the core spun white threads in loop breaking strength. The core spun threads had the higher single strand breaking elongation. A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white threads and the black threads of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in <b>loop</b> breaking <b>elongation</b> existed among the brands. Variation in <b>loop</b> breaking <b>elongation</b> also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the black core spun threads. The core spun threads exhibited more shrinkage than the tow spun threads. Seams sewn with the white tow spun threads were stronger than those sewn with the white core spun thread.

40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses infecting western lowland gorillas (SIVgor) {{are closely}} related to HIV- 1 and are most likely the ancestors of HIV- 1 groups 0 and P. At present, limited data are available on genetic diversity, transmission, viral evolution, and pathogenicity of SIVgor in its natural host. Between 2004 and 2011, 961 putative gorilla fecal samples were collected at the Campo Ma'an National Park, Cameroon. Among them, 16 % cross-reacted with HIV- 1 antibodies, corresponding to at least 34 infected gorillas. Combining host genotyping and field data, we identified four social groups composed of 7 to 15 individuals each, with Sly rates ranging from 13 % to 29 %. Eleven SIVgor-infected gorillas were sampled multiple times; two most likely seroconverted during the study period, showing that SIVgor continues to spread. Phylogenetic analysis of partial env and pol sequences revealed cocirculation of closely related and divergent strains among gorillas from the same social group, indicating SIVgor transmissions within and between groups. Parental links could be inferred for some gorillas infected with closely related strains, suggesting vertical transmission, but horizontal transmission by sexual or aggressive behavior was also suspected. Intra-host molecular evolution in one gorilla over a 5 -year period showed viral adaptations characteristic of escape mutants, i. e., V 1 V 2 <b>loop</b> <b>elongation</b> and an increased number of glycosylation sites.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the viscoelastic properties of 6 common arthroscopic sliding knots (Tennessee slider, Roeder knot, SMC knot, Duncan loop, Weston knot, and Nicky's knot) with 3 reversing half-hitches on alternating posts, tied with No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex, Naples, FL). Knot configuration was designed to simulate a double-row rotator cuff repair with suture bridges. Methods: Constructs were loaded in 20 -N increments to 100 N and held for 2 minutes to monitor the viscoelastic behavior in tension. Suture was also tested without tying a knot. Results: Stress relaxation increased with loading but did not differ between knot configurations. Initial elongation was highest during the first loading to 20 N. Relaxation was greater for the Roeder knot at 20 N and for the Roeder and SMC knots at 80 N (P <. 05) {{when compared with the}} loop with no knot. Elongation was greatest for the Roeder knot throughout all loads. This difference was significant at 60 N compared with the knotless loop. At 100 N, all knots showed greater elongation than the knotless loop (P <. 05). Testing of suture, without any knots, accounted for more than 75 % of the overall stress relaxation and <b>loop</b> <b>elongation</b> of the suture-knot construct. Conclusions: In our in vitro evaluation of the Tennessee slider, Roeder knot, SMC knot, Duncan loop, Weston knot, and Nicky's knot in a simulated suture bridge construct, knot configuration was not a variable that influenced elongation or stress relaxation. Overall response was primarily due to the suture itself. With the exception of the Roeder knot, relaxation was similar provided that a secure knot was formed at the time of original tying. Clinical Relevance: With the evolution of surgical devices, the reliance on knots is decreasing. The {{results of this study suggest}} that using knotless techniques for securing the rotator cuff will not change the stress relaxation characteristics of the suture bridge. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Cupredoxins arc {{electron}} transfer (ET) proteins which possess type I (Tl) copper sites. A TI copper ion is equatorially coordinated by the thiolate sulfur of a Cys and the imidazole nitrogens of two His residues, along with usually an axially coordinating thioether sulfur of a Met [azurin (Az) possess a second axial interaction with a backbone carbonyl oxygen]. Thr~e of these ligands (Cys, a His and Met) are {{found on a}} C-terminal loop which links two of the strands of the cupredoxin p-barrel scaffold. The length and sequence of this Tl copper-binding loop varies. The shOltest known Tl binding loop (that of amicyanin, Ami) has been introduced into three different cupredoxin scaffolds. All of the. loopcontraction variants possess copper centres with authentic TI properties and are redox active. The Cu(lI) and Co(II) sites experience only small structural alterations upon loop contraction with the largest changes in the Az variant (AzAmi) which can be ascribed to the removal of a hydrogen bond to the coordinating thiolate sulfur of the Cys ligand. In all cases loop-contraction leads {{to an increase in}} the pKa of the His ligand found on the loop in the reduced proteins, and in the pseudoazurin (Paz) and plastocyanin (Pc) variants the values are almost identical to that of Ami (~ 6. 7). Thus in Paz, Pc and Ami the length of this loop tunes the pKa of the His ligand. In the AzAmi variant the pKa is 5. 5 which is considerably higher than the estimated value for Az Ã‚Â« 2) and other controlling factors, along with loop length, are involved. The reduction potentials (EmS) of the loop-contraction variants are all lower than those of the wild type (WT) proteins by ~ 30 - 60 mV and thus this property of a Tl copper site is finetuned by the C-tenninalloop. The electron self-exchange (ESE) rate constant (kESE) of Paz is diminished significantly by the introduction of a shorter loop. However, in PcAmi only a 2 -fold decrease is observed and in AzAmi there is no effect, and thus in these two cupredoxins loop contraction does not signi~cantly influence ET reactivity. Loop-contraction provides an active site environment in all of the cup. re~oxins which is preferable for Cu(ll), whereas previous <b>loop</b> <b>elongation</b> experiments always favoure [...] d the cuprous site. Thus the ligand-containing loop {{plays an important role in}} tuning the entatic nature ora TI copper centre. The thiolate sulfur of the Cys ligand in Az is hydrogen bonded from the backbone amides of. Asn 47 and Phe 114. One of these interactions has been removed in the Phel 14 Pro variant. A unique. I'~ pectr~s~opj~= [...] featur~,of A. z is-the position of. the S(Cys) ~Cu(Il),. ligand-to-metalcharge-transfer. - [...] . ' ~,... '.. (LMCT) band in its UVNis spectrum (~ 630 nm) which is shifted to 599 nm in the Phel 14 Pro variant, although a site with classic Tl properties is maintained. Shorter CU(Il) -SO(Metl 21) and longer Cu(lI}O(Gly 45) distances are found at the active site in the crystal structure of the variant compared to WT Az. The copper centre of Phel 14 Pro Az is more like those of Pc, Ami and Paz than the trigonal bipyramidal arrangement found in Az. The Phel 14 Pro mutation results in an 80 mV decrease in Em and an order of magnitude smaller kESE value. The influence of this mutation on Em is due to a number of structural effects ofthe mutation, with removal of the hydrogen bond probably most significant. Comparison of the active site structures of Cu(ll) and Cu(I) Phe 114 ProÃ‚Â· Az indicate larger changes upon redox interconversion than those in the WT protein which increases the reorganization energy and results in slower ET. The axial ligand at Tl copper sites is not conserved. In most cases a weakly coordinated thioether sulfur from a Met [Cu(II) -S 5 ~ 2. 6 - 3. 3 A] is found in the axial position as in Pc, Paz, Az and Ami. A strong axial bond [Cu(II) -Otl of ~ 2. 2 A] is sometimes provided by a Gln. [as in the stellacyanins (STCs) ] and the axial ligand can be absent (a Val, Leu or Phe in the axial position) as in ceruloplasmin, FeOp, fungal laccases and some plantacyanins (PLTs). Cucumber basic protein (CBP) is a PLT which has a relatively short Cu(II) -S 5 (Met 89) axial bond (2. 6 A). The Met 89 Gln variant of CBP has a kE?E' a measure of intrinsic ET reactivity, ~ 7 times lower than that of the WT protein. The Met 89 Vai mutation to CBP results in a 2 -fold increase in kESE' As the axial interaction decreases from strong Oel of Gin to relatively w. eak S 5 of Met to no ligand (Val), ESE reactivity is enhanced by - 1 order of magnitude whilst Em increases by - 350 mY. The variable coordination position at this ubiquitous ET site provides a mechanism for tuning the driving force to optimize ET with the correct partner without significantly compromising intrinsic reactivity. The enhanced reactivity of a three-coordinate Tl copper site will facilitate intramolecular ET in fungallaccases and Fet 3 p. The phytocyanins form a sub-family of the cupredoxins and are made up of the STCs, PLTs and uc 1 acyanins. All of the phytocyanins exhibit an alkaline transition which results in the S(Cys) ~Cu(II) LMCT band shifting - 20 nm to higher energy at elevated pH (pKa - 10). The alkaline transition influences all of the coordinating residues with the Cys ligand most affected. The exact cause of alkaline transition is not known, although deprotonation of a group close to the active site must be involved, and the side chain of the axial Gin ligand has been suggested as the trigger for this effect in the STCs. The influe!lce of pH on the spectrosco~ic properties of WT CBP and the Met 89 Gln and Met 89 Vai axial ligand variants has been studied. The alkaline transition has a similar influence on. the visible spectrum in all three proteins although the pKa value in Met 89 Vai CBP is smaller (8. 9) than for the other two proteins (- 9. 7). Thus the axial ligand is not the cause ofthe alkaline transition. The surface exposed Met 16 residue of Paz is situated close to the His 81 ligand in the centre of the protein's hydrophobic patch. To study the importance of Met'i 6, and to attempt to introduce a 1 t- 1 t. interaction with the imidazole ring of His 81, the Met 16 Phe and Met 16 Trp variants have been prepared and characterized. NMR studies indicate that the introduced aromatic groups are oriented parallel to the imidazole ring of His 8 l. UVNis, EPR and paramagnetic IH NMR spectra of the Cu(II) variants highlight very similar active site structures in the two mutants which are less tetragonally distorted than in the WT protein. The pKa value for the His 81 ligand in the Cu(I) proteins decreases from 4. 9 in WT Paz to 4. 5 and 4. 1 in Metl 6 Phe and Metl 6 Trp Paz respectively, indicating that 1 t- 1 t contact with the introduced aromatic ring stabilizes the Cu-N 51 (His 81) interaction. The enhanced rigidity at the active site may contribute to decr~ased reorganization energies in the variants resulting in - 2 -fold and - 3 -fold larger kESE values in Met 16 Phe alid Metl 6 Trp Paz respectively. These mutations could also contribute to tl~e increased kESE values by facilitating homo-dimer formation: The Metl 6 Phe and Metl 6 Trp mutations give rise to approximately 40 - 60 mV increases in the Em of Paz. The physiological function of Paz is donation of electrons to nitrite reductace (NiR) and the influence of these mutations on Em result in a decreased driving force for this ET reaction and smaller kC 31 are found. The Km for the reaction with NiR is - 2 -fold larger for the Met 16 Phe variant whilst similar values are found for Met 16 Trp Paz and the WT protein. Introduction of a 1 t- 1 t interaction at the active site of Paz leads to subtle structural changes but has little effect on the interaction with the physiological ET partner.

These ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are RNA N-glycosidases that remove a single base from a conserved 28 S rRNA <b>loop</b> required for <b>elongation</b> factor 1 alpha binding. Cell-free in vitro translation extracts were used to show that both maize and wheat ribosomes were resistant to molar excesses of b- 32 but not to the dicotyledonous RIP gelonin. We extracted RIP activity from kernels during seed maturation and germination. The amount of RIP activity increased during germination, although the amount of b- 32 protein remained fairly constant. Expression of a maize RIP gene under the control of an endosperm-specific transcriptional regulatory may be an important clue prompting investigation of the biological basis for RIP expression in seeds of other plants...|$|R
40|$|The sarcin/ricin loop is {{a highly}} conserved {{sequence}} found in the RNA of all large ribosomal subunits. The cytotoxins alpha-sarcin and ricin both inactivate ribosomes by cleaving a single bond in that loop. Once it has been attacked, ribosomes no longer interact with elongation factors properly, and translation stops. We have determined the conformation of the sarcin/ricin loop by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy using E 73, a 29 -nucleotide RNA that has the sarcin/ricin loop sequence and that is sensitive to both toxins in vitro. The sarcin/ricin loop has a compact structure that contains several purine. purine base pairs, a GAGA tetraloop, and a bulged guanosine adjacent to a reverse Hoogsteen A. U pair. It is stabilized by an unusual set of cross-strand base-stacking interactions and imino proton to phosphate oxygen hydrogen bonds.

40|$|Angiogenesis, the {{formation}} of new blood vessels from preexisting ones through creation of new vessel branch points by sprouting or vessel splitting, {{is an important part}} of tissue growth in both physiological processes like wound healing and pathological conditions such as cancer. Growth factors like VEGF-A, FGF- 2 and PDGF-BB are involved in both types of angiogenesis. Screening for genes regulated by VEGF-A stimulation in endothelial cells revealed up regulation of the endothelial cell specific glycoprotein endocan. Endocan itself did not stimulate angiogenesis. VEGF was a specific inducer since FGF- 2, PDGF-BB, HGF and EGF did not alter expression. The signaling molecule PI 3 K was a negative regulator of endocan expression. Endocan was expressed in tumor cells and vessels, suggesting that although endocan did not directly regulate angiogenesis it can serve as a marker for angiogenic tumors. In two models of wound healing angiogenesis, the chick extra-embryonal CAM assay and the mouse cornea assay, we observed that blood vessels grew into avascular areas as functional mural cell covered <b>loops</b> by <b>elongation</b> of preexisting vessels. Loop formation was simultaneous with contraction of the avascular matrix mediated by proto/myofibroblasts. Reducing the contractibility of the stroma reduced vessel ingrowth, showing that contraction was necessary for mediating and directing growth of the vascular loops. These findings suggest a model for biomechanical regulation of vascularization that is complementary to sprouting angiogenesis which is guided by gradients of growth factors. In defining the role of growth factors, in the CAM assay, we found that FGF- 2 and PDGF-BB induced vessel ingrowth, while VEGF-A, EGF and HGF did not. TGF-beta reduced the effect of FGF- 2. By use of specific receptor kinase inhibitors we found an absolute requirement VEGF- and PDGF-receptor activity for vascularization while FGF- and TGF-beta-receptor function was dispensable. This suggests that functional VEGF- and PDGF-receptors are needed for vessel elongation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of HIV- 1 sequences {{of the envelope}} domains V 1 V 2 and V 3 was analyzed by RT-PCR amplification. Two distinct biological phenotypes of HIV- 1 have been described: the nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype, best characterized by the inability to infect MT- 2 cells, and the syncytium-inducing phenotype (SI), {{with the ability to}} infect MT- 2 cells. Viral phenotype SI has been associated with HIV pathogenesis. The presence of positively charged amino acids at position 306 and 320 in the V 3 domain of gp 120 {{has been shown to be}} required for the support of the SI phenotype. In addition, V 2 elongation and relocation of N-glycosylation sites were postulated to herald an NSI to SI phenotype switch. The present study was designed to assess the stability of an elongated V 2 region with relocated N-glycosylation sites observed in SI isolates compared to NSI isolates. Eleven isolates with the SI phenotype and 19 isolates with the NSI phenotype were included in the study. Nine of the SI and 1 of the NSI isolates had a positively charged residue at position 306 or 320 (p < 0. 001) in the V 3 domain as assessed by direct sequencing of the viral RNA. In contrast, elongation and/or relocation of N-glycosylation sites of the V 2 variable region were not found to be a consistent genetic feature of the SI phenotype. However, SI isolates had more positively charged amino acid residues in the hypervariable V 2 region compared with NSI isolates. In one of the two SI isolates lacking positively charged amino acids at positions 306 or 320 in the V 3 <b>loop</b> an <b>elongation</b> of 26 amino acids with 4 additional N-linked glycosylation sites was observed in the V 2 region. This is consistent with the theory that elongation of V 2 may be transiently required for SI conversion.

Fifty-four sets of magnetic resonance images of embryos between Carnegie stage (CS) 14 and CS 23 were used to reconstruct embryonic digestive tract in three dimensions in the Amira program. Elongation, PUH, and rotation were quantified in relation to the proximal part of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), designated as the origin. Up to CS 16, IL rotation was initially observed as a slight deviation of the duodenum and colorectum from the median plane. The PUH was noticeable after CS 17. At CS 18, the IL showed a hairpin-like structure, with the SMA running parallel to the straight part and the cecum located to the left. After CS 19, the IL began to form a complex structure {{as a result of the}} rapid growth of the small intestinal portion. By CS 20, the IL starting point had moved from the right cranial region to an area caudal to the origin, though elongation of the duodenum was not conspicuous-this was a change of almost 180 ° in position. The end of the IL remained in roughly the same place, to the left of and caudal to the origin. Notably, the IL rotated around the origin only during earlier stages and gradually moved away, running transversely after CS 19.

Sample Population: Crimped loop constructs of 100 [*]lb Ande type nylon leader line in 7 different configurations comprising single and double loops, single and double crimps, and the interlocking loop configuration. Methods: Constructs premade on external skeletal fixator bars 60 [*]mm apart and tested in tension with a custom-made split circular arm {{mounted on a}} table-top materials testing machine. Data were derived from force/displacement plots. In “load to failure” test (10 /group) constructs were loaded to failure with distraction rates of 10 [*]mm/min; ultimate load, tension at 2 [*]mm elongation and failure were recorded. In “staircase” test (5 /group) constructs cycled at 100 [*]N/s from 75 [*]N with incremental increases of 50 [*]N/cycle; ultimate load, maximum tension before elongation at rest over 2 [*]mm and failure were recorded.

40|$|Abstract—Formation {{probabilities of}} {{different}} hydrogen bonds between carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen {{were determined by}} Monte Carlo simulations using a computer model {{in the space of}} sterically allowable conformations of alanine and glycine oligopeptides, and the corresponding entropy losses for the peptide backbone, T∆S, were calculated. The model was studied at different criteria of steric interactions. Comparison with the data of other authors showed the values of T∆S to be mainly determined by overall extent and type of the state space and to be only slightly dependent on its energy profile. Both short-range and long-range steric interactions were shown to prevent hydrogen bonding, especially in alanine peptides. In the model studied, the initiation of α(R) -helices is associated with T∆S = 8 – 10 kT, and prior formation of a 3 / 10 -turn or one three-center H-bond does not appreciably decrease this entropy barrier. Elongation of the α(R) -helix by one residue leads to T∆S = 3. 0 – 3. 7 kT, the helices begin to stabilize after at least three sequential H-bonds are formed. The difference in the probability of insertion of Ala and Gly into the helix is lower than it follows from comparison of their mobility. The results could be explained assuming that factors different from helical H-bonds take part in the stabilization of the helices. One may suppose upon modeling of folding that even three sequential H-bonds are unable to fix the structure of a flexible peptide <b>loop,</b> while the <b>elongation</b> of α(R) -helices in the supersecondary helixloop-helix structure is favorable as long as the loop conformation remains nearly optimal.

40|$|Abrin is {{a potent}} toxin {{obtained}} from the seeds of Abrus precatorius. It is a heterodimeric glycoprotein consisting of an A and a B subunit linked together by a disulfide bond. The toxicity of the protein comes from the A subunit harboring RNA-N-glycosidase activity which cleaves the glycosidic bond between the ribose sugar and the adenine at position 4324 in 28 S rRNA. The depurination of a specific adenine residue at position 4324 results in loss of conformation of the 28 S rRNA at the α sarcin/ricin <b>loop</b> to which <b>elongation</b> factor- 2 (EF- 2) binds, during the transloction step of translation, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. The B subunit of abrin is a galactose specific lectin. The lectin activity enables the toxin to gain entry inside cells on binding to receptors with terminal galactose. After entering cells, a few molecules of abrin reach the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the retrograde transport, where the disulfide bond between the A and the B subunits gets cleaved. Then the A chain escapes into the cytosol where it binds to its target, the α-sarcin loop of the 28 S ribosomal RNA and inhibits protein synthesis. Apart from inhibition of protein synthesis, exposure of cells to abrin leads {{to the loss of}} mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) resulting in the activation of caspases and finally apoptosis. However, whether apoptosis is dependent on the inhibition of protein synthesis has not been elucidated. The major objectives of this study are therefore to delineate the signaling pathways involved in abrin-induced apoptosis. The thesis is divided into 4 Chapters: Chapter 1. provides a overview of the general properties of RIPs, with a brief history, classification, trafficking and biological activities of the toxins. This chapter also discusses their potential use in bio-warfare and the treatments available for management of toxicity. Chapter 2 and 3 discuss the results obtained on studies aimed at gaining insights into the signaling pathways involved in abrin-induced apoptosis. Chapter 4 focuses on the research carried out to understand the mechanisms of neutralization of abrin by the mAb D 6 F 10. Towards the first objective, chapter 2 elucidates the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling in abrin-induced apoptosis using the human T-cell line, Jurkat as a model system. It could be concluded that the inhibition of protein synthesis by the catalytic A subunit of abrin could result in accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER leading to ER stress which triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. The ER resident trans-membrane sensors IRE 1 (Inositol-requiring enzyme 1), PERK (PKR-like ER kinase) and ATF 6 (Activating transcription factor 6) are the important players of UPR in mammalian cells. These sensors inhibit translation and increase the levels of chaperones to restore protein homeostasis. However, if the ER stress is prolonged, apoptotic pathways get activated to remove severely damaged cells in which protein folding defects cannot be resolved. Recent studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces apoptosis by activating initiater caspases such as caspase- 2 and - 8 which eventually trigger mitochondrial membrane potential loss and activation of downstream effector capases- 9 and - 3. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α and upregulation of CHOP [CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein], important players involved in ER stress signaling by abrin, suggested activation of ER stress in the cells. ER stress is also known to induce apoptosis via stress kinases such as p 38 MAPK and JNK. Activation of both the pathways was observed upon abrin treatment and found to be upstream of the activation of caspases. However, abrin-induced apoptosis was found be dependent on p 38 MAPK but not JNK. We also observed that abrin induced activation of caspase- 2 and caspase- 8 and triggered Bid cleavage leading to mitochondrial membrane potential loss and thus connecting the signaling events from ER stress to mitochondrial death machinery. Few toxins belonging to the family of ribosome inactivating proteins such as Shiga toxin have been observed to induce DNA damage in human endothelial cells and activate p 53 /ATM-dependent signaling pathway in mammalian cells. To further investigate the role of abrin on activation of DNA damage signaling pathway, we analysed the phosphorylation of H 2 AX and ATM, which are markers for double strand DNA breaks. We observed phosphorylation of H 2 AX and ATM upon abrin treatment but not when cells were pretreated with the broad spectrum pan caspase inhibitor. This study suggested that the DNA damage observed was an indirect effect of caspase-activated DNase. We concluded from the studies in chapter 2 that inhibition of protein synthesis by abrin can trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Further studies were conducted to understand the dependence of ER stress on inhibition of protein synthesis and are presented in chapter 3. For this study, we have used an active site mutant of abrin A chain (R 167 L) which exhibits lower protein synthesis inhibitory activity than the wild type abrin A chain. Recombinant wild type and mutant abrin A chains were expressed in E. coli and purified. Since, abrin A chain requires the B chain for internalization into cells, both wild type and mutant abrin A chains were conjugated to native ricin B chain to generate a hybrid toxin. Next, we have compared the toxic effects of the two conjugates in cells. The rate of inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by the mutant ricin B-rABRA (R 167 L) conjugate was slower than that of the wild type ricin B-rABRA conjugate but it could trigger ER stress leading to mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in cells though delayed, suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis is the major factor contributing to abrin-mediated apoptosis. Abrin is extremely lethal and considered as a potential agent for use in biological warfare. Currently, there are no antidotes or effective therapies available for abrin poisoning. Antibody based antitoxins function by either preventing toxin binding to cell surface receptors or by translocation. Antibodies against the B chain of RIPs function by inhibiting the binding of B chain of the toxin to cells, whereas the exact mechanism by which antibodies against A chain function is still not clear. The only known neutralizing monoclonal antibody against abrin A chain, namely, D 6 F 10, was generated in our laboratory and was shown to rescue cells and mice from abrin intoxication. Earlier experiments with confocal microscopy suggested that mAb D 6 F 10 could internalize in HeLa cells along with abrin, suggesting that the antibody can function intracellularly. Chapter 4 discusses the work carried out to delineate the mechanism of intracellular neutralization of abrin by the mAb D 6 F 10. We observed significant reduction in binding and delay in abrin internalization {{in the presence of the}} neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) D 6 F 10. Considering that the majority of the abrin after internalization is removed by lysosomal degradation, we studied the fate of abrin in the presence of mAb D 6 F 10. Confocal images did not show any difference in the distribution of abrin in the lysosomes in the absence or presence of antibody. However, the antibody remained persistently colocalized with abrin in the cells, suggesting that the antibody might inhibit enzymatic activity of abrin at its cellular site of action...|$|R
