Although {{initially}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most}} effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
25|$|Athy {{had to wait}} 24 {{years before}} {{reaching}} the summit of Kildare Senior Football once again. On 9 October 2011 in St Conleths Park Newbridge Michael Foley captained a young Athy side to victory against Carbury with a final score of 2.11 to 2.07. Athy scored 2–5 in the opening 15 minutes and two points in the closing four minutes but managed just four points in between, a period during which Carbury accumulated 2–4. Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute {{to cut the deficit}} to two points, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> might have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve and calmly pointed a free.|$|E
25|$|In 1787, 1789 and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of the French revolution looming {{in the minds of}} many members of Parliament, few were swayed by Charles James Fox's arguments for equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley specifically. In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of William Pitt and Edmund Burke that most angered Priestley and his friends; they had expected the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

25|$|At 7:30a.m. the {{following}} morning, Cattran and Wheeler returned to 23 Cranley Gardens, {{by which time}} the drain had been cleared. This aroused the suspicions of both the drain inspector and his supervisor. Cattran discovered some scraps of flesh and four bones in a pipe leading from the drain which linked to the top flat of the house. To both Cattran and Wheeler, the bones <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> originated from a human hand. Both men immediately called the police who, upon closer inspection, discovered further small bones and scraps of what looked {{to the naked eye}} like either human or animal flesh in the same pipe leading from the drain. These remains were taken to the mortuary at Hornsey, where pathologist Professor David Bowen advised police that the remains were indeed human, and that one particular piece of flesh he concluded had been from a human neck bore a ligature mark.|$|E
25|$|Tina Louise is Ginger Grant, {{the movie}} star. Louise clashed with {{producer}} Sherwood Schwartz because {{she believed that}} she was hired as the central character. Her character was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play it as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play her as a Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield type. Louise continued to clash with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to return {{for any of the}} post-series TV movies, saying that the role had killed her career as a serious actress. She did, however, appear in a reunion of the cast on a late-night television talk show in 1988 and on an episode of Roseanne in 1995 when the Roseanne cast re-enacted Gilligan's Island. In the first season, Ginger often wore gowns that <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were tailored from Minnow tarpaulins or similar substitute cloth (some had the name of the vessel stenciled on them). In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger, no last name, (then a secretary) was played by actress Kit Smythe.|$|E
25|$|By 1915, {{after having}} {{published}} a first article in 1912, Alfred Wegener was making serious arguments {{for the idea}} of continental drift in the first edition of The Origin of Continents and Oceans. In that book (re-issued in four successive editions up to the final one in 1936), he noted how the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were once attached. Wegener was not the first to note this (Abraham Ortelius, Antonio Snider-Pellegrini, Eduard Suess, Roberto Mantovani and Frank Bursley Taylor preceded him just to mention a few), but {{he was the first to}} marshal significant fossil and paleo-topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation (and was supported in this by researchers such as Alex du Toit). Furthermore, when the rock strata of the margins of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way, implying that they were joined initially. For instance, parts of Scotland and Ireland contain rocks very similar to those found in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. Furthermore, the Caledonian Mountains of Europe and parts of the Appalachian Mountains of North America are very similar in structure and lithology.|$|E

25|$|The 2015–16 Big Bash League season {{marked the}} first {{year in which the}} Thunder {{finished}} in {{the top half of the}} table, finishing 4th overall. Having won the first three games of the season and boasting a squad including Michael Hussey, Shane Watson, Usman Khawaja and Jacques Kallis, The Thunder soon became the favourites to win the tournament. However, the Thunder lost their following four games and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were set to miss out on the finals. In their final game of the 2015–16 Big Bash League season, the Thunder defeated the Sixers for only the second time in their history to book a finals berth. The Thunder faced the Adelaide Strikers at Adelaide Oval in the first semi final, winning convincingly. The Thunder then faced the Stars in the Finals the Melbourne Stars. The final was played at Melbourne Cricket Ground on 24 January 2016 and resulted in the Thunder's defeat of the Melbourne Stars. The Sydney Thunder franchise also swept the titles as the women's team won the inaugural women's title hours ago on the same ground by the same margin with the same number of balls remaining (3 wickets with 3 balls remaining). The men's game also featured a battle of two captains as brothers Michael and David Hussey went against each other on their mother's birthday.|$|E

They were the 20-gun Charente and the [...] 8-gun Joie out of Rochefort and at 17:00 Aigle caught up with them. The French ships shortened sail and <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were about to do battle but after discharging their guns, both ran aground.

500|$|Some special effects, like Motoko's [...] "thermo-optical camouflage", were {{rendered}} {{through the}} use of TIMA software. The process uses a single illustration and manipulates the image as necessary to produce distortions for effect in combination with a background without altering the original illustration. The effect is re-added back into the shot to complete the scene. While the visual displays used in the film were technically simple to create, the appearance of the displays underwent numerous revisions by the production team to best represent visual displays of the future. Another aspect of the CG use was to create images and effects that <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "perceived by the brain" [...] and were generated in video and added to the film in its final stages.|$|E

500|$|The two secondhand vessels [...] {{were joined}} in January 1899 by the newly built Manchester City of 7,696 grt, {{constructed}} by Raylton Dixon & Co of Middlesbrough. This steamship carried [...] of coal, burned at [...] per day, giving {{a speed of}} , fast for her day. [...] She was a refrigerated vessel, designed to carry frozen meat and live cattle, and was claimed {{to be one of}} the largest meat-carrying ships then afloat. She made a successful maiden voyage from Canada and up the new canal to Manchester, taking two days and stopping overnight at Irlam to give the crew a rest. The Manchester Guardian reported on 16 January 1899 that [...] "there were many shakings of the head, not only in Liverpool, at the audacity of the attempt" [...] and that [...] "the canal pilots, on reaching Irlam, <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had not been in bed for a week, as their eyes were bleared with exhaustion". The City discharged 450cattle and 150sheep at Manchester Corporation's Foreign Animals Wharf near the Mode Wheel locks in Salford. With an overall length of , she was by far the largest vessel to have ventured up the waterway, and her successful navigation disproved the claim of Liverpool owners that only ships of [...] or less could safely reach Manchester. The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port. On her first voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1899, the City took nine days and sixteen hours; and arrived before the mail boat, which had left the Mersey twelve hours ahead of her.|$|E
500|$|McLaren {{locked out}} {{the front row of}} the grid for the second race in succession, with Lewis Hamilton once again on pole. Both HRT cars {{qualified}} for the race, but filled out the final row of the grid almost two seconds behind Marussia's Charles Pic in twenty-second position. In the race, Hamilton made a better start than Jenson Button, but his lead was short-lived; heavy rain interrupted the race, forcing the suspension of the Grand Prix. When the race restarted an hour later, Button was involved in contact with Narain Karthikeyan that forced him to make an unscheduled stop for a new front wing, while Hamilton had a slow pit stop and was held in the lane while other cars passed. Fernando Alonso inherited the lead, with Sauber's Sergio Pérez a surprise second, having made an early stop for extreme wet weather tyres and then taking advantage of a rush to the pit lane to position himself in third at the restart. As the race wore on, Pérez began to quickly catch Alonso on a drying track. Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for dry-weather tyres on lap 38, triggering another round of stops. Sauber and Pérez initially <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had left their stop too late when Pérez emerged from the pits five seconds behind Alonso, but he began catching the two-time World Champion {{at the same rate as}} he had before. Pérez closed to within half a second with seven laps to go, but ran wide at turn 14 and lost five seconds, later admitting that it was his mistake. He was unable to close the gap, and Alonso went on to win the race by two seconds, the win giving him a five-point lead in the championship. Pérez was second, taking his first podium and Sauber's best ever result as an independent team. Hamilton finished third ahead of Mark Webber and Kimi Räikkönen, while Button had to settle for fourteenth. Bruno Senna finished in sixth, scoring more points in a single race than his team scored in [...] Sebastian Vettel finished outside the points after making contact with Karthikeyan and developing a puncture.|$|E

Screeton of Carlisle, Arkansas which read in part: [...] "Dear Judge: In relation to the strange disappearance of Elsie Parobek, I will say that a band of forty gypsy men and four gypsy women with eighteen children ranging in age from three months to eighteen years were seen in the union station at Little Rock, Arkansas last week.

2500|$|The {{new type}} was {{intended}} {{from the beginning}} to replace the B.E.2, which was already attracting widespread criticism, and an attempt was made to address each of the earlier type's failings. [...] The more powerful motor was intended to improve the feeble speed and climb of the B.E.2 and to allow a better payload. This permitted the type to operate as a true two-seater, since the observer no longer had to be left at home when bombs or a full fuel load were carried, {{there was no need for}} his seat to be at the centre of gravity – as a result he could now be seated behind the pilot, in the proper position to operate a defensive machine gun. It was also possible to allow for a pilot's gun. The new wings had already proved themselves on the B.E.2e, maintaining the stability of the B.E.2c while providing rather better manoeuvrability, although the long extensions on the upper wing <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> might collapse if the aircraft was dived too sharply, which did not improve the trust in which they were held by some pilots. The new tail, as originally fitted, had a much smaller fin, which it was hoped would improve rudder control and allow the new type to turn more easily without seriously affecting stability.|$|E
