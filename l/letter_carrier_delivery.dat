50|$|In the 1970s, {{with the}} city's {{population}} growing rapidly, {{the implementation of}} <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>delivery</b> to individual houses was considered.

5000|$|Centralized mail {{delivery}} {{is a unique}} form of {{mail delivery}} system where a <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> provides <b>delivery</b> and collection services {{to a number of}} residences from a centrally located installation - whether in a single-family subdivision or multi-family structure. Business customers also receive delivery services from a convenient central location.Centralized mail delivery equipment can be in the form of any [...] "clustered" [...] type mailbox - including free-standing, pedestal-mounted cluster box unit (CBU), or other cluster mailboxes mounted in a wall, kiosk, or shelter. The U.S. Postal Service prefers centralized mail delivery in all new construction because it is less expensive. The United States Postal Service aims to continue to review and modify its operations to provide universal service as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Therefore, there is pressure to establish centralized mail delivery, which is required in some communities.|$|R
25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of <b>letter</b> <b>carriers.</b> Previously, the <b>delivery</b> of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and collection of mail from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position of a mail service courier, while <b>letter</b> <b>carriers</b> delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, <b>letter</b> <b>carrier</b> routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering parcels, mail, clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and collection of mail from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased overtime, work stress, and injuries to employees who are facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|R

Although postal policy does not allow artists to portray living persons on stamps, one of the carriers in the stamp is an unmistakable self-portrait of Davis.|$|R
