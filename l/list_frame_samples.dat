30|$|Cluster {{sampling}} is {{one method}} {{that has been}} used in these circumstances. It involves dividing the population into recognisable ‘clusters’ (say, streets within a city suburb) and then sampling from the clusters (say, the houses in a street) (Cochran 1999, Chaps. 9 – 10; Schreuder et al. 1993, Chap. 3; Gregoire and Valentine 2008, Chap. 12). However, this is inappropriate if it is desired to take a simple random sample of individuals from the population; cluster sampling generally involves varying chances of selection for the population members, rather than equal chances as required for a simple random sample. Pinkham (1987) described a simple method to take a simple random sample of individuals from a population without a <b>list</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> However, it involves visiting each and every individual in the population, generally an impossibility for very large populations and a process through which a <b>list</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> could be compiled in any case.|$|R

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to compare these results with those of Gordon and Pont (2015), who tested {{a number of different}} sampling methods to estimate the mean stem wood volume of individual trees in five populations of plantation Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Four of the populations varied in area over the range 1.3 – 2.3  ha, whilst the fifth was 22.8  ha in area. A <b>list</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> was available for each population with a detailed list of the trees with their stem wood volumes and spatial locations. Through simulation studies, they tested five sampling methods that could be applied {{in the absence of a}} <b>list</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> to provide <b>samples</b> that aimed to mimic simple random samples. They compared these results with actual simple random sampling that used the <b>list</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> In effect, their five alternative methods involved forms of cluster sampling where sample points were located randomly across the population area and the trees that occurred in a plot surrounding those points were included in the sample; that contrasts with Iles’ approach where no more than one tree from any such plot is included in the sample. Whilst the methods Gordon and Pont used are not necessarily unbiased estimators, a number of the methods they tested gave estimates of population means with only a slight bias and often with precision close to that of simple random sampling. However, none gave results that were completely consistent with simple random sampling across the several populations they considered. Their methods certainly reduce the effort involved in taking a sample of any particular size when compared with the methods considered here. However, if the sampler is willing to live with the possible risk of some bias and less certain estimates of precision when compared with actual simple random sampling, Gordon and Pont’s methods may prove satisfactory.|$|R

In the case of Method 1, an average of 1388 of the 5 -m square sample plots had to be visited to find 50 that contained an individual to make up the required sample. For Method 2, a larger, 25 -m square, plot size was used with a value of M[*]=[*] 8; that value of M was one more than the maximum number of trees that occurred in any sample plot. In that case, an average of 480 plots still had to be visited to find the required sample of 50 individuals; if a higher value had been used for M, an even greater number of plots would have to have been visited. Where there was a <b>list</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> there was no such cost and the sampler needed to visit only the 50 individuals selected from the list.

In these situations it’s impossible to carry out a probabilistic sampling design and sampling data should be not so reliable, hence here a Bayesian estimate approach based on the joint use of sampling and extra-sampling information is proposed, specially referred to the case of two frames (dual frame).

30|$|As {{discussed}} by Gregoire and Valentine (2008, p. 8), before a sample {{can be drawn}} from a population, it is necessary to have available a ‘sampling frame’, that is, a mechanism that identifies and locates the sampling units within the population.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) conducts {{quarterly}} surveys for {{estimation of}} some primary commodities produced on farms and ranches. The commodities often have highly skewed distributions {{with a few}} farms producing very large amounts. NASS uses dual <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> comprised of the <b>list</b> <b>frame</b> for efficient stratification and the area frame for estimation of the part (nonoverlap) {{of the population that}} is not included in the <b>list</b> <b>frame.</b> Because the area <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> probabilities are relatively small, a few large observations in the nonoverlap sample can greatly influence the usual direct expansion (DE) estimates for population totals. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate modifications of the usual DE estimators which could produce more efficient estimators for the NASS quarterly surveys. An empirical Bayes approach is used as a method for including estimates from previous quarterly surveys to help stabilize the estimate for the current survey. Another approach is to right-censor the very large expanded observations in the nonoverlap sample to produce a censored direct expansion (CDE) estimator. A bias adjustment, formed as the ratio of the DE and CDE sums over the repeated surveys, is applied to the CDE estimator to produce the adjusted censored direct expansion (ACDE) estimator. The empirical Bayes technique is then applied to the ACDE estimates. The empirical Bayes and censored estimates are calculated for total hogs and pigs in the nine quarterly surveys: March 1987 -March 1989 from Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio. A bootstrap method is constructed to estimate and compare the biases, standard errors, and root mean square errors (RMSE's) of the various estimators. Only a slight reduction in RMSE resulted from censoring the very large expanded observations in the nonoverlap sample. Application of the empirical Bayes technique to either the DE or the ACDE estimators reduced the average RMSE by about 10 % {{in each of the three}} states...|$|R
