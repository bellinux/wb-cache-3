500|$|A {{common theme}} that appears {{throughout}} Outliers is the [...] "10,000-Hour Rule", {{based on a}} study by Anders Ericsson. Gladwell claims that greatness requires enormous time, using the source of The Beatles' musical talents and Gates' computer savvy as examples. The Beatles performed live in Hamburg, Germany over 1,200 times from 1960 to 1964, amassing more than 10,000 hours of playing time, therefore meeting the 10,000-Hour Rule. Gladwell asserts {{that all of the}} time The Beatles spent performing shaped their talent, and quotes Beatles' biographer Philip Norman as saying, [...] "So by the time they returned to England from Hamburg, Germany, 'they sounded <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else. It was the making of them.'" [...] Gates met the 10,000-Hour Rule when he gained access to a high school computer in 1968 at the age of 13, and spent 10,000 hours programming on it.|$|E

However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program.

500|$|E=MC² {{received}} a 63/100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") {{on the website}} Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of Allmusic, rated the album three out of five stars, and wrote [...] "it's misleading to judge Mariah based on her new record of possessing the most number one singles, as she's not about longevity, she's about being permanently transient, a characteristic 'E=MC²' captures all too well." [...] Billboards Gary Trust felt that on the album, Carey was in [...] "pristine form", stating, [...] "She's proclaimed emancipation before, but Mariah Carey's never sounded as free as she does on her 10th album. Carey's made a pop album with equal parts levity and gravity." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Margeaux Watson graded E=MC² an 'A-', and described how the album's goal was to prove [...] "her comeback was no fluke". She continued complimenting the album's several collaborations, and wrote [...] "the result is a largely enjoyable mix of flirtatious club jams, midtempo love songs, and emotional ballads anchored by hip-hop beats that handsomely showcase the singer's powerful vocal chops." [...] Though Carey's voice had been criticized since her 2002 release, Charmbracelet, {{for not being able}} to deliver the [...] "gravity defying vocals" [...] from the 1990s, Roger Friedman from Fox News wrote [...] "Her infamous eight-octave range has suffered a little wear and tear over the years, but Carey still can flutter from great highs to mellow lows <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else." [...] Alex Macpherson from The Guardian gave the album four out of five stars, heavily describing the singer's vocal state throughout the album: [...] "Carey's voice has been mocked, bizarrely, as being a triumph of technique over soul - an argument that fails to comprehend that technique and soul are intertwined, that technique primarily exists as a means to convey emotion - but she is on fine vocal form throughout 'E=MC²', whether belting out massive ballads, or layering her voice into a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs." [...] Macpherson concluded his review with, [...] "When she sings elsewhere, [...] "Them other regularities, they can't compare with MC," [...] "it is hard not to agree", referencing a lyric on [...] "For the Record".|$|E

2500|$|Lind died at her {{residence}} at Brookside, Salthill, Slough, {{at the age}} of 61, having become ill rather suddenly that year. [...] Her obituary from The Times said, [...] "She was very pretty; she was very graceful; there was something appealing about her which might almost be called childish. She had a queer and very attractive little croak in her voice, and an elementary, little-girlish way of saying things which made them peculiarly engaging, and caused her saying of them to stick in the memory with a permanence which their wit or point might by no means justify. Add to this the enchanting lissomeness and beauty of all such movements as she was mistress of, and a stage personality (as we call it) which was <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else's, and there is more than justification for the glow which the remembrance of her performances kindles." [...] Lind's funeral took place at St. Mary's Church, Slough, on Friday, 31 August 1923, and she was buried in Windsor Cemetery.|$|E

His film Rebecca (nominated for 11 Oscars) won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1940—another Hitchcock film, Foreign Correspondent, was also nominated that year. Hitchcock has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, receiving one for his contribution to television and another for his work in motion pictures. Following a 2007 critics' poll by Britain's Daily Telegraph in which he was ranked Britain's greatest filmmaker, one scholar wrote: [...] "Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from the audience) and engaging the emotions of the audience <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff was {{the most}} famous {{exponent}} {{of the school of}} football known as Total Football (Totaalvoetbal in Dutch) explored by Rinus Michels. Being known as [...] "the total footballer", he {{was also one of the}} brilliant pioneers of the [...] "false nine" [...] position/role in modern football. In Total Football's heyday (in the early 1970s), Cruyff was truly an ‘on-field tactician’, an ‘on-field manager’, or a ‘coach-player’ at the same time, before the concept of player-coach was at the height of its popularity in professional football during the 1980s and 1990s. As Argentina World Cup winner Jorge Valdano said of Cruyff, in an interview with Thomas Goubin of SoFoot.com, “Never in my life have I seen a player like Cruyff rule matches. He was the owner of the show. Much more than his team, the referee or the fans. His grip on what was happening on the field was amazing. He was a player, coach and referee at the same time.”. Chris McMullan (of FootballFanCast.com) writes that “he [...] was an anomaly. A man who played football <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else. He didn't physically play football after all, he played it with his mind. An esoteric pursuit that completely changed the game. A visionary, a departure, a flight of fancy – Cruyff is the ultimate because his contribution to the game wasn't simply personal. He didn't break records, he didn't win golden boots, and only occasionally dazzled with skills. The reason he is a great is because he understood the game <b>like</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else ever did and probably ever will. (...) His vision, his ability to see the game in a way that no one else could have was his gift. It showcases his talent, the way he formulated the game in his head and then was able to execute it perfectly with his legs.” And he concludes, “There is no one goal, no one clip of football that can encapsulate Johan Cruyff's contribution to football. No one piece of video could ever do that. That's not surprising. Cruyff wasn't a Pele or a Maradona whose careers can be summed up with a series of vines and clips, mountains of goals and skills after another. With Cruyff, you have to think in order to be able to understand it. It doesn't simply happen before your eyes, but it's something altogether more thoughtful, and ultimately more rewarding.” ...|$|E
