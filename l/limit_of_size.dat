60|$|So {{long as one}} had to {{consider}} the navigable balloon the aerial side of warfare remained unimportant. A Zeppelin is little good for any purpose but scouting and espionage. It can carry very little weight in proportion to its vast size, and, what is more important, it cannot drop things without sending itself up like a bubble in soda water. An armada of navigables sent against this island would end in a dispersed, deflated state, chiefly in the seas between Orkney and Norway--though I say it who should not. But these aeroplanes can fly all round the fastest navigable that ever drove before the wind; they can drop weights, take up weights, and do all sorts of able, inconvenient things. They are birds. As for the birds, so for aeroplanes; there is an upward <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>size.</b> They {{are not going to}} be very big, but they are going to be very able and active. Within a year we shall have--or rather they will have--aeroplanes capable of starting from Calais, let us say, circling over London, dropping a hundredweight or so of explosive upon the printing machines of The Times, and returning securely to Calais for another similar parcel. They are things neither difficult nor costly to make. For the price of a Dreadnought one might have hundreds. They will be extremely hard to hit with any sort of missile. I do not think a large army of under-educated, under-trained, extremely unwilling conscripts is going to be any good against this sort of thing.|$|E
6000|$|But {{neither he}} nor Mr. Darwin has {{considered}} {{the effects of the}} withdrawal of the action of natural selection in keeping up the parts in question to their full dimensions, which, of itself, seems to me quite adequate to produce the results observed. Recurring to the evidence, adduced in Chapter III, of the constant variation occurring {{in all parts of the}} organism, while selection is constantly acting on these variations in eliminating all that fall below the best working standard, and preserving only those that are fully up to it; and, remembering further, that, of the whole number of the increase produced annually, only a small percentage of the best adapted can be preserved, we shall see that every useful organ will be kept up nearly to its higher <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and efficiency. Now Mr. Galton has proved experimentally that, when any part has thus been increased (or diminished) by selection, there is in the offspring a strong tendency to revert to a mean or average size, which tends to check further increase. And this mean appears to be, not the mean of the actual existing individuals but a lower mean, or that from which they had been recently raised by selection.[199] He calls this the law of [...] "Regression towards Mediocrity," [...] and it has been proved by experiments with vegetables and by observations on mankind. This regression, in every generation, takes place even when both parents have been selected for their high development of the organ in question; but when there is no such selection, and crosses are allowed among individuals of every grade of development, the deterioration will be very rapid; and after a time not only will the average size of the part be greatly reduced, but the instances of full development will become very rare. Thus what Weismann terms [...] "panmixia," [...] or free intercrossing, will co-operate with Galton's law of [...] "regression towards mediocrity," [...] and the result will be that, whenever selection ceases to act on any part or organ which has heretofore been kept up to a maximum of size and efficiency, the organ in question will rapidly decrease till it reaches a mean value considerably below the mean of the progeny that has usually been produced each year, and very greatly below the mean of that portion which has survived annually; and this will take place by the general law of heredity, and quite irrespective of any use or disuse of the part in question. Now, no observations have been adduced by Mr. Spencer or others, showing that the average amount of change supposed to be due to disuse is greater than that due to the law of regression towards mediocrity; while even if it were somewhat greater, we can see many possible contributory causes to its production. In the case of civilised man's diminished jaw, there may well be some correlation between the jaw and the brain, seeing that increased mental activity would lead to the withdrawal of blood and of nervous energy from adjacent parts, and might thus lead to diminished growth of those parts in the individual. And in the case of pet-dogs, the selection of small or short-headed individuals would imply the unconscious selection of those with less massive temporal muscles, and thus lead to the concomitant reduction of those muscles. The amount of reduction observed by Darwin in the wing-bones of domestic ducks and poultry, and in the hind legs of tame rabbits, is very small, and is certainly no greater than the above causes will well account for; while so many of the external characters of all our domestic animals have been subject to long-continued artificial selection, and we are so ignorant of the possible correlations of different parts, that the phenomena presented by them seem sufficiently explained without recurrence to the assumption that any changes in the individual, due to disuse, are inherited by the offspring.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ultimate}} {{development is}} the [...] "air-separate" [...] precalciner, in which the hot combustion air for the calciner arrives in a duct directly from the cooler, bypassing the kiln. Typically, 60-75% of the fuel is burned in the precalciner. In these systems, the feed entering the rotary kiln is 100% calcined. The kiln has only to raise the feed to sintering temperature. In theory the maximum efficiency would be achieved if all the fuel were burned in the preheater, but the sintering operation involves partial melting and nodulization to make clinker, and the rolling action of the rotary kiln remains {{the most efficient way}} of doing this. Large modern installations typically have two parallel strings of 4 or 5 cyclones, with one attached to the kiln and the other attached to the precalciner chamber. A rotary kiln of 6 x 100 m makes 8,000-10,000 tonnes per day, using about 0.10-0.11 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. The kiln is dwarfed by the massive preheater tower and cooler in these installations. Such a kiln produces 3 million tonnes of clinker per year, and consumes 300,000 tonnes of coal. A diameter of 6 m appears to be the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> of rotary kilns, because the flexibility of the steel shell becomes unmanageable at or above this size, and the firebrick lining tends to fail when the kiln flexes.|$|E

40|$|The lower <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> of {{biological}} objects {{which can be}} photographed with the electron microscope, by the aid of shadow‐casting, is shown to depend upon the smoothness of substrate upon which they can be mounted, and upon the continuity of structure of the thin films {{with which they are}} shadowed. Numerous attempts to improve the existing deficiencies are reported, both with respect to producing smoother substrate films, and to producing films for shadow‐casting of high efficiency and continuity of structure. No success has been encountered in producing a usable substrate film perceptibly smoother than the collodion and Formvar films commonly used. It is found that the best shadow‐casting material for this type of film is uranium or uranium oxide. Verification has been obtained of the severe granulation of gold films previously used in the pre‐shadowed replica process, when subjected to the electron current of a biased‐beam electron gun. Attempts to reduce the granulation to a satisfactory level have failed. Various methods of preparing pre‐shadowed replicas are reported. The factors affecting the tenacity of evaporated films to glass surfaces are discussed. It is found that elements which oxidize readily are relatively adherent to glass, while the elements gold, palladium, platinum, and rhodium are not. Uranium sulfide {{can be used as a}} pre‐shadowed replica material, but only with some uncertainty, owing to its chemical instability. It has been found that a palladium‐platinum mixture is the most satisfactory material for use in the pre‐shadowed replica technique, and that films of this mixture in a thickness of about 6 A produce adequate shadows in which there is no sign of granulation. The surface of clean glass is again found to have the smoothest structure of any material known, with practically no sharp discontinuities in elevation as great as 10 A.
