40|$|The {{objective}} of the work described here is to compare the isolated English <b>language</b> <b>digit</b> speech recognition using Hidden Markov Model for speaker independent system. Two different datasets were collected of audio recordings for the said comparison of isolated digits of English language. Speakers here read numeric digits 0 to 9 i. e. ZERO to NINE. One corpus is self recorded signals and other is standard CUAVE dataset (36 speakers, each uttered 10 words). The training and testing samples are separated for speaker dependent and speaker independent systems. The system has been implemented using the HMM toolkit i. e. HTK by training HMMs of the words making the vocabulary on the training data. Different HMMs for individual digits have been initialized and trained to have well modeled structure. The trained system was tested on training data as well as test data and results shown {{that most of the}} speech samples were correctly recognized. The system was tested for speaker independent and dependent way, to check the changes in the recognition rate. Further this can be used by developers and researchers interested in speech recognition for English language not only for isolated digits but also for other words of English language. If clean database is available, further this can be generalized to recognize words of any language. Continuous speech can also be recognized using study of this system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an efficient}} method for recognizing spoken digits {{using a combination}} of Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) classifier. Speech recognition is a fascinating application of Digital Signal Processing. There has been lot of {{research in the area of}} speech recognition for different <b>languages.</b> <b>Digits</b> in Malayalam, which belong to one of the four Dravidian languages of Southern India, are used to create the database. Wavelet Packet Decomposition is used for feature extraction in the time-frequency domain. Training, testing and pattern recognition are performed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Due to the multi-resolution characteristics and efficient time frequency localizations, wavelets are very much suitable for processing non stationary signals like speech. ANNs are utilized in this work due to their parallel distributed processing, distributed memories, error stability, and pattern learning distinguishing ability. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this hybrid architecture in recognizing speech...|$|R

The participants were scanned by {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) twice {{on the day of the}} experiment. The results of the measurements revealed that upon learning that the signs actually have numeric meaning, a network of brain areas is activated immediately. Many of these areas have been previously implicated in numerical processing. The similar neural network of brain regions responsible for numerical processing exists on a nonlinguistical basis and works to retrieve arithmetic facts from presented linguistic material regardless of the mode of the <b>language.</b> <b>Digits</b> and number words are considered a very recent cultural invention in the evolution of the human species. Indeed, they arise from the specifically human and evolutionarily recent ability to create and mentally manipulate complex symbols. The sense of numerosity, however, is older.

40|$|Designing an {{automatic}} pattern recognition {{system is a}} challenging task. However, despite the design challenges, its enormous application potentials have {{attracted the attention of}} researchers and developers over the last four to five decades. Design of recognition systems for handwritten character applications has been a subject of intensive research, and the search is still on for a robust technique capable of dealing with natural variations in handwritten characters. In this paper the performance of Hopfield neural network (HNN) model in recognizing the handwritten Oriya (an Indian <b>language)</b> <b>digits</b> is addressed. The implementation has been carried out in two different ways. In first case, 290 test patterns (29 elements of each classes 0 - 9) created by different persons in Microsoft Paint were presented to the network in image form of 12 × 12. It is found that the network recognized 97. 95 % of the input characters correctly even if 40 % of the input characters were having a significant level of noise. In the second experiment, the inputs were the collected handwritten characters in image format. A total of 1500 different input patterns were fed to the network sequentially and 95. 4 % recognition accuracy is achived.

40|$|Some {{numerical}} knowledge, such as {{the immediate}} recognition of small quantities, is observed in animals. The development of arithmetical abilities found in mans evolution {{as well as in}} childs development represents a long process following different stages. Arithmetical abilities are relatively recent in human history and are clearly related with counting, i. e., saying aloud a series of number words that correspond to a collection of objects. Counting probably began with finger sequencing, and that may explain the 10 -base found in most numerical systems. From a neuropsychological perspective, there is a strong relationship between numerical knowledge and finger recognition, and both are impaired in cases of left posterior parietal damage (angular or Gerstmanns syndrome). Writing numbers appeared earlier in human history than written <b>language.</b> Positional <b>digit</b> value is clearly disclosed in Babylonians, and around 1, 000 BC the zero was introduced. Contemporary neuroimaging techniques, specifically fMRI, have demonstrated that the left parietal lobe, particularly the intraparietal sulcus, is systematically activated during a diverse of number tasks; other areas, particularly the frontal lobe, are also involved in processing numerical information and solving arithmetical problems. It can be conjectured that numerical abilities continue evolving due to advances in mathematical knowledge and the introduction of new technologies...|$|R
40|$|Number {{transcoding}} (e. g., writing 64 when hearing ‘sixty-four’) {{is a basic}} numerical skill; faultlessly {{performed in}} adults, but rather difficult for children. In the present study, children speaking Dutch (an inversed number language) and French (a non-inversed number <b>language)</b> wrote Arabic <b>digits</b> to dictation. We also tested their IQ and their phonological, visuospatial, and executive working memory. Although the amount of transcoding errors (e. g., hearing 46 but writing 56) was equal in both groups, the amount of inversion errors (e. g., hearing 46 but writing 64) was significantly higher in Dutch-speaking than in French-speaking children. Regression analyses confirmed that language was the only significant predictor of inversion errors. Working-memory components, in contrast, were the only significant predictors of transcoding errors. Executive resources were important in all children. Less-skilled transcoders also differed from more-skilled transcoders in that they used semantic rather than asemantic transcoding routes. Given the observed relation between number transcoding and mathematics grades, current findings may provide useful information for educational and clinical settings...|$|R

This technical specification of the information society abolishes the frontiers between the old mass media and the new computer systems which mainly operate within a peer-to-peer logic resulting in sociological changes that are still nebulous but nevertheless significantly impacting on the formation of communication contexts, on the debates about policy and regulation, and consequently, {{on the notion of}} citizenship in a globalized world. The new international configuration provided by the adoption at a planetary scale of the mathematical <b>language</b> of two <b>digits</b> has {{put an end to the}} Babel Tower and positioned the globalized local, national and supranational communities in constant interaction (even if not necessarily in dialogue).

40|$|Hearing loss has a {{prevalence}} of 10. 3 % in New Zealand, with the Māori population being disproportionately affected {{compared to the}} non-Māori population. Hearing loss is an impairment that is under-recognised, under-reported and under-treated. This {{can be explained by}} the many existing barriers – the shortage of audiological services, financial cost to an individual seeking treatment, the stigma of both hearing loss and hearing aids, and healthcare seeking rates, particularly among the Māori population. This study aimed to develop a Māori <b>language</b> adaptive <b>digit</b> triplet test that could be offered remotely via the telephone and Internet as a hearing-screening test. Three sets of recordings were made of digit triplets spoken in te reo Māori by a female speaker. Two of these sets were selected for normalisation in speech noise. Normal-hearing participants (8 listeners) with hearing thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL were tested to establish the intelligibility of the individual recorded digits at various signal-to-noise ratios (- 13, - 10. 5, - 8 and - 5. 5 dB). Psychometric functions were fitted to the intelligibility data, and the digits in each position of the triplet that had the steepest slope were selected as the final test stimuli. The level of each selected digit was then adjusted to achieve equal intelligibility as measured at the midpoints of the psychometric functions. These digits were then assembled into eight equivalent lists of similar difficulty, ready for pilot testing. Due to low participant numbers, the pilot testing phase was not completed. Further development of this test continues as the focus of a follow-on study...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the prefrontal cortex on the improvement of verbal, visuospatial working memory and naming in healthy adults. Method Thirty two healthy adults (15 males and 17 females, mean age 37. 3 ± 13. 0 years) were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into four groups randomly. They underwent sham or anodal tDCS over {{the left or right}} prefrontal cortex, for 20 minutes at a direct current of 1 mA. Before and immediately after tDCS, the subjects performed the Korean version of the mini-mental state exam (K-MMSE) and stroop test (color/word/interference) for the screening of cognitive function. For working memory and <b>language</b> evaluation, the <b>digit</b> span test (forward/ backward), the visuospatial attention test in computer assisted cognitive program (CogPack®) and the Korean-Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) were assessed before tDCS, immediately after tDCS, and 2 weeks after tDCS. Results The stroop test (word/interference), backward digit span test and K-BNT were improved in the left prefrontal tDCS group compared with that of the sham group (p< 0. 05). The stroop test (interference) and visuospatial attention test were in the right prefrontal tDCS group compared with that of the sham group (p< 0. 05). Their improvement lasted for 2 weeks after stimulation. Conclusion tDCS can induce verbal working memory improvement and naming facilitation by stimulating the left prefrontal cortex. It can also improve the visuospatial working memory by stimulating the right prefrontal cortex. Further studies which are lesion and symptom specific tDCS treatment for rehabilitation of stroke can be carried out...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Four studies {{investigated}} potential psycho-linguistic {{predictors of}} Ll Arabic and L 2 English literacy skills amongst Arabic speaking children in different school stages in Kuwait: primary, intermediate and secondary. Word-level reading, reading comprehension and writing production measures determined literacy levels across the groups. Phonological processing skills were assessed by measures of phonological awareness, rapid naming and phonological memory, {{and measures of}} listening comprehension, morphological awareness, vocabulary and syntax {{were used to assess}} more general <b>language</b> skills. Backward <b>digit</b> span and listening span were also used to measure working memory processes. The results argued for the influence of these psycho-linguistic skills on bilingual literacy development, with measures of phonological, morphological and syntactic awareness being reliable predictors of reading comprehension in both Arabic and English. Non- word decoding and phonological awareness predicted variance in basic word-level literacy skills in both Arabic and English. Morphological awareness explained variance in reading comprehension in Ll Arabic and L 2 English independent from word decoding skills. Vocabulary and syntax had comparable strengths in explaining variability in reading comprehension and writing production in both languages. And L 2 working memory was important for L 2 reading comprehension. In addition, there were cross-language predictions: L 2 listening comprehension supported Ll reading comprehension, while Ll non-word reading and syntactic ability supported L 2 reading comprehension. Although some relationships seemed to be more specific to one orthography or LUL 2, there was a commonality of predictors for English and Arabic literacy skills through the four studies, which allowed models of psycho-linguistic influences on literacy development to be developed based on current perspectives on literacy acquisition. These models and newly-developed literacy measures appropriate for work with Arab bilingual children should inform future research and practice, as well as theory 2 development, which should increase understanding ofliteracy development in non- English contexts.

40|$|Background: It is well {{documented}} that children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) experience significant grammatical deficits. While much of the focus {{in the past has}} been on their morphosyntactic difficulties, less is known about their acquisition of complex syntactic structures such as relative clauses. The role of memory in language performance has also become increasingly prominent in the literature. Aims: This study aims to investigate the control of an important complex syntactic structure, the relative clause, by school age children with SLI in Ireland, using a newly devised sentence recall task. It also aims to explore the role of verbal and short-termworking memory in the performance of children with SLI on the sentence recall task, using a standardized battery of tests based on Baddeley’s model of working memory. Methods and Procedures: Thirty two children with SLI, thirty two age matched typically developing children (AM-TD) between the ages of 6 and 7, 11 years and twenty younger typically developing (YTD) children between 4, 7 and 5 years, completed the task. The sentence recall (SR) task included 52 complex sentences and 17 fillers. It included relative clauses that are used in natural discourse and that reflect a developmental hierarchy. The relative clauses were also controlled for length and varied in syntactic complexity, representing the full range of syntactic roles. There were seven different relative clause types attached to either the predicate nominal of a copular clause (Pn), or to the direct object of a transitive clause (Do). Responses were recorded, transcribed and entered into a database for analysis. TheWorkingMemory Test Battery for children (WMTB-C—Pickering & Gathercole, 2001) was administered in order to explore the role of short-term memory and working memory on the children’s performance on the SR task. Outcomes and Results: The children with SLI showed significantly greater difficulty than the AM-TD group and the YTD group. With the exception of the genitive subject clauses, the children with SLI scored significantly higher on all sentences containing a Pn main clause than those containing a transitive main clause. Analysis of error types revealed the frequent production of a different type of relative clause than that presented in the task—with a strong word order preference in the NVN direction indicated for the children with SLI. The SR performance for the children with SLI was most highly correlated with expressive <b>language</b> skills and <b>digit</b> recall. Conclusions and Implications: Children with SLI have significantly greater difficulty with relative clauses than YTD children who are on average two years younger—relative clauses are a delay within a delay. Unlike the YTD children they show a tendency to simplify relative clauses in the noun verb noun (NVN) direction. They show a developmental hierarchy in their production of relative clause constructions and are highly influenced by the frequency distribution of the relative clauses in the ambient language...|$|R
