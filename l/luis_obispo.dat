5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced.

50|$|One {{story of}} its birth is that Cal Poly San <b>Luis</b> <b>Obispo’s</b> {{students}} and administration wanted {{to present the}} school {{to the rest of}} the community by placing a “P” for Poly on the campus hillside. A lot of thought was put into the idea of whether to use a water tower with a “P” painted on it, or to construct a giant “P”. The idea of the “P” on the hillside won because of the expensive costs of purchasing a water tower. It was purposely placed in a spot that could be viewed from three specific locations: the administration building’s porch, the newly constructed Highway 101, and the air, as flying was becoming popular.|$|R

The primary objective is to promote the development of small scale wind turbine blades in ways that resemble, as closely as possible, the construction and methods of utility scale turbine blade manufacturing. Vacuum infusion is employed to create a hollow, multi piece, lightweight design using carbon fiber and fiberglass with an epoxy based resin. A “rapid prototyping” method is developed using high density foam molds that allows short cycle time between design iterations of aerodynamic planforms. A production run of eight blades is manufactured and key components of the blade are tested to determine the appropriateness of the design...|$|R
