5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features. The pipeline {{was designed to be}} pressurized, so any leak would be instantly detected by a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1983, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry {{collided}} with a KC-135A Tanker aircraft over Saudi Arabia during Operation ELF-1. Both aircraft were recovered back to Riyadh Air Base. The Tanker received substantial damage, with parts impact and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> as well as shut down of the two starboard engines. The E-3 received severe damage with the partial loss of a left wing section.|$|E

However, if the water becomes too hot, injectors lose efficiency and can fail. For this reason, the tanks often stopped short of the hotter and uninsulated smokebox.|$|E

500|$|A sudden {{reduction}} in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew. Above , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a [...] "time of useful consciousness" [...] up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete. At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; {{a breach of}} cabin integrity {{would result in a}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss {{in the event of a}} breach, a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent. Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{diffuser}} is to slow the high speed, highly compressed, air from the compressor to a velocity optimal for the combustor. Reducing the velocity results in an unavoidable loss in total pressure, {{so one of the}} design challenges is to limit the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> as much as possible. Furthermore, the diffuser must be designed to limit the flow distortion as much as possible by avoiding flow effects like boundary layer separation. Like most other gas turbine engine components, the diffuser is designed to be as short and light as possible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is shown}} {{that one of}} the most {{efficient}} ways to obtain emulsion is cavitation treatment of the mixed stream in the jet boundary layer. The authors offer a model for calculating the operational process in the hydrodynamic mixer with multiple-jet nozzle as agitator of cavitation, based on hydrodynamic equations and data of experimental research on jet pumps. There has been considered and analyzed the characteristic of the cavitation mixer, which shows how relative <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> total stream <b>pressure</b> depends on relative nozzle square, and hydraulic resistance coefficient of flow-part elements. It is shown that gradual reduction of hydraulic resistance coefficient allows to decrease considerably the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> total stream <b>pressure.</b> Besides, there exists the range of optimal relative square values where <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> total <b>pressure</b> are minimized. If the elements of the mixer flow-part are made hydraulically proper then the optimal values of the nozzle relative square are 0, 66 … 0, 76, whereas minimum <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>pressure</b> don’t exceed 0, 22...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{researchers}} independently {{proposed the}} installation of degassing columns from rafts in the lake. The principle is simple: a pump lifts water {{from the bottom of}} the lake, heavily saturated with , until the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> begins releasing the gas from the diphasic fluid and thus makes the process self-powered. In 1992 at Monoun, and in 1995 at Nyos, a French team directed by Michel Halbwachs demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. [...] In 2001, the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance funded a permanent installation at Nyos.|$|E
2500|$|The Travel Air Type R Hawks flew, was {{the fourth}} {{of a series of}} five racers and was {{configured}} for long-distance racing with longer wings and a full set of instrumentation, features that differentiated the aircraft {{from the rest of the}} series. Hawks raced [...] "Texaco 13" [...] as [...] "race No. 28" [...] in the 1930 Thompson Trophy Race at the National Air Races on September 1, 1930, using a set of [...] "racing wings", a pair of shorter wingspan wings fitted out at the factory. Hawks pulled out of the race on the third lap when the engine began to falter at full throttle. It was revealed later that a piece of masking tape placed over the gas cap (for streamlining) caused a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, {{just before}} the end of the war, an American court {{overturned}} a conviction against Margaret Sanger. In this case, the judge ruled that condoms could be legally advertised and sold for the prevention of disease. [...] There were still a few state laws against buying and selling contraceptives, and advertising condoms as birth control devices remained illegal in over thirty states. [...] But condoms began to be publicly, legally sold to Americans for the first time in forty-five years. [...] Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes. [...] Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure.</b> Several American companies sold their rejects under cheaper brand names rather than discarding them. [...] Consumers were advised to perform similar tests themselves before use, although few actually did so. [...] Worldwide, condoms sales doubled in the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} threats to the mound springs comes from the {{extraction}} {{of water from the}} Great Artesian Basin for pastoral use. This leads to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> aquifer <b>pressure</b> causing lower spring flows. Almost all of the mound springs in western New South Wales are now extinct due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> aquifer <b>pressure.</b> The other main threat to the mound springs in the park comes from trampling and grazing from feral species such as goats (Capra hircus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and from rooting by feral pigs (Sus scrofa). Feral pigs can be particularly destructive for mound springs as they dig up the ground searching for roots and tubers.|$|R
