40|$|The {{rolling mills}} {{cylinders}} are apply to thermo-mechanical stresses that are variable, complex, with extremely marked influences. Therefore, to intensify the rolling processes {{we need to}} observe the durability limits. To this purpose {{it is necessary to}} know the type of stress, the materials, and a detailed characterizes evaluation, to determine exploitation timing and to compare with previously established values. The paper presents experimental determinations of the mechanical stresses that take place during plastic deformation in rolling cylinders in exploitation. When being used, the <b>laminating</b> <b>rolls</b> are compared to the thermal tensions that cause thermal fatigue. This fatigue is the main cause for <b>laminating</b> <b>rolls</b> break.

It consists of pre-heated steel coils that are sandwiched between {{one or two}} sheets of polymer. The heated sheets are then immediately quenched, which yields a strong bond between the layers. A new multi-layer polymer coated steel has been developed for can manufacturing. This material presents an interesting extension to previous research on polymer laminated steel in ironing. This work shows a modelization for the ironing process (the most crucial step in can manufacturing) done by using a neural network...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} {{operations}} of the breadmaking chain, the impact of shaping on dough cellular structure has scarcely been studied. In this work, wheat flour dough has been <b>laminated</b> under different <b>roll</b> gap conditions delta(mm) = (2, 5, 10, 20, infinity). Rheological properties were measured under large and small strains, by lubricated squeezing flow test and dynamic thermomechanical analysis, respectively. Laminating has a limited effect on the elongational viscosity of the dough. However, the minimum value of the ratio of storage modulus reached for gap delta = 5 mm suggests that gluten network structuration is improved in this case. The kinetics of porosity and shape ratio of fermenting laminated doughs were calculated from image analysis of dough follow-up during proofing. They showed that stability is improved for delta = 5 mm. Finally, Xray tomography experiments, performed on <b>laminated</b> <b>rolled</b> dough during proofing, confirmed that the main changes {{can be attributed to}} an increase of cellular homogeneity at delta = 5 mm, reflected by lower median gas cell size and less spread size distributions...|$|R

Observou-se que as embalagens laminadas não evitaram a absorção de água, enquanto a atividade de água aumentou e os açúcares redutores diminuíram com o tempo; por outro lado, a acidez total titulável diminuiu mas apenas nos primeiros vinte dias; enfim, todas as amostras sofreram escurecimento durante o armazenamento.

40|$|Trimodal composites, {{consisting}} of ultrafine grains, coarse grains, and particles, {{are known to}} possess desirable combinations of physical and mechanical properties. In this paper, we report the fabrication of a sheet of trimodal material using roll bonding and annealing of an Al/Ti/Al laminate at 873 K for durations ranging from 6 h to 168 h. The Al/Ti/Al <b>laminate</b> was <b>roll</b> bonded from 625 μm (Al sheet thickness 300 μm, Ti foil thickness 25 μm) to 130 μm. The Ti layer was seen to break up and disperse in the aluminium matrix after rolling. It was found that when the annealing time was less than 12 h, there were residual voids at the interface between the TiAl 3 and Al layers, resulting in reduced ductility and strength of the composite sheet. When the annealing time was increased to 24 h, there were no residual voids and the laminate {{became a kind of}} trimodal material, {{consisting of}} a combination of coarse-grained Al, ultrafine-grained Ti and TiAl 3 particles. This kind of laminate shows the highest yield strength and good ductility. With a further increase in the annealing time to 168 h, no residual pure Ti was seen in the laminate and the TiAl 3 particles were found to be distributed in the Al matrix close to the laminate surface, leading to lower strength and ductility. We also discuss the microstructure evolution and the deformation mechanism during tensile testing...|$|R
50|$|Whether {{small office}} or {{industrial}} machines their primary {{function is to}} embellish or protect printed works. Such laminators are used to apply varying thicknesses of lamination film onto substrates such as paper or fabrics. The main advantage {{to the use of}} heated roll laminators is that of speed. Heated laminators use heated rollers or heated shoes to melt the glue which is applied to lamination film. The process of heating the glue prior to applying the film to a substrate allows for a faster application of the film. The laminates and adhesives used are generally cheaper to manufacture than cold <b>roll</b> <b>laminates,</b> often as much as half the cost depending on the comparison made. As the materials are non-adhesive until exposed to heat, they are much easier to handle. The glue is solid at room temperature, so lamination of this type is less likely to shift or warp after its application than pressure activated laminates, which rely on a highly viscous, adhesive fluid.|$|R
50|$|Advances in {{the iron}} and steel {{industries}} allowed the new forts to use armor in innovative ways. In 1875, the Mougin system of <b>laminated</b> armor using <b>rolled</b> iron was first used in casemates to provide protection against field guns. Rolled iron gave way to cast iron, providing protection against siege guns. Mougin also devised the Mougin turret, a revolving cast iron turret for 155 mm guns. Cast iron was not altogether suitable for protection against explosive shells and its use was discontinued in 1882. In 1885, steel was substituted for cast iron. Such non-retractable, or non-eclipsing turrets could avoid direct-fire damage to their gun embrasures, only by facing away {{from the direction of}} fire. Eclipsing turrets were developed that could retract {{in the face of such}} attack, leaving only their top surfaces exposed. Such turrets were expensive and complex, with serious problems of noise and ventilation but were shown to be effective. Where possible, casemated artillery was used, due to the lower cost of such an emplacement. While heavy armament was being armored, lighter armament and observers were also protected. A range of armored machine gun and observation positions were developed and were widely installed.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{treatments}} of Aluminium alloys for laminates used for rigid and semi-rigid packaging sectors are well established since many years. In such applications {{the use of}} surface treatments enhances the adhesion of the polymer coating to the metallic substrate {{in order to increase}} its corrosion resistance. In flexible packaging, however, such treatments are hardly to be applied due the micrometer thickness of the laminates (normally in the range 6. 3 ÷ 40 mm) that are, currently, subject to a thermal degreasing for the evaporation of fluids used in the cold rolling process. The reason for the almost 2 ̆ 2 no knowledge 2 ̆ 2 of surface {{treatments of}} rolled aluminium with micrometric thickness arises from the fact that these treatments, up to a decade ago, were made only in immersion baths with processes requiring subsequent rinsing in demineralised water (rinse process). This process, for the complexity and length of installations, is not achievable on thin <b>rolled</b> <b>laminates.</b> In the last years, however, the spread and consolidation of the treatments applied by coater not requiring any rinsing (no rinse surface treatments) opens up opportunities in the field of flexible packaging. Moreover, electrochemical techniques, such as: (i) potentiodynamic polarization measurements (used to assess the degree of protection offered by the pre-treatment), (ii) Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy EIS (used on rolled after coating application of polymeric coatings, in order to evaluate the corrosion resistance), (iii) capacity measurements at fixed frequency (which allow us to monitor the kinetics of absorption of water and electrolytes in the protective polymer coating), in addition to innovative methodologies such as cathodic delamination test (test carried out in continuous current through which is possible to obtain information on the adhesion of paint to the metal substrate) allow to measure accurately (and rapidly) the advantages offered by the chemical pre-treatment of the surface and to evaluate the improvements both in terms of corrosion and adhesion resistance...|$|R
