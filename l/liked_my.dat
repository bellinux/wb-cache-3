500|$|Paramount's {{vice-president}} of music Joel Sill took a liking to a 28-year-old composer named James Horner, feeling that his demo tapes {{stood out from}} generic film music. Horner was introduced to Bennett, Meyer and Salin. [...] Horner said that [...] " [...] {{did not want the}} kind of score they had gotten before. They did not want a John Williams score, per se. They wanted something different, more modern." [...] When asked about how he landed the assignment, the composer replied that [...] "the producers loved my work for Wolfen, and had heard my music for several other projects, and I think, so far as I've been told, they <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> versatility very much. I wanted the assignment, and I met with them, we all got along well, they were impressed with my music, and that's how it happened." [...] Horner agreed with the producers' expectations and agreed to begin work in mid-January 1982.|$|E
500|$|Stephen {{was written}} by Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with her mother Pebe Sebert, David Gamson, and Oliver Leiber. The song was produced by Gamson with additional production by Leiber. Gamson played all the instruments on the song, {{with the exception of}} the accordion which was performed by Kesha. The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song. [...] "He does all the keyboard stuff, he's amazing, a crazy cynical genius guy, and he <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> voice and my thing, and I really liked his thing, so we decided to work together" [...] she explained.|$|E

[...] "And don't drive like his brother!" [...] and [...] "Don't drive <b>like</b> <b>my</b> sister..." [...] "And don't drive <b>like</b> <b>my</b> sister!" [...] The tagline was heard in the Pixar film Cars, in which Tom and Ray voiced anthropomorphized vehicles (Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze, respectively a 1963 Dodge Dart V1.0 and 1963 Dodge A100 van, as Lightning McQueen's racing sponsors) with personalities similar to their own on-air personae.

After meeting {{her at the}} Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. She called a doctor, who {{prescribed}} some medicine and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacist's. When she came back, Louis was dead. On her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, {{in the words of}} her biographer, [...] "became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe's surviving royalty". In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Philip's education and upbringing during his parents' separation and his mother's institutionalisation. Prince Philip recalled, [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> grandmother very much and she was always helpful. She was very good with children... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional." ...|$|E

Spence D. of IGN wrote that the lyrics evoke [...] "the crossroads of Old School and New School." [...] "One Love" [...] is composed of a series of letters to incarcerated friends, recounting mutual acquaintances and events that have occurred since the receiver's imprisonment, and address unfaithful girlfriends, emotionally tortured mothers, and underdog loyalty. The phrase [...] "one love" [...] signifies street loyalty in the song. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastises a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin to tell me that he <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> style [...] Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Produced by Q-Tip, [...] "One Love" [...] samples the double bass and piano from the Heath Brothers' [...] "Smilin' Billy Suite Part II" [...] (1975) and the drum break from Parliament's [...] "Come In Out the Rain" [...] (1970), complementing the track's mystical and hypnotic soundscape.|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions."

500|$|Joy Division {{took time}} to develop their style. As Warsaw, they played [...] "fairly undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock". Critic Simon Reynolds wrote that their {{originality}} only [...] "really became apparent as the songs got slower". Their music took on a [...] "sparse" [...] quality; according to Reynolds, [...] "Peter Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater." [...] According to music critic Jon Savage, [...] "Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound [...] "came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow {{the rhythm of the}} band, which gave us our own edge." [...] By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{encountered}} young screenwriter and aspiring director Harmony Korine in Washington Square Park in New York City {{during her}} {{senior year of high}} school in 1993. The two became close friends, which resulted in her being cast in the low-budget independent film Kids (1995). Directed by Larry Clark and written by Korine, Sevigny plays a New York teenager who discovers she is HIV positive. According to Sevigny, she was originally cast in a much smaller role in the film, but ended up replacing Canadian actress Mia Kirshner. Just two days before production began, the leading role went to the then-19-year-old Sevigny, who had no professional acting experience; she said of her casting in the role, [...] "Harmony [...] just thought I was this sweet, cute girl and he <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> blonde hair." [...] Nonetheless, Kids was highly controversial; the film was given an NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for its graphic depiction of sexuality and recreational substance and drug use involving teenagers. Despite its controversy, Kids was taken note of critically and commercially: respected film critic Janet Maslin considered the film a [...] "wake-up call to the modern world" [...] about the nature of the American youth in contemporary urban settings. Sevigny's performance was praised, with critics noting that she brought a tenderness to the chaotic, immoral nature of the film: [...] "Sevigny provided the warm, reflective center in this feral film". She ended up receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I think they just never <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E
