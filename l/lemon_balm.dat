500|$|Studies on the non-vascular flora {{recorded}} {{the presence of}} about 150 moss species {{in the area of}} the national park, including one newly described taxon. Many herbs of the Vikos Gorge and other areas within the park were regarded to have medicinal properties and were once harvested by local healers, colloquially referred to as [...] "Vikos doctors" [...] ( [...] , [...] "Vikoiatri"). These herbal healers used special recipes that were often copies of ancient Greek recipes of Hippocrates or Dioscorides and became famous beyond the borders of Greece. The plants used in these recipes include the <b>lemon</b> <b>balm</b> Melissa officinalis, Tilia tomentosa, the spearmint Mentha spicata, the gas-plant Dictamnus albus, St John’s Wort Hypericum perforatum, [...] absinth Artemisia absinthium, the very popular Sideritis raeseri, known colloquially in Greece as “mountain tea”, and the elder bush Sambucus nigra. A chemical screening of these native plant species has shown that a high number of them are characterized by biologically active ingredients. A collection of 2,500 dried species of local plants and herbs is exhibited in the local natural history museum in the village of Koukouli.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the growth and essential oil production of Melissa officinalis in the climatic conditions of Montes Claros – MG. The experiment was conducted from May to November 2009. The experimental design was completely randomized (CRD) with four treatments and five repetitions. In the first analysis, the effect of harvesting time on the biomass and essential oil was evaluated. In the second analysis, the production of biomass and essential oil after 30 days of harvest of the previous study was evaluated. The data were submitted to regression analysis using the software SAEG. From the results, the first cut at 33 days, increased the percentage of dry matter, and the best time of production of the <b>Lemon</b> <b>Balm’s</b> essential oil occurred during regrowth, 30 days after the first harvest of the younger plant. This study concluded that the early harvest in the conditions of northern Minas Gerais favors the production of biomass and feature content of essential oil similar to other crops...|$|R

The wine produced was given the name Kaltes Ende ("cold end" [...] in German), until it was altered to the similar-sounding term Kalte Ente meaning [...] "cold duck".

40|$|A utilização de malhas fotoconversoras para o cultivo de algumas espécies ornamentais e olerícolas tornou-se comum. Diante da grande influência que a radiação solar exerce sobre os vegetais, esta pesquisa foi realizada com o objetivo de avaliar o efeito da intensidade e da qualidade espectral da luz transmitida pelas malhas fotoconversoras (Chromatinet®) em relação a aspectos fisiológicos de crescimento (teor, rendimento e composição química) do óleo essencial de Melissa officinalis L. Em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, foram dispostos quatro tratamentos e cinco repetições, sendo cada parcela composta de quatro vasos (uma planta por vaso). Os tratamentos foram caracterizados por plantas de melissa cultivadas a pleno sol, em malha preta (50 %), em malha Chromatinet® vermelha (50 %) e em Chromatinet® azul (50 %). As características avaliadas consistiram em: fitomassa seca de folhas, caules, parte aérea, raízes e total; razão raiz/parte aérea; área foliar total; razão de área foliar; razão de peso foliar; área foliar específica; teor, rendimento e composição química do óleo essencial. A utilização de malhas no cultivo de melissa favoreceu o crescimento, independentemente da cor, em relação ao cultivo a pleno sol. Sob a malha vermelha houve menores teor e rendimento óleo essencial, porém apresentou o maior teor de citral. The use {{of color}} shading nets for {{cultivation}} of some ornamentals and vegetables has become common. Thus, observing the great influence of the solar radiation on the plant physiology, {{the objective of this}} research was to evaluate the the quantity and quality effects of spectral light transmitted through color shading nets (Chromatinet®) in Melissa officinalis L., including physiological aspects as:growth,content and chemistry composition. Four treatments and five replications were disposed in a completely randomized design, being each experimental unit composed by four pots (one plant per pot). The treatments were <b>lemon</b> <b>balm's</b> plants cultivated under full sunshine, black shading net (50 %), red shading net (50 %) and blue shading net (50 %). The characteristics evaluated were: plant's height; dry phytomass of leaves, stems, aerial part, roots and total; root/aerial part ratio; total leaf area; leaf area ratio; leaf weight ratio; specific leaf area; content, yield and composition of the essential oil. The utilization of nets favored the growth organs dry phytomass yield, independently of the color, in comparison with total sun light. Plants under red shading had lower content of essential oil and yield, but they showed the higher content of citral...|$|R
