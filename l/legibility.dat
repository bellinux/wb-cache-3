5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when <b>legibility</b> was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining <b>legibility</b> and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E

25|$|In the {{interest}} of pan-dialectal <b>legibility,</b> the Berber Latin alphabet omits the partly phonemic contrasts found in some Berber language varieties (notably the Kabyle language and Tarifit) between stops and fricatives.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{specifies}} {{what appears}} on the obverse and reverse of its currency. The specifications mentioned here imply the use of all upper-case letters, although they appear here in upper and lower case letters for the <b>legibility</b> of the article.|$|E
25|$|Much more loosely, Transport, the {{typeface}} used on British road signs, {{was designed}} by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert influenced by Akzidenz-Grotesk. However, many adaptations and letters influenced by other typefaces were incorporated to increase <b>legibility</b> and make characters more distinct.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, one {{thousand}} {{copies of the}} Lotus sutra were printed in 1009 as a pious work, {{not intended to be}} read and therefore <b>legibility</b> was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legibility</b> of text on {{packaging}} and labels is always subjective {{due to the}} inherent variations of people. Efforts {{have been made to}} help better quantify this by people in a laboratory: still using people for the evaluation but also employing a test apparatus to help reduce variability.|$|E
25|$|Times Modern was {{unveiled}} on 20 November 2006, as the successor of Times Classic. Designed for improving <b>legibility</b> in smaller font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled bracket serifs. The font {{was published by}} Elsner + Flake as EF Times Modern; it was designed by Research Studios, led by Ben Preston (deputy editor of The Times) and designer Neville Brody.|$|E
25|$|Basic service: All {{types of}} {{extinguisher}} require a basic inspection annually to check weight, externally validate the correct pressure, and find {{any signs of}} damage or corrosion. Cartridge extinguishers are to be opened up for internal inspection, {{and to have the}} weight of the cartridge tested. Labels must be inspected for <b>legibility,</b> and where possible, dip tubes, hoses and mechanisms must be tested for clear, free operation.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, Samsung {{unveiled}} its SamsungOne font, a typeface that {{hopes to}} give a consistent and universal visual identity to {{the wide range of}} Samsung products. SamsungOne was designed to be used across Samsung's diverse device portfolio, with a focus on <b>legibility</b> for everything from smaller devices like smartphones to larger connected TVs or refrigerators, as well as Samsung marketing and advertisements. The font family supports 400 different languages through over 25,000 characters.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} improve <b>legibility</b> or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been {{produced}} using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is Lance Wyman's early plans for the Mexico City Metro, on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the Washington Metro, though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are Fukuoka, Guadalajara and Monterrey.|$|E
25|$|A phonetic {{conversion}} goes {{one step}} further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language, sacrificing <b>legibility</b> if necessary by using characters or conventions {{not found in the}} target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent every possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to coarticulation effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The International Phonetic Alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription.|$|E
25|$|Because contractions that occupy {{only the}} lower half of the braille cell mostly double as basic {{punctuation}} marks, <b>legibility</b> requires that, with few exceptions, they may not come in contact with actual punctuation marks; if they would, they should instead be spelled out. That is, any cell which follows without an intervening space should contain a dot in its top row. Most of the difficulties of when to use contractions are due to this complication.|$|E
25|$|The Times is the {{originator}} of {{the widely}} used Times Roman typeface, originally developed by Stanley Morison of The Times {{in collaboration with}} the Monotype Corporation for its <b>legibility</b> in low-tech printing. In November 2006 The Times began printing headlines in a new font, Times Modern. The Times was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years, but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. The Sunday Times remains a broadsheet.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} University logo {{comprises the}} University {{name and the}} UH symbol in a horizontal panel. There is an exclusion zone equivalent to {{the height of the}} H in the logo above, below and {{to the right of the}} logo. The University have created an endorsed version of the logo to be used where <b>legibility</b> is an issue with the standard logo. It comprises just the University name in a horizontal panel. Although the University brands its logo in various colours, the standard colour is Hertfordshire Cyan.|$|E
25|$|The Clearview typeface, {{developed}} by US researchers to provide improved <b>legibility,</b> is permitted for light legend on dark backgrounds under FHWA interim approval. Clearview has seen widespread use by {{state departments of}} transportation in Arkansas, Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. The Kansas Turnpike Authority has also introduced Clearview typeface to some of its newer guide signs along the Kansas Turnpike, but the state of Kansas continues to use the FHWA typefaces for signage on its non-tolled Interstates and freeways.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco is {{currently}} used for user interface across all of Apple's product line, including watchOS, macOS and iOS. It {{was first introduced}} alongside the Apple Watch, where it was used for enhanced <b>legibility</b> and taller x-heights for easy reading on a small display. The design references {{a number of different}} other typefaces, notably FF DIN (used in the UI of the Camera app in iOS 7 and above), Helvetica (used in the UI in iOS 6 and below), Helvetica Neue (used in the UI of iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite), Roboto (Google's new UI typeface), and Univers (used on Apple's early keyboard designs).|$|E
25|$|Sans serif (lit. without serif) designs {{appeared}} relatively {{recently in}} the history of type design. The first, similar to slab serif designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. Sans serif fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage, headings, and other situations demanding <b>legibility</b> above high readability. The text on electronic media offers an exception to print: most web pages and digitized media are laid out in sans serif typefaces because serifs often detract from readability at the low resolution of displays. Many have minimal variation in stroke width, creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design.|$|E
25|$|Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla (died 940), an {{accomplished}} calligrapher from Baghdad, {{was also a}} prominent figure at this time. He became vizir to three Abbasid caliphs and is credited with developing the ﬁrst script to obey strict proportional rules. Ibn Muqla’s system {{was used in the}} development and standardization of the Quranic script, and his calligraphic work became the standard way of writing the Quran. However it was later perfected by Ibn al-Bawwab (d. 1022), the master calligrapher who continued Muqla’s tradition. Muqla’s system {{became one of the most}} popular styles for transcribing Arabic manuscripts in general, being favored for its <b>legibility.</b> The eleventh century Qur'an is one of the earliest dated manuscripts in this style.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of Chartres Cathedral {{is the extent}} to which architectural structure has been adapted to meet the needs of stained glass. The use of a three-part elevation with external buttressing allowed for far larger windows than earlier designs, particularly at the clerestory level. Most cathedrals of the period had a mixture of windows containing plain or grisaille glass and windows containing dense stained glass panels, with the result that the brightness of the former tended to diminish the impact and <b>legibility</b> of the latter. At Chartres, nearly all of the 176 windows were filled with equally dense stained glass, creating a relatively dark but richly coloured interior in which the light filtering through the myriad narrative and symbolic windows was the main source of illumination.|$|E
25|$|Gamelan {{music is}} {{traditionally}} not notated and {{began as an}} oral tradition. In the 19th century, however, the kraton (palaces) of Yogyakarta and Surakarta developed distinct notations for transcribing the repertoire. These {{were not used to}} read the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six or seven vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the balungan (melodic framework), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a gatra) are darkened for <b>legibility.</b> Symbols on the left indicate the colotomic or metric structure of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.|$|E
500|$|However, typographic {{opinions}} are typically anecdotal with {{no basis in}} evidence. [...] "Opinions are not always safe guides to <b>legibility</b> of print", and when direct studies are conducted, anecdotal opinions—even those of experts—can {{turn out to be}} false. Text that seems legible (visually pleasing at first glance) may be shown to actually impair reading effectiveness when subjected to scientific study.|$|E
500|$|When it was {{released}} in the US in 1982, the record label changed the artwork to a simpler, red-tinted design – [...] "this horrible 'new-wave'-looking generic cover", in Ashton's view. Richard Butler {{says that when he}} first saw the replacement cover, he [...] "actually burst into tears". Ostensibly Columbia decreed the change to increase <b>legibility</b> of the band's name, and perhaps to mimic the design of the previous album, Talk Talk Talk.|$|E
500|$|Double square {{brackets}} [...] {{are used for}} extra-precise transcription. They indicate that a letter has its cardinal IPA value. For example, [...] is an open front vowel, rather than the perhaps slightly different value (such as open central) that [...] "" [...] {{may be used to}} transcribe in a particular language. Thus two vowels transcribed for easy <b>legibility</b> as [...] and [...] may be clarified as actually being [...] and [...] may be more precisely [...]|$|E
500|$|Claims abound {{regarding}} the <b>legibility</b> and readability {{of the single}} and double sentence spacing methods—by proponents on both sides. [...] Supporters of single spacing assert that familiarity with the current standard in books, magazines, and the Web enhances readability, that double spacing looks strange in text using proportional fonts, and that the [...] "rivers" [...] and [...] "holes" [...] caused by double spacing impair readability. Proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible, particularly noting the very small visual difference between a dot and a comma.|$|E
500|$|Ohio's flag is {{the only}} non-rectangular U.S. state flag. It is a rare example of a non-quadrilateral civil flag, another {{well-known}} example being the flag of Nepal. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, it may be loosely based upon cavalry flags of the Civil War and Spanish–American War. The flag has been officially defined as a [...] "burgee" [...] since 2002, even though burgees are typically used as maritime flags. Its shape, lack of text, and mirror symmetry {{allow it to be}} flown or hung in various orientations without affecting <b>legibility.</b> On account of the flag's uncommon shape, foreign manufacturers have occasionally set the entire design against a white, rectangular field.|$|E
500|$|The bold weights of Gill Sans, {{including}} Kayo, {{have been}} particularly criticised for design {{issues such as the}} eccentric design of the [...] "i" [...] and [...] "j", and for their extreme boldness. (Gill Sans' standard weight is, as already noted, already quite bold by modern standards.) Gill argued in his Essay on Typography that the nineteenth-century tendency to make sans-serif typefaces attention-grabbingly bold was self-defeating, since the result was compromised <b>legibility.</b> In the closing paragraph he ruefully noted how he had contributed to the genre: There are now about as many different varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools. I myself am responsible for designing five different sorts of sans-serif letters – each one thicker and fatter than the last because each advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours.|$|E
500|$|The IPA {{once had}} {{parallel}} symbols from alternative proposals, {{but in most}} cases eventually settled on one for each sound. The rejected symbols are now considered obsolete. An example is the vowel letter , rejected in favor of [...] Letters for affricates and sounds with inherent secondary articulation have also been mostly rejected, with the idea that such features should be indicated with tie bars or diacritics: [...] for [...] is one. In addition, the rare voiceless implosives, , have been dropped and are now usually written [...] A retired set of click letters, , is still sometimes seen, as the official pipe letters [...] may cause problems with <b>legibility,</b> especially when used with brackets ( [...] or / /), the letter , or the prosodic marks [...] (for this reason, some publications which use the current IPA pipe letters disallow IPA brackets).|$|E
500|$|Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought {{previously}} existing Nintendo DS {{games were}} revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased <b>legibility</b> of text, respectively. CVG's Mike Jackson {{argued that the}} bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained [...] "if you tend not {{to carry it out}} with you, and only ever tend to use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".|$|E
500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the <b>legibility</b> of the text. That seems like a bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey {{called it}} a martial-arts {{spectacle}} that [...] "may just {{be one of the}} best bad movies ever." [...] Sharkey said that some uneven performances and lack of refinement were the result of RZA's lack of directing experience, but appreciated the choreography of the [...] "extreme action" [...] and the film's visual aesthetic, which she described as [...] "a blend of French Baroque and ancient China". Sharkey said that the plot [...] "goes seriously off-course" [...] when expanding on the Blacksmith's history. The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy said that the film is [...] "sufficiently well done and amusing enough to satisfy the appetites of fans who mainline this sort of thing," [...] but considered that in directly acting as an homage to the genre, it lacked any stylistic inspiration or imaginative flair to reinvent it. McCarthy however praised the imaginative weapon designs, and the performances of Lucy Liu and Crowe. The Village Voices Nick Pinkerton said [...] "the action scenes are often too cluttered for <b>legibility,</b> and, curious to say of a movie made by a musician, the film has broad swaths without tempo", and added that it has a homemade charm that he found [...] "curiously touching".|$|E
500|$|Developed by the Monotype {{drawing office}} team in Salfords, Surrey, led by Fritz Steltzer, the project veered {{away from a}} purely {{faithful}} revival towards a denser, more condensed design. This differentiated it from the other Janson revivals on the market. Nicholas commented [...] "I think it was Morison's take on Janson - made a little heavier and narrower to give improved <b>legibility</b> and economy." [...] Typesetting expert Yannis Haralambous wrote of being told by a Monotype manager that the typeface was designed particularly for sale in Germany [...] "to appeal {{to those who have}} a weakness for Fraktur" [...] (blackletter or 'Gothic' typefaces, still very popular in Germany in the 1930s). In its dense design it may be able to compliment blackletter well, and Morison in his article on Leipzig printing suggested that this might have been a motivation behind the original's design style. Ehrhardt's technical production followed Monotype's standard method of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by Steltzer, who Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. A wax-copy was made from these drawing, the wax-copy was used to produce a lead plate with the design. These plates were then used as a plan for machining metal punches to stamp matrices in the Benton-pantographs. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{performed}} [...] "Ave Maria" [...] in Burswood Entertainment Complex, Perth, Western Australia, on September 25, 2009. Jay Hanna, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, described the performance as [...] "stunning". Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line described the same performance as [...] "operatic". Holly Byrnes of The Daily Telegraph while reviewing another stop during the concert tour of Knowles in Australia wrote that her {{performance of the}} ballad [...] "guaranteed to have raised the sails of the Sydney Opera House", while Patrick Emery of The Australian described her performance during another stop in the same country as [...] "soaring". A live performance of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is featured on Knowles 2010 live album, I Am... World Tour. Andy Gill of The Independent, while reviewing the DVD, gave a negative review {{for the performance of}} the song, writing that [...] "if her grotesque over-emoting on 'Ave Maria' is anything to go by, <b>legibility</b> could make things a lot worse." [...] On December 3, 2008, Knowles' performance of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] at the Rockefeller Center, in New York, was broadcast on NBC. A writer from People magazine described her performance as [...] "rousing". Knowles sang the song as a tribute to Michael Jackson at the 2008 Essence Music Festival. She later performed the song during the 2009 BET Awards, where she blended it with Sarah McLachlan's song [...] "Angel" [...] in honor to Michael Jackson, following his death. Knowles appeared in an angelic Balmain mini white dress, and according to a writer from The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, she performed a [...] "moving version" [...] of [...] "Ave Maria". A writer for the newspaper The Hindu commented that the performance of the song was [...] "simultaneously sexy and angelic".|$|E
