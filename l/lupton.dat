5|$|In December 2013, it was {{reported}} that Sir Christopher Bullock – a direct descendant of Shelburne's brother, Thomas Fitzmaurice (MP) – had married his wife, Lady Bullock, née Barbara May <b>Lupton,</b> at London's Unitarian Essex Church in 1917. Barbara <b>Lupton</b> was the second cousin of Olive Middleton, née <b>Lupton,</b> the great grandmother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. In 1914, Olive and Noel Middleton had married at Leeds' Mill Hill Chapel, which Priestly, as its minister, had once guided towards Unitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The Little Butte Creek {{area was}} {{originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribe of Native Americans. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the Eagle Point region in 1852. Little Butte Creek was named by the early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Big Butte Creek. Due to conflicts with the Rogue River Indians, Major J. A. <b>Lupton</b> gathered 35men from Jacksonville on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans {{near the mouth of}} Little Butte Creek, killing about 30 of them. <b>Lupton</b> was also killed, and eleven of his men were injured. On December 24 of the same year, Captain Miles Alcorn discovered and attacked a Native American camp on the north fork, killing eight. On Christmas the following day, another band of Native Americans were attacked near Little Butte Creek's mouth; some fled, while the rest were either captured or killed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the institute's {{effective}} disestablishment after 1866, {{a meeting}} {{was held on}} May 15, 1869, with nine original members of the Romney Literary Society: James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. <b>Lupton,</b> James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These nine men set about expanding the society's membership rolls and reviving its library. Over the next few years, 20 younger members {{were added to the}} society's rolls.|$|E
5|$|Hawke asked Sir Home Gordon, a cricket {{writer who}} had {{assisted}} Hawke with his autobiography, {{to sound out}} other counties {{to see if they}} would find Sutcliffe an acceptable captain if he played as an amateur—some players switched from amateur to professional, or vice versa, around this time. Sutcliffe was en route to South Africa with the MCC touring team, but was aware that Yorkshire were considering him as a replacement for <b>Lupton.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1506 the Inn {{was sold}} by the Gray family to Hugh Denys {{and a group of}} his feoffees {{including}} Roger <b>Lupton.</b> This was not a purchase on behalf of the society and after a five-year delay, it was transferred under the will of Denys in 1516 to the Carthusian House of Jesus of Bethlehem (Sheen Priory), which remained the Society's landlord until 1539, when the Second Act of Dissolution led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and passed ownership of the Inn to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his work with The Wiggles, John founded The John Field Band, an eight-piece covers band with John on lead vocals, Bernadette Cogin on lead vocals (later replaced by Bronwyn Mulcahy), Dom Lindsay on trumpet, former Cockroaches member Dan Fallon on tenor saxophone, Roy Ferin on trombone, Mark Rohanna on piano, Matt Morrison on drums, and Chris <b>Lupton</b> on bass guitar. John wrote the musicals Evie and The Birdman (July 2001) and Who Loves Me.|$|E
5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years of experience as a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. <b>Lupton</b> writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E
5|$|The Yorkshire {{captaincy}} {{affair of}} 1927 arose from a disagreement {{among members of}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club over {{the selection of a}} new captain to succeed the retired Major Arthur <b>Lupton.</b> The main issue was whether a professional cricketer should be appointed to the post. It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains should always be amateurs. At Yorkshire, a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s, on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities, although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers. None lasted long; after Lupton's departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long-term basis.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. <b>Lupton,</b> James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E
25|$|Olive Middleton's father, Francis Martineau <b>Lupton</b> (1848-1921), grew up {{initially}} on the family's Newton Park Estate {{and then}} their Beechwood Estate, in Roundhay. Two of Olive Middleton's uncles were Lord Mayors of Leeds – Sir Charles <b>Lupton,</b> (founder of the law firm DLA Piper) in 1915 and Hugh <b>Lupton</b> in 1926. In their official roles they played host to royalty. British Pathe discovered newsreel footage from 1915 of Francis Martineau and his three brothers inspecting troops near Leeds.|$|E

25|$|Charles II Hayne {{was only}} 22 when he {{inherited}} <b>Lupton</b> in 1769 and he built <b>Lupton</b> House which largely survives today. He did not marry but lived there alone for about twenty years. In 1788 he sold <b>Lupton</b> to Judge Francis Buller and made Fuge House his principal residence. He died in 1821, having bequeathed Fuge House to his great-nephew Charles I Seale-Hayne (d.1842) (on condition he should adopt the additional surname of Hayne), the second son of Sir John Henry Seale, 1st Baronet (1780–1844), of Mount Boone, Dartmouth, {{the son of}} his sister Sarah Hayne. The son of Charles I Seale-Hayne was Charles II Seale-Hayne (1833-1903), Member of Parliament for Ashburton in Devon (1885-1903) and Paymaster-General (1892-1895), who by his will founded Seale-Hayne College near Newton Abbot in Devon.|$|E

25|$|The manor of <b>Lupton</b> {{was listed}} as Lochetone in the Domesday Book of 1087 and formed one of the 107 Devonshire {{holdings}} of Juhel of Totnes, within his feudal barony of Totnes. Before the Norman Conquest of 1066 it was held by the Saxon Otre (Othere).|$|E
25|$|Worsley {{followed}} Major Arthur <b>Lupton</b> as captain, {{but only}} accepted the position after the Yorkshire committee had initially offered Herbert Sutcliffe the captaincy.

25|$|Middleton {{declined}} {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps of studying at New College, at Oxford University, the alma mater of many members of Capt. Middleton's family. Middleton had been up at Oxford in the 1930s with his cousin, Cecil Middleton, a champion golfer. Peter Middleton's great uncle, the Lord Mayor of Leeds Hugh <b>Lupton</b> (d.1947), and in-law, James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce, were also Oxford alumni.|$|E

25|$|From 1883 to 1959 inclusive, Yorkshire {{always had}} an amateur club captain. The extent of {{leadership}} given by these gentlemen {{has long been a}} subject of discussion. Hawke and Sellers are generally held to have been autocratic and decisive, but in fact both relied heavily on sound professional advice. At the other extreme, Wilfred Rhodes is supposed to have been the de facto captain from 1920 to 1930, but it was Major Arthur <b>Lupton</b> who restored discipline to the side when a row erupted between Yorkshire and Middlesex in 1924.|$|E
25|$|After leaving England in late 1946, Dr. McManus {{took up a}} {{position}} as Assistant Professor of Pathology first at the University of Alabama and then two years later in Virginia.

It was there in collaboration with Robert Mowry, Charles <b>Lupton</b> and Sidney Kent, that the department became one of the best known medical centers for research and education. In 1960 he teamed with Dr. Robert Mowry to write Staining Methods; a handbook integrating newer histological and histochemical methods of tissue examination into standard laboratory procedures.|$|E
25|$|In April 1980 Sutcliffe {{was arrested}} for drunk-driving. While {{awaiting}} trial, he killed two more women.

He attacked three other women who survived; Dr Uphadya Bandara in Leeds on 24 September, Maureen Lea, an art student attacked in the grounds of Leeds University on 25 October and 16-year-old Theresa Sykes, attacked in Huddersfield on the night of 5 November. On 25 November Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe, reported him to the police as a suspect but the information vanished into the paperwork already created.|$|E
25|$|At {{some time}} before 1792 it was sold by Charles II Hayne, who had only lived in his new house for about twenty years, to the judge Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet (1746-1800), of nearby Churston Court, which he let to a tenant. Judge Buller had another residence, on bleak Dartmoor, known as Prince Hall, {{where he was a}} pioneer of moorland reclamation. In about 1840 the house was remodelled in the neo-classical style by his grandson, Sir John Yarde-Buller, 3rd Baronet (1799–1871; created Baron Churston of Churston Ferrers and <b>Lupton</b> in 1858), to the designs of George Wightwick. In 1862 further alterations, since demolished, were made to the designs of Anthony Salvin, who in 1826 had {{designed}} Mamhead House for the first baron's father-in-law, Sir Robert William Newman.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1905, signalled by {{the arrival}} whistle of a locomotive's engine, the Malacca branch of the F.M.S. Railway was {{declared}} open, Acting Resident Councillor Bland having arrived at 6.30 a.m. at Kubu Station where he met R. C. Fryer, Firmstone, <b>Lupton</b> and Darbishire (the constructing engineer), after which they proceeded to Tampin, arriving there at 7.40. With the extension of rail services to Malacca, it was now possible to leave there at 1 p.m. and arrive at Penang at 6.21 a.m. the following day, instead of taking {{two or three days}} by steamer. The project had pushed ahead with speed. The first sod was cut on 9 June 1901 and plate laying commenced October 1904. Malacca's first engine was put together at the Malacca Yard, and steam was got up on 9 November 1904. The rails were joined to the trunk line on 15 May and the laying of 2.5 miles of railway track completed by 1 December.|$|E
