5|$|The Faculty of Medicine is {{affiliated}} with a network of ten teaching hospitals, providing medical treatment, research and advisory services to patients and clients from Canada and abroad. A core member of the network is University Health Network, itself a specialized federation of Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. Physicians in the medical institutes have cross-appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in university departments. The Rotman School of Management developed the discipline and methodology of integrative thinking, upon which the school bases its curriculum. Founded in 1887, the Faculty of Law's emphasis on formal teachings of liberal arts and <b>legal</b> <b>theory</b> was then considered unconventional, but gradually helped shift the country's legal education system away from the apprenticeship model that prevailed until the mid-20th century. The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is the teachers college of the university, {{affiliated with}} its two laboratory schools, the Institute of Child Study and the University of Toronto Schools. Autonomous institutes at the university include the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies and the Fields Institute.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the study of how {{individuals}} and businesses develop and construct legal agreements through electronic means. E-contract works faster in order to promote certain outcomes, but can also contain a level of legal and moral hiatus stemming from the nature of the contract and the distance of the parties. This paper describes the history of <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> apply to the formation phase of e-contract, and not contract per se. It begins with e-contracting and follows with <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> that recognize <b>legal</b> enforce ability.

25|$|Feminist <b>legal</b> <b>theory</b> {{is based}} on the feminist view that law's {{treatment}} of women in relation to men has not been equal or fair. The goals of feminist <b>legal</b> <b>theory,</b> as defined by leading theorist Claire Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be committed to. This is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to concrete areas of law.|$|E

25|$|The {{sociology}} {{of law is}} often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages {{with some of the}} debates within jurisprudence and <b>legal</b> <b>theory.</b> Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike <b>legal</b> <b>theory,</b> is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by Louis Brandeis and Roscoe Pound. It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist Eugen Ehrlich and the Russian-French sociologist Georges Gurvitch.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we will {{spend some time}} {{sketching}} out the <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> that form the foundational grammar and vocabulary {{of the law that}} are explored in this book. We confine ourselves to those theories that are so long-standing that they are {{part and parcel of the}} law itself and those theories which triggered fundamental rethinks about law and the way it is understood. In a sense, these theories sit in the background, against which other <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> are constructed and framed. But before we start looking at them, we would like you to look at something that has nothing to do with law at all. We want you to look at a series of photographs of a gate...|$|R

The Center arranges fora for scholars, members of academe, and political and business leaders. Its lectures and fora focus on rule of law issues involving ethics and the legal profession, economic development and constitutional principles, judicial history, and <b>legal</b> <b>theory.</b> It also holds the collection of legal and private papers of Chief Justice Teehankee.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to identify}} the <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> developed and employed by the jurists of the Shāfi‘ī school of law {{for the purpose of}} issuing fatāwā. It intends to shed light on how these jurists understand the term iftā’, and what are the elements in their view that constitute the legal framework that they utilize for iftā’. This research also attempts to determine the differences between iftā’ and the general process of formulating legal rulings by way of ijtihād, and the factors of consideration that may result in the existence of such a differentiation. This research argues that the existing legal discourse within the Shāfi‘ī madhhab has not rendered due attention to the significance of iftā’, and thus there exist a dearth of literature within the madhhab on the <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> of iftā’. This research also analyzes examples of fatāwā issued by the Singapore Fatwa Committee with the aim to comprehend how the <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> of iftā’, lacking they may be within the legal deliberations of the Shāfi‘ī madhhab, have an influence on the iftā’ institution {{of the state and the}} fatāwā it issued.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} connectionism (neural networks) in modelling legal reasoning. I discuss how the implementations of neural networks have failed to account for legal theoretical perspectives on adjudication.

The paper reviews a number of <b>legal</b> <b>theories</b> which provide a grounding for the use of neural networks in law. It then examines some implementations undertaken in law and criticises their legal theoretical naivete.
