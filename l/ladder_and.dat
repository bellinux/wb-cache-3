5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match featured Paul London and Brian Kendrick, William Regal and Dave Taylor, MNM (Joey Mercury, and Johnny Nitro), and The Hardys (Matt and Intercontinental Champion Jeff) in a four-team ladder {{match for}} the WWE Tag Team Championship. In this match, {{the only way to}} win and capture the titles was by climbing a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> releasing the championship belts that were suspended above the ring. Towards the end of the match, while MNM and The Hardys were out of the ring, Regal and Taylor attempted to climb the ladder, but Kendrick managed to knock the pair off. Kendrick fought off Regal and Taylor as London climbed the <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> captured the titles to win the match for his team and retain the championships. During the match, Mercury suffered a legitimate nose injury after being hit by a ladder.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their <b>ladder,</b> <b>and</b> Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline angle, Rated-RKO {{attacked}} Ric Flair {{with steel}} chairs to enrage DX on November 27. At New Year's Revolution in January 2007, Rated-RKO faced DX in a title defense, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match. At Royal Rumble, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he lasted the longest in the match {{with a time of}} 44:02 and eliminated 5 men and made it to the final 4 in the match before getting eliminated by Shawn Michaels, With Triple H out of action, the team continued their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels. Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the tag team championship on January 29, 2007. Edge and Orton suffered a series of losses to Cena and Michaels in the following months, In April 2007, Edge competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. During the match, Matt Hardy threw him onto a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> encouraged Jeff Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high (6.1 m) <b>ladder,</b> <b>and</b> drove him through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge & himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers. After this Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship. Neither Edge nor Orton won the championship, and they lost their claims as number one contenders after a failed match with Cena at Backlash in April.|$|E
5|$|For the 1888 season, Wilson {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Launceston Grammar School {{football}} team. He also became a leading player for the Launceston Football Club. Wilson kicked two of his team's three goals in a school match against Horton College, and was named in Launceston's best players in several games, including matches against South Launceston and City that counted towards the premiership. In a match that was to decide the premiership, against South Launceston, Wilson put in a creditable performance. The game ended in a draw, which left the teams even on the <b>ladder,</b> <b>and</b> a subsequent game was scheduled for two weeks later. In that match, Wilson kicked one of Launceston's five goals as they ran out two-goal victors to win their first Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA) premiership. He was named in Launceston's best players for the match by the Launceston Examiner. For the following cricket season, Wilson moved to play with St. Leonards.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the <b>ladder,</b> <b>and</b> used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

Meyer died on June 25, 2000 {{after she}} {{fell off a}} <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> was {{electrocuted}} after touching a 7,200-volt wire while working at Golden Era Productions. Golden Era Productions was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for improper wiring precautions near a vault where Grove Meyer had been working. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the incident, and determined that her death {{was not related to}} the safety violations at the facility. Grove Meyer had worked for two years at Golden Era Productions in landscaping and maintenance.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E

Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The angle between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio continued. On {{an episode}} of SmackDown!, Guerrero {{threatened}} to reveal a secret concerning Mysterio's son Dominick. This led the families of both Guerrero and Mysterio pleading with Guerrero not to reveal the secret. At the Great American Bash, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a match where if Guerrero lost, he could not reveal the secret. On the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero, however, revealed the secret, claiming he was Dominick's scripted biological father. The storyline also went on that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick to be raised by Mysterio's family. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. This led to a Ladder match, a match where the objective was to climb a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> reach an object hanging above the ring, between the two for the custody of Dominick at SummerSlam, which Mysterio won.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship between Christian and Chris Jericho in a Ladder match. The two superstars brawled early into the match, but they then {{retrieved}} ladders and used them to their advantage. Christian was then able to gain control over the match after he performed a running enziguri onto Jericho. The two superstars then continued in a back and forth match, until Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Christian, {{on the top of}} the ladder, which caused Christian to fall down. Jericho failed to retrieve the title on the first attempt, but was able to set up another <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> successfully retrieved the title on the second attempt, thus Jericho winning the match and the WWE Intercontinental Championship for a record sixth reign at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a <b>ladder</b> <b>and</b> then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E
