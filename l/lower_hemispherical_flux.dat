They are generally modelled or characterized under normal incidence. In this work, a monolayer 3 D ray tracing program {{taking into account the}} polarisation of light have been developed, validated and used to compute the directional-hemispherical reflectance versus the azimuth and incidence angles for both regular upright pyramids and inverted ones, with (111) facets. Results are given for a wavelength of 0. 7 µm. They show that this reflectance is not minimal at normal incidence but for an incidence angle near 20 • and that upright pyramids can have a <b>lower</b> <b>hemispherical</b> reflectance than inverted ones for incidence angles in the middle range. The bihemispherical reflectance is 19. 6 % for regular upright pyramids and 20. 7 % for inverted ones. The effect of the pyramids aspect ratio on the hemispherical reflectance at normal incidence is also studied. This reflectance decreases with the aspect ratio of both textures. Above an aspect ratio of 0. 51, inverted pyramids have a <b>lower</b> <b>hemispherical</b> reflectance. But their bihemispherical reflectance is lower only for aspect ratios below 0. 23...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} three XV- 15 {{acoustic}} flight tests have been conducted over a five year period by a NASA/Army/Bell Helicopter team to evaluate the noise reduction potential for tiltrotor aircraft during terminal area operations. <b>Lower</b> <b>hemispherical</b> noise characteristics {{for a wide range}} of steady-state terminal area type operating conditions were measured during the phase 1 test and indicated that the takeoff and level flight conditions were not significant contributors to the total noise of tiltrotor operations.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has {{established}} the Constellation Program. The Constellation Program has defined {{one of its}} many goals as long-term lunar habitation. Critical {{to the design of}} a lunar habitat is an understanding of the lunar surface environment; of specific importance is the primary meteoroid and subsequent ejecta environment. The document, NASA SP- 8013 'Meteoroid Environment Model Near Earth to Lunar Surface', was developed for the Apollo program in 1969 and contains the latest definition of the lunar ejecta environment. There is concern that NASA SP- 8013 may over-estimate the lunar ejecta environment. NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) has initiated several tasks to improve the accuracy of our understanding of the lunar surface ejecta environment. This paper reports the results of experiments on projectile impact into powdered pumice and unconsolidated JSC- 1 A Lunar Mare Regolith simulant targets. Projectiles were accelerated to velocities between 2. 45 and 5. 18 km/s at normal incidence using the Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR). The ejected particles were detected by thin aluminum foil targets strategically placed around the impact site and angular ejecta distributions were determined. Assumptions were made to support the analysis which include; assuming ejecta spherical symmetry resulting from normal impact and all ejecta particles were of mean target particle size.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a new {{technique}} for the measurement of the total <b>hemispherical</b> radiation <b>flux</b> and the convective flux was proposed. The proposed concept can be applied both to low and high heat flux levels, however it is particularly suitable for high temperature, harsh environments. The heat flux assessment {{is based on the}} temperature measurement in a porous disc crossed by a known cold gas stream. Different conceptions to determine the heat flux reaching the sensing element were proposed and discussed. The separation of the <b>hemispherical</b> incident radiation <b>flux</b> and total heat flux is achieved by the effect of the transpiration gas blown though the porous disc on the external boundary layer developing on the sensing element surface. Mathematical models representing the heat and mass transfer mechanisms in the instrument head were developed and solved. Design rules aiming the specification of the instrument characteristics {{in order to meet the}} required sensibility and accuracy were established with the help of the developed models. Several prototypes have been constructed based on the established rules. Three of those prototypes where chosen for experimental verification of the instrument performance acting as a radiometer, i. e., to measure radiation heat fluxes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to further investigate the hydrodynamics of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) paddle dissolution apparatus using a previously generated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The influence of paddle rotational speed on the hydrodynamics in the dissolution vessel was simulated. The maximum velocity magnitude for axial and tangential velocities at different locations in the vessel was found to increase linearly with the paddle rotational speed. Path-lines of fluid mixing, which were examined from a central region {{at the base of the}} vessel, did not reveal a region of poor mixing between the upper cylin-drical and <b>lower</b> <b>hemispherical</b> volumes, as previously speculated. Considerable differences in the resulting flow patterns were observed for paddle rotational speeds between 25 and 150 rpm. The approximate time required to achieve complete mixing varied between 2 to 5 seconds at 150 rpm and 40 to 60 seconds at 25 rpm, although complete mixing was achievable for each speed examined. An analysis of CFD-generated velocities above the top surface of a cylindrical compact positioned at the base of the vessel, below the center of the rotating paddle, revealed that the fluid in this region was undergoing solid body rotation. An examination of the velocity boundary layers adjacent to the curved surface of the compact revealed large peaks in the shear rates for a region within∼ 3 mm from the base of the compact, consistent with a ‘grooving’ effect, which had been previously seen on the surface of compacts following dissolution, associated with a higher dissolution rate in this region...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive surface-based retrievals {{of cloud}} optical and microphysical {{properties}} {{were made at}} Taihu, a highly polluted site in the central Yangtze Delta region, during a research campaign from May 2008 to December 2009. Cloud optical depth (COD), effective radius (Re), and liquid water path (LWP) were retrieved from measurements made with a suite of ground-based and spaceborne instruments, including an Analytical Spectral Devices spectroradiometer, a multi␣lter rotating shadowband radiometer, a multichannel microwave radiometer profiler, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua satellites. Retrievals from zenith radiance measurements capture better the temporal variation of cloud properties than do retrievals from <b>hemispherical</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Annual mean LWP, COD, and Re are 115. 8 ± 90. 8 g/m 2, 28. 5 ± 19. 2, and 6. 9 ± 4. 2 microns. Over 90 % of LWP values are less than 250 g/m 2. Most of the COD values (> 90 %) fall between 5 and 60, and ~ 80 % of Re values are less than 10 microns. Maximum (minimum) values of LWP and Re occur in summer (winter); COD is highest in winter and spring. Raining and nonraining clouds have signi␣cant differences in LWP, COD, and Re. Rainfall frequency is best correlated with LWP, followed by COD and Re. Cloud properties retrieved from multiple ground-based instruments are also compared with those from satellite retrievals. On average, relative to surface retrievals, mean differences of satellite retrievals in cloud LWP, COD, and Re were - 33. 6 g/m 2 (- 26. 4 %), - 5. 8 (- 31. 4 %), and 2. 9 ␣m (29. 3 %) for 11 MODIS-Terra overpasses and - 43. 3 g/m 2 (- 22. 3 %), - 3. 0 (- 10. 0 %), and - 1. 3 ␣m (- 12. 0 %) for 8 MODIS-Aqua overpasses, respectively.

40|$|Geological {{fieldwork}} on the {{sea floor}} is still impaired by our inability to resolve features on a sub-meter scale resolution in a quantifiable reference frame and over an area large enough to reveal the context of local observations. In order to overcome these issues, we have developed an integrated workflow of visual mapping techniques leading to georeferenced data sets which we examine using state-of-the-art visualization technology to recreate an effective working style of field geology. We demonstrate a microbathymetrical workflow, {{which is based on}} photogrammetric reconstruction of ROV imagery referenced to the acoustic vehicle track. The advantage over established acoustical systems lies in the true three-dimensionality of the data as opposed to the perspective projection from above produced by downward looking mapping methods. A full color texture mosaic derived from the imagery allows studies at resolutions beyond the resolved geometry (usually one order of magnitude below the image resolution) while color gives additional clues, which can only be partly resolved in acoustic backscatter. The creation of a three-dimensional model changes the working style from the temporal domain of a video recording back to the spatial domain of a map. We examine these datasets using a custom developed immersive virtual visualization environment. The ARENA (Artificial Research Environment for Networked Analysis) features a (<b>lower)</b> <b>hemispherical</b> screen at a diameter of six meters, accommodating up to four scientists at once thus providing the ability to browse data interactively among a group of researchers.

50|$|Michelangelo {{inherited}} {{the project to}} design the dome of St. Peter's basilica in 1546. It had previously been {{in the hands of}} Bramante (with Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giovanni Giocondo) until 1514, Raphael Sanzio (assisted by Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giovanni Giocondo) until 1520, and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (with Baldassare Peruzzi), whose work was disrupted by the sack of Rome in 1527. The design had been altered by Giuliano da Sangallo from being hemispherical to being 9 meters taller, segmental, and ribbed, and he had strengthened the piers and completed building the pendentives. Michelangelo redesigned the dome to have two shells, a mostly brick internal structure, and three iron chains to resist outward pressure. His dome was a <b>lower,</b> <b>hemispherical</b> design. He further strengthened the piers by eliminating niches in them and the internal spiral staircase. He obtained a decree from Pope Julius III that threatened an interdiction against anyone who altered his design, completed construction of the base for the drum by May 1558, and spent November 1558 to December 1561 creating a detailed wooden model. Construction of the drum was completed a few months after he died in 1564. Sixteen pairs of columns project out between sixteen windows in the drum to act as buttresses, and are aligned with the sixteen ribs of the dome and the paired columns of the lantern. An artist and sculptor, rather than an engineer, Michelangelo's did not create full engineering plans for the dome and his model lacked construction details. The dome was later built by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana.|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of aerosol radiative effect on broadband <b>hemispherical</b> solar <b>flux</b> is often performed using simplified spectral and directional scattering characteristics of atmospheric aerosol and underlying surface reflectance. In {{this study we}} present a rigorous yet fast computational tool that accurately accounts for detailed variability of both spectral and angular scattering properties of aerosol and surface reflectance in calculation of direct aerosol radiative effect. The tool is developed {{as part of the}} GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) project. We use the tool to evaluate instantaneous and daily average radiative efficiencies (radiative effect per unit aerosol optical thickness) of several key atmospheric aerosol models over different surface types. We then examine the differences due to neglect of surface reflectance anisotropy, nonsphericity of aerosol particle shape and accounting only for aerosol angular scattering asymmetry instead of using full phase function. For example, it is shown that neglecting aerosol particle nonsphericity causes mainly overestimation of the aerosol cooling effect and that magnitude of this overestimate changes significantly as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA) if the asymmetry parameter is used instead of detailed phase function. It was also found that the nonspherical–spherical differences in the calculated aerosol radiative effect are not modified significantly if detailed BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is used instead of Lambertian approximation of surface reflectance. Additionally, calculations show that usage of only angular scattering asymmetry, even for the case of spherical aerosols, modifies the dependence of instantaneous aerosol radiative effect on SZA. This effect can be canceled for daily average values, but only if sun reaches the zenith; otherwise a systematic bias remains. Since the daily average radiative effect is obtained by integration over a range of SZAs, the errors vary with latitude and season. In summary, the present analysis showed that use of simplified assumptions causes systematic biases, rather than random uncertainties, in calculation of both instantaneous and daily average aerosol radiative effect. Finally, we illustrate application of the rigorous aerosol radiative effect calculations performed as part of GRASP aerosol retrieval from real POLDER/PARASOL satellite observations...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the macroscopic thermal behaviour of 2 m diameter Jet A fires in crosswinds of 3 m/s to 13 m/s. Two scenarios were considered: with and without a 2. 7 m diameter, 10. 8 m long, blocking object situated 3. 4 m downwind of the fire. These scenarios simulated transportation accidents with the fire representing a burning pool of aviation fuel and the object simulating an aircraft fuselage. To date, {{the limited number of}} experiments that have been conducted to examine wind effects on fire behaviour have been performed at small scale, which does not fully simulate the physics of large fires, or in outdoor facilities, with poorly controlled wind conditions. This thesis presents the first systematic characterization of the thermal environment in a large, turbulent fire under controlled wind conditions, with and without a large downwind blocking object. In experiments without the object, flame geometry was measured using temperature contour plots and video images, and the results compared to values predicted using published correlations. Results were greatly affected by the method used to measure flame geometry and by differences in boundary conditions between experiments. Although the presence of the blocking object prevented direct measurement of flame geometry due to interaction between the fire plume and object, temperature and heat flux measurements were analyzed to describe overall effects of the object on fire plume development. The fire impinged on the blocking object at wind speeds below 7 m/s and interacted with the low-pressure wake region behind the object. Laboratory-scale experiments were also conducted to examine the responses of different heat flux gauges to controlled heating conditions simulating those found in wind-blown fires. Schmidt-Boelter, Gardon and <b>Hemispherical</b> Heat <b>Flux</b> gauges and a Directional Flame Thermometer were exposed to a convective flow and to radiation from a cone calorimeter heater. Measurements were influenced by differences between the calibration and measurement environments, differences in sensor surface temperature, and unaccounted thermal losses from the sensor plate.
