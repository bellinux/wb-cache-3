5|$|Hydrogen is {{commonly}} used in power stations as a coolant in generators due {{to a number of}} favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include low density, <b>low</b> <b>viscosity,</b> and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very <b>low</b> <b>viscosity.</b> Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
30|$|Different surfactants, {{including}} CTAB (cationic), PSSS, SDS (anionic) and HTPC (zwitterionic), at a {{molar ratio}} of 1 : 1 : 1 of CTAB:HTPC:PSSS, {{were used as}} DRAs. Nonisothermal rheometric studies were conducted in aqueous solutions with 40, 50 and 70  ppm DRAs. The viscometric analysis revealed that the <b>lowest</b> <b>viscosity</b> for crude A was with 70  ppm PSSS, while the <b>lowest</b> <b>viscosity</b> value for crude B was with 70  ppm CHP.|$|R

25|$|The {{viscosity}} of lava {{is important}} because it determines how the lava will behave. Lavas with high viscosity are rhyolite, dacite, andesite and trachyte, with cooled basaltic lava also quite viscous; those with <b>low</b> <b>viscosities</b> are freshly erupted basalt, carbonatite and occasionally andesite.|$|R
5|$|Volcanic ash {{particles}} erupted during magmatic eruptions {{are made}} up of various fractions of vitric (glassy, non-crystalline), crystalline or lithic (non-magmatic) particles. Ash produced during <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> magmatic eruptions (e.g., Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process. For example, ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of sideromelane (light brown basaltic glass) pyroclasts which contain rare microlites (small quench crystals) and phenocrysts. Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt (e.g., Strombolian) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular sideromelane droplets to blocky tachylite (black to dark brown microcrystalline pyroclasts). In contrast, most high-silica ash (e.g. rhyolite) consists of pulverised products of pumice (vitric shards), individual phenocrysts (crystal fraction) and some lithic fragments (xenoliths).|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{is widely}} used in centrifugation in a technique known as isopycnic centrifugation. Centripetal and diffusive forces establish a density gradient that allow separation of mixtures {{on the basis of}} their molecular density. This technique allows separation of DNA of different densities (e.g. DNA fragments with differing A-T or G-C content). This application requires a solution with high density and yet relatively <b>low</b> <b>viscosity,</b> and CsCl suits it because of its high solubility in water, high density owing to the large mass of Cs, as well as <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> and high stability of CsCl solutions.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, more mafic magmas, such {{as those}} that form basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, {{such as those}} that form rhyolite. <b>Low</b> <b>viscosity</b> leads to gentler, less {{explosive}} eruptions.|$|E

40|$|Viscosity is a liquid's {{resistance}} against flow. Using a discrimination experiment, the human ability {{to distinguish between}} different viscosities was measured over the range of 200 - 20, 000 mPa. s. Eight blindfolded subjects stirred pairs of different silicone oils using a wooden spatula and had to indicate the "thicker" of the two. The viscosity of the liquids was measured seperately using a rheometer. Weber fractions for discrimination ranged from 0. 3 at high viscosities to almost 1 at the <b>lowest</b> <b>viscosity.</b> For the higher viscosities, discrimination {{could be described as}} Weber-like, but for the <b>low</b> <b>viscosities,</b> {{there seemed to be a}} floor effect for the absolute threshold. The characterisation of the discrimination threshold as a function of viscosity is of fundamental interest in perception research, but also of practical value for designers of haptic devices capable of displaying viscosity...|$|R

25|$|The {{osmolality}} of {{the contrast}} agent was previously {{believed to be}} an important factor in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today it has become increasingly clear that other physicochemical properties play a greater role, such as viscosity. Attention should be paid to using contrast agents of <b>low</b> <b>viscosity.</b> Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are non-ionic, the older ionic types caused more adverse effects, and their use has diminished.|$|E
25|$|Droplets {{are about}} 2.5mm in diameter. The {{internal}} structure is complex, {{consisting of a}} mass of curled or folded fibre embedded in a viscid matrix which is in turn surrounded by a less viscous layer. This results in the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> liquid flowing past the moth's scales to reach the cuticle below, while the more viscous liquid forms a bond to the thread to sustain the moth's weight. The folded thread inside the ball permits elastic elongations which extend the spider's striking range.|$|E
25|$|Helium is an {{inert gas}} {{which is used}} in {{breathing}} mixtures for diving to reduce or eliminate the narcotic effects of other gases at depth. It is a relatively expensive gas and has some undesirable side effects, {{and as a result}} is used where it significantly improves safety. Another desirable feature of helium is low density and <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> compared to nitrogen. These properties reduce work of breathing, which can become a limiting factor to the diver at extreme depths.|$|E

25|$|Ethylene glycol has {{desirable}} thermal properties, {{including a}} high boiling point, low freezing point, stability {{over a wide}} range of temperatures, and high specific heat and thermal conductivity. It also has a <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> and, therefore, reduced pumping requirements. Although EGW has more desirable physical properties than PGW, the latter coolant is used in applications where toxicity might be a concern. PGW is generally recognized as safe for use in food or food processing applications, and can also be used in enclosed spaces.|$|E
25|$|While small {{generators}} may be cooled by air {{drawn through}} filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. Hydrogen gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used {{because it has}} the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly flammable hydrogen does not mix with oxygen in the air.|$|E
25|$|Fluoride {{glass is}} {{a class of}} non-oxide optical quality glasses {{composed}} of fluorides of various metals. Because of their <b>low</b> <b>viscosity,</b> {{it is very difficult}} to completely avoid crystallization while processing it through the glass transition (or drawing the fiber from the melt). Thus, although heavy metal fluoride glasses (HMFG) exhibit very low optical attenuation, they are not only difficult to manufacture, but are quite fragile, and have poor resistance to moisture and other environmental attacks. Their best attribute is that they lack the absorption band associated with the hydroxyl (OH) group (3,200–3,600cm−1; i.e., 2,777–3,125nm or 2.78–3.13 μm), which is present in nearly all oxide-based glasses.|$|E

25|$|A VEI 3 {{eruption}} occurred from 17 January 1991 to 11 March 1991, producing 0.15km3 of lava and 2×107m3 of tephra. The eruption, {{which was}} preceded by sulphurous smells and earthquakes, started as a Plinian eruption, producing an ash cloud reaching an altitude of 11.5km within 10minutes which had travelled over 200km north-northeast to the coast within 3hours. The eruption then began producing andesitic lava, the flows eventually covering an area of 23km2 to an average depth of 6–7m. Initially, part of the Heklugja fissure and other fissures erupted with lava fountains reaching 300m in height. By the second day, the activity stopped {{in all but one}} fissure where the main crater formed. During these 2days, 800m3·s−1 of lava were produced, slowing to between 1m3s−1 and 14m3·s−1 for most of the eruption. This <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> lava had a SiO2 content of approximately 54%.|$|E
25|$|The {{inner core}} is solid, the outer core is liquid, and the mantle solid/plastic. This {{is because of}} the {{relative}} melting points of the different layers (nickel–iron core, silicate crust and mantle) and the increase in temperature and pressure as depth increases. At the surface both nickel–iron alloys and silicates are sufficiently cool to be solid. In the upper mantle, the silicates are generally solid (localised regions with small amounts of melt exist); however, as the upper mantle is both hot and under relatively little pressure, the rock in the upper mantle has a relatively <b>low</b> <b>viscosity.</b> In contrast, the lower mantle is under tremendous pressure and therefore has a higher viscosity than the upper mantle. The metallic nickel–iron outer core is liquid because of the high temperature, despite the high pressure. As the pressure increases, the nickel–iron inner core becomes solid because the melting point of iron increases dramatically at these high pressures.|$|E
25|$|Glass solders are {{available}} as frit powder with grain size below 60 micrometers. They can be mixed with water or alcohol {{to form a}} paste for easy application, or with dissolved nitrocellulose or other suitable binder for adhering to the surfaces until being melted. The eventual binder has to be burned off before melting proceeds, requiring careful firing regime. The solder glass can be also applied from molten state {{to the area of}} the future joint during manufacture of the part. Due to their <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> in molten state, lead glasses with high PbO content (often 70–85%) are frequently used. The most common compositions are based on lead borates (leaded borate glass or borosilicate glass). Smaller amount of zinc oxide or aluminium oxide can be added for increasing chemical stability. Phosphate glasses can be also employed. Zinc oxide, bismuth trioxide, and copper(II) oxide can be added for influencing the thermal expansion; unlike the alkali oxides, these lower the softening point without increasing of thermal expansion.|$|E

The latter finding indicates that certain flagellated bacteria have the ability to swim through environments of relatively high viscosity. It is suggested that these flagellated bacteria possess a specialized type of motility apparatus suited to viscous conditions present in their habitats...|$|R
