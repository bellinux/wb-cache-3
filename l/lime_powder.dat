In recent days the demand for river sand is increasing due to its lesser availability. Hence the practice of partially replacing river sand with M-Sand and ordinary Portland cement with <b>lime</b> stone <b>powder</b> is taking a tremendous growth. It is also inferred from the literature that partially replacement of normal sand with M-Sand and ordinary Portland cement with <b>lime</b> stone <b>powder</b> produces no appreciable increase in compressive and tensile strength due to the variation in mix ratio.

50|$|The {{differences}} are {{largely in the}} techniques used to create these artworks and in their distinct iconography. The techniques adopted by the Mysore artists are slightly {{different from those of}} the Tanjore School. While Tanjore School used white <b>lime</b> <b>powder</b> and powdered tamarind seeds with gum arabic on cloth stretched on wooden panels, Mysore artists used white lead powder (Makhisafeda) or Makhi Gamboge (yellow) drawn from the juice of the indigenous tree (Revana Chinni halu) on paper. The paper sometimes was pasted to a wooden board, but mostly was framed as it was. As against the high relief of the Tanjore 'Gesso' work used prominently across large areas of the painting, the Mysore school preferred low relief, in selected areas such as jewellery, clothing, and borders. The Mysore school used pure gold leaf in lesser quantity as against gold-coated silver leaf handled across larger areas in the painting by Tanjore artists. The use of glass beads, precious and semi precious stones is also very rare in Mysore paintings. More elaborate and detailed interior and exterior landscapes are featured in Mysore paintings, whereas Tanjore paintings tend to be more iconic and static. In Mysore paintings, the jewellery, costumes, architectural features, furniture, etc. reflect the contemporary style prevalent in the Mysore Palace. The throne on which Gods and Goddesses are shown seated is usually a replica of the Mysore throne in many Mysore paintings.|$|E

Heizer displaced 6 tons of earth, making a one-foot-wide trench, 120 feet long, with the loop being 12 feet in diameter. This culminated in the production of Double Negative in 1969 and 1970, a project for which he displaced 240,000 tons of rock in the Nevada desert, cutting two enormous trenches—each one 50-feet-deep and 30-feet-wide and together spanning 1,500 feet—at the eastern edge of Mormon Mesa near Overton, Nevada.|$|E

Plasticity Index {{is one of the}} important properties of soil to determine the behavior of soil in presence of water. The poorest soil among all is Black Cotton Soil (BC Soil). In Rajkot area this BC Soil is spread over southern part of District. Rich proportion of montmorillonite is found in BC Soil from mineralogical analysis. High percentage of montomorillonite renders high degree of expansiveness. These property results cracks in soil without any warning. These cracks have sometimes extent severe limit like 1 / 2 “to 12 ” deep. Use of this type of land may suffer severe damage to the construction with the change in atmospheric conditions. In this paper, BC Soil was tested using three different stabilizing agents - 1. Cement waste dust collected from the cement plant 2.
