25|$|The {{varieties}} of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained. The grains of <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> (high in amylose) tend {{to remain intact}} after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre, in Spain. Some {{varieties of}} <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> that are high in amylopectin, known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed. A stickier medium-grain rice is used for sushi; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{collection}} of rice cultivars is at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, with over 100,000 rice accessions held in the International Rice Genebank. Rice cultivars are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai Jasmine rice is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> contains less amylopectin than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese mochi rice and Chinese sticky rice are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as [...] "glutinous rice" [...] (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to [...] "gluten") to make zongzi. The Japanese table rice is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese sake rice is another kind as well.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Rice kernel {{dimensions}} {{affect the}} performance of various post-harvest processes. This study assessed variability trends in kernel dimensional distributions of Bengal (medium-grain), Cypress, and Drew (<b>long-grains)</b> <b>rice</b> varieties. Rice was harvested at various stages of maturity from Stuttgart and Keiser, Arkansas during the autumns of 1998, 1999, and 2000. Brown rice kernel dimensions decreased with harvest moisture content [HMC (Moisture contents are expressed on a wet basis) ] below 24 % HMC. Kernel dimensional distributions were usually single-modal and near normal. Brown rice dimensional variability, expressed by kernel dimensional standard deviation (SD), was significantly affected by HMC and location. Kernel dimensional SD generally was linearly and directly related to HMC. Among kernel dimensions, thickness had the greatest shrinkage with decreasing HMC, followed by length and then width. Among varieties, Bengal had the greatest kernel shrinkage, followed by Drew, and then Cypress...|$|R

40|$|Germinated {{brown rice}} is {{commonly}} consumed in Asia for its enhanced nutritional properties such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and softer cooked texture. However germination decreases milling yield and alters some physicochemical properties, and most germinated rice studies evaluated medium-grain and aromatic rice cultivars. This study compared {{the effects of}} germination duration and parboiling on milling, physicochemical, and textural properties of a medium- (Jupiter) and a <b>long-grain</b> (Wells) <b>rice</b> cultivars. Rough rice was soaked in water at 25 °C for 12 hr, and then incubated at 30 - 34 °C for varying germination durations, or combined with parboiling at 120 °C for 20 min prior to drying.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Equilibrium {{simulation}} model {{was used for}} estimating the drying and rewetting of <b>long-grain</b> rough <b>rice</b> in shallow beds due to forced aeration. Limitations of the {{simulation model}} were examined for the relative influences of grain layer thickness, time step, and airflow rate on predicted moisture content profiles in grain beds. A value of grain dry matter-to-air ratio {{equal to or greater}} than 0. 27 based on 1 -h time step was determined to yield close agreement between experimental and simulated moisture content profiles. Under such conditions, the simulated moisture content profiles were insensitive to the changes either in layer thickness or time step for a fixed value of grain dry matter-to-air ratio based on 1 -h time step. Results showed that equilibrium model predicted rough rice drying and rewetting in shallow-beds reasonably well when the developed criterion for grain dry matter-to-air ratio was applied in the simulation scheme.

40|$|Graminaceous {{arabinoxylans}} are {{distinguished by}} decoration with feruloylated monosaccha-ridic and oligosaccharidic side-chains.

Here we report the development and application of a rapid and robust method enabling the quantitative comparison of feruloylated side-chain profiles in cell wall materials following mildly acidic hydrolysis, C 18 -SPE, reduction under aprotic conditions, and liquid chromatog-raphy with diode-array detection/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD/MS) separation and detection.

The emulsifying properties were dependent on the solubility and H- 0, while solubility was also related to the disulfide bond contents. Distinct differences in H- 0, thermal properties, and disulfide bond contents between REP and RDP could be due to the conformational changes, as the industrial processing steps in the production of rice syrups caused an increase in beta-turns at the expense of beta-sheets and random coils of REP, leading to the unfolding of beta-sheets into higher-ordered supramolecular structures for RDP, which could be responsible for its better functional properties.

40|$|Milling and {{polishing}} are important operations during {{the production of}} white rice. The degree of milling {{and polishing}} has {{a significant effect on}} the nutritional aspects of white rice, especially on minerals, due to a non-uniform distribution of nutrients in the kernel. Information on the distribution of nutrients in rice will greatly help in understanding the effect of milling and aid in designing procedures that improve technological and sensory properties of rice while retaining its essential nutrients as much as possible. In this study, three kernel shapes (short-, medium- and <b>long-grain)</b> of <b>rice</b> were selected for the study of milling characteristics and distribution of zinc (Zn) and phytic acid using abrasive milling and X-ray fluorescent microscope imaging approaches. Milling characteristics differed with kernel shapes and cultivars. Mass loss (y, %) correlated well with milling duration (x, s) and was fitted using a polynomial equation of y=ax 2 +bx+c (R 2 = 0. 99). Different kernel shapes of rice resulted in different patterns. Breakage in milling increased with longer duration of milling. The relation between breakage (y, %) and milling duration (x, s) fitted the exponential equation y=aebx. Levels of phytic acid, as well as Zn, decreased with prolonged milling. Phytic acid decreased at a higher rate than Zn. The analysis of different milling runs showed that the concentration of phytic acid decreased from the surface region inward, whereas X-ray fluorescent images indicated that the highest concentration of phosphorus was at the interface of the embryo and perisperm. Our results help in understanding the milling characteristics of different rice cultivars.

40|$|More than 2 {{billion people}} suffer from {{micronutrient}} malnutrition worldwide. Vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc deficiencies {{are among the}} leading public health concerns for developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and many parts of Asia. Strict vegetarian diets, lack of diversity in the diet, high rates of infection, and unfavorable socio-economic conditions are risk factors for these deficiency conditions. In India alone, approximately 75 % of {{children under the age}} of five suffer from iron deficiency, and 57 % of {{children under the age of}} six suffer from sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency. Micronutrient deficiencies bring adverse consequences to their victims and the economies of the countries in which they live. Fortification has proven to be an effective long-term nutrition intervention strategy, and rice has emerged as a staple food with much potential as a food fortification vehicle. Rice provides 50 % of calories for more than half of the world population. However, a lack of micronutrients in white rice has become a problem for countries with high consumption rates of rice. Low intakes of iron, vitamin A, and iodine are a major concern, while low zinc intake is also a problem. An experimental product, extruded rice kernels manufactured from rice flour fortified with vitamins and minerals, has been proposed as an effective vehicle for delivering a variety of micronutrients to low income populations. The aims of this study were 1) to select and adapt analytical methods and conduct analyses for vitamin A and vitamin C in the experimental product, as well as measure mineral retention, and 2) to conduct sensory studies to evaluate the acceptability of the experimental product by consumers and compare acceptability by South Asian consumers to that of non-South Asian consumers. Extruded rice samples fortified with vitamins A and C and iron and zinc were evaluated for their micronutrient retention following extrusion and cooking. The average vitamin A retention in the experimental product after extrusion was 48 % for dried kernels and 37 % for cooked rice. The average vitamin C retention in the experimental product after extrusion was 52 % for dried kernels and 48 % for cooked rice. Iron and zinc retentions both averaged 84 % for rice kernels after extrusion (cooked and non-cooked data combined). The vitamin retentions are consistent with studies on vitamin retention in extruded products. However, mineral retention is lower than expected. Larger sample sizes, consistency in analysis methods, and more research are needed to draw further conclusions. The experimental product was also evaluated for its consumer appeal using consumer acceptance tests. For the acceptability evaluation, two extruded samples of rice (fortified and unfortified extruded rice), and two commercial samples of enriched <b>rice</b> (<b>long-grain</b> white <b>rice)</b> were cooked in a rice cooker and presented to taste panelists. Acceptability of the product was based on a 9 -point hedonics test, a just-about-right (JAR) test, and a ranking test. Results suggested greater acceptability by the consumer panel for commercial rice samples. The most sizable difference was seen in the appearance attributes, followed by overall acceptance, and aroma. The addition of vitamins and minerals to extruded rice did not appear to have a large effect on sensory acceptability, with the exception of several appearance attributes. Group differences and group interactions were observed. The South Asian panelist group gave lower scores in several attributes, and the group was generally more critical of (gave lower ratings to) the unfortified extruded rice sample and the parboiled commercial sample than the non-South Asian group. Rice with extruded fortified kernels has potential to be an effective vehicle for fortification in developing countries; however, the challenges in micronutrient retention and acceptability need to be met for optimized utilization...|$|R
