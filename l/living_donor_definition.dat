The {{goal of the}} present study was to compare hepatic hypertrophy and the kinetic growth rate(KGR) in patients after the ALPPS (Associating Liver Partition with Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy) procedure, portal vein embolization (PVE) and <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation. MethodsVolumetry and KGR of the future liver remnant (FLR) were compared from (15) patients undergoing ALPPS, (53) patients undergoing PVE, (90) recipients of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver grafts and (93) <b>donors</b> of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver grafts. ResultsThe degree of hypertrophy was significantly greater after ALPPS (84. 3 ± 7. 8 %) than after PVE (36. 0 ± 27. 2 %) (P < 0. 001). The KGR was also significantly greater for ALPPS [32. 7 ± 13. 6 cubic centimetres (cc) /day] (10. 8 ± 4. 5 %/day) compared with PVE (4. 4 ± 3. 2 cc/day) (0. 98 ± 0. 75 %/day) (P < 0. 001). The FLR of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors had the greatest degree of hypertrophy (107. 5 ± 39. 2 %) and was greater than after ALPPS (P = 0. 02), PVE (P < 0. 001) and in living donor‐recipient grafts (P < 0. 001). KGR (cc/day) was greater in FLR of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors compared with both ALPPS (P < 0. 001) and PVE (P < 0. 001). The KGR in patients undergoing ALPPS and <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation had a linear relationship with the size of FLR. ConclusionFLR hypertrophy and KGR were greater after ALPPS than PVE. However, the degree of hypertrophy after ALPPS is not unprecedented, as KGR in the FLR from <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors is equal to or greater than after ALPPS.

40|$|Background. Cadaveric liver {{donors are}} scarce in Hong Kong, and the {{application}} of liver transplantation to high-urgency patients is limited. We evaluated the use of grafts from <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> in this setting. Methods. From July 1994 to January 1998, 49 consecutive adult patients who were intensive care unit-bound because of acute or chronic liver failure were put on a high- urgency list for liver transplantation. Family members were not solicited for living donation, and the initiation and decision for <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation (LDLT) was based on the donor's voluntary intent. Assessment of the <b>living</b> <b>donor,</b> including blood tests, computed tomographic volumetry, and angiography, was performed only after informed consent was executed. Results. In 25 of 49 (51 %) patients, no family member volunteered as living donor; 23 died awaiting donor organs, and 2 received a cadaveric graft. Twenty-four (49 %) patients had 36 family members who volunteered as <b>living</b> <b>donors.</b> Before evaluation of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> was completed, two patients received a cadaveric liver transplant. LDLT was not performed in nine patients because of recipient contraindications (n= 4), ABO blood group incompatibility (n= 3), and withdrawal of donor (n= 2). Eight of these nine patients died, and one received a cadaveric liver graft. The remaining 13 (27 %) patients received grafts from <b>living</b> <b>donors.</b> Four of 5 (80 %) patients who underwent cadaveric liver transplantation and 11 of 13 (85 %) who underwent LDLT survived. Thus, emergency transplantation from <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> increased the applicability of liver transplantation from 10 % to 37 %, and the survival rate after emergency LDLT (85 %) was superior to that of the remaining patients (11 %). Conclusions. When cadaveric organ donation is scarce, emergency liver transplantation from <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> can be applied to high-urgency adult patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Successful kidney {{transplantation}} is {{the best}} treatment for patients with end stage renal disease and graft survival {{is one of the}} most important measures of success in kidney transplantation. The majority of the patients with end stage renal disease is men while the majority of <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> is women. Gender related issues in the demographics of the <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> population and outcomes in the transplant recipients are elucidated in this thesis. When evaluating the gender distribution in <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> and graft survival in first time <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplant recipients, data was retrieved from the Norwegian Renal Registry during two different time periods. Gender demographics of <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> and outcomes were evaluated in 1319 first time transplantations performed in the period 1985 - 2002. Death censored graft survival and acute rejection episodes were investigated in 739 first time <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> transplantations in recipients 18 years of age or older performed between 1994 and 2004. Gender differences in cardiovascular events and total mortality in recipients of a kidney transplant was evaluated in the placebo arm of the ALERT (Assessment of LEscol in Renal Transplantation) study (n= 1052), The aim of this thesis was to increase our knowledge about gender related issues in kidney transplantation. The main results are that in Norway there is no predominance of female-to-male donations among first time <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantations. Donor age up to 65 years provided excellent long term results in <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> transplantation. Furthermore, female donor sex may convey superior long term graft survival compared to male donor sex.

A recent transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> to a kidney recipient revealed a possible limitation in existing screening protocols for HIV infection in <b>living</b> <b>donors.</b> We surveyed kidney and liver transplant centers (N = 18) in New York State to assess HIV screening protocols for <b>living</b> <b>donors.</b> Although most transplant centers evaluated HIV risk behaviors in <b>living</b> <b>donors,</b> evaluation practices varied widely, as did the extent of HIV testing and prevention counseling.

In addition, we compared the clinical outcome between ABOi-KT and ABO compatible KT (ABOc-KT) from spousal donor, and performed a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to define the risk factors affecting the allograft outcomes. The introduction of ABOi-KT increased overall <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> KT by 12. 2 % and its portion was increased from 0. 3 % to 21. 7 % during study period. The ABOi-KT in living unrelated KT was two times {{higher than that of}} <b>living</b> related <b>donor</b> KT (17. 8 vs. 9. 8 %).

In addition, increasing rate ABOi-KT from spousal donor was 10 times higher than that of <b>living</b> related <b>donor.</b> The clinical outcome (incidence of acute rejection, allograft function, and allograft and patient survival rates) of ABOi-KT from spousal donor was comparable to that of ABOc-KT.

A qualitative investigation into the experiences of Black American <b>living</b> kidney <b>donors</b> was conducted.
