50|$|Fox has small cameos {{in other}} games, notably Stunt Race FX, where a {{portrait}} of him {{can be found in}} track-side billboards. Additionally, in one of the tracks, an Arwing will occasionally fly overhead. In F-Zero X and GX, a character named James McCloud is a playable racer, bearing the name of Fox's father. He has a similar appearance to Fox, with his hair <b>looking</b> like <b>ears,</b> and wears sunglasses as well. As if an inside joke, one of the multiple endings in Star Fox Command, Fox and Falco join a G-Zero space racing team; a reference to the F-Zero series. Fox's uniform appears as a clothing option in the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for some characters.|$|R
50|$|German Shepherds are {{medium to}} large-sized dogs. The breed {{standard}} height at the withers is 60 - 65 cm {{for males and}} 55 - 60 cm for females. The weight standard is 30 - 40 kg for males and 22 - 32 kg for females. They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown with a lively, intelligent and self-assured <b>look.</b> The <b>ears</b> are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. They have a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.|$|R
50|$|The idea of masking {{is based}} on ancient {{fertility}} rites. Usually maskās tried to portray themselves as spirits, who wanted to either placate or impress. One {{of the best known}} ancient mummers masks was a bear mask, because it was believed a bear with his growl was able to frighten off all evil spirits. Buki's masks were made under the sheet by affixing a flexible card arcing downward, which was covered with a sheet and attached to it horns and a beard, as for cranes - they inverted the fur coat to the other side and in one sleeve put an ax with a head, with spoons tied to both sides, which <b>looked</b> like <b>ears</b> and a beak, which could be modified.|$|R
5000|$|Andrea Schiavone's Judgement of Midas in the British Royal Collection, is {{some twenty}} years earlier, from c. 1548-50, and is {{interestingly}} comparable to Titian, in atmosphere and {{some details of}} the composition. Titian [...] "must also have remembered elements of this painting: the pensive and abstracted attitudes of Apollo and Midas, and the radically free impressionistic brushwork used to heighten the dramatic mood of the story." [...] Apollo also plays a lira da bracchio, and Midas, as yet with normal <b>ears,</b> <b>looks</b> straight at Pan.|$|R

50|$|Set {{between the}} 1910s and 1940s, the film follows Shaggy (Diogo Morgado), a feared killer {{in the state}} of Pernambuco.

Now an adult, he finally goes to town to <b>look</b> for Seven <b>Ears</b> who has disappeared, but instead finds a place ruled by the tyrannical Monsieur Blanchard (Etienne Chicot), a Frenchman who runs the precious stones trade and previously employed Seven Ears as an assassin.|$|R
50|$|The first Wrath was {{a member}} of Batman's rogues gallery where he served as a sort of Anti-Batman. The Wrath's {{appearance}} and motivation are reminiscent of Batman's, but with notable differences. The Wrath (like Batman) is distinguished by perfectionism and obsession in what he does. His costume is also very similar to Batman's (though coloured in crimson and purple with a W-insignia on the chest and cowl; the W on his cowl, when seen in the right light and at the right angle, <b>looks</b> like the <b>ears</b> of the Batman's own cowl).|$|R
50|$|Eye-cup is {{the term}} {{describing}} a specific cup type in ancient Greek pottery, distinguished by pairs of eyes painted on the external surface. Classified as kylikes in terms of shape, they were especially widespread in Athens and Chalkis {{in the second half}} of the sixth century BC. The bowl of the eye-cup rests on a short squat foot; both sides are dominated by large painted pairs of eyes under arched eyebrows. The eyeballs are painted in silhouette style, later often filled with white paint or painted white on black. Some eyes are “female”, i.e. almond-shaped and without tear-ducts. Often, a stylized nose is placed centrally between the eyes. While used as a drinking vessel, due to the necessary inclination of the vessel, the cup with its painted eyes, the handles <b>looking</b> like <b>ears</b> and the base of the foot like a mouth, would have resembled a mask. Many of the vases also bear dionysiac imagery. The eyes are assumed to have served an apotropaic (evil-averting) function.|$|R
50|$|The North Country Cheviot has a striking, alert <b>look</b> with erect <b>ears.</b> The head is {{brilliant}} white and woolly.

The neck is short and strong. The legs are covered with short, white fiber. In general, the wool is fine, white and free from kemp. Wool grades from 50 to 56 count. Mature rams weigh above 225 lb and mature ewes weigh above 175 lb.|$|R
5000|$|French fur trappers, the {{earliest}} European explorers in the area, named it Lac Courte Oreilles after the Ottawa Anishinaabe peoples {{living in the}} area. The French believed they cut off the edges of their ear lobes, so referred to them as the Courte Oreilles, or [...] "Short Ears." [...] An alternative explanation is that some tribes in the region had a practice of distending their earlobes by earrings or other ornaments, and the local people's <b>ears</b> <b>looked</b> short in contrast. But the Indians of the Lac Courte Oreilles area did not practice that custom and had naturally shaped [...] "short" [...] ears.|$|R
