5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|The Budapest Gambit saw a {{short-lived}} revival in 1984–85 when Chess Informant included three games (as many {{as in the}} previous fifteen years), all played at a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition,</b> and all won by Black. But White players found reinforcements and even invented a line with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3. In the 21st century, despite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the Budapest Gambit almost never appears at the highest level. Its most recent appearance was when Richárd Rapport defeated Boris Gelfand with Black using the opening in round 2 of the 2014 Tata Steel Chess competition.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the Selle Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses {{registered with the}} stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français. Selle Français have proven successful at the international <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{mainstay}} of community ecology that local exclusion of species will result if competitive pressures become too large. The pattern of exclusion may be complicated, but the qualitative orthodoxy has changed little since the pioneering work of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause—no two species can occupy the same niche. Stated in a more precise form, the higher the intensity <b>of</b> interspecific <b>competition</b> in an assemblage of species, the fewer {{the number of species}} that can coexist in perpetuity. We suggest that this orthodoxy results from “linear” thinking, and that if the classical equations are formulated more realistically with attendant nonlinearities, the orthodoxy breaks down and higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> may actually increase the likelihood that species will avoid competitive exclusion. Furthermore, this increased probability of coexistence at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> is accompanied by characteristic dynamic patterns: (i) at lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition,</b> after all extinction events have occurred, remaining species follow irregular chaotic patterns; (ii) at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition,</b> when most species coexist, all species are entrained in a single large limit cycle; (iii) the transient behavior appears to correspond to a special case of chaos, uniform phase chaotic amplitude...|$|R

5|$|King won the Child's Bowling Cup, {{the premier}} award for bowling in American cricket, {{for the first}} time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was {{arranged}} mainly for educational purposes: few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. Heading into the draft, the Capitals had only five picks due {{to a variety of}} trades, which was tied for the fewest in {{franchise}} history. Believing that they had prospect depth in their organization and not seeing an available player who could help immediately, Washington traded their first round pick for Troy Brouwer. With just late round selections remaining, the Capitals decided to take players that required time to develop. Three of their four picks were in, or set to attend, college. Fourth-round pick Steffen Soberg, the lone player not attending college, played in the GET-ligaen, Norway's highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships, he posted the second-highest save percentage in the tournament and was considered one of Norway's top three players, though no Norwegian goaltender has ever played an NHL game.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition,</b> the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the discriminative power of the {{recently}} developed Interval Shuttle Run Test (ISRT) and the widely used Maximal Multistage 20 m Shuttle Run Test (MMSRT) for soccer players at different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> The main difference between the tests is that the exercise mode of the ISRT is not continuous but intermittent. Instead of 60 s of running per stage in the MMSRT, 30 s of running are alternated with 15 s of walking, twice per stage. METHODS: Comparative study: within a 2 -week period, 81 male soccer players at the Dutch premier league professional, premier league and 3 rd division amateur levels performed the ISRT and the MMSRT. The total number of runs was scored for both tests. RESULTS: Only the ISRT distinguished between <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> In general, the ISRT correlated moderately with the MMSRT for players <b>of</b> different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> (rP: 0. 52 - 0. 83). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the MMSRT, the ISRT shows discriminative power for soccer players at different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> supporting the validity of the ISRT for measuring endurance in a more soccer-specific way. As a result of the intermittent character of the ISRT the energetics of the ISRT and the MMSRT are not closely relate...|$|R
