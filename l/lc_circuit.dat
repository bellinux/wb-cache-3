5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an <b>LC</b> <b>circuit,</b> that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} to apply the concept to {{electric}} circuits was George Francis FitzGerald, who in 1892 tried to excite oscillations in an <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> by pumping it with a varying inductance provided by a dynamo.|$|E
25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant <b>LC</b> <b>circuit.</b> When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the <b>LC</b> <b>circuit.</b> This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E

50|$|Study of one-ports is an {{important}} part of the foundation of network synthesis, most especially in filter design. Two-element one-ports (that is RC, RL and <b>LC</b> <b>circuits)</b> are easier to synthesise than the general case. For a two-element one-port Foster's canonical form or Cauer's canonical form can be used. In particular, <b>LC</b> <b>circuits</b> are studied since these are lossless and are commonly used in filter design.|$|R
25|$|In a {{parallel}} <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> where the main loss is {{the resistance of}} the inductor, R, in series with the inductance, L, Q is as in the series circuit. This is a common circumstance for resonators, where limiting {{the resistance of the}} inductor to improve Q and narrow the bandwidth is the desired result.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an <b>LC</b> <b>circuit,</b> the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
25|$|The primary break rate of {{sparking}} Tesla coils is slow {{compared to}} the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> to the resonator where the voltage rings up over {{a short period of}} time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.|$|E

500|$|Tuning screws are screws {{inserted}} into resonant cavities {{which can be}} adjusted externally to the waveguide.

2500|$|Modern {{high-voltage}} enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils {{similar to}} some of Tesla's [...] "later" [...] 2-coil air-core designs.

In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving {{the bottom of a}} separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth (or [...] "ground"). The primary <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary <b>LC</b> <b>circuit.</b> The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field {{near the top of the}} secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.|$|E

2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant <b>LC</b> <b>circuit</b> to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E
