40|$|A seized <b>lube</b> <b>pump</b> of a {{helicopter}} was investigated. Examination revealed that the pump got seized due to seizure at the 2 nd stage rotor and centering plate interface. Evidences suggest that the seizure was caused due to adhesive wear resulting from the debris generated in-situ. It has been established that constant rubbing of the 2 nd stage rotor key with the centering plate {{was responsible for the}} generation of debris. Factors such as improper lubrication or entrapment of foreign particles as the causes of failure have been ruled out. Analysis showed that with the present design of the rotor keys, such seizure in the <b>lube</b> <b>pump</b> is unavoidable. It is recommended that the rotor keys be redesigned so that the contacts between the keys and the centering plate are avoided. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lube</b> <b>pump</b> gears of an Aircraft Mounted Accessory Gearbox (AMAGB) {{were found}} to have cracks on the face and gear root areas after {{completion}} of 290 h of flight trials and 1000 h of endurance test respectively. After a preliminary investigation, the subject gears were forwarded to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. The gears were provided in cut-pieces. Dye penetrant inspection (DPI) carried out showed presence of cracks in gears AGB 02 1008 and AGB 02 1009. The DPI signatures were very feeble indicating that the cracks were very tight. Subsequent examination of the gears in scanning electron microscope revealed presence of one crack in gear AGB 02 1008 and six cracks in gear AGB 02 1009. However, no cracks could be identified on the available portion of gear AGB 02 1013. A few representative cracks observed in gear AGB 02 1009 were pulled open for further study. All these cracks {{were found to}} be very shallow and they were found to be confined only to the carburized layer. Macroscopic examination of the crack surface gave no evidence of corrosion, fatigue marks or rapid ductile failure. Based on these, the crack generation either by fatigue mechanism or stress corrosion cracking (SCC) was ruled out. Electron fractographic study, however, showed typical brittle, intergranular mode of crack propagation, suggestive of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) failure. Investigation revealed that the gears were given phosphating treatment. In view of the hydrogen embrittlement as the cause of crack generation, the question arises whether or not the phosphating treatment had been performed as per standard practice. It is reported that the phosphating treatment involved electrolytic processes. Therefore, the possibility of hydrogen embrittlement is inherent in this case. In the event of not performing baking operation after phosphating treatment, failure by hydrogen embrittlement is inevitable. Metallurgical examination showed that neither the chemical composition of the steel nor the hardness profile of the gears conformed to the specification. The gear material was found to contain high amount of MnS inclusions. The effective case depth and the core hardness were found to be more than the specifications in all gears. In addition, the surface of the gears was found to have asperities resulting during the phosphating treatment. In summary, the gears in question have failed by HE. The steel picked up hydrogen during phosphating treatment. The susceptibility to HE was further increased due to high hardness in the material, stress concentrations in the hard carburized layer, and more importantly, presence of MnS in the microstructure. ...|$|E
40|$|The fleet is {{plagued with}} leaking <b>lube</b> oil <b>pumps</b> due to {{mechanical}} shaft seal failures. Correction programs {{have resulted in}} improved shaft sealing techniques however, there {{continues to be a}} leakage problem on most classes of ships. The ultimate solution is to eliminate the mechanical shaft seal. This has been proven to be a very successful solution and has additional benefits of eliminating the motor to pump coupling, which further reduces maintenance. The newly developed Canned <b>Lube</b> Oil <b>Pump</b> is the solution. It combines the proven screw pump design with the proven Oil-Through motor design. The resulting compact pumping unit is substantially smaller and lighter than the legacy unit. The motor is cooled by a portion of the oil, that is being pumped to the system. This eliminates the motor cooling fan and eliminates grease packed motor bearings, further reducing maintenance. A comprehensive factory and shipboard testing program has demonstrated that this new unit will eliminate oil leaking from <b>lube</b> oil <b>pumps,</b> thus will reduce shipboard maintenance substantially...|$|R

50|$|On 11 February, G-3 {{proceeded}} to New London, Connecticut, for initial shakedown operations. Aside from {{a brief period}} alongside submarine tender Tonopah (ex-Nevada) to repair damaged screws in March, she spent the next five months conducting trial runs, dive tests and training operations out of New London. Following another yard period at Bridgeport in mid-July to replace defective <b>lube</b> <b>pumps,</b> the boat moved to New York City on 30 August for final acceptance trials. Unfortunately, the breakdown of G-3s port engine disrupted her standardization trials in late September, prompting her move into the Navy Yard for repairs on 3 October. Difficulties in working in tight engine room spaces necessitated removing the port engine for repair and the boat remained immobile through the following spring. She finally put to sea on 1 June 1917 and returned to New London that same day.|$|R

5000|$|When [...] "fire in engineroom lower level" [...] was announced, due {{to water}} in the main <b>lube</b> oil <b>pump</b> motors, {{a man in the}} aft end of engineroom upper level opened the {{watertight}} door into the stern room, which swung into the stern room, to retrieve a fire extinguisher. Just then the up-angle increased dramatically and the bilge water began pouring in. The door was shut before the boat surfaced. With the boat on an even keel, the water came up to the deadlight in the door.|$|R
5000|$|Japanese bombers {{attacked}} Relief on 2 April. One bomb fell several yards wide of the ship, but {{the only}} damage was temporary loss of suction in a <b>lube</b> oil <b>pump.</b> A barrage of antiaircraft fire from destroyer [...] drove off the attackers. Relief anchored off the Okinawa invasion beach by day and stood out to sea each night, illuminated [...] "like a Christmas tree." [...] As massive suicide aerial raids became common at night, the retirement plan was abandoned 9 April and the hospital ships remained in the anchorage area, {{taking advantage of the}} cover of smoke screens and turning off their illumination.|$|R

When the planesmen put a slight up-angle on the boat to come shallow the water in the bilges instantly rushed aft, greatly increasing its effect on trim (this is known as [...] "free surface effect", later classes of subs have flood control bulkheads in engineroom lower level to prevent this) and causing an up-angle of about 45 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Operation {{begins when}} the controller/timer sends {{a signal to}} the <b>pump</b> {{starting}} the <b>lube</b> cycle. The <b>pump</b> begins pumping lubricant to build up pressure in the supply line connecting the pump to the injectors.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Fixtures are {{the special}} {{production}} tools which make the standard machine tools, more versatile {{to work as}} specialized machine tools. They are normally used in large scale production by when interchangeability is possible. Various areas related to design of fixture are already been very well described by various renowned authors, {{but there is a}} need of couple and apply all these research work to an individual application. This paper on “Design and manufacturing fixture of Flange <b>Lube</b> oil <b>pump</b> filter ” which integrates all these aspects and the evolutionary function approach of designed fixture is proved {{from the fact that the}} real industrial component is considered for fixture designing. In addition to this, fixture is made by wear in house material without consuming much cost for production. The fixture shows great time saving for the production...|$|R
50|$|Operation {{begins when}} the controller/timer sends {{a signal to}} the pump to start the <b>lube</b> event. The <b>pump</b> then feeds {{lubricant}} into the supply line which connects to the primary metering valve, for either a preprogrammed amount of time or number of times as monitored through a designated piston cycle switch. Lubricant is fed to the multiple lubrication points one after another via secondary progressive metering valves sized for each series of lubrication points, and then directly to each point via the feed lines.|$|R
40|$|Tube-tube heat {{exchanger}} (TTHE) {{is a low}} cost, vented double wall {{heat exchanger}} which increases reliability by avoiding mixing of fluids exchanging heat. It can be potentially used for heat recovery from engine cooling circuit, oil cooling, desuperheating in refrigeration and air conditioning, dairy, and pharmaceutical industry, chemical industry, refinery, etc. These tube-tube heat exchangers are successfully demonstrated for superheat recovery water heating applications, condenser and evaporator in heat <b>pumps,</b> <b>lube</b> oil cooler for shipboard gas turbines, milk chilling and pasteurizing application. This paper presents an experimental study on various layouts of TTHE for water-to-water heat transfer. The theoretical and experimental results on this type of heat exchanger configuration could not be located in literature. Overall heat transfer coefficient and pumping power were experimentally determined for a fixed tube length and surface area of serpentine layouts with different number of bends and results are compared with straight tube TTHE. In the case investigated, serpentine layout TTHE with seven bends has shown optimum performance, with {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} 17 % higher than straight tube TTHE. Two out of five serpentine layout TTHE have shown poor heat transfer performance than straight tube TTHE. The experimental results also indicate that there is a definite optimum for a number of bends in serpentine layout TTHE. An analytical model for prediction of thermo-hydraulic performance of straight layout has been developed and validated experimentally. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
50|$|On February 8, 1976, a Pacific American Airlines Douglas YC-112A (prototype of the DC-6 series), {{registration}} N901MA, {{experienced the}} separation of its no. 3 engine shortly after takeoff from Hollywood-Burbank Airport. The one of engine's propeller blades passed through the fuselage and severed pneumatic, hydraulic, and emergency airbrake lines {{as well as the}} electrical wiring for Curtiss electric propeller controls and some engine instruments. The blade continued out of the fuselage and struck the no. 2 engine, disabling its <b>lube</b> oil scavenge <b>pump</b> and causing it to begin filling with oil. After an abortive attempt to land at Burbank, which became a touch-and-go when the crew discovered that hydraulic brakes, thrust reverse, and emergency air brakes were all inoperative, the captain elected to attempt an emergency landing on the longer, uphill Runway 34L at Van Nuys. Because of severe damage resulting in loss of power from the No. 2 engine, a bare firewall where the No. 3 engine had separated, and drag from the drooping landing gear and flaps, the airplane was unable {{to make it to the}} runway and attempted to land on a golf course in the final approach corridor. The nose of the aircraft struck a 24 inch cm concrete foundation of a partially constructed building, separating the nose gear main trunnion and jamming the gear assembly up into the cockpit. The three flight crew members aboard the aircraft perished, although the two stewardesses and a baggage handler in the cabin survived.|$|R
