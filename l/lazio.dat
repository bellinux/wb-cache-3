5|$|Clinton now faced a lesser-known {{candidate}} in <b>Lazio.</b> While a relative moderate among House Republicans, <b>Lazio</b> had frequently supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a largely despised figure among many New Yorkers. <b>Lazio</b> did {{bring to the}} table an ethnic suburban background familiar to many New Yorkers, and had a reputation as an energetic campaigner.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2017, <b>Lazio</b> {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Nani on a season-long loan deal. He scored his first goal for <b>Lazio</b> on 29 October, the final goal of a 5–1 away victory over Benevento.|$|E

50|$|Despite his {{clearance}} hitting Rodrigo Taddei's {{head and}} ricocheting into <b>Lazio's</b> goal to concede their first {{goal of the}} match, his 92nd minute winning goal etched Behrami's name into <b>Lazio's</b> history books as they won the Derby della Capitale on 19 March 2008 and virtually finished the Scudetto hopes for rivals Roma.|$|R
5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick <b>Lazio</b> {{to replace}} him. The {{election}} included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, <b>Lazio,</b> and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by <b>Lazio</b> solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women. Clinton {{won the election}} in November 2000 with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{won their}} first three matches in Group B, against Sparta Prague, Shakhtar Donetsk and <b>Lazio.</b> The club secured {{qualification}} {{into the second}} group stage with a 1–1 draw away at <b>Lazio,</b> before a win against Sparta Prague and defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk to end the first group stage with 13 points.

5|$|<b>Lazio's</b> bid was {{handicapped}} by {{the weak}} performance of George W. Bush in New York in the 2000 election, {{but it was}} also clear Hillary Clinton had made substantial inroads in upstate New York prior to <b>Lazio's</b> entry into the race. Exit polls also showed a large gender gap with Clinton running stronger than expected among moderate women and unaffiliated women.|$|R
5|$|<b>Lazio</b> faced {{a unique}} {{tactical}} problem campaigning upstate. The major issue {{there was the}} persistently weak local economy, which <b>Lazio</b> hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks {{on the state of}} the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor George Pataki, however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.|$|E

Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent.

50|$|<b>Lazio's</b> {{traditional}} club {{badge and}} symbol is the eagle, which {{was chosen by}} founding member Luigi Bigiarelli. It is an acknowledgment to the emblem of Zeus (the god of sky and thunder in Greek mythology) {{commonly known as the}} Aquila; <b>Lazio's</b> use of the symbol has led to two of their nicknames; le Aquile ("the Eagles") and Aquilotti ("Eaglets").

5|$|Early in {{his career}} at Sparta, Nedvěd was sent off three times in just six matches. With Sparta, Nedvěd won one Czechoslovak First League title, two Gambrinus liga titles and a Czech Cup. In 1994, he {{received}} his first call up to the Czech Republic national team. His performance at UEFA Euro 1996, including a goal in the group stage against Italy, attracted attention; despite a verbal agreement with PSV, Nedvěd moved from Sparta Prague to Italian Serie A club <b>Lazio.</b> Sparta first sold Nedvěd to Slovak club 1. FC Košice (which had the same owner as Sparta) for a 1.5 million CZK transfer fee, and immediately, Košice sold Nedvěd to <b>Lazio.</b> Thus Sparta paid {{only a small fraction}} of the transfer fee to Plzeň.
