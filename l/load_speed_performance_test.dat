During the PTC 10 (1997) Type I testing, rotor instability was observed on the back-to-back (first and second stage) compressor casing. The third stage final compressor casing exhibited anomalous rotor centerline positions in the bearings and rotating stall. This paper discusses the technical analysis, resolution, and retesting to resolve the rotor instability, rotor equilibrium/synchronous response, and rotating stall issues experienced during the testing.

40|$|UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a production-level optical {{polishing}} process {{consisting of}} a moving belt that is pressed into an optical surface by a carrier wheel. The current configuration is comprised of a cylindrical carrier wheel attached to cylindrical roller bearings. As the optics market is moving towards aspheric geometry with smaller radii of curvature, geometric limitations associated with roller bearings requires {{the development of a}} modified approach to the UFF process. This thesis explores the feasibility of incorporating spherical fluid bearing elements in the UFF process as a replacement for roller bearings. Self-acting (or wedge film) and externally pressurized hydrostatic spherical fluid-film bearings were investigated for the UFF process. The self-acting bearing was modeled and analyzed using a previously developed hydrodynamic finite element computer program. The hydrostatic bearing was modeled using an analytical formulation of the Reynolds equation coupled with empirical data to account for entrance flow effects at the feed hole and to account for pressure drops in the bearing fluid supply system. Both bearing configurations predicted adequate fluid film thickness under steady <b>load</b> and <b>speed.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>tests</b> on the UFF were completed with both bearing configurations under steady <b>load</b> and <b>speed.</b> Ball to cup seizure was observed with the self-acting configuration nearly immediately after initial <b>load</b> and <b>speed</b> application, with seizure presumably due to inadequate squeeze film resistance during the transient startup period. The hydrostatic bearing operated successfully over a wide range of applied <b>loads</b> and <b>speeds</b> employed in the current UFF process with minimal cup and ball wear. The feasibility of the hydrostatic spherical bearing element in the UFF process was subsequently demonstrated through the generation of repeatable and acceptable removal function maps which were then employed in the polishing of a planar optical surface...|$|R

To build user confidence in using geospatial Web Services in the CGDI for their decision making, knowing the quality of these services is important. In this paper, the authors discuss {{the results of a}} GeoConnections-funded project in exploring the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and applying them to test services in the CGDI.

This is both because biological processes can be highly-dynamic, and to avoid unnecessary photobleaching and phototoxicity of living samples. This article shows that besides the hardware (microscope) components themselves, the acquisition control {{software is}} an important influencing factor of <b>speed</b> <b>performance.</b> We <b>tested</b> and compared the <b>speed</b> <b>performance</b> of five different generic applications (Image-Pro Plus, MetaMorph, Micro-Manager, SlideBook, and Volocity) using typical experimental setups involving a single specific state-of-the-art fluorescence microscope configuration. The test measurements included multichannel experiments, z-stacking, burst acquisition, as well as combinations of these measurements with time-lapse acquisitions. The measured data provided values for guiding the testing and analysis of other microscope systems with similar configurations. Despite the identical hardware settings, significant and surprisingly large speed differences were evident among the various software applications. Additionally, no application was identifiable as the fastest in all tests. Our work pinpoints the importance of the control software in determining a system`s ``real`` maximal imaging speed.

40|$|Dense stereo {{correspondence}} enabling {{reconstruction of}} depth {{information in a}} scene is of great importance {{in the field of}} computer vision. Recently, some local solutions based on matching cost filtering with an edge-preserving filter have been proved to be capable of achieving more accuracy than global approaches. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these algorithms is quadratically related to the window size used to aggregate the matching costs. The recent trend has been to pursue higher accuracy with greater efficiency in execution. Therefore, this paper proposes a new cost-aggregation module to compute the matching responses for all the image pixels at a set of sampling points generated by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The complexity of this implementation is linear both in the number of image pixels and the number of clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art local methods in terms of both accuracy and <b>speed.</b> Moreover, <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> indicate that parameters such as the height of the hierarchical binary tree and the spatial and range standard deviations have a significant influence on time consumption and the accuracy of disparity maps...|$|R

However, to this date there has been little research on the interplay between changes in these neuropsychological processes and walking gait overtime. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate intra-individual changes in neurocognitive <b>test</b> <b>performance</b> and gait step time at two-time points across a one-year span. Neuropsychological test scores from 440 elderly individuals deemed cognitively normal at Year One were analyzed via repeated measures t-tests to assess for decline in cognitive performance at Year Two. 34 of these 440 individuals neuropsychological <b>test</b> <b>performance</b> significantly declined at Year Two; whereas the "non-decliners" displayed improved memory, working memory, attention/processing <b>speed</b> <b>test</b> <b>performance.</b> Neuropsychological <b>test</b> scores were also submitted to factor analysis at both time points for data reduction purposes and to assess the factor stability overtime. Results at Year One yielded a three-factor solution: Language/Memory, Executive Attention/Processing Speed, and Working Memory. Year Two's test scores also generated a three-factor solution (Working Memory, Language/Executive Attention/Processing Speed, and Memory). Notably, language measures loaded on Executive Attention/Processing Speed rather than on the Memory factor at Year Two. Hierarchal multiple regression revealed that both Executive Attention/Processing Speed and sex significantly predicted variance in dual task step time at both time points. Remarkably, in the "decliners", the magnitude of the contribution of the neuropsychological characteristics to gait variance significantly increased at Year Two. In summary, this study provides longitudinal evidence of the dynamic relationship between intra-individual cognitive change and its influence on dual task gait step time. These results also indicate that the failure to show improved <b>test</b> <b>performance</b> (particularly, on memory tests) with repeated administrations might prove to be useful of indicator of early cognitive decline...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we provide an updated {{description}} of the Vertical Current Approximation Nonlinear Force-Free Field (VCA-NLFFF) code, {{which is designed to}} measure the evolution of the potential, nonpotential, free energies, and the dissipated magnetic energies during solar flares. This code provides a complementary and alternative method to existing traditional NLFFF codes. The chief advantages of the VCA-NLFFF code over traditional NLFFF codes are the circumvention of the unrealistic assumption of a force-free photosphere in the magnetic field extrapolation method, the capability to minimize the misalignment angles between observed coronal loops (or chromospheric fibril structures) and theoretical model field lines, as well as computational <b>speed.</b> In <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> of the VCA-NLFFF code, by comparing with the NLFFF code of Wiegelmann (2004), we find agreement in the potential, nonpotential, and free energy within a factor of about 1. 3, but the Wiegelmann code yields in the average a factor of 2 lower flare energies. The VCA-NLFFF code is found to detect decreases in flare energies in most X, M, and C-class flares. The successful detection of energy decreases during a variety of flares with the VCA-NLFFF code indicates that current-driven twisting and untwisting of the magnetic field is an adequate model to quantify the storage of magnetic energies in active regions and their dissipation during flares. - The VCA-NLFFF code is also publicly available in the Solar SoftWare (SSW).
