40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} copper in near-neutral aerated tap water was studied by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy {{up to four}} days of immersion under different hydrodynamic conditions. The impedance results were interpreted by equivalent circuit that showed an increasing film thickness with time that hinders the diffusion of copper species across the oxide layer, which is larger in stagnating condition. At low anodic overpotential, copper impedance presents at <b>least</b> <b>four</b> <b>time</b> constants that {{could be explained by}} faradaic processes, adsorption/desorption of intermediate species, diffusion controlled process and oxide layer formation on copper surface. In the anodic region, the overall corrosion resistance decreases possibly due to the dissolution of copper species and the increase of diffusion across the oxide layer, mainly under hydrodynamic condition...|$|R

5|$|Skin {{toxicity}} evolved alongside bright coloration, perhaps preceding it. Toxicity {{may have}} relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods, which likely occurred at <b>least</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> among the dendrobatids. Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet specialization, body mass, aerobic capacity, and chemical defense. Either aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering, {{making it easier for}} frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization, contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that toxicity from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet specialization preceded higher aerobic capacity, and aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation.|$|E

5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types.

Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at <b>least</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E

5|$|Football-themed {{stories were}} {{a staple of}} British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either {{competing}} for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed {{the structure of the}} actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at <b>least</b> <b>four</b> <b>times.</b> Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.|$|E
