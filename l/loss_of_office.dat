5|$|Gerard was {{appointed}} Lord Chancellor of England in 1085, and {{was present at}} William I's deathbed in 1087. He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092; what precipitated his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> is unclear. He retained the king's trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with William Warelwast on a diplomatic mission to Pope Urban II regarding Archbishop Anselm receiving the pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority. Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the Antipope Clement III in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose of as he saw fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by Whitsun with a papal legate, Walter the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.|$|E
5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 general election, the Social Democratic Party {{received}} the smallest share of votes (34.99%) ever {{in a general}} election with universal suffrage, resulting in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> to the opposition, the centre-right coalition Alliance for Sweden. Among the support that the Social Democratic Party lost in the 2006 election was the vote of pensioners (down 10% from the 2002 election), and blue-collar trade unionists (down 5%). The combined Social Democratic Party and Left Party vote of citizens with non-Nordic foreign backgrounds sank from 73% in 2002 to 48% in 2006. Stockholm County typically votes for the centre-right parties. Only 23% of Stockholm City residents voted for the Social Democratic Party in 2006.|$|E

500|$|The {{connection}} between Calvert's resignation and his conversion to Roman Catholicism was a complex one. George Cottington, {{a former employee}} of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert's conversion had been in progress {{a long time before}} it was made public. George Abbot (1562–1633), the reigning Archbishop of Canterbury (and ecclesiastical head of the independent Church of England), reported that political opposition to Calvert, combined with his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> had [...] "made him discontented and, as the saying is, [...] "Desperatio facit monachum", so hee apparently did turne papist, which hee now professeth, this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way [...] ". Godfrey Goodman, the Bishop of Gloucester, later claimed Calvert had been a secret Catholic all along ("infinitely addicted to the Catholic faith"), which explained his support for lenient policies towards Catholics and for the Spanish match.|$|E
2500|$|Asser {{represents}} Alfred as a Solomonic judge, painstaking {{in his own}} judicial {{investigations and}} critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate {{so that they could}} apply themselves [...] "to the pursuit of wisdom". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Charters {{required}} {{among many}} other things {{the use of the}} Salisbury ("Sarum") Rite, a daily sung Mass in honour of Our Lady, and also the singing of Matins, a High Mass and Vespers on more than two dozen high feasts, led by the Dean in Choir, so {{there would have been a}} heavy musical programme for the choir of around sixteen (including at least some of the Vicars) and its musical director. His initial salary was £10 a year (only £2 a year less than that of the Dean) and by 1540 this had increased to £12 a year. In addition Aston, also referred to in some documents as a singer and organist, was entitled to receive further significant payments for additional services such as funerals. In 1525 he had been recommended to Cardinal Wolsey as the founder director of music at his new Cardinal’s College, Oxford, (now Christ Church College and Cathedral) but Aston seems to have declined the offer and in any event Wolsey appointed John Taverner instead. [...] Aston continued at The Newarke until shortly before the final dissolution of the Foundation at Easter 1548, and on retirement he received a £12-a-year state pension in respect of his Newarke College office. By this time he must have been holding at least advisory positions at a number of other important Midlands choral institutions, since he also received further state pensions totalling £6 13s. 4d. in respect of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> at six other suppressed choral institutions: Sully and Pipewell in Northamptonshire, Coventry and Kenilworth in Warwickshire, and the Leicestershire abbeys of Launde and St Mary de Pratis (= Leicester Abbey).|$|E

500|$|In the end, {{both the}} Senate and the Chamber passed the electoral reform—which {{became known as}} Lei dos Círculos (Law of the Circles)—by a bare margin. The {{majority}} of the saquaremas voted against the bill. Paraná succeeded because, as founder {{and leader of the}} Conservative Party, he [...] "had enormous charisma and a broad personal clientele in the Chamber" [...] and [...] "could (and did) dispense power, prestige, and patronage." [...] Some saquaremas voted in favor of the reform out of fear, believing that, should the cabinet fall, the Emperor might turn to the Liberals to form a new cabinet, resulting in reprisals and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>offices</b> throughout the country. On the other hand, the Liberals supported the reform as a means to further weaken the divided Conservative Party.|$|R

To {{compensate}} for his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> and to secure his votes, the Earl of Carabas was promoted in the peerage, and {{was presented with}} some magnificent office, meaning nothing; swelling with dignity, and void of duties. As years rolled on, various changes {{took place in the}} administration, of which his Lordship was once a component part; and the ministry, to their surprise, getting popular, found that the command of the Carabas interest was not of such vital importance to them as heretofore, and so his Lordship was voted a bore, and got shelved. Not that his Lordship was bereaved of his splendid office, or that anything occurred, indeed, by which the uninitiated might have been led to suppose that the beams of his Lordship's consequence were shorn; but the Marquess's secret applications at the Treasury were no longer listened to, and pert under-secretaries settled their cravats, and whispered [...] "that the Carabas interest was gone by." ...|$|E

They are coming up immediately. Not a moment is to be lost, which seems to me very odd. Master Rodolph is arranging everything; and he has this morning purchased from his master's predecessor his palace, furniture, wines, and pictures; in short, his whole establishment: the late Grand Marshal consoling himself for his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> and revenging himself on his successor, by selling him his property at a hundred per cent. profit. However, Master Rodolph seems quite contented with his bargain; and your luggage is come, sir.

60|$|From {{the general}} and {{systematic}} measures of reform I {{now turn to}} consider the individual contributions to this memorable bonfire. In many instances these were of a very amusing character. One poor fellow threw in his empty purse, and another a bundle of counterfeit or insolvable bank-notes. Fashionable ladies threw in their last season's bonnets, together with heaps of ribbons, yellow lace, and much other half-worn milliner's ware, all of which proved even more evanescent in the fire {{than it had been}} in the fashion. A multitude of lovers of both sexes--discarded maids or bachelors and couples mutually weary of one another--tossed in bundles of perfumed letters and enamored sonnets. A hack politician, being deprived of bread by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> threw in his teeth, which happened to be false ones. The Rev. Sydney Smith--having voyaged across the Atlantic for that sole purpose--came up to the bonfire with a bitter grin and threw in certain repudiated bonds, fortified though they were with the broad seal of a sovereign state. A little boy of five years old, in the premature manliness of the present epoch, threw in his playthings; a college graduate, his diploma; an apothecary, ruined by the spread of homeopathy, his whole stock of drugs and medicines; a physician, his library; a parson, his old sermons; and a fine gentleman of the old school, his code of manners, which he had formerly written down for the benefit of the next generation. A widow, resolving on a second marriage, slyly threw in her dead husband's miniature. A young man, jilted by his mistress, would willingly have flung his own desperate heart into the flames, but could find no means to wrench it out of his bosom. An American author, whose works were neglected by the public, threw his pen and paper into the bonfire and betook himself to some less discouraging occupation. It somewhat startled me to overhear a number of ladies, highly respectable in appearance, proposing to fling their gowns and petticoats into the flames, and assume the garb, together with the manners, duties, offices, and responsibilities, of the opposite sex.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> {{postmaster}} and {{the carrying}} of letters affected Prideaux little. His legal practice {{continued to be}} large and lucrative, being worth £5,000 a year. He purchased Forde Abbey in the parish of Thorncombe, then in Devonshire, now in Dorset, where he built a large mansion house. On 31 May 1658 he was made a baronet by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, for [...] "his voluntary offer for the mainteyning of thirty foot-souldiers in his highnes army in Ireland".|$|R
5000|$|The {{reasons for}} Collingbourne's enmity {{are not entirely}} clear. In 1892, James H. Ramsay {{suggested}} that the lampoon was written [...] "in revenge for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>offices</b> in Wiltshire". Collingbourne's name does not appear among the commissions of peace in December 1483. Furthermore, in a letter of 3 June 1484, by King Richard asked his mother Cecily Neville, Duchess of York that [...] "my lord Chamberlain ... be your officer in Wiltshire in such as Colyngbourne had". This suggests that Collingbourne had been steward of the Duchess' Wiltshire lands and that both his correspondence and his lampoon were written in response to having lost this position. This loss may {{have been linked to}} his involvement in Buckingham's rebellion, either because he was dismissed or because he went into hiding. If his post was eventually filled by the Lord Chamberlain, Francis Viscount Lovell, this would further explain Collingbourne's ire against Richard's closest associate.|$|R

5000|$|Judging by {{his letters}} to Thomas Cromwell, Delahide seemed less {{concerned}} {{at the risk}} being prosecuted for treason than with the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his public <b>offices.</b> Elrington Ball [...] quotes his abject letter to Cromwell in 1534 in which Delahide denied that he had ever slandered Cromwell : in good faith I never spoke nor thought to speak any such thoughts...I know it well ye be of our Sovereign Lord's Privy Council and as high in his favour as any man. He greatly resented the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Chancellor of the Exchequer to Thomas Cusack but grudgingly conceded: I would have been contented {{that he should have}} enjoyed the same accordingly though it had rightfully been mine own. Delahide's main concern was to be restored to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Chief Justice : he wrote that there is labours made for mine <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Justiceship wherein I have truly {{to the best of my}} little power served the King's Grace by the space of 20 years trusting that there shall be no good cause proved why his Grace should (re)move me from the same.|$|R
