50|$|A {{variety of}} covered litter boxes exist that are {{commonly}} available and moderately priced. Many are constructed out of plastic and feature a plastic hood or dome {{that covers the}} <b>litter</b> <b>pan</b> and litter. The pet enters through {{an opening in the}} cover. Pet owners lift the cover off the tray to scoop, clean and change the litter. Covered litter boxes may reduce the amount of litter that is tracked outside the box and may address issues of pet eliminating waste over the walls of a <b>litter</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|E
50|$|For covered {{cat litter}} boxes, it will {{probably}} be necessary to cut a larger opening for the skunk. With any <b>litter</b> <b>pan,</b> bear in mind that regular cleaning is necessary since skunks will avoid a dirty bathroom.|$|E
50|$|Most skunks can be housebroken by corner training. After {{they choose}} a corner, a <b>litter</b> <b>pan</b> with unscented litter {{can be placed}} there. If the skunk misses the <b>litter</b> <b>pan,</b> after cleanup, the area should be {{saturated}} with plain white vinegar to remove the scent, {{so that they will}} not return to that spot. After the skunk's toilet has been established, it can be moved about four inches a day to a different location. The skunk may or may not follow. If it doesn't, {{it may be necessary to}} give in, let the skunk have that corner, and block the view with a chair or bookcase placed in the corner or some other decorative idea.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is assumed}} that fecal {{shedding}} of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) constitutes a transmission potential, no study has been performed showing that feces of infected cats can be a source of infection. In this study, we investigated fecal viral shedding of FeLV and its role in viral pathogenesis with the goal to improve infection control. FeLV RNA and DNA levels were determined in rectal swabs of experimentally infected cats by real-time PCR, and the results were correlated with proviral and viral loads in whole blood and plasma, respectively, and plasma p 27 levels. All antigenemic cats shed FeLV RNA and DNA in feces. To determine whether the viral RNA detected was infectious, virus isolation from feces was also performed. Infectious virus was isolated from feces of antigenemic cats, and these results perfectly correlated with the isolation of virus from plasma. Naïve cats exposed to these feces seroconverted, showing that infection through feces took place, but remained negative for the presence of FeLV provirus and p 27 in blood, an outcome so far not described. Some of the organs collected after euthanasia were provirus positive at low copy numbers. From these results it is concluded that fecal shedding of FeLV plays a role in transmission, but it is probably of secondary importance in viral pathogenesis. Nevertheless, sharing of <b>litter</b> <b>pans</b> by susceptible and viremic cats could increase the environmental infectious pressure and appropriate measures should be taken to avoid unnecessary viral exposure...|$|R
40|$|The major ways {{in which}} man acquires {{toxoplasmosis}} are through handling and consumption of raw meat and contact with feces (in litterpans and soil) from cats infected with Toxoplasma gondii. To prevent toxoplasmosis, certain steps should be taken. Meat should be heated throughout to 150 F (66 C) before consumption, and hands should be washed {{with soap and water}} after handling meat to remove any toxoplasma organisms contaminating the skin. Infection of indoor cats can be prevented by feeding them dry, canned, or boiled food and by restraining them from hunting. To the extent that diet cannot be controlled, an indoor eat's litterpan should be cleaned daily, feces should be flushed down the toilet, and the pan should be disinfected with boiling water. A person should wear disposable gloves while performing these tasks. Since soil contaminated by oocysts from T. gondii in feline feces is difficult to disinfect, contaminated sand in chil-dren's sandboxes should be disposed of, and gloves should be worn while one is working with soil that may contain feces from cats. Pregnant women should avoid cats whose source of food is unknown and should not empty <b>litter</b> <b>pans,</b> as toxo-plasmosis can be transmitted to infants in utero. The transmission of toxoplasmosis first became of interest with the discovery of neonatal infection. In the newborn baby, the disease often gives rise to disorders of the central nervous system and the eyes [1, 2]. Subsequently, the transmission of toxoplasmosis from raw or undercooked meat was suspected [3, 4], confirmed experimentally [5], and illustrated by an epidemic attributed to ham-burger meat [6]. It became apparent during the last few years that a stage of Toxoplasma gondii was shed in the feces of cats [7 - 9]. After an oocyst was discovered in feline feces and it was shown that Toxoplasma can be transmitted like other coccidia [10, 11], the focus of interest in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis shifted almost en-tirely to the role of cats since {{there is no evidence that}} other animals shed toxoplasma oocysts [10...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to litter or toilet train coatis; if one cannot be trained as such, {{it is still possible}} to lessen problems in that they tend to designate a latrine area, which can have a <b>litter</b> <b>pan</b> placed in it as is done with many ferrets, pet skunks, rabbits, and rodents.Coatis generally need both dog and cat vaccines for distemper and many other diseases and a killed rabies vaccine. They can be spayed or neutered for the same reason as cats and dogs and other pets.|$|E
50|$|An open <b>litter</b> <b>pan</b> is {{generally}} {{the most basic}} and least expensive design. They are commonly constructed out of plastic, however some disposable models exist, {{in the shape of}} a rectangular tray with outwardly sloped sides 10 to 15 cm high. Open litter pans allow for maximum ventilation which may increase cat comfort. Also, they show the waste most visibly which may encourage owners to scoop the box more frequently. Litter pans with low walls may not contain litter when a pet scratches or digs, some animals who eliminate standing up may be able to urinate/defecate over the walls. Some designs include a detachable rim to help catch litter when the animal kicks to bury their waste.|$|E
5000|$|A litter box, {{sometimes}} called a sandbox, litter tray, <b>litter</b> <b>pan,</b> or catbox, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats (as well as rabbits, ferrets, micro pigs; small dogs, such as Beagles and Chihuahuas; and other pets that instinctively or through training will {{make use of}} such a repository) that are permitted free roam of a home but who cannot or do not always go outside to relieve themselves. Many owners of these animals prefer not to let them roam outside for fear that they might succumb to outdoor dangers, such as weather, wildlife, traffic, or hostile humans. It has been claimed indoor cats, on average, live ten years longer than outdoor cats. [...] A litter box {{makes it possible to}} shelter pets from these risks.|$|E
6000|$|The {{room was}} {{stifling}} hot {{and full of}} flies; for the house was dirty and low and small, and stood in a bad place, behind the village, in {{the borders of the}} bush, and sheltered from the trade. The three men’s beds were on the floor, and a <b>litter</b> of <b>pans</b> and dishes. There was no standing furniture; Randall, when he was violent, tearing it to laths. There I sat and had a meal which was served us by Case’s wife; and there I was entertained all day by that remains of man, his tongue stumbling among low old jokes and long old stories, and his own wheezy laughter always ready, so that he had no sense of my depression. He was nipping gin all the while. Sometimes he fell asleep, and awoke again, whimpering and shivering, and every now and again he would ask me why I wanted to marry Uma. “My friend,” I was telling myself all day, “you must not come to be an old gentleman like this.” ...|$|R
40|$|Con el objetivo de evaluar la vida productiva de cerdas de las razas Large White (LW), Landrace (LR) y sus cruces recíprocos, se analizaron 2444 registros de prolificidad (TAN) y peso acumulado de la camada al nacer (PAN). Los registros de las cerdas provinieron de una granja {{comercial}} ubicada en el estado Yaracuy. Los datos fueron ajustados por mes, período de años y número de parto. Para el análisis final se agruparon los años de nacimiento de las cerdas en dos períodos: 1986 - 1998 y 1999 - 2005. Se consideraron las cerdas con la oportunidad de tener {{al menos}} tres partos. Se realizaron análisis de varianza por el procedimiento de máxima verosimilitud restringida. Los efectos incluidos en el análisis fueron: grupo racial de cerda (GRC: 1,…, 4), período de nacimiento de la cerda (PN: 1, 2), mes de nacimiento de la cerda (MN: 1,…, 12), GRC*MN y la edad al primer parto como covariable. Se obtuvieron promedios ajustados y no ajustados de 39, 27 y 39, 3 lechones; y 59, 5 kg y 59, 58 kg para TAN y PAN, respectivamente. Las cerdas del grupo racial LR*LW (42, 69 lechones y 63, 32 kg) y LW (41, 44 lechones y 62, 57 kg) resultaron superiores (P With {{the purpose of}} evaluating the productive life of Large White (LW) and Landrace (LR) sows and their reciprocal crosses, 2. 444 records of prolificacy (TAN) and aggregated weight of the <b>litter</b> at birth (<b>PAN)</b> were analyzed. The sow records came from a commercial farm located in the State of Yaracuy, Venezuela. The data were adjusted by month, period of year, and farrowing number. For the final analysis, the years of birth of the sows were grouped into two periods: 1986 - 1998 and 1999 - 2005. Sows with a chance of at least delivering three farrowings were considered. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) by the restricted maximum likelihood procedure was performed. The effects {{included in the analysis}} were: breed group of the sow (GRC: 1 … 4), birth period of the sow (PN: 1, 2), month of birth of the sow (MN: 1 … 12), the GRC*MN interaction, and the age at first farrowing as covariate. The adjusted and non-adjusted TAN averages obtained were 39. 27 and 39. 3, respectively; and the adjusted and nonadjusted PAN averages were 59. 5 and 59. 58 kg, in that order. The sows of LR*LW (42. 69 piglets and 63. 32 kg) and LW (41. 44 piglets and 62. 57 kg) breed group were higher (P< 0. 01) in TAN and PAN, respectively. There was a statistically significant effect of PN, PM, and GRC*MN. Heterosis was significant for TAN, with a value of 5. 9 %. It is concluded that purebred sows and their crosses whose genotype have alleles from mothers of the LW breed, are superior for the characteristics assessed in this research...|$|R
