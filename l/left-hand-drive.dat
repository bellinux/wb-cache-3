25|$|According to the Ashgabat {{correspondent}} of Turkmenistan.ru, right-hand-drive imported cars {{converted to}} <b>left-hand-drive</b> were banned {{due to a}} perceived increased risk in accidents.|$|E
25|$|Ford had {{intended}} on developing {{the car with}} <b>left-hand-drive</b> export potential, and received federal and state government grants to assist, but in October 2007 it was announced by Ford Australia president Tom Gorman that the <b>left-hand-drive</b> Falcon project was to be abandoned and the export-incentive grant money would be directed to construction of the Ford Focus small-car in Australia. In the end, the Focus project did not proceed, and Asia-Pacific production of that model was instead started at a new plant in Thailand in June 2012. As the FG Falcon utilizes much of the previous model's architecture, converting it to left-hand drive {{would have been a}} costly and time-consuming process.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} the Citroën SM, first shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1970. It went on sale in France in September of that year. Factory {{produced}} cars were all <b>left-hand-drive,</b> although RHD conversions were done in the UK and Australia.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, The Group {{announced}} its {{move into the}} European bus market with NABI, Inc.’s debt-financed acquisition {{of all of the}} shares of the Optare Group, (Optare) of Leeds, U.K. for $US 28.5million, making Optare a NABI, Inc. subsidiary. Anticipated benefits included immediate participation in the European market as well as eventual European market participation with a new, composite-structured bus then under development. Plans also included the derivation of certain <b>left-hand-drive</b> Optare products for U.S. and Hungarian markets.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there had}} been {{previous}} moderate expansion of NABI’s Anniston, AL facility, 2001 marked additional and substantial factory expansion, taking the Anniston, AL plant to over 250,000square feet (under roof). 2001 also marked derivation of the 30-foot NABI Model 30-LFN which was a <b>left-hand-drive</b> derivative of the recently developed Optare “Solo” being sold in the UK. Sale of these small low-floor buses commenced to private and public operators within the U.S. An additional outgrowth of the Optare acquisition was {{the sale of a}} small number of full-size (11meter) NABI Model 700SE’s the following year in Hungary. These were derived from the Optare Excel, and were produced on Scania chassis.|$|E
500|$|The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) {{awarded the}} i-MiEV a four-star car safety rating, earning the {{following}} ratings for each criterion. The tested model was a <b>left-hand-drive</b> five-door hatchback registered in 2011: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, Holden {{introduced}} its third major new model, the FB. The car's style {{was inspired by}} 1950s Chevrolets, with tailfins and a wrap-around windshield with [...] "dog leg" [...] A-pillars. By {{the time it was}} introduced, many considered the appearance dated. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact Holden. The FB became the first Holden that was adapted for <b>left-hand-drive</b> markets, enhancing its export potential, and as such was exported to New Caledonia, New Hebrides, the Philippines, and Hawaii.|$|E
2500|$|The Fronte 7-S {{was never}} a big seller, as {{it was an old}} design and {{two-stroke}} engines were beginning to lose favor with Japanese car buyers. The SS10 and SS20 Frontes were both clearly based on the old LC20, making do with a widened LC20 chassis and using its doors and many interior parts. For the SS20 Suzuki resorted to increasingly awkward efforts to hide the LC20's curvy design with square blocks of plastic, without much success. Production ended in April 1979, as Suzuki was getting ready to introduce their new generation of front-wheel drive kei cars. In the few export markets where it was available, the Fronte 7‑S was simply sold as the [...] "Suzuki SS10" [...] and [...] "SS20", foregoing the Fronte name. It was also built with <b>left-hand-drive.</b> The SS10 received an engine less burdened by emissions equipment than the Japanese market model, producing [...] at 4500rpm. It was available as the two-door FC (Custom) and the four-door GL (Deluxe).|$|E
50|$|The smart was {{initially}} {{available only in}} <b>left-hand-drive</b> form, as the floorpan allowed only for a <b>left-hand-drive</b> version. Smart subsequently designed a floorpan for right-hand-drive models. The Fortwo is now marketed in 37 countries worldwide.|$|E
50|$|When the {{original}} fleet {{was beginning to}} age, Neoplan constructed a single <b>left-hand-drive</b> prototype bus with video cameras as a potential replacement. All of the MallRide operators {{refused to accept the}} <b>left-hand-drive</b> bus, citing more convenience and safety with right-hand-drive configuration.|$|E

50|$|In 1961 Buckle Motors was {{purchased}} by Hong Kong investors and in 1963 Bill Buckle created Bill Buckle Auto Conversions, specialising in <b>left-hand-drive</b> to right-hand-drive conversions of American vehicles.|$|E
50|$|This {{generation}} {{was generally not}} exported, and was never built by Suzuki with engines of more than 660 cc nor with <b>left-hand-drive.</b> It arrived late in export markets, only by 1993 after the earlier export version had been retired, {{and it was only}} seen in a very few places, namely New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In most countries the earlier Alto/Fronte was replaced by an Alto-badged Maruti Zen (an Indian-built Suzuki Cervo Mode). With a 0.8-liter engine the CL11 Alto was built with <b>left-hand-drive</b> in Korea, Poland, Romania and Uzbekistan as the Daewoo Tico, and in China by Anchi.|$|E
50|$|Available as a two-door with an {{extended}} pickup bed for personnel or equipment transport, or a four-door multipurpose vehicle, {{it may be}} produced with numerous vehicle-body and seating configurations in either right-hand- or <b>left-hand-drive.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{small number}} of <b>left-hand-drive</b> Tens were {{exported}} to the USA and sold as the Triumph TR-10. On these, the two-tone colour arrangement normally reserved for the Pennant was available (though this export model was not tailfinned).|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle {{must meet}} all {{technical}} requirements to be legal for road {{use in the}} country of registration. Any conflicting technical requirements (e.g., right-hand-drive or <b>left-hand-drive)</b> in the signatory country where the vehicle is being driven do not apply.|$|E

50|$|The protagonists drive {{signature}} cars. Danny Wilde {{drives a}} red <b>left-hand-drive</b> Dino 246 GT (chassis number 00810). Brett Sinclair drives a UK-registered Bahama Yellow right-hand-drive Aston Martin DBS (chassis number DBS/5636/R) with V8 wheels and markings. Both cars were {{provided to the}} show's producers courtesy of the respective vehicle manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|In total {{only seven}} Arnage Green Label units were built, {{all of which}} were <b>left-hand-drive</b> versions. There was a final series of {{vehicles}} built in 2000 with the 4.4-litre BMW engine designated the Arnage Birkin, of which 52 units were produced and are distinguishable by their three-dial as opposed to five-dial instrument center dashboard configuration.|$|E
5000|$|A {{production}} tourer, the MG [...] "YT", {{was launched}} at the Motor Show in 1948. It {{was available for}} export only in both right- and <b>left-hand-drive</b> models. Only 877 of these cars were produced when production ceased in 1950—it was not the success that MG had hoped for, and indeed other British manufacturers were also having problems selling open-tourer versions of their saloons.|$|E
50|$|Fresnel lenses {{are used}} in <b>left-hand-drive</b> European lorries {{entering}} the UK and Republic of Ireland (and vice versa, right-hand-drive Irish and British trucks entering mainland Europe) to overcome the blind spots caused by the driver operating the lorry while sitting {{on the wrong side}} of the cab relative to the side of the road the car is on. They attach to the passenger-side window.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{fitted with}} a 1340 cc three-main-bearing engine (model 109E), the early cars were {{considered}} underpowered and suffered from premature crankshaft failure. Engine capacity was increased in August 1962 to 1498 cc (model 116E) and this engine with its new five-bearing crankshaft was an improvement. The first 200 Capris were <b>left-hand-drive</b> cars for export including Europe and North America. In Germany at the 1961 Frankfurt Auto Show, Ford sold 88 Capris.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{currently}} possible {{to produce a}} single car design that fully meets both UN and US requirements simultaneously, but it is growing easier as technology and both sets of regulations evolve. Given {{the size of the}} US vehicle market, and differing marketing strategies in North America vs. the rest of the world, many manufacturers produce vehicles in three versions: North American, rest-of-world right-hand drive (RHD) and rest-of-world <b>left-hand-drive</b> (LHD).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 30 ft bus {{version was}} coded L1, {{it was right}} hand drive with a 16 ft 2in wheelbase and an overall length of 29 ft 4in. The 30 ft coach was the L2 which had the same wheelbase but was an inch shorter overall, the <b>left-hand-drive</b> LHL1 shared the wheelbase but the overall length was 29 ft 2in. All had a swept turning circle of 68 ft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{code name}} for the project was DP K9.01, named after a Doctor Who character. It {{was built in the}} UK, but is a <b>left-hand-drive</b> car. It is 15ft 6in long, very low at 43 inches (1.1 m) high, and sharp, {{distinctive}} Trapezium shaped design, features five centre-mounted, hidden headlamps and gull-wing doors. The interior uses digital instrumentation and the rear view is delivered via a television monitor mounted on the centre console.|$|E
50|$|During this time, the NSX {{also lost}} sales as Acura made few changes from its {{original}} 1990 trim. A year later, the Integra sedan was withdrawn from the Canadian market, replaced by the market-exclusive Acura 1.6 EL, a rebadged Honda Civic/Domani. The Integra sedan continued to be sold in the United States until 2001 (in name only, the model it was replaced with, the RSX, was simply a rebadged <b>left-hand-drive</b> version of the JDM DC5 Honda Integra).|$|E
50|$|Around 500 of the {{civilian}} version {{are thought to have}} been made, including at least one <b>left-hand-drive</b> version. They were priced at £750 in November 1952 and at £1000 in November 1954. Many went to Australia, where some can still be found. Two are known to have survived in the UK. Some of the design features of the Champ were carried over to the Austin Gipsy, of which some 21,000 were made from 1958 to 1967.|$|E
