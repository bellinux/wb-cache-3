5|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>hydride</b> {{containing}} lithium-6 {{is used in}} thermonuclear weapons, {{where it}} serves as fuel for the fusion stage of the bomb.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>hydride</b> {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a variety of reagents for organic synthesis, such as lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) and lithium borohydride (LiBH4). Triethylborane reacts to give superhydride (LiBHEt3).|$|E
25|$|Proposed {{hydrides}} {{for use in}} {{a hydrogen}} economy include simple hydrides of magnesium or transition metals and complex metal hydrides, typically containing sodium, lithium, or calcium and aluminium or boron. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are <b>lithium</b> <b>hydride,</b> sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride and ammonia borane. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.|$|E

50|$|Reducing {{agents for}} the non-catalytic {{conversion}} to amines include <b>lithium</b> aluminium <b>hydride,</b> <b>lithium</b> borohydride, diborane, or elemental sodium in alcohol solvents.|$|R
50|$|The use of lithium {{borohydride}} {{is particularly}} advantageous in some preparations {{due to its}} higher chemoselectivity relative to other popular reducing agents such as <b>lithium</b> aluminium <b>hydride.</b> For instance, unlike <b>lithium</b> aluminium <b>hydride,</b> <b>lithium</b> borohydride will reduce esters, nitriles, lactones, primary amides, and epoxides while sparing nitro groups, carbamic acids, alkyl halides, and secondary/tertiary amides.|$|R
500|$|Lithium has a {{diagonal}} relationship with magnesium, {{an element of}} similar atomic and ionic radius. Chemical resemblances between the two metals include {{the formation of a}} nitride by reaction with N2, the formation of an oxide (...) and peroxide (...) when burnt in O2, salts with similar solubilities, and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides. The metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce <b>lithium</b> <b>hydride</b> (LiH).|$|E
500|$|Compounds of {{hydrogen}} are often called hydrides, {{a term that}} is used fairly loosely. The term [...] "hydride" [...] suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H−, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten <b>lithium</b> <b>hydride</b> (LiH), producing a stoichiometry quantity {{of hydrogen}} at the anode. For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is , which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the [...] anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).|$|E
500|$|The {{first shot}} {{was a test}} of Pendant, a fission bomb boosted with solid <b>lithium</b> <b>hydride</b> {{intended}} as a primary for a thermonuclear bomb. Rather than being dropped from a bomber, this bomb was suspended from a string of four vertically stacked barrage balloons. This was chosen over an air drop because the bomb assembly could not be fitted into a dropable casing, but it introduced a host of problems. A balloon shot had been tried only once before by the British, during Operation Antler at Maralinga in October 1957. William Saxby from Aldermaston was placed {{in charge of the}} balloon crews, who commenced training at RAF Cardington in Bedfordshire in January 1958. Inflating the balloons required 1,200 cylinders of hydrogen gas, and there were no reserves. If another balloon test were required, then the empty cylinders would have to be returned to the United Kingdom for refilling, and then shipped out again. An important consideration was how they could be shot down if they broke loose of their moorings with a live hydrogen bomb. The cargo ship SS Tidecrest arrived at Christmas Island on 20 July, but the firing harness was lost at San Francisco International Airport on 1 August, and a replacement had to be flown out. The Pendant fissile core arrived by air on 12 August, and the weapon was assembled with its external neutron initiator unit. On 22 August 1958 it was lifted [...] in the air, and it detonated at 09:00. The yield was assessed at [...]|$|E
50|$|Alkoxyaluminium {{hydrides}} {{are typically}} prepared by treatment of <b>lithium</b> aluminium <b>hydride</b> with the corresponding alcohol. Hydrogen evolution indicates {{the formation of}} alkoxyaluminium hydride products. Hindered <b>hydrides</b> such as <b>lithium</b> tri-(tert-butoxy)aluminium <b>hydride</b> (LTBA) are stable {{for long periods of}} time under inert atmosphere, but <b>lithium</b> trimethoxyaluminium <b>hydride</b> (LTMA) undergoes disproportionation and should be used immediately after preparation. Pure, solid Red-Al is stable for several hours under inert atmosphere and is available commercially as a 70%-solution in toluene under the trade name VitrideTM.|$|R
25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{are reduced}} by strong hydride donors such as <b>lithium</b> aluminium <b>hydride</b> and diisobutylaluminium hydride to give primary alcohols. <b>Lithium</b> tri-tert-butoxyaluminium <b>hydride,</b> a bulky hydride donor, reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, {{as does the}} Rosenmund reduction using hydrogen gas over a poisoned palladium catalyst.|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} to crew, electronics, and non-metallic materials {{is one of}} many concerns with long-term, deep space travel. Mitigating this exposure is approached via a multi-faceted methodology focusing on multi-functional materials, vehicle configuration, and operational or mission constraints. In this set of research, we are focusing on new multi-functional materials that may have advantages over traditional shielding materials, such as polyethylene. Metal hydride materials are of particular interest for deep space radiation shielding due to their ability to store hydrogen, a low-Z material known to be an excellent radiation mitigator and a potential fuel source. We have previously investigated 41 different metal hydrides for their radiation mitigation potential. Of these metal hydrides, we found a set of <b>lithium</b> <b>hydrides</b> to be of particular interest due to their excellent shielding of galactic cosmic radiation. Given these results, we will continue our investigation of <b>lithium</b> <b>hydrides</b> by expanding our data set to include dose equivalent and to further understand why these materials outperformed polyethylene in a heavy ion environment. For this study, we used HZETRN 2010, a one-dimensional transport code developed by NASA Langley Research Center, to simulate radiation transport through the <b>lithium</b> <b>hydrides.</b> We focused on the 1977 solar minimum Galactic Cosmic Radiation environment and thicknesses of 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 g/cm 2 to stay consistent with our previous studies. The details of this work and the subsequent results will be discussed in this paper...|$|R
