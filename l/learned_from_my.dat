60|$|Both Nathaniel and I had {{believed}} it was the king who counted to send all these people overseas; but I <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> new master that a company of London merchants {{was in charge of}} the enterprise, these merchants believing much profit might come to them in the way of getting gold.|$|E

"When men {{are kept}} as serfs, they work as serfs--I {{mean to say}} they work unwillingly and slowly, while, had they {{the sense of being}} free, and of having the same rights as others, they would labour more cheerfully. Moreover, it would double the {{strength}} of the force that the king and his nobles could place in the field. I am not speaking upon my own judgment, but from what I have <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> father." ...|$|E

60|$|I soon <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> shipmates, {{that this}} was the famous Bett-Buoy, which is {{precisely}} what its name implies; and tolls fast or slow, according to the agitation of the waves. In a calm, it is dumb; in a moderate breeze, it tolls gently; but in a gale, it is an alarum like the tocsin, warning all mariners to flee. But it seemed fuller of dirges for the past, than of monitions for the future; and no one can give ear to it, without thinking of the sailors who sleep far beneath it {{at the bottom of the}} deep.|$|E
60|$|The man's {{name was}} said to be Murlock. He was {{apparently}} seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lustreless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> grandfather, from whom also I got the man's story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I got {{the letter}} that you wrote when you were at Gibraltar, saying what ship you were on, and <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> friend Captain Harrington of the prize court, that unless some hitch {{occurred}} in the negotiations, the fleet there, with the troops on board, would at once be ordered home, and on arrival would be paid off. There was, therefore, no occasion {{for me to make}} any application in the matter. The troops are, I see, landing to-day, and I suppose that in a week at latest the ships will be taken to the harbour and you will all be paid off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Colonel Starbottle," [...] {{interrupted}} Arthur, rising with dignity, [...] "the facts I {{have just}} stated are {{sufficient for the}} responsibility I assume in this case.

This is a matter, between gentlemen, serious enough without further complication!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2016, Charles was a {{guest on}} The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In February 2017, Charles caused {{controversy}} when he tweeted an offensive joke about Africa and Ebola.

40|$|Between 18 - 26 th of May 2013 I {{participated in}} a Comenius {{training}} course in Dunfermline, Scotland where I {{had a lot to}} <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> experienced teacher trainers and I shared a lot with the other European countries.

60|$|My {{people were}} not a little anxious {{regarding}} me, by the time I returned to Carlow, and the landlord was very much afraid, he said, that the highwaymen had gotten hold of me. There, too, my name and station had been <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> servant Fritz: who had not spared his praises of his master, and had invented some magnificent histories concerning me. He {{said it was the}} truth that I was intimate with half the sovereigns of Europe, and the prime favourite with most of them. Indeed I had made my uncle's order of the Spur hereditary, and travelled under the name of the Chevalier Barry, chamberlain to the Duke of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.|$|E
60|$|Our {{conversation}} {{now turned}} upon {{the details of}} our arrangements for the morrow. Talbot, I <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> betrothed, had just arrived in town. I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage. The soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was {{to be at the}} door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best.|$|E
60|$|Now let me {{apply the}} lessons I have <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> {{handicraft}} to yours. If {{any of you}} were obliged to take an apprentice, I suppose {{you would like to}} get a good healthy lad, ready and willing to learn, handy, and with his fingers not all thumbs, as the saying goes. You would like that he should read, write, and cipher well; and, if you were an intelligent master, and your trade involved the application of scientific principles, as so many trades do, you would like him to know enough of the elementary principles of science to understand what was going on. I suppose that, in nine trades out of ten, it would be useful if he could draw; and many of you must have lamented your inability to find out for yourselves what foreigners are doing or have done. So that some knowledge of French and German might, in many cases, be very desirable.|$|E
40|$|DEDICATION This work is {{dedicated}} to my husband, Murray, {{who has been a}} constant source of support. It is also dedicated to my children, Kiera and Ben: I hope that you will <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> mistakes and be daring enough to make your own. Finally, this work {{is dedicated}} to my parents Rose and Ted Green in acknowledgement of their immeasurable gifts: knowledge of the love of God; their continuous love; and, the encouragement to dream.

5000|$|The album version {{includes}} a third verse {{compared to the}} much shorter single. Additionally, a [...] "lost verse" [...] mix of the song was released on the 1996 reissue of Who Are You, with a completely different second verse: [...] "I used to check my reflection / Jumping with my cheap guitar / I must have lost my direction, cause I ended up a superstar/ One-nighters in the boardroom/ Petrify the human brain/ You can <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> mistakes, but you're posing in the glass again".|$|R

[...] "And hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed my regret. That this should have occurred to any gentleman, Mr. Jarndyce, but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock, and indeed claiming some distant connexion with her, and for whom (as I <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> Lady herself) she entertains a high respect, does, I assure you, give--me--pain." ...|$|R
