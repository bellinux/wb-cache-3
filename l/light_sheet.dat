25|$|<b>Light</b> <b>sheet</b> {{fluorescence}} microscopy or selective plane imaging microscopy (SPIM) uses illumination {{that is done}} perpendicularly to the direction of observation, by using a thin sheet of (laser) light. Under certain conditions, this illumination principle can be combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to allow spatially resolved imaging of the mobility and interactions of fluorescing particles such as GFP labelled proteins inside living biological samples.|$|E
25|$|Fog (usually {{from water}} particles) is created with an {{ultrasonic}} piezoelectric nebulizer. The fog is transported inside the wind tunnel (preferably of the closed circuit and closed test section type). An electrically heated grid is inserted before the test section, which evaporates the water particles at its vicinity, thus forming fog sheets. The fog sheets function as streamlines over the test model when illuminated by a <b>light</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Using a {{plane of}} light formed by {{focusing}} light through a cylindrical lens at a narrow angle or by scanning {{a line of}} light in a plane perpendicular to the axis of objective, high resolution optical sections can be taken. Single plane illumination, or <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> illumination, is also accomplished using beam shaping techniques incorporating multiple-prism beam expanders. The images are captured by CCDs.

40|$|A {{laser-based}} {{technique for}} measuring instantaneous three-dimensional species concentration distributions in turbulent flows is presented. The laser beam {{from a single}} laser is formed into two crossed <b>light</b> <b>sheets</b> that illuminate the area of interest. The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) signal emitted from excited species within both planes is detected with a single camera via a mirror arrangement. Image processing enables {{the reconstruction of the}} three-dimensional data set in close proximity to the cutting line of the two <b>light</b> <b>sheets.</b> Three-dimensional intensity gradients are computed and compared to the two-dimensional projections obtained from the two directly observed planes. Volume visualization by digital image processing gives unique insight into the three-dimensional structures within the turbulent processes. We apply this technique to measurements of toluene-LIF in a turbulent, non-reactive mixing process of toluene and air and to hydroxyl (OH) LIF in a turbulent methane-air flame upon excitation at 248 nm with a tunable KrF excimer laser...|$|R

It is important that the particles are of small size so that not only they follow the flow satisfactorily but also they rapidly assume its temperature.

In Bessel beam <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> microscopes, a non-diffracting Bessel beam is first created then dithered in the x direction in order to produce a sheet. However, the lobes of a Bessel functions carry as much energy as the central spot, resulting in illumination out of the depth of field of the observation objective.|$|E

40|$|A novel multiple-camera {{system for}} the {{recording}} of digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) images acquired in a two-dimensional separating / reattaching flow is described. The measurements were performed in the NASA Langley Subsonic Basic Research Tunnel {{as part of an}} overall series of experiments involving the simultaneous acquisition of dynamic surface pressures and off-body velocities. The DPIV system utilized two frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers to generate two coplanar, orthogonallypolarized <b>light</b> <b>sheets</b> directed upstream along the horizontal centerline of the test model. A recording system containing two pairs of matched high resolution, 8 -bit cameras was used to separate and capture images of illuminated tracer particles embedded in the flow field. Background image subtraction was used to reduce undesirable flare light emanating {{from the surface of the}} model, and custom pixel alignment algorithms were employed to provide accurate registration among the various cameras. Spatial cross correlation analysis with median filter validation was used to determine the instantaneous velocity structure in the separating / reattaching flow region illuminated by the laser <b>light</b> <b>sheets.</b> In operation the DPIV system exhibited a good ability to resolve largescale separated flow structures with acceptable accuracy over the extended field of view of the cameras. The recording system design provided enhanced performance versus traditional DPIV systems by allowing a variety of standard and non-standard cameras to be easily incorporated into the system. dcamer...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{a variety}} of results in string theory and general relativity, {{a picture of the}} black hole {{interior}} is developed wherein spacetime caps off at an inner horizon, and the inter-horizon region is occupied by a Hagedorn gas of a very low tension state of fractionated branes. This picture leads to natural resolutions of {{a variety of}} puzzles concerning quantum black holes. Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation. 1. Black Hole Horizons and Thermodynamics The outer horizon of a stationary black hole is the surface beyond which outward-directed <b>light</b> <b>sheets</b> have a negative expansion. Causal evolution draws any matter within this surface further into the interior. For charged and/or rotating black holes, such outward-directed <b>light</b> <b>sheets</b> accumulate at an inner horizon. For instance, the metric of a charged black hole can be written in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates ds 2 = −∆(r) dv 2 + 2 dv dr + r 2 dΩ 2; (1) the two horizons are located at ∆(r±) = 0. Properties of both horizons feed into black hole thermodynamic relations such as the first law [1, 2]: dM = T±dS ± + Ω±dJ + Φ±e dQe.

5000|$|In lattice <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> {{microscopy}}, {{very similar}} to <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> microscopy the illumination of the sample occurs perpendicular to the image detection. Initially the <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> is formed by stretching the linearly polarized circular input beam {{with a pair of}} cylindrical lenses along the x axis and then compressing it with an additional pair of lenses along the z axis. [...] This modification creates a thin sheet of light that is then projected onto a binary ferroelectric spatial light modulator (SLM). The SLM is a device that spatially varies the waveform of a beam of light. The light that is reflected back from the SLM is used to eliminate unwanted diffraction. Diffraction is eliminated by the transform lens that creates a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from the reflected light at an opaque mask containing a transparent annulus. [...] Optical lattices are two or three dimensional interference patterns, which here are produced by the transparent annular ring. The mask is conjugate to x and z galvanometers. This quality of the microscope is important for the dithered mode of operation, where the <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> must be oscillated within the x axis.|$|E

50|$|A {{cylindrical}} lens is a lens which focuses light into a line {{instead of a}} point, as a spherical lens would.
