25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} between angakkuq and lay person {{has not always}} been clearly demarcated. Non-angakkuq could experience hallucinations, and almost every Alaskan Native can report memories of ghosts, animals in human form, or <b>little</b> <b>people</b> living in remote places. Experiences such as hearing voices from ice or stones were discussed as readily as everyday hunting adventures. Neither were ecstatic experiences the monopoly of angakkuit (reverie, daydreaming, even trance were not unknown by non-angakkuit), and laypeople (non-angakkuit) experiencing them were welcome to report their experiences and interpretations. The ability to have and command helping spirits was characteristic of angakkuit, but laypeople could also profit from spirit powers through the use of amulets. In one extreme instance a Netsilingmiut child had 80 amulets for protection. Some laypeople had a greater capacity than others for close relationships with special beings of the belief system; these people were often apprentice angakkuit who failed to complete their learning process.|$|E
25|$|A {{graduate}} of University College Dublin, Ó Dálaigh was a committed Fianna Fáil supporter {{who served on}} the party's National Executive in the 1930s, he became Ireland's youngest Attorney General in 1946 under Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, serving until 1948. Unsuccessful in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann elections in 1948 and 1951, he was re-appointed as Attorney General in 1951 and in 1953 he was appointed as the youngest member of the Supreme Court by his mentor, de Valera. Less than a decade later, he became Chief Justice, when selected by then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. He was a keen actor in his early years and became a close friend of actor Cyril Cusack. It is commonly stated that Ó Dálaigh and Cusack picketed the Dublin launch of Disney's Darby O'Gill and the <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> for what they felt was the film's stereotyping of Irish people.

25|$|The Main Event was a {{continuation}} of a storyline that had gotten very heated, very quickly as Volador Jr. and Mr. Niebla faced off in a singles match between the two. In previous weeks the two had fought, tearing at each other's masks and brutalizing each other whenever they got the chance; this match was no different. The action even included Mije and Zacarias, the Mascotas (<b>little</b> <b>people</b> in brightly colored costumes) as both Mije and Zacarias interfered in the match and tried to gain an advantage for their side. In the third and deciding fall Volador Jr. pulled Mr. Niebla's mask off, hoping to gain an advantage by the distraction, but Mr. Niebla had prepared for such a ploy and had his face wrapped in bandages under the mask so his bare face was not exposed. When the referee caught Volador Jr. with Mr. Niebla's mask in his hands he immediately called for the disqualification as {{it is illegal to}} take an opponent's mask off under Lucha Libre rules. For the third week in a row Volador Jr. challenged Mr. Niebla to a mask vs. mask match and for the third week in a row Mr. Niebla decline the challenge, stating Volador Jr. was not worthy of it.|$|E
