50|$|Deferred {{financing}} costs or debt issuance costs is an accounting concept meaning {{costs associated with}} issuing debt (loans and bonds), such as various fees and commissions paid to investment banks, law firms, auditors, regulators, and so on. Since these payments do not generate future benefits, they are treated as a contra debt account. The costs are capitalized, reflected in the balance sheet as a contra <b>long-term</b> <b>liability,</b> and amortized using the imputed interest method or over the finite life of the underlying debt instrument, if below de minimus. The unamortized amounts {{are included in the}} long-term debt, as a reduction of the total debt (hence contra debt) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Early debt repayment results in expensing these costs.|$|R

50|$|Tailings do {{not have}} to be stored in ponds or sent as {{slurries}} into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked. This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the <b>long-term</b> <b>liability</b> that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.|$|R
