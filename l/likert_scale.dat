5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale,</b> they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
25|$|This self-report {{questionnaire}} {{can be both}} {{administered by}} a clinician or self-administered. It {{is made up of}} 5 items rated on a 6-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

30|$|A {{focus group}} {{comprising}} researchers, school administrators, and school psychologists was convened {{to review the}} instrument. The question items comprised various <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> of four, five, or seven points. In the final analysis, all items were converted to five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales.</b> Due to {{the objectives of the}} study, a total of 29 items were not used since they were related to the subjective well-being of students during the past week of filling the survey.|$|R
40|$|Rating <b>scales,</b> such as <b>Likert</b> <b>scales,</b> {{are very}} common in {{marketing}} research, customer satisfaction studies, psychometrics, opinion surveys, population studies, and numerous other fields. We recommend diverging stacked bar charts as the primary graphical display technique for <b>Likert</b> and related <b>scales.</b> We also show other applications where diverging stacked bar charts are useful. Many examples of plots of <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> are given. We discuss the perceptual and programming issues in constructing these graphs. We present two implementations for diverging stacked bar charts. Most examples in this paper were drawn with the likert function included in the HH package in R. We also have a dashboard in Tableau...|$|R
25|$|Political {{opinions}} in Oregon are geographically split by the Cascade Range, with western Oregon being more liberal and Eastern Oregon being conservative. In a 2008 {{analysis of the}} 2004 presidential election, a political analyst found that according to {{the application of a}} <b>Likert</b> <b>scale,</b> Oregon boasted both the most liberal Kerry voters and the most conservative Bush voters, making it the most politically polarized state in the country.|$|E
25|$|The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is used {{to detect}} the {{relation}} between personality traits and positive or negative affects at this moment, today, the past few days, the past week, the past few weeks, the past year, and generally (on average). PANAS is a 20-item questionnaire, which uses a five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely). A longer version with additional affect scales is available in a manual.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of FAS facial {{features}} uses criteria {{developed by the}} University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide, a five-point <b>Likert</b> <b>Scale</b> with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.|$|E

In the theoretical part of the thesis, fundamental terms are defined, such as tourism, tourist destination, its attractivity and ways of measurement, destination as a system. Furthermore we focus on the methodology used in this thesis, especially Q-methodology and <b>Likert's</b> <b>scale.</b> In the practical part, attractivity of tourist destination is evaluated by South Bohemian residents. The result of the research is the comparisons of the results based on the Q-methodology and <b>Likert's</b> <b>scale...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{study was}} a {{prospective}} two-phase design in an Australian teaching hospital. Phase one: a survey of pharmacist self-reported confidence to eight questions on providing contemporary advice on vancomycin. Responses were recorded using a <b>Likert</b> <b>scales.</b> Phase two: The provision of a pilot online CPD module on vancomycin containing knowledge-based assessment based on a clinical vignette. <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> recorded self-reported confidence were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). Knowledge assessment was reported using descriptive statistics. The main outcome measure were the self-reported confidence, and knowledge of pharmacists regarding provision of contemporary advice on clinical vancomycin use.|$|R
25|$|The name item {{response}} {{theory is}} due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each examinee of a given ability to each item in the test. The term item is generic: covering all kinds of informative item. They might be multiple choice questions that have incorrect and correct responses, but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a rating or <b>Likert</b> <b>scale),</b> or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is used {{to measure}} a tetraplegic patient's performance and satisfaction before and after upper limb surgery. This is done by identifying important goals of hand surgery and evaluating patient-perceived performance and satisfaction of hand surgery for these goals. Goals are identiﬁed through an interview between the therapist and the patient based on past experience. Published reports are provided about the expected outcomes of elbow extension transfers on strength and function of patients with a spinal cord injury. For each goal, the subject rated performance and satisfaction using a 10-point <b>Likert</b> <b>scale,</b> in which 1 was negative (“cannot perform,” “not satisfied”) and 10 was positive (“performs very well,” “very satisfied”). After surgery, performance and satisfaction are rated again for each goal.|$|E
500|$|Kohlberg's {{body of work}} on {{the stages}} of moral {{development}} has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the Defining Issues Test (DIT) created in 1979 by James Rest, originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview. Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made {{efforts to improve the}} validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the <b>Likert</b> <b>scale,</b> to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's. It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of [...] "post-conventional thinking". In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT-2; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required, such as divinity, politics, and medicine.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{solutions}} to two recurring problems in cross-national research: response style differences and language bias. In {{order to do}} so, we conduct a methodological comparison of two different response formats [...] rating and ranking. For rating, we assess the effect of changing the commonly used 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> to 7 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales.</b> For ranking, we evaluate the validity of presenting respondents with short scenarios for which they need to rank their top 3 solutions. Our results - based on two studies of 1965 undergraduate and 1714 MBA students in 16 different countries - confirm our hypotheses that both solutions reduce response and language bias, but show that ranking generally is a superior solution. These findings allow researchers to have greater confidence in the validity of cross-national differences if these response formats are used, instead of the more traditional 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales.</b> In addition, our findings have several practical implications for multinational corporations, relating to issues such as selection interviews, performance appraisals, and cross-cultural training.

30|$|A {{structured}} questionnaire with 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> with anchors “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” {{was used}} in this study. Since 5 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> are widely used, especially in a business context, this research felt that it was appropriate to use the same tactic for this study. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part was to examine the customer satisfaction through the variables of service quality. The second part was designed to collect respondents’ demographic information. To validate the questionnaire, a pilot test was carried out on a convenient sample of 30 passengers and the collected data was used to refine the survey instrument.|$|R

40|$|Listening is an {{interesting}} subject to learn. Especially in learning English, listening is very essential subject to learn for helping the students improve their abilities in learning English. The listening class is designed {{for the students to}} be skilled listeners in order to succeed academically. In contradiction, there are some students who have problems in listening class. There are many factors that might cause problems in listening class. Each of the students has different problems in listening class. In this study the writer divided them into different categories including linguistic and non linguistic factors in listening class. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the problems faced by the first year students of SMA Muhamadiyah I Malang in listening class. The research design used in this research was descriptive quantitative because the writer used numbers in clarifying the data about the students problems in learning listening and the dominant problem faced by the students in listening class. The populations of this study were all the first year students of SMA Muhammadiyah I Malang. In collecting the data the writer used <b>Likert</b> <b>Scales.</b> The <b>Likert</b> <b>Scales</b> consists of 20 statements that are connected with linguistic and non-linguistic problems. The <b>Likert</b> <b>Scales</b> items related to linguistic problems deal with pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension. While the <b>Likert</b> <b>Scales</b> items related to non linguistic problems deal with the media and students’ motivation. The findings of the study shows that most of the first year students have problems in listening class including the linguistic and non linguistic, while the most dominant students’ problem is linguistic problem related with pronunciation. ...|$|R
30|$|The TAM 2 items had 7 -point <b>Likert’s</b> <b>scale</b> response, and the SUS survey asked 5 -point Likert’s response. To answer RQ 1, <b>Likert’s</b> <b>scale</b> {{data was}} {{aggregated}} in three groups, viz agree (combining responses 5 to 7), neutral (response 4), and disagree (combining responses 1 to 3). We further analyzed the transitions of response from one group to another across the survey items by using iSAT. This helped to explicate patterns {{across the three}} constructs chosen from the TAM 2 survey. For RQ 2, we considered the total SUS score and evaluated its usability with respect to empirical results of SUS score (Bangor et al. 2008). We examined the reason that participants gave corresponding to their response to each items to find the major perceived reason.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{major focus}} in psychometrics {{has been on}} {{personality}} testing. [...] There have been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality. [...] Some of the better known instruments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Five-Factor Model (or [...] "Big 5") and tools such as Personality and Preference Inventory and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. [...] Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric approaches. [...] A common method in the measurement of attitudes {{is the use of}} the <b>Likert</b> <b>scale.</b> [...] An alternative method involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (Andrich & Luo, 1993).|$|E
2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally {{connected people}} feel {{to the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale</b> from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows acceptable reliability (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or social desirability. See also Connectedness to nature scale.|$|E
2500|$|The Nature Relatedness {{measure is}} a 21-item scale that {{measures}} how connected to nature participants feel at a trait level. Participants indicate their agreement with each statement using a <b>Likert</b> <b>scale.</b> There are 3 subscales to this measure; NR- self, NR- perspective, and NR- experience. NR-self measures how much individuals identify with nature (e.g., “I feel very connected to {{all living things}} and the earth”), NR-perspective measures how concerned individuals may feel {{about the effect of}} human actions on the environment (e.g., “Humans have the right to use natural resources any way we want”), and NR- Experience measures how comfortable individuals are in nature and their desire to be involved with nature (e.g., “I enjoy being outdoors, even in unpleasant weather”). This scale shows good reliability, alpha = [...]87 and test-retest stability six months later, alpha = [...]85. There is also a brief Nature Relatedness Scale made up of 6 items from the original 21 items. The purpose of this scale is to measure how connected an individual feels to nature but in a shorter way. This scale shows good reliability, alpha = [...]87 and test-retest stability six months later, alpha = [...]88.|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} types of {{response}} scales {{identified in the}} literature included: VAS, VRS with or without numerical anchors, NRS, {{and to a lesser}} extent graphical scales such as the Faces Scale. Several less commonly used scales were also identified, such as <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> and Binary scales.|$|R
30|$|Fourth, {{in order}} to ensure {{consistency}} with the existing literature, 7 -point <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> were used to measure all three dimensions of thought. While this simplifies the process and allows participants to make quick and intuitive decisions, <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> have the disadvantage of being unmoored from common reference points. Put simply, even with verbal anchors, there is no objective meaning of a 4 out of 7 on the scale; as a result, each rating may mean something entirely different to each participant. Once again, we attempted to mitigate this by providing participants with extensive instructions. These instructions even included prompting participants to come up with their own examples of different levels of freely moving thought, ensuring that their ideas were as close as possible both to their cohort’s perceptions and to the experimenters’ expectations.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the approach, {{a number}} of {{different}} methods are used in experimental aesthetics, such as pairwise comparisons, rank order methods, <b>Likert</b> <b>scales</b> and semantic differentials, production methods, statistical comparisons of groups, reaction time measurements, and also more complex methods such as eye tracking, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging.|$|R
