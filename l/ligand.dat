5|$|To {{determine}} the equilibrium constant for this reaction, {{in which the}} <b>ligand</b> loses a proton, the pKa of the protonated <b>ligand</b> must be known. In practice, the <b>ligand</b> may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− can accept four protons; in that case, all pKa values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the pK values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known.|$|E
50|$|Compounds with disphenoidal {{geometry}} (See-Saw Geometry) {{have two}} types of <b>ligands,</b> one pair related by 180° often called axial <b>ligands.</b> A separate pair of <b>ligands</b> is situated orthogonal to the axial <b>ligands.</b> Typically the bond distance to the apical <b>ligands</b> is longer than to the equatorial <b>ligands.</b> The angle between the axial <b>ligands</b> and the equatorial <b>ligands</b> is 90°; whereas the angle between the two equatorial <b>ligands</b> themselves is 120°.|$|R
25|$|Bivalent <b>ligands</b> {{consist of}} two drug-like {{molecules}} (pharmacophores or <b>ligands)</b> connected by an inert linker. There are {{various kinds of}} bivalent <b>ligands</b> and are often classified {{based on what the}} pharmacophores target. Homobivalent <b>ligands</b> target two of the same receptor types. Heterobivalent <b>ligands</b> target two different receptor types. Bitopic <b>ligands</b> target an orthosteric binding sites and allosteric binding sites on the same receptor.|$|R

5|$|Many <b>ligand</b> {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their <b>ligand</b> is present in high concentrations, but must also release the <b>ligand</b> when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E

Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen donor-containing {{compounds}} {{have been}} shown great potentials as <b>ligands</b> to construct highly active non-phosphine organometallic catalysts because nitrogen donor-containing organometallic complexes usually exhibit good stability to oxygen and moisture, and are usually more reactive than transition metal complexes of phosphine <b>ligands.</b> Pyridyl-supported N-heterocyclic <b>ligands</b> such as pyridyl&# 61485;bispyrazolyl (pseudo N 3) <b>ligands,</b> 1, 2 pyrazolyl&# 61485;pyridyl&# 61485;N-heterocyclic carbene (NNC) <b>ligands,</b> 3 pyridyl-supported oxazolinyl&# 61485;N-heterocyclic carbene (NNC) <b>ligands</b> and other mixed nitrogen donor (NNN) <b>ligands</b> are explored in our laboratories.

5|$|Although calcium is in {{the same}} group as {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts.

Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability.

Metal complexes of 3 -pyridyldiphenylphosphine, 6, 6 '-bis(methylthiomorpholine) - 2, 2 '-bipyridine and 4, 4 '-dimethyl- 6, 6 '-bis(methylthiomorpholine) - 2, 2 '-bipyridine were prepared. <b>Ligands</b> and complexes were characterized by 1 H-, 13 C-, 31 P- and two-dimensional HSQC-NMR spectroscopy, and crystal structures were determined for the <b>ligands</b> and two of the metal complexes.

5|$|Organostrontium {{compounds}} contain {{one or more}} strontium–carbon bonds. They {{have been}} reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions. Although strontium {{is in the same}} group as magnesium, and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118pm; Eu2+ 117pm; Sm2+ 122pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, strontium dicyclopentadienyl, Sr(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 <b>ligand</b> with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 <b>ligand</b> on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E

The melanocytes present in the reticular dermis were negative for NKp 46 <b>ligands</b> in common nevi; in malignant melanocytic lesions, the deeper melanocytes were focally positive. In dermoepidermal junction of all melanocytic lesions, the melanocytes showed enhanced expression of NKp 46 <b>ligands.</b> Melanophages in all lesions were consistently positive for NKp 46 <b>ligands.</b> These observations establish the expression of NKp 46 <b>ligands</b> by primary-transformed melanocytes. Normal melanocytes did not express <b>ligands</b> to NKp 46.
