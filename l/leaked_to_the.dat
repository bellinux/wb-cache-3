5|$|Diefenbaker was {{initially}} inclined {{to go along}} with Kennedy's request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961, letter from Kennedy which urged this was <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The Prime Minister was also influenced by a massive demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill. Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.|$|E
5|$|During filming, Bale became {{angry with}} {{director}} of photography Shane Hurlbut for walking onto a set during a scene; he swore and screamed at Hurlbut {{and threatened to}} leave the film. Audio of Bale's tirade <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public and went viral. Bale apologized publicly and said he resolved his differences with Hurlbut, explaining that he sometimes {{has a problem with}} someone walking on set, and that when the incident took place they continued to work together for a number of hours that day.|$|E
25|$|After Felt {{admitted}} in the May 2005 Vanity Fair article {{that he lied}} <b>to</b> Gray about <b>leaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, Gray claimed that Felt's bitterness at being passed over {{was the cause of}} his decision <b>to</b> <b>leak</b> <b>to</b> Time, <b>The</b> Washington Post, and others.|$|R

5|$|In 1956, Radford {{proposed}} protecting several military {{programs from}} funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but {{the proposal was}} <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other Joint Chiefs of Staff again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|Lowell Reese, of Kentucky Roll Call, {{reported}} on September 28, 2015, that the Comer campaign had <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Herald-Leader emails {{showing that the}} husband of Crosbie had {{been in contact with}} the blogger. By doing so, the campaign was able to deny the allegations of abuse that had circulated for months in Frankfort, the state capital, and put Heiner's campaign on the defensive.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 1858, Brown held {{a meeting}} in Chatham, Ontario, where he {{unveiled}} his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When word of the plan was <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him in this effort, and with more detailed plans for the assault.|$|E
50|$|A third {{test method}} to {{determine}} if ductwork is <b>leaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside is <b>to</b> use a pressure pan, which is a register cover with a pressure tap for a hose connection. With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure pan {{by means of a}} hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected <b>to</b> or <b>leaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are <b>leaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.|$|R

5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E
5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E
5|$|Copies were <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press via a Dutch {{news agency}} during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed {{the tape to}} be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
50|$|The FBI's bureaucracy, and Pickard in particular, {{has been}} implicated as an {{opponent}} of FBI agent John P. O'Neill. Among other disruptions of O'Neill's career was a <b>leak</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> New York Times; in the PBS Frontline documentary The Man Who Knew. O'Neill's significant other said O'Neill suspected Pickard might have <b>leaked</b> information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Times, but when confronted Pickard assured O'Neill that he had not. The Times story {{was seen as a}} final signal by O'Neill that he should leave the FBI.|$|R
25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the output circuit, and its harmonics were <b>leaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a blocking capacitor and a controlling potentiometer between {{the output of the}} preamplifier and the earth, and shunted the preamplifier when triggered. In this scheme, the control signal did not <b>leak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> output. Modulation depth was regulated by a low-impedance potentiometer placed on the front panel. The potentiometer significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus <b>the</b> preamplifier had <b>to</b> have reserves by amplification.|$|R
25|$|According to WAJ, only 65% of the {{population}} are connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sewerage system. The rest of those having access to improved sanitation uses on-site sanitation solutions such as septic tanks.

5|$|Daniels and Schur {{first started}} writing the script {{in the summer}} of 2008, when they were {{in the early stages of}} conceiving the series. Like the rest of the series, the pilot was filmed in the same mockumentary style as The Office, the NBC comedy series also {{directed}} by Daniels. About one month before the pilot aired, a focus group report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was not ready for prime-time television. The pilot episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{a casting}} call sheet <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Internet {{revealed}} that Cobra Commander {{would appear in}} the sequel, though it was unknown who would play the character. Chu said that fans would {{get a glimpse of}} Destro in the film, but Christopher Eccleston would not reprise his role in the sequel. On May 1, 2012, it was confirmed by Jon Chu that G.I. Joe: Retaliations Cobra Commander is Rex Lewis, the same character that Joseph Gordon-Levitt played in The Rise of Cobra. Actor Robert Baker confirmed that he is the voice of Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|NIS {{investigators}} {{tried to}} prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt {{had had a}} homosexual relationship {{with each other and}} that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media. The leaks were later said to have come from the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 January 1963, unaware that their battle plans had been <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enemy, the South Vietnamese Civil Guards spearheaded the attack by marching toward Ap Tan Thoi from the south. However, {{when they reached the}} hamlet of Ap Bac, {{southeast}} of Ap Tan Thoi, they were immediately pinned down by elements of the Viet Cong 261st Battalion. Shortly afterwards, three companies of the 11th Infantry Regiment were committed into battle in northern Ap Tan Thoi, but they too could not overcome the NLF soldiers who had entrenched themselves in the area. Just before midday, further reinforcements were flown in from Tan Hiep. The 15 US helicopters ferrying the troops were riddled by NLF gunfire and five helicopters were lost as a result.|$|E
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, {{had no interest in}} dying {{for the sake of the}} Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavated}} hoard {{was taken}} to the British Museum. The discovery was <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, and on 19 November, the Sun newspaper ran a front-page story, alongside a picture of Lawes with his metal detector. Although the full contents of the hoard and its value were still unknown, the newspaper article claimed that the hoard was worth £10 million. In response to the unexpected publicity, the British Museum held a press conference at the museum on 20 November to announce the discovery. Newspapers lost interest in the hoard quickly, allowing British Museum curators to sort, clean and stabilize the hoard without further disruption from the press. The initial cleaning and basic conservation of the hoard was completed within a month of its discovery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legal status}} of WikiLeaks is complex. Assange {{considers}} WikiLeaks a protection intermediary. Rather than <b>leaking</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, and fearing exposure and retribution, whistleblowers can <b>leak</b> <b>to</b> WikiLeaks, which then <b>leaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press for them. Its servers are located throughout Europe and are accessible from any uncensored web connection. The group located its headquarters in Sweden because it {{has one of the}} world's strongest laws to protect confidential source-journalist relationships. WikiLeaks has stated it does not solicit any information. However, Assange used his speech during the Hack In The Box conference in Malaysia <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> crowd of hackers and security researchers to help find documents on its [...] "Most Wanted Leaks of 2009" [...] list.|$|R
50|$|Elected as vice {{president}} was Sam Church, a former Boyle supporter and local president who became a field representative and then international representative in the Miller administration. When Church punched a former UMWA staffer {{in a dispute over}} a <b>leak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, Miller asked Church to be his running-mate.|$|R
50|$|A tar pit, or more {{accurately}} an asphalt pit or asphalt lake, {{is the result}} of a type of petroleum seep where subterranean bitumen <b>leaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, creating a large area of natural asphalt. This happens because, after the material reaches the surface, its lighter components vaporize, leaving only the thick asphalt.|$|R
5|$|When Rommel {{was seriously}} wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry {{undertook}} efforts {{to conceal the}} injury {{so as not to}} undermine domestic morale. Despite this, the news <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at a press conference held on 1 August. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have <b>leaked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media and alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers {{would have been difficult}} {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
50|$|On 21 December 2006, Yahoo Sports {{reported}} {{that one of}} Conte's initial defense lawyers, Troy Ellerman, had been targeted by the FBI as a possible source of <b>leaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media during the Barry Bonds probe.
