5|$|Algebraic K-theory {{is related}} to the group of {{invertible}} matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> isomorphism K1(F) = F. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) agrees with K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.|$|E

5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Confusion is a one-song Afrobeat {{album that}} begins with an entirely {{instrumental}} first half, which features free form interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer Tony Allen. It <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extended mid-tempo section with Allen's polyrhythms and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers call-and-response vocal passages. In reviews since the record's release by EMI, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, Confusion was reissued and bundled with Kuti's 1973 Gentleman album.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{increase in}} mobility {{and availability of}} uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, {{it is difficult to}} precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N.

This <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> atomic weight of around 14.007u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N {{is one of the}} five stable odd–odd nuclides (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.|$|E

5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz {{variation}} 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates on}} the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material advantage of a pawn {{at the cost of}} a weakening of the white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
