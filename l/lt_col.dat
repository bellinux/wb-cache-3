5|$|The battle {{began on}} the morning of July 8 with Rogers' Rangers and light {{infantry}} from Colonel Thomas Gage's 80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot pushing the few remaining French scouts behind the entrenchments. They were followed by provincials from New York and Massachusetts, and then three columns of regulars, who made their way through the provincial formations to begin the attack. The 27th and 60th made up the right column, under the command of the 27th's <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> William Haviland, the 44th and 55th under <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> John Donaldson made the center, and the 42nd and 46th under the 42nd's <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Francis Grant formed the left column. Each column was preceded by the regimental light infantry companies. Held in reserve were provincial regiments from Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Anthony R. Giannangeli, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|In 1755, nearby Fort Beausejour was {{captured}} by English forces {{under the command of}} <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Robert Monckton. The Beaubassin region including the Memramcook and Petitcodiac river valleys subsequently fell under English control.|$|E
5|$|Operation Skyburner: On 22 November 1961, a {{modified}} Phantom with water injection piloted by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Robert B. Robinson, set an absolute world record average speed over a 20-mile (32.2km) long 2-way straight course of 1,606.342mph (2,585.086km/h).|$|E
5|$|As of April 2017, {{the wing}} {{commander}} of the CTWG is Col James Ridley, Sr. The vice commander position is held by <b>Lt</b> <b>Col</b> Rob Roy. The chief of staff is <b>Lt</b> <b>Col</b> Matt Valleau. The vice commander is responsible for coordinating the wing echelon with the subordinate units, specifically the squadrons. The vice commander is also an assistant of the wing commander, serving as the coordinator of various special projects. The chief of staff {{is responsible for the}} staff members located at wing headquarters, who are independent of the individual squadrons. Finally, the wing commander is responsible for connecting the two groups and ensuring that the chief of staff uses the wing staff members to benefit the squadrons who receive these benefits through the vice commander.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Dunnington {{continued}} {{to build up}} his works at Little Rock until November 1862, when Captain Sanford C. Faulkner (composer of The Arkansas Traveler) was placed {{in charge of the}} Arsenal. Dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the Ponchartrain.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1818, the 52nd were {{stationed}} in the Midlands, where they were responsible for domestic peacekeeping and policing {{under the command of}} <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Charles Rowan, experience which fitted Rowan for his 1829 posting to establish a military-style metropolitan police service under Sir Robert Peel.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Doolan Downing is commemorated {{on panel}} 17 of the New Zealand Memorial to the Missing on Chunuk Bair, {{along with his}} commanding-officer, <b>Lt</b> <b>Col</b> William George Malone, who died aged 56, and more than 300 other men of his battalion.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} news footage from 1977, showing the {{discovery}} of water on Mars and a face sculpted into the planet's landscape. <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Marcus Aurelius Belt (Ed Lauter), {{the commander of the}} mission, is plagued by flashbacks of an encounter with the disembodied face during a spacewalk.|$|E
5|$|As late as 3–7 December 1939, when <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Langer and French Air Force Capt. Henri Braquenié visited London and Bletchley Park, the British {{asked that}} the Polish cryptologists be made {{available}} to them in Britain. Langer, however, took the position that they must remain where the Polish Army in exile was forming—on French soil.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Longstreet met {{his future}} first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. She was the {{daughter}} of Longstreet's commander, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Garland. Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet never once mentioned Louise in his memoirs, and there are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship come through the writings of Longstreet's second wife, Helen Dortch Longstreet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Clifford Sheldon, DSO, was joint {{managing}} {{and senior}} director of Reeds, the paper manufacturer, and was connected with that firm and its associated companies from 1911 {{until his death in}} 1950 at the age of 62 years. He gave his name to the Clifford Sheldon Club House, a converted oast house, which subsequently became the Manor and Greenside Oast.|$|E
5|$|The first {{episodes of}} season 9 show Mitchell's {{struggle}} to reunite the former SG-1 members under his command. With {{the aid of}} <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Samantha Carter, Dr. Daniel Jackson, the Jaffa Teal'c, and the alien thief Vala Mal Doran, Mitchell attempts to stop the Ori threat to the Milky Way galaxy during the series' run. Mitchell is an experienced fighter pilot and is often involved in close combat.|$|E
5|$|When Lounsberry {{learned that}} a {{military}} column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> George Armstrong Custer) would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory, he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage. However, {{at the last minute}} Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place. Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, the 21st took up camp in {{the former}} Confederate fort, {{remaining}} there for nearly a month. During that time, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Maggi, determined to make the 21st as disciplined as a regiment of Regulars, enforced stern standards for drill and dress parades. After the near mutiny of one company, Maggi submitted his resignation. Maj. William S. Clark, a professor of chemistry at Amherst College, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on February 28, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> George Armstrong Custer's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at {{the failure of the}} Peace Policy. Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his failure}} at Fredericksburg, Burnside was reassigned to the Department of the Ohio. The IX Corps, {{which he had}} {{formerly}} commanded, was reassigned with him. The 21st Massachusetts boarded trains for Cincinnati on March 28, 1863. They were then transported to Mount Sterling, Kentucky, to combat Confederate guerrillas. In April, due to the reduced numbers of the regiment (now about 200) several officers, being effectively without commands, chose to resign their commissions, including Col. William S. Clark. Command of the regiment passed to <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> George P. Hawkes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lt</b> <b>Col</b> Newman {{aboard the}} MGB {{need not have}} landed, but {{he was one of}} the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion {{was able}} to hold Ain Ghasin until the afternoon, when it retreated to Nefisha. As for the reconstituted 85th Battalion, it was ordered to occupy Jebel Mariam, Heneidac and Touscan. The battalion's commander, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Monsif, found during a {{reconnaissance}} that Touscan was surrounded by large Israeli forces and under heavy fire, and so limited his battalion's defenses to Jebel Mariam and Heneidac only, occupying the former with the battalion's main forces, including two companies of paratroopers, and placing a single company at Heneidac.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1937, the 2nd Bombardment Group, now {{commanded}} by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Robert Olds, received {{the first of}} the newly developed B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, with 12 delivered during {{the spring and summer of}} 1937. Designated the YB-17 because of its prototype status, the Flying Fortress was the first multi-engine long-range bomber acquired by the Air Corps, despite resistance from the Army General Staff over its necessity, and the centerpiece of the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force).|$|E
5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements. Meade had sent {{virtually all of}} his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Freeman McGilvery.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} post {{was established}} on Key Biscayne in March 1838. Its first commander was <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> James Bankhead. The fort was initially known as Fort Dallas or Fort Bankhead, {{but it was}} eventually renamed Fort Russell for Captain Samuel L. Russell. He was killed when the Seminoles ambushed two boats on the Miami River in February 1839. In the summer of 1839, a total of 143 soldiers and sailors were stationed at Fort Russell. Some of the Seminoles captured during the war were held at Fort Russell until they could be placed on ships to be removed to Indian Territory.|$|E
5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement {{of gold in}} the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|British <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Iceal Hambleton had 29 {{years of}} {{military}} service. He {{had served in}} the Army Air Force as a radio operator during World War II, though not in combat. After World War II, he was recalled to active service by the USAF in the early 1950s. During the Korean War he flew 43 combat missions as a navigator in a B-29 bomber. He then worked during the 1960s on various USAF ballistic missile projects including the PGM-19 Jupiter, Titan I ICBM and Titan II ICBM. He had been the deputy chief of operations for the USAF Strategic Air Command 390th Strategic Missile Wing before the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1972, the Easter Offensive, {{the largest}} {{combined}} arms {{operation of the}} entire Vietnam War, was in its third day. An early morning flight of two United States Air Force EB-66 aircraft was led by Bat 20, piloted by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Robert Singletary. Hambleton was a navigator aboard Bat 21. The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence, including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile and Hambleton was the only survivor, parachuting behind the front lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} {{of the first half of}} 1876, Sitting Bull's camp {{continually}} expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani commandos {{raided the}} outer {{perimeter}} of the compound, blasting holes through {{the walls of the}} mosque to allow trapped women and children to escape. The assaults began shortly after 1:00am (20:00GMT) on 7 July and were met with heavy armed resistance. SSG Commander <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Haroon-ul-Islam, who had been leading the operation, was wounded on 6 July and died in the hospital two days later. However, the commandos succeeded, and the boundary wall of Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa collapsed. Abdul Rashid Ghazi said they would not surrender and that they had sufficient ammunition and rations to last a month.|$|E
5|$|USMC Col. Al Gray {{suggested}} a covert, land-based rescue operation. and <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Andy Anderson, Commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC, MACVSOG-80) ordered a ground rescue. In Saigon, Navy SEAL Lt. Thomas R. Norris, {{one of just}} three SEAL officers and nine enlisted men remaining in Vietnam, had just completed an assignment in the Mekong Delta. He was waiting for orders when the call came in for a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Although Dutch forces {{conquered the}} {{towns and cities}} in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside. Republican troops and militia led by Lt. Colonel (later President) Suharto {{attacked}} Dutch positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon. Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as Serangan Oemoem (new spelling: Serangan Umum '1 March General Offensive'), is commemorated by a large monument in Yogyakarta. A similar attack against Dutch troops in Surakarta was led by <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Slamet Riyadi on 7 August the same year.|$|E
5|$|Following Tipu's fall, {{a part of}} {{the kingdom}} of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The {{remaining}} territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old scion of the Wodeyar family, Krishnaraja III, was installed on the throne with chief minister (Diwan) Purnaiah, who had earlier served under Tipu, handling the reins as regent and <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Barry Close taking charge as the British Resident. The British then took control of Mysore's foreign policy and also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore. As Diwan, Purnaiah distinguished himself with his progressive and innovative administration until he retired from service in 1811 (and died shortly thereafter) following the 16th birthday of the boy king.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the Union line, three regiments of Cutler's brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before they could get into {{position}} on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped {{the right of}} Cutler's, making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered Cutler's regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, <b>Lt.</b> <b>Col.</b> Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. Cutler's 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men. Some of Davis's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge. This defocused the Confederate effort north of the pike.|$|E
