50|$|The Lever lock {{door handle}} on a {{backplate}} is {{another type of}} door handle which operates similarly to the <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> door handle. This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the <b>lever</b> <b>latch,</b> the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of door handle is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} and basic type of door handle is the <b>Lever</b> <b>latch</b> door handle on a {{backplate}} found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle has a latch {{which is used to}} keep the door shut. The door handle features only a lever handle which operates this latch. When the handle is pushed down, the spindle rotates which “passes through the door and the tubular latch inside the door allowing the door to be opened”. This type of door handle is normally found on doors leading into the living and dining rooms as they don’t require any type of locking. The <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> handle is also easy to install and use and is available in a variety of styles and finishes.|$|E
5000|$|ETRS: A {{modification}} introduced July 1982, ETRS {{production discontinued}} September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens release sliding <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> located to {{left side of}} camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly {{referred to as the}} [...] "plastic" [...] body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate.|$|E
50|$|The Third Model Dragoon numbers {{stand at}} ten-thousand from 1851 through 1860. This design had more {{variations}} {{as compared to}} its earlier counterparts. Some of the third model Colt Dragoon Revolvers had frame cuts for detachable shoulder stocks, horizontal loading <b>lever</b> <b>latches</b> and folding leaf sights. Third Colt Dragoon Revolvers had a round trigger guard. Government records showed an order for 8,390 Dragoons.|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} {{portion of}} the action features integrally milled bases to facilitate accurate and stable scope mount installation. The streamlined bolt sleeves contain a locking bar mechanism to prevent accidental rotation when the bolt {{is removed from the}} receiver. DuBiel rifles were balanced for handling ease - the result of “total concept design”. Distinctive <b>lever</b> <b>latches</b> complement the floor plates (button releases were optional). DuBiel stock designs closely parallel the bore axis to reduce the effect of recoil.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the Swiss factory Henke {{introduced}} the buckle boot, using over-center <b>levered</b> <b>latches</b> patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across {{a number of}} eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering {{the front of the}} boot.|$|R
50|$|The Dragoon was {{produced}} {{because of the}} problems seen with the fielded Colt Walker revolvers, namely, the Walker's large size, {{four and a half}} pounds, making it suitable only for use as a saddle-mounted revolver, the Walker's propensity for cylinders exploding on occasion when fired (due to the chambers being loaded with too much powder), and the Walker's habit of dropping the loading lever upon discharge, locking up the revolver action in the middle of combat. The Colt Dragoon Revolver had a comparatively shorter cylinder (thus preventing overloading the cylinder) and held up to 50 grains of powder, whereas the Walker had used up to 60 grains of powder. The Dragoon Revolver had a shorter barrel at 7.5 inches (some later revolvers 8 inches) as compared to the 9 in barrel on the Walker. A loading <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> in front of the lever replaced the spring to keep the lever from dropping during recoil, thereby preventing jamming of the revolver. These variations made the Colt Dragoon Revolver 4 pounds two ounces. These changes also reduced the risks of the Colt Dragoon Revolver from exploding when fired, unlike the risk that had been demonstrated with the Walker revolvers.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} {{also features}} special metallic <b>levers</b> or <b>latches</b> under each course called mandals. These small levers, {{which can be}} raised or lowered quickly by the performer while the instrument is being played, serve to slightly change the pitch of a particular course by altering effective string lengths.|$|R
5000|$|Some calculators {{that had}} been {{serviced}} had dials that were mispositioned by (probably) 3.6 degrees; the gears weren't quite meshed correctly when reassembled.The calculator was very complicated compared to, for example the Friden STW, a machine notable for its relative internal simplicity. Much of the Marchant's control mechanism was beneath the keys, and had about 25 [...] "layers" [...] of <b>levers,</b> linkages, <b>latches,</b> and such. It had three driveshafts, extending across the mechanism. Most other calculators had only one.|$|R
50|$|A CPU socket {{is made of}} plastic, {{and comes}} with a <b>lever</b> or <b>latch,</b> and with metal {{contacts}} {{for each of the}} pins or lands on the CPU. Many packages are keyed to ensure the proper insertion of the CPU. CPUs with a PGA (pin grid array) package are inserted into the socket and the latch is closed. CPUs with an LGA package are inserted into the socket, the latch plate is flipped into position atop the CPU, and the lever is lowered and locked into place, pressing the CPU's contacts firmly against the socket's lands and ensuring a good connection, as well as increased mechanical stability.|$|R
50|$|When {{the correct}} key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a <b>lever,</b> {{activating}} a <b>latch</b> or sliding bolt, {{or it may}} itself push against the latch or bolt. In a double acting lever lock, the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.|$|R
40|$|A fluid {{connector}} {{system is}} disclosed {{which includes a}} modified plumbing union having a rotatable member for drawing said union into a fluid tight condition. A drive tool is electric motor actuated and includes a reduction gear train providing an output gear engaging an integral peripheral spur gear on the rotatable member. Coaxial alignment means are attached to both the connector assembly and the drive tool. A hand <b>lever</b> actuated <b>latching</b> system includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced latching balls selectively wedged against the alignment means attached to the connector assembly or to secure the drive tool with its output gear in mesh with the integral peripheral spur gear. The drive motor is torque, speed, and direction controllable...|$|R
50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The <b>lever</b> then would <b>latch</b> in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to disengage the safety.|$|R
