25|$|A common {{reaction}} between coordination complexes involving ligands are {{inner and}} outer sphere electron transfers. They are two different mechanisms of electron transfer redox reactions, largely defined by the late Henry Taube. In an inner sphere reaction, a ligand with two <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pairs acts as a bridging ligand, a ligand to which both coordination centres can bond. Through this, electrons are transferred from one centre to another.|$|E
25|$|The ions or {{molecules}} {{surrounding the}} central atom are called ligands. Ligands are generally {{bound to the}} central atom by a coordinate covalent bond (donating electrons from a <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pair into an empty metal orbital), and {{are said to be}} coordinated to the atom. There are also organic ligands such as alkenes whose pi bonds can coordinate to empty metal orbitals. An example is ethene in the complex known as Zeise's salt, K+−.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E

25|$|The ammonia {{molecule}} has a trigonal pyramidal {{shape as}} {{predicted by the}} valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one {{lone pair of electrons}}. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pair, which makes ammonia a base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form hydrogen bonds, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are protonated. Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of NH4+. The latter has the shape of a regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike ozone, O3, {{the ground}} {{electronic}} state of nitrogen dioxide is a doublet state, since nitrogen has one unpaired electron, which decreases the alpha effect compared with nitrite {{and creates a}} weak bonding interaction with the oxygen lone pairs. The <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> in [...] also means that this compound is a free radical, so the formula for nitrogen dioxide is often written as •.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tetrahedron}} {{shape is}} seen in nature in covalently bonded molecules. All sp3-hybridized atoms are surrounded by atoms (or <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pairs) at {{the four corners of}} a tetrahedron. For instance in a methane molecule (...) or an ammonium ion (...) , four hydrogen atoms surround a central carbon or nitrogen atom with tetrahedral symmetry. For this reason, one of the leading journals in organic chemistry is called Tetrahedron. The central angle between any two vertices of a perfect tetrahedron is arccos(−), or approximately 109.47°.|$|E
50|$|The radical-pair is {{characterized}} as triplet or singlet by the coupled spin {{state of the}} two <b>lone</b> <b>electrons.</b> The spin relationship is such that the two unpaired electrons, one in each radical molecule, may have opposite spin (singlet; anticorrelated), or the same spin (triplet; correlated). The singlet state is called such because {{there is only one}} way for the electrons’ spins to anticorrelate (S), whereas the triplet state is called such because the electron’s spin may be correlated in three different fashions (T+1, T0,T−1).|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrogen}} fluoride, HF, molecule is polar {{by virtue}} of polar covalent bondsin the covalent bond electrons are displaced toward the more electronegative fluorine atom. Ammonia, NH3, molecule the three N−H bonds have only a slight polarity (toward the more electronegative nitrogen atom). The molecule has two <b>lone</b> <b>electrons</b> in an orbital, that points towards the fourth apex of the approximate tetrahedron, (VSEPR). This orbital is not participating in covalent bonding; it is electron-rich, which results in a powerful dipole across the whole ammonia molecule.|$|R
50|$|When {{electrodes}} {{are placed}} in an electrolyte and a voltage is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. <b>Lone</b> <b>electrons</b> normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the cathode, providing electrons to the electrolyte. Another reaction occurs at the anode, consuming electrons from the electrolyte. As a result, a negative charge cloud develops in the electrolyte around the cathode, and a positive charge develops around the anode. The ions in the electrolyte neutralize these charges, enabling the electrons to keep flowing and the reactions to continue.|$|R
2500|$|Complexes {{that have}} {{unfilled}} or half-filled orbitals often show {{the capability to}} react with substrates. [...] Most substrates have a singlet ground-state; that is, they have <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pairs (e.g., water, amines, ethers), so these substrates need an empty orbital {{to be able to}} react with a metal centre. [...] Some substrates (e.g., molecular oxygen) have a triplet ground state, which results that metals with half-filled orbitals have a tendency to react with such substrates (it must be said that the dioxygen molecule also has lone pairs, so it is also capable to react as a 'normal' Lewis base).|$|E

The <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these <b>lone</b> <b>electron</b> pairs. Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium (...) > secondary ammonium (...) > tertiary ammonium (R3NH+). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as aniline, have their lone pair electrons conjugated into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.|$|E

Unusual behavior of this phase have been determined by study of separation mechanism of polar and nonpolar analytes, in comparison of their separation on polar and nonpolar phases. This behavior is due to medium polarity of the phase (system constant s), which is not so pronounced to cancel separation of nonpolar analytes due to induction forces.
