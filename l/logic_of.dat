5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> abolitionism {{to the cause}} of women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E
40|$|Formal {{frameworks}} for the specification of autonomous agents are commonly based on <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> intention and belief. Desirable properties for <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> intention are particularly non-standard, {{even more so}} than for <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> belief. In this paper, we address problems with existing <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> intention and belief by shifting to a non-classical semantics, making use of Rantala's impossible, or non-normal, worlds. Our framework invalidates the problematic properties of intention and, by imposing certain constraints on the algebraic structure of the models, we show that that many desirable properties can be obtained. The non-normal worlds framework provides a fine-grained semantics and proves to be an extremely powerful and flexible tool for the logical specification of rational agent behaviour. 1. Introduction <b>Logics</b> <b>of</b> Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) have recently received much attention in the AI literature on the design of autonomous intelligent agents (e. g. [2, 3, 6]).

In this paper we present a translation from temporal <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> knowledge into the monodic fragment <b>of</b> first-order temporal <b>logic</b> in order to use an existent implementation of a theorem-prover for mondic first-order temporal logic called TeMP.

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} the <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices {{and lead to}} an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also {{lead to an increase}} in poaching.|$|E
5|$|The 8 {{compartment}} Bühlmann - based UWATEC ZH-L8 ADT MB PMG decompression {{model in}} the Scubapro Galileo dive computer processes the dive profile and suggests an intermediate 2-minute stop that {{is a function of}} the tissue nitrogen loading at that time, taking into account the accumulated nitrogen from previous dives. Within the Haldanian <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> the model, at least three compartments are offgassing at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.|$|E
