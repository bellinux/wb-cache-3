500|$|The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are {{singled out}} by Cox as among the finest {{of this part of}} Wood's career. Among those {{conducting}} their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, [...] "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: [...] "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall <b>last</b> <b>Tuesday</b> permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." [...] However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: [...] "I must say {{it was the first time}} since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands." ...|$|E
