25|$|Following this announcement, {{there was}} {{widespread}} condemnation of CompuServe and Unisys, and many software developers threatened {{to stop using}} GIF. The PNG format (see below) was developed in 1995 as an intended replacement. However, obtaining support from the makers of Web browsers and other software for the PNG format proved difficult {{and it was not}} possible to replace GIF, although PNG has gradually increased in popularity. Therefore, GIF variations without <b>LZW</b> <b>compression</b> were developed. For instance the libungif library, based on Eric S. Raymond's giflib, allows creation of GIFs that followed the data format but avoided the compression features, thus avoiding use of the Unisys LZW patent. A 2001 Dr. Dobbs article described another alternative to <b>LZW</b> <b>compression,</b> based on square roots.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new <b>LZW</b> data <b>compression</b> algorithm that partitions conventional single large dictionary into a dictionary set {{that consists of}} several small address space dictionaries. As doing so the dictionary set not only has small lookup time but also can operate in parallel. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm has better compression ratio for image data than conventional LZW algorithm and DLZW (dynamic LZW) algorithm, has competitive performance for text data with DLZW algorithm. In addition, a parallel VLSI architecture for implementing the new algorithm is proposed, and it is realized using FPGA XC 4 VLX 15 - 10. The experiment results show that the chip can yield a compression rate of 198. 4 Mbytes/s, it is about 6. 9 times the compression rate of implementing conventional LZW, and 3. 2 times the compression rate of implementing DLZW.

25|$|The {{motivation}} {{for creating the}} PNG format was in early 1995, after it became known that the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (<b>LZW)</b> data <b>compression</b> algorithm used in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format was patented by Unisys. There were also other problems with the GIF format that made a replacement desirable, notably its limit of 256 colors {{at a time when}} computers able to display far more than 256 colors were becoming common.|$|R
25|$|Portable Network Graphics (PNG) was {{designed}} as a replacement for GIF in order to avoid infringement of Unisys' patent on the <b>LZW</b> <b>compression</b> technique. PNG offers better compression and more features than GIF, animation being the only significant exception. PNG is more suitable than GIF in instances where true-color imaging and alpha transparency are required.|$|E
25|$|The GIF {{encoding}} {{process can}} be modified to create a file without <b>LZW</b> <b>compression</b> that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally {{as a way to}} avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of LZW led CompuServe to choose {{it as the}} compression technique for their version of GIF, developed in 1987. At the time, CompuServe {{was not aware of}} the patent. Unisys became aware that the version of GIF used the <b>LZW</b> <b>compression</b> technique and entered into licensing negotiations with CompuServe in January 1993. The subsequent agreement was announced on 24 December 1994. Unisys stated that they expected all major commercial on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate, but that they would not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line services.|$|E
25|$|CompuServe {{introduced}} GIF on June 15, 1987 {{to provide}} a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier run-length encoding (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used <b>LZW</b> data <b>compression,</b> which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as PCX and MacPaint used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow modems.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} general-purpose, {{lossless}} compression algorithm used with TIFF is Lempel–Ziv–Welch (<b>LZW).</b> This <b>compression</b> technique, {{also used in}} GIF, was covered by patents until 2003. TIFF also supports the compression algorithm PNG uses (i.e. Compression Tag 000816 'Adobe-style') with medium usage and support by applications. TIFF also offers special-purpose lossless compression algorithms like CCITT Group IV, which can compress bilevel images (e.g., faxes or black-and-white text) better than PNG's compression algorithm.|$|R

50|$|GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is {{in normal}} use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is {{technically}} possible). GIF is {{most suitable for}} storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses <b>LZW</b> lossless <b>compression,</b> which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or dithered images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.|$|R

40|$|The sensor nodes are {{typically}} resource deficient with energy {{being the most}} critical of all the resources. There are usually several security requirements to protect a sensor network. These requirements should be considered during design of a security protocol, including confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. An effective security protocol should provide services to meet these requirements. In addition to this, sensor devices have critical resource constraints such as memory size and reliability. So a simple but versatile compression technique is necessary for data compression, before the encryption process. Here the compression technique which is utilized is <b>LZW</b> (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) <b>compression</b> and HIGHT algorithm for encryption.

While this storage approach is efficient for structured and fixed length data, this does not hold for the more unstructured and variable sized data that is seen today. To combat storage inefficiency and store variable sized data with minimal wasted space, each page is composed of cells of a variable size that are packed tightly together; the column store architecture supports a variable number of cells per page and various page formats within a column. SAP IQ also applies Lempel-Ziv-Welch ( [...] <b>LZW</b> [...] ) <b>compression</b> algorithms to each data page {{when it is written}} to disk, to significantly reduce data volume.|$|R

The stability and computational complexity problems are solved by introducing new selection and update rules working entirely in the integer domain. Image decomposition is randomized in several ways thus improving the stego-message undetectability, and making the hidden message undetectable by targeted steganalyzers. A refinement decomposition step {{is applied to the}} three color bands to increase the stego-message payload. Due to the ever-increasing security threats, {{there is a need to}} develop algorithms with more complexity and advanced features for a secured message transfer.

5000|$|A DICOM {{data object}} {{consists}} {{of a number of}} attributes, including items such as name, ID, etc., and also one special attribute containing the image pixel data (i.e. logically, the main object has no [...] "header" [...] as such, being merely a list of attributes, including the pixel data). A single DICOM object can have only one attribute containing pixel data. For many modalities, this corresponds to a single image. However, the attribute may contain multiple [...] "frames", allowing storage of cine loops or other multi-frame data. Another example is NM data, where an NM image, by definition, is a multi-dimensional multi-frame image. In these cases, three- or four-dimensional data can be encapsulated in a single DICOM object. Pixel data can be compressed using a variety of standards, including JPEG, lossless JPEG, JPEG 2000, and run-length encoding (RLE). <b>LZW</b> (zip) <b>compression</b> can be used for the whole data set (not just the pixel data), but this has rarely been implemented.|$|R
