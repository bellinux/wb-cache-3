40|$|Leads and encapsulants provide {{multilayer}} ceramic capacitors (MLCs) used in through-hole board technology {{with plenty of}} protection from thermal and mechanical stresses. Thus, the development of ceramic dielectrics for <b>leaded</b> <b>capacitor</b> applications initially concentrated on achieving optimum electrical properties. Surface-mount technology changed the rules, and {{for more than a}} decade KEMET ceramic development engineers have worked under the admonition “Think Like a Mechanical Engineer. ” This focus has resulted in physical property studies, the use of finite element analyses in capacitor design, and new acceptance criteria for dielectric developments. The paper which follows provide some basic information on two of the important mechanical properties of MLCs: fracture toughness and modulus of rupture. For those readers who wish to learn more on this subject, a list of KEMET technical publications follows the paper...|$|E

For surface mount devices, the soldering process may change the capacitance value {{by as much as}} 10%. The dissipation factor and insulation resistance of film capacitors may also be changed by the above-described external factors, particularly by moisture absorption in high humidity climates.|$|R
