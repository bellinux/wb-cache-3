5|$|Brown {{discovered}} the holotype female from an M. vindex nest on 23 March 1955 northwest from Wagin at Badjanning Rocks, Western Australia. The specimen is currently {{housed in the}} Western Australian Museum in Perth. Two dealated paratype females were also collected with the holotype, <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> similar to each other except for the mandibles and colouration. The mandibular dentition varies among the three, {{and one of the}} paratypes is darker than the holotype. In 1991, a published journal reviewing the species groups assigned M. inquilina to the M. cephalotes species group. However, entomologists placed it in the M. gulosa species group one month after placing it in the M. cephalotes species group.|$|E

25|$|Cho {{broke through}} to shodan after beating Michihiko Azuma in May 1968. He {{became one of the}} {{youngest}} professionals ever in modern go history, at 11 years and 8 months. In the same year, he was promoted to 2 dan and was <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> promising. Within a mere two years, he climbed to 4 dan after winning almost every Oteai game possible. He reached 5 dan in 1971, at just 15 years of age.|$|E
25|$|By December 1999, Anderson {{was working}} on plans for a {{computer}} animated sequel to Captain Scarlet, and he showed early test reels at a few fan conventions. These reels had the visual design and characters <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> much as {{they had in the}} original show, although the vehicle designs had been somewhat modernised. Several years after the initial tests the project evolved into the remake Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet, by which time the entire appearance had been significantly updated.|$|E
25|$|Dean Jones resumed day for on 141 not out {{and took}} Australia past 400 {{with the help of}} Hohns, and then Geoff Lawson, however Jones himself was out for 157 soon after lawson's departure, and after an epic 4 day innings, Australia were finally all out for 424 with a match result <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> unlikely. Captain Allan Border may have fancied his chances of dismissing England cheaply twice, but the {{remaining}} time made the prospect seem unlikely. His hope would have been to bowl them out for a low total, enforce the follow-on and then either defeat them by the innings or set a low target score for victory.|$|E

There is one scene which the national board of film reviewers deemed to be pornographic in nature and therefore determined in an impediment to national order.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{set about}} his innings in a workman-like fashion {{and kept the}} {{scoreboard}} ticking over. He and Boon put on 96 for the fourth wicket, before the different pace at running between the wickets of the burly Tasmanian and greyhound-like Jones led to Boon's run out for 38. This brought Steve Waugh to the wicket for the Australians, who so far had not been dismissed all series. Jones had edged past fifty and was <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> confident as the day wore on. The pair added a further 31, and despite day one ending with an almost biblical-scale lightning storm and flash flood, Australia ended day one on 234 for 4, with Dean Jones 71 not out, and Steve Waugh 17 not out.|$|E

The Brumbies also suffered a loss at | home to the Bulls whereas the controversial game of the round saw the Waratahs draw with the Western Force because of a blunder by Waratahs utility back Sam Norton-Knight who decide to run with the ball in the final minute instead of taking the penalty shot which could have won them the game and for his mistake Lote Tuqiri shoved him and walked off the pitch <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> disappointed.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 1997, Port Adelaide played {{its first}} AFL premiership match against Collingwood at the MCG, {{suffering}} a 79-point defeat. Port won its first AFL game in round 3 against Geelong, and defeated cross town rivals and eventual premiers Adelaide by 11 {{points in the}} first Showdown in round 4. At the conclusion of round 17, the side sat fifth – only one win and percentage off the top spot in what was an unusually close season – but it fell out of the finals after recording only a draw from its final five games. Port Adelaide finished its first season 9th, missing the finals on percentage behind Brisbane. The 1998 season was <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> similar to the previous year as they hovered around ninth position for most of the year and looked like a threat for finals after round 14; but they lost six of their last eight games to finish in 10th place, with a record of 9 wins, 12 losses and 1 draw.|$|E

It {{was created by}} David Hiller, who mixed footage from the band's 24 April 1980 debut {{appearance}} on BBC's Top of the Pops programme with a forest montage. Smith said that the group [...] "came across <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> morose and disinterested" [...] in the video because that is how they felt at the time; he [...] "hated" [...] Top of the Pops as he was [...] "really anti-pop" [...] during this period. He recalled {{that he had been}} in pain {{at the time of the}} shoot as he had broken his thumb trying to change a tyre a few days previously.|$|E

Obviously a major malfunction." [...] These were the last words spoken before the disintegrating vehicle fell into the sea. The use of the sample has been criticized in the media, including Hardeep Phull of the New York Post, who described its presence in the song as [...] "tasteless". Former NASA astronauts and families were also dismayed and labeled {{the use of the}} sample as [...] "insensitive". Keith Cowing of NASA Watch suggested that the use of the clip ranged from negligence to repugnance.|$|E
500|$|Thalia Grace: Thalia is a 15-year-old demigod {{daughter}} of Zeus. Though she appears in Percy's dream {{in the first}} book, she makes a full appearance {{at the end of}} The Sea of Monsters and is given a greater role in the third book. Thalia is described as <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> punk, with electric blue eyes, black clothes, and spiky hair. Her personality is often described as [...] "independent and many times sarcastic." [...] Thalia is a lot like Percy and consequently, they often argue. She is heartbroken by Luke's betrayal, it is supposed that she had feelings for him. She is also afraid of heights, which she reluctantly admits to Percy, {{despite the fact that she}} is {{daughter of}} Zeus, God of the Sky.|$|E
500|$|The Sarah Jane Adventures {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics and the viewing public. [...] At {{the end of}} the first series, Abi Grant of The Daily Telegraph wrote: [...] "With the debate about the future of children's TV still rumbling on, this is what the BBC does best, and despite lacking the production values of Doctor Who, it's still top tea-time programming." [...] Daniel Martin of The Guardian described the show as <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> promising and more convincing than another Doctor Who spinoff Torchwood. Review website DVD Talk called the series [...] "wonderful", [...] "thoughtful" [...] and [...] "imaginative children's entertainment" [...] that was highly recommended.

Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. I guess they thought I could pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> good".|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalists {{and fans}} have speculated {{about the impact}} a {{completed}} X-treme might have had on the market. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the prospect of [...] "a good 3D Sonic game" [...] on the Saturn as [...] "a 'What if...' situation {{on a par with}} the dinosaurs not becoming extinct." [...] IGN's Tavis Fahs called X-treme [...] "the turning point not only for Sega's mascot and their 32-bit console, but for the entire company", but noted that the game served as [...] "an empty vessel for Sega's ambitions and the hopes of their fans". Dave Zdyrko, who operated a prominent Saturn fan website during the system's lifespan, said: [...] "I don't know if [...] could've saved the Saturn, but... Sonic helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn't a great new Sonic title ready at or near the launch of the [...] ". In a 2007 retrospective, producer Mike Wallis maintained that X-treme [...] "definitely would have been competitive" [...] with Nintendo's Super Mario 64. By contrast, Next Generation reported in late 1996 that the game did not compare well to contemporary competition, and would have harmed Sega's reputation if it had been completed and released. Naka stated that he was relieved by the cancellation, as the game [...] "wasn't <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> good from my perspective".|$|E
