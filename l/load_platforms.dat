50|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (that is good in compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.Stiff polymer geogrids, with very open apertures, in addition to three-dimensional geocells made from various polymers are also increasingly specified in unpaved and paved roadways, <b>load</b> <b>platforms</b> and railway ballast, where the improved loadbearing characteristics significantly reduce the requirements for high quality, imported aggregate fills, thus reducing the carbon footprint of the construction.|$|E

40|$|Centrifugal {{microfluidic}} systems bear {{great potential}} for applications where ruggedness, portability, ease-of-use, and cost efficiency are critical. However, due to the unidirectional nature of the centrifugal pumping force, the number of sequential process steps which can be integrated on these “Lab-on-a-Disc” (LoaD) devices is limited by their finite radial extension. To significantly widen this bottleneck and thus expand the scope of applications that can be ported on these <b>LoaD</b> <b>platforms,</b> various groups have developed a range of centripetal pumping mechanisms. Here, we present two advancements over our previous efforts in this area by combining buoyancy-based pumping with dissolvable film (DF) valves. First, we present a buoyancy-driven, reciprocating flow of a dense liquid initially located an upper reservoir and a sample in a peripheral reservoir. Secondly, we combine buoyancy-driven centripetal pumping with sample discretization and metering to fully integrate and automate a liquid handling protocol towards implementing a multi-parameter bioassay on a disc...|$|E

40|$|The manipulation, trapping, {{detection}} and counting of cells in biological fluids is {{of critical importance}} to the areas of disease diagnosis, drug delivery and genomic applications in biomedical research. In recent times, this research has focussed on utilising the superior metering, separation, routing, mixing and incubation capabilities of centrifugal microfluidic “Lab on a Disk” (LOAD) technologies to tackle the challenge of handling numerous types of cells, proteins, genes and their reagents simultaneously. Furthermore, integrated optical detection systems are being developed in parallel to the aforementioned microfluidic technologies, to facilitate the accurate and inexpensive detection, imaging and counting of cells. This thesis describes a number of novel centrifugal microfluidic approaches towards the separation, capture and detection of white blood cells from whole blood. Firstly, a thorough review of the state-of-the art research {{in the areas of}} centrifugo-microfluidic cell handling and detection is outlined. Secondly, a series of physical size filtration and microcontact printing approaches for the capture and detection of biomimetic particles are described. Finally, the author assesses the suitability of sol-gel materials for waveguiding applications on disposable <b>LOAD</b> <b>platforms</b> and outlines areas of future work that would build upon the research undertaken in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|This {{systematic}} review synthesized and analyzed clinical findings {{related to the}} effectiveness of innovative technological feedback for tackling functional gait recovery. An electronic search of PUBMED, PEDro, WOS, CINAHL, and DIALNET was conducted from January 2011 to December 2016. The main inclusion criteria were: patients with modified or abnormal gait; application of technology-based feedback to deal with functional recovery of gait; any comparison between different kinds of feedback applied by means of technology, or any comparison between technological and non-technological feedback; and randomized controlled trials. Twenty papers were included. The populations were neurological patients (75 %), orthopedic and healthy subjects. All participants were adults, bar one. Four studies used exoskeletons, 6 <b>load</b> <b>platforms</b> and 5 pressure sensors. The breakdown of the type of feedback used was as follows: 60 % visual, 40 % acoustic and 15 % haptic. 55 % used terminal feedback versus 65 % simultaneous feedback. Prescriptive feedback was used in 60 % of cases, while 50 % used descriptive feedback. 62. 5 % and 58. 33 % of the trials showed a significant effect in improving step length and speed, respectively. Efficacy in improving other gait parameters such as balance or range of movement is observed in more than 75 % of the studies with significant outcomes. Conclusion: Treatments based on feedback using innovative technology in patients with abnormal gait are mostly effective in improving gait parameters and therefore useful for the functional recovery of patients. The most frequently highlighted types of feedback were immediate visual feedback followed by terminal and immediate acoustic feedback...|$|E
40|$|Rotational {{microfluidic}} platforms {{have attracted}} swiftly growing interest {{over the last}} decade due to their suitability for integration and automation of sample preparation and detection. Valving is of pivotal importance on these compact “Lab-on-a-Disc” (<b>LoaD)</b> <b>platforms</b> as all liquids are exposed to the same centrifugal field. A number of valving technologies have been developed to coordinate timing of serial and / or parallel multi-step / multi-liquid assay protocols comprising of laboratory unit opera-tions (LUOs) such as the release, metering and mixing of sample and reagents. So far these valving techniques could be broadly categorised into rotationally controlled or externally actuated schemes. Only recently a new, “event-triggered” flow control has been introduced. In this approach, a valve is opened upon arrival of a liquid at a defined destination on the disc; this innovative mechanism for the first time permits the cascading of LUOs independent of the spin rate. In one technology, dissolvable films (DFs) are configured with a pneumatic chamber to offer function akin to an electrical relay. Dissolving one DF, termed the control film (CF), results in the release of liquid at a distal location through a so-called load film (LF). In this paper, a new method for temporal control of actuating DF-based, event-triggered CFs which are serially aligned at defined distances along a paper strip is introduced. Liquids are transported through the paper strip at a given velocity, thus setting well-defined intervals between subsequent LUOs, e. g. incubation steps. As a proof-of-concept, we present a disc with inte-grated metering and mixing which can perform a prototypical, 4 -fold serial dilution; a common function in bioanalytical protocols. Imbibition of the paper strip sequentially opens five valves for serial dilution and mixing. To illustrate an unprecedented level of on-disc automation, this is followed by a branched cascade of 17 event-triggered valves (for a total of 22 liquid handling steps) which completes the serial dilution protocol...|$|E

40|$|Background: With the {{expansion}} of HIV- 2 epidemic beyond African countries, co-infection with HIV- 1 becomes a global challenge. We have recently identified an HIV- 1 / 2 dual infection with both viruses bearing multiclass drug resistance in an untreated patient [1]. We now present the patient&#x 0027;s combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) outcome after 6 months follow-up. Patient and Methods: Clinical samples were obtained upon informed consent from a 23 -year-old man living in Guinea-Bissau until March 2011 {{when he moved to}} Switzerland. As previously reported [1], HIV- 1 / 2 co-infection was confirmed by HIV- 1 PCR (21. 000 copies/ml) and total HIV- 1 / 2 viremia (4. 351 nU/ml) by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay. The patient denied previous HIV testing or exposure to antiretroviral drugs. Dual infection consisted of HIV- 1 CRF 02 _AG bearing resistance mutations M 184 V/V 90 I and HIV- 2 clade A, harboring K 65 R/D 67 N mutations as amplified from proviral-DNA. Baseline CD 4 +&#x 200 A;T-cell count was 408 cell/mm 3. We initiated cART in accordance to drug resistance mutations (see below). Treatment compliance was assessed with an electronic pillbox device and drug-plasma concentrations. Clinical and laboratory follow up were done at weeks 2, 4, 9, 12 and 24. Results: cART was initiated with tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), boosted-darunavir (DRV/r) and raltegravir(RAL). Treatment compliance was fluctuant during the first 3 months after which it remained stable with an average monthly intake of 92 %. Antiretroviral drug-plasma concentrations were traced at percentile 25 th. HIV- 1 viremia became undetectable at week 12. Additionally, HIV- 2 viremia was retrospectively assessed by real-time RT-PCR at two independent laboratories showing undetectable values across the study period including baseline. Thus, baseline viremia, as assessed by the PERT test for particle-associated reverse transcriptase activity was due to HIV- 1 alone. CD 4 &#x 200 A;+&#x 200 A;T-cell count was 559 cell/mm 3 at week 24. Laboratory assessments showed a neutrophile drop to 0. 96 at week 4, fully restored at week 9. Conclusion: This case of HIV- 1 / 2 dual infection underscores the importance of assessing genotypic analysis of both viruses ahead to treatment choice. It also highlights viral <b>load</b> <b>platforms</b> constraints when it comes to clinical monitoring of HIV- 1 / 2 co-infection in western settings. Overall, first-line salvage treatment was well tolerated and suppressed HIV- 1 resistant clade allowing recovery of CD 4 + T-cell count...|$|E
