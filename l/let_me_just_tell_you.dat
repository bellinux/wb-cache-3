60|$|You may {{easily see}} that {{although}} we obtained from water {{twice as much}} in volume of the hydrogen as of oxygen, {{it does not follow}} that we have twice as much in weight--because one is heavy, and the other a very light gas. We have means of weighing gases or air; but without stopping to explain, that, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what their respective weights are. The weight of a pint of hydrogen is three-quarters of a grain; the weight of the same quantity of oxygen is nearly twelve grains. This is a very great difference. The weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is one-twelfth of an ounce; and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is one ounce and a third. And so on we might come to masses of matter which may be weighed in the balance, and which we can take account of as to hundredweights and as to tons, as you will see almost immediately.|$|E

30|$|The {{particle}} ma (but), which I briefly analyze in “Further issues” section, is an adversative coordinating particle. Without entering in much detail, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> {{point out}} that all these sentences are counter-expectational, in that the speaker expresses her surprise at a state of things different from what she expected. The contribution of ma to yield this effect is crucial.|$|R
40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> ask a {{question}} which everyone else who has been faithfully attending these sessions is surely burning to ask. If some rules you have described constitute universal constraints on all languages, yet they are not learned, nor are they somehow logically necessary a priori, how did language get that way?

40|$|Thank you for {{the kind}} {{introduction}} and for the very clear summary of the arguments of Multicultural Citizenship. So I thought I’d just mention {{a couple of the}} ideas that I’ve been working with more recently. The first concerns this. There are two main types of groups that I’ve been thinking of - immigrant groups and national minorities. What kinds of rights are appropriate for these two different types of groups. I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit. I would now talk about these in terms of immigrant multiculturalism for immigrant groups and multi-nation federalism for national minorities. So <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> say that I hope it’s not dramatically different from what’s in the book but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> clarify what I mean by those terms, because I will use them...|$|R
