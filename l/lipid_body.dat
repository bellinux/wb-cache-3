However, the molecular mechanisms involved in PPARγ expression and functions during infection are not completely understood. Here, we investigate signaling pathways triggered by TLR 2, the involvement of co-receptors and lipid rafts in the mechanism of PPARγ expression, <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation and cytokine synthesis in macrophages during BCG infection. BCG induces NF-κB activation and increased PPARγ expression in a TLR 2 -dependent manner. Furthermore, BCG-triggered increase of <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> biogenesis was inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist GW 9662, but not by the NF-κB inhibitor JSH- 23. In contrast, KC/CXCL 1 production was largely dependent on NF-κB but not on PPARγ. BCG infection induced increased expression of CD 36 in macrophages in vitro. Moreover, CD 36 co-immunoprecipitates with TLR 2 in BCG-infected macrophages, suggesting its interaction with TLR 2 in BCG signaling. Pretreatment with CD 36 neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited PPARγ expression, <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation and PGE 2 production induced by BCG. Involvement of CD 36 in <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation was further confirmed by decreased BCG-induced <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation in CD 36 deficient macrophages.

40|$|Lipid bodies, {{inducible}} lipid-rich cytoplasmic inclusions, are characteristically {{abundant in}} cells associated with inflammation, including eosinophils. Here we reviewed {{the formation and}} function of lipid bodies in human eosinophils. We now have evidence that the formation of lipid bodies is not attributable to adverse mechanisms, but is centrally mediated by specific signal transduction pathways. Arachidonic acid and other cis fatty acids by an NSAID-inhibitable process, diglycerides, and PAF by a 5 -lipoxygenase dependent pathway are potent stimulators of <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> induction. <b>Lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation develops rapidly by processes that involve PKC, PLC, and de novo mRNA and protein synthesis. These structures clearly serve as repositoires of arachidonyl-phospholipids and are more than inert depots.

Lipid bodies appear to be dynamic, organelle-like structures involved in intracellular pathways of lipid mobilization and metabolism. Indeed, increases in <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> numbers correlated with enhanced production of both lipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-derived eicosanoids. We hypothesize that lipid bodies are distinct inducible sites for generating eicosanoids as paracrine mediators with varied activities in inflammation.

Because lipid bodies are potential reservoirs of esterified arachidonate and sites at which eicosanoid-forming enzymes may localize, we evaluated mechanisms of <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation in neutrophils (PMN). Among receptor- mediated agonists, platelet activating factor (PAF), but not C 5 a, formyl-methyl-phenylalanine, interleukin 8, or leukotriene (LT) B 4, induced the rapid formation of lipid bodies in PMN. This action of PAF was receptor mediated, {{as it was}} dose dependently inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 and blocked by pertussis toxin. <b>Lipid</b> <b>body</b> induction by PAF required 5 -lipoxygenase (LO) activity and was inhibited by the 5 -lipoxygenase-activating protein antagonist MK 886 and the 5 -LO inhibitor zileuton, but not by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Corroborating the dependency of PAF-induced <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation on 5 - LO, PMN and macrophages from wild-type mice, but not from 5 -LO genetically deficient mice, formed lipid bodies on exposure to PAF both in vitro and in vivo within the pleural cavity. The 5 -LO product inducing <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation was not LTB 4 but was 5 (S) - hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [5 (S) -HETE], which was active at 10 -fold lower concentrations than PAF and was also inhibited by pertussis toxin but not by zileuton or WEB 2086. Furthermore, 5 -HETE was equally effective in inducing <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation in both wild-type and 5 -LO genetically deficient mice. Both PAF- and 5 (S) -HETE-induced <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation were inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine and chelerythrine, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors D 609 and U- 73122, and by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Prior stimulation of human PMN with PAF to form lipid bodies enhanced eicosanoid production in response to submaximal stimulation with the calcium ionophore A 23187; and the levels of both prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and LTB 4 correlated {{with the number of}} lipid bodies. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide inhibited not only the induction of <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation by PAF, but also the PAF- induced "priming" for enhanced PGE 2 and LTB 4 in PMN. Thus, the compartmentalization of lipids to form lipid bodies in PMN is dependent on specific cellular responses that can be PAF receptor mediated, involves signaling through 5 -LO to form 5 -HETE and then through PKC and PLC, and requires new protein synthesis. Since increases in <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> numbers correlated with priming for enhanced PGE 2 and LTB 4 production in PMN, the induction of lipid bodies may have a role in the formation of eicosanoid mediators by leukocytes involved in inflammation...|$|E

Previous research suggested that green algae and diatoms appear to have different acclimation strategies to nutrient limitations. This study focused on determining what some of those different acclimation strategies are.

The compartmentalization of signaling compo-nents within discrete and dynamic sites in the cell is critical for specificity and efficiency of enzymatic reactions of phosphorilation, enzyme activation and function. We hypothesized that <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> – inducible non-membrane bound cytoplasmic lipid domains – function as specialized intracellular sites of compartmentalization of signaling with major roles in lipid mediator formation within leukocytes engaged in inflammatory process. Over the past years substantial progresses have been made demonstrating that all enzymes involved in eicosanoid synthesis localize at <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> are distinct sites for eicosanoid generation. Here we will review our current knowl-edge on the mechanisms of formation and functions of <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> pertinent to inflammation. Key words: inflammation- lipid bodies- eicosanoids The cells of both innate and adaptive immune response express {{a great variety of}} receptors that transduce and integrate an enormous amount of information enabling the cells to mount effective immune responses.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} transmission electron micrographs {{of human}} lung mast cells by digitized planimetry and point counting {{to determine the}} cross- sectional areas of two distinct cytoplasmic organelles: specific granules and <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies.</b> Specific granules have a limiting membrane and often contain one or more cylindrical scroll-like inclusions. By contrast, <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> are on average much larger than granules and lack both limiting membranes and inclusions. The measured cross- sectional areas of <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> and scroll-containing granules were converted to equivalent volumes, and the noise in the frequency distribution of these volumes was smoothed using a moving bin technique. This analysis revealed (a) a periodic, multimodal distribution of granule equivalent volumes in which the modes fell at volumes that were integral multiples of the volume defined by the first mode (the "unit volume"), and (b) a modal granule equivalent volume frequency that occurred at a magnitude equal to four "unit volumes. " Thus, specific granules appear to be composed of units of a narrowly fixed volume. Furthermore, the mean volume of intragranule inclusions was 0. 0061 mu 3, a value {{very similar to that}} calculated for the "unit volume" (0. 0071 mu 3). This result suggests that each "unit volume" comprising the individual scroll-type granules contains (or is capable of generating or accommodating) a single scroll-like inclusion. In contrast to the specific granules, mast cell <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> lack a periodic, multimodal volume distribution. Taken together, these findings suggest that the volumes of human lung mast cell granules and <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> are regulated by distinct mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The etiolated {{germination}} {{process of}} oilseed plants {{is characterized by}} the mobilization of storage lipids, which serve as a major carbon source for the seedling. We found that during early stages of germination in cucumber, a lipoxygenase (linoleate: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 13. 11. 12) form is induced that is capable of oxygenating the esterified fatty acids located in the lipid-storage organelles, the so-called <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies.</b> Large amounts of esterified (13 S) -hydroxy-(9 Z, 11 E) -octadecadienoic acid were detected in the <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies,</b> whereas only traces of other oxygenated fatty acid isomers were found. This specific product pattern confirms the in vivo action of this lipoxygenase form during germination. Lipid fractionation studies of <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> indicated the presence of lipoxygenase products both in the storage triacylglycerols and, to a higher extent, in the phospholipids surrounding the lipid stores as a monolayer. The degree of oxygenation of the storage lipids increased drastically during the time course of germination. We show that oxygenated fatty acids are preferentially cleaved from the <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> and are subsequently released into the cytoplasm. We suggest that they may serve as substrate for beta-oxidation. These data suggest that during the etiolated germination, a lipoxygenase initiates the mobilization of storage lipids. The possible mechanisms of this implication are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{cucumber}} (Cucumis sativus), high lipoxygenase- 1 (LOX- 1) {{activity has}} been {{detected in the}} soluble fraction prepared from cotyledons of germinating seeds, and the involvement of this enzyme in lipid turnover has been suggested (K. Matsui, M. Irie, T. Kajiwara, A. Hatanaka [1992] Plant Sci 85 : 23 – 32; I. Fuessner, C. Wasternack, H. Kindl, H. Kühn [1995] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92 : 11849 – 11853). In this study we have investigated {{the expression of the}} gene lox- 1, corresponding to the LOX- 1 enzyme. LOX- 1 expression is highly coordinated with that of a typical glyoxysomal enzyme, isocitrate lyase, during the postgerminative stage of cotyledon development. In contrast, although icl transcripts accumulated in tissue during in vitro senescence, no accumulation of lox- 1 mRNA could be observed, suggesting that lox- 1 plays a specialized role in fat mobilization. LOX- 1 is also known to be a major <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> protein. The partial peptide sequences of purified LOX- 1 and <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> LOX- 1 entirely coincided with that deduced from the lox- 1 cDNA sequence. The data strongly suggest that LOX- 1 and <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> LOX- 1 are derived from a single gene and that LOX- 1 can exist both in the cytosol and on the lipid bodies. We constructed an in vitro oxygenation system to address the mechanism of this dual localization and to investigate the action of LOX- 1 on lipids in the lipid bodies. LOX- 1 cannot act on the lipids in intact lipid bodies, although degradation of <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> proteins, either during seedling growth or by treatment with trypsin, allows lipid bodies to become susceptible to LOX- 1. We discuss the role of LOX- 1 in fat mobilization and its mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculous sputum {{provides}} {{a sample of}} bacilli that must be eliminated by chemotherapy and that may go on to transmit infection. A preliminary observation that Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells contain triacylglycerol lipid bodies in sputum, but not when growing in vitro, led us to investigate the extent of this phenomenon and its physiological basis. Microscopy-positive sputum samples from the UK and The Gambia were investigated for their content of lipid body-positive mycobacteria by combined Nile red and auramine staining. All samples contained a lipid body-positive population varying from 3 % to 86 % of the acid-fast bacilli present. The recent finding that triacylglycerol synthase is expressed by mycobacteria when they enter in vitro nonreplicating persistence led us to investigate whether this state was also associated with <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> formation. We found that, when placed in laboratory conditions inducing nonreplicating persistence, two M. tuberculosis strains had <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> levels comparable {{to those found in}} sputum. We investigated these physiological findings further by comparing the M. tuberculosis transcriptome of growing and nonreplicating persistence cultures with that obtained directly from sputum samples. Although sputum has traditionally been thought to contain actively growing tubercle bacilli, our transcript analyses refute the hypothesis that these cells predominate. Rather, they reinforce the results of the <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> analyses by revealing transcriptional signatures that can be clearly attributed to slowly replicating or nonreplicating mycobacteria. Finally, the <b>lipid</b> <b>body</b> count was highly correlated (R(2) = 0. 64, p < 0. 03) with time to positivity in diagnostic liquid cultures, thereby establishing a direct link between this cytological feature and the size of a potential nonreplicating population. As nonreplicating tubercle bacilli are tolerant to the cidal action of antibiotics and resistant to multiple stresses, identification of this persister-like population of tubercle bacilli in sputum presents exciting and tractable new opportunities to investigate both responses to chemotherapy and the transmission of tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|Microstructures {{of seven}} plant {{introductions}} of winged beans (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) produced in Okinawa, Japan were investigated. In cotyledonary cells of winged beans, protein <b>bodies</b> plus numerous <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> were distributed in a cytoplasmic network. Starch granules were {{often found in}} some introductions but rarely in others. All seven introductions had very thick cell walls. The high protein, fat and hemicellulose contents of winged beans {{are consistent with the}} numerous protein <b>bodies,</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> and thick cell walls in the mature cotyledonary cells. The cell walls contained a number of depressions or cavities 1 to 2 lJ m deep which frequently occurred opposite complementary pits in adjacent cells (presumably pit-pairs). Plasmodesmata traverse the cell walls in the pit-pairs. In order to determine changes during development, cultivar UPS- 32 cultivated at Fukuoka-city was used. In coty ledonary cells at 30 days after flowering, cell walls which had pitpairs with plasmodesmata, developing amyloplasts with starch granules, vacuoles with dense flocculent materials, tubular rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria etc., were observed but no protein <b>bodies</b> or <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> were apparent. Protein <b>bodies</b> and <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> were, however, found at 45 days after flowering. Cotyledonary cells at 45 days contained many starch granules but mature seeds contained few, if any...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a characteristic blue fluorescence to identify and isolate pluripotent human embryonic stem cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cells. The blue fluorescence emission (450 – 500  nm) is readily observed by fluorescence microscopy and correlates with the expression of pluripotency markers (OCT 4, SOX 2, and NANOG). It allows easy identification and isolation of undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells, high-throughput fluorescence sorting and subsequent propagation. The fluorescence appears early during somatic reprogramming. We show that the blue fluorescence arises from the sequestration of retinyl esters in cytoplasmic <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies.</b> The retinoid-sequestering <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> are specific to human and mouse pluripotent stem cells of the primed or epiblast-like state and absent in naive mouse embryonic stem cells. Retinol, present in widely used stem cell culture media, is sequestered as retinyl ester specifically by primed pluripotent cells and also can induce the formation of these <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Steryl esters and {{triacylglycerol}} (TAG) are {{the main}} storage lipids in eukaryotic cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these storage lipids accumulate during stationary growth phase within organelles known as <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies.</b> We have used single and multiple gene disruptions to study storage lipid synthesis in yeast. Four genes, ARE 1, ARE 2, DGA 1, and LRO 1, were found to contribute to TAG synthesis. The most significant contribution is made by DGA 1, which encodes a novel acyl-CoA;diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Two of the genes, ARE 1 and ARE 2, are also involved in steryl ester synthesis. A yeast strain that lacks all four genes is viable and has no apparent growth defects under standard conditions. The strain is devoid of both TAG and steryl esters, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that it also lacks <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies.</b> We conclude that neither storage <b>lipids</b> nor <b>lipid</b> <b>bodies</b> are essential for growth in yeast...|$|R
