The phase-shift mask (PSM) is one such technique that is utilized to push the limits of optical lithography. Altering the optical phase of the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> <b>transmits</b> through a photomask can increase the resolution of a lithographic image significantly. However, intensity imbalances between the etched and non-etched regions due to sidewall scattering can cause resolution, phase and placement errors on the wafer.

The light rays entering the sight receptors are subject to reflection, absorption and transmission. In the retina of the eye, the light energy is transformed into nerve impulses. The reception of light is dependent on the degree of absorption of the length of certain waves and the concentration of light. A ray of light entering the eye pupil is the proper eye stimulus which stimulates the receptors of the retina and causes visual impressions...|$|E

The two reflected rays will interfere according to the total phase change caused by the extra path length 2t and by the half-cycle phase change induced in reflection at the lower surface.

The Fresnel equations provide a quantitative description of how much of the light will be transmitted or reflected at an interface. The light reflected from the upper and lower surfaces will interfere. The degree of constructive or destructive interference between the two light waves depends on the difference in their phase. This difference in turn depends on the thickness of the film layer, the refractive index of the film, and the angle of incidence of the original wave on the film.

Mid-infrared light interacts strongly with the fundamental and vibrational modes of many molecules, enabling specifi c and sensitive detection. Optical absorption detection is accomplished by monitoring the power of <b>light</b> <b>that</b> is <b>transmitted</b> through a gas thought to contain the molecules under test, triacetone trip-eroxide (TATP) for example. The detection sensitivity of the system can be improved by increasing the interaction length of the light and the gas using a multipass cell. The chaotic cavity gas cell in this project is constructed from a single highly-refl ective, closed surface that is designed by deform-ing a sphere. In this project, we focus on designing cavities with stabilized ray trajectories that have long optical path lengths. The single-surface design of the gas cell and the stabilized orbits mitigate alignment issues and fl uctuations in the environment that limit more common multipass gas cells and reduce total product costs.

40|$|This {{research}} study presents {{a framework for}} applying physically based global illumination techniques {{to the creation of}} software models of <b>light</b> fields <b>that</b> are then validated against actual light fields measured in physical experiments. A prior experiment was performed by horticulture scientists in which the light field of an empty plant growth chamber was measured using quantum sensors at fixed spatial intervals. The result was a light map consisting of a 9 x 45, fixed-width, two-dimensional graph of sensor readings that described the intensity of radiant energy present in the chamber at the chosen locations. A single observation of the growth chamber was made resulting in a single data set consisting of 45 different, location-sensitive irradiance observations. ^ To test this framework a series of simulations were performed in which the physical attributes of the growth chamber were duplicated as closely as possible in a virtual growth chamber software model. Modeled attributes included physical dimensions, wall and light reflectivity, and full-spectrum light characterization. Light transport was modeled using a physically based, global illumination rendering technique called photon mapping. Virtual sensors that recorded the intensity of the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> <b>transmitted</b> through their surface were placed in the virtual chamber at the same position and interval as the ones that were used in the physical experiment. The output of the virtual chamber experiments were represented as a graph in the same configuration as the one in the physical experiment. The experiment was conducted using a modified version of pbrt, a physically based, extensible renderer developed by Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys [1]. ^ As photon mapping uses a stochastic algorithm, many repetitions of the virtual chamber experiment were performed and the mean and standard deviation were recorded as a global measure for each chamber as well as for each individual sensor location. The global means of the physical and virtual chambers were compared using a simple linear regression analysis and were shown to have a p 3 ̆c 0. 0001 at α 3 ̆c 0. 05, thus indicating a significant association between them. The correlation coefficient between the chambers was – 0. 66 indicating a fairly strong negative relationship between the two groups. ^ A robust statistical comparison of sensor-to-sensor similarity between the physical and virtual was not possible due to the limited number of observations in the physical data. However visual comparison of the patterns of response between a given physical and virtual sensor does show a significant inverse relationship between the two. It is unclear why the relationship between the virtual and physical chambers is inverse; potential causes and solutions are discussed. ^ An important conclusion reached in this study is that photon mapping as implemented in pbrt demonstrates the ability to function as a tool for irradiance modeling as well as image synthesis. ...|$|R

One LED is red, with wavelength of 660 nm, and the other is infrared with a wavelength of 940 nm. Absorption of light at these wavelengths differs significantly between blood loaded with oxygen and blood lacking oxygen. Oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more infrared light and allows more red light to pass through. Deoxygenated hemoglobin allows more infrared light to pass through and absorbs more red light. The LEDs sequence through their cycle of one on, then the other, then both off about thirty times per second which allows the photodiode to respond to the red and infrared light separately and also adjust for the ambient light baseline. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>that</b> is <b>transmitted</b> (in other words, that is not absorbed) is measured, and separate normalized signals are produced for each wavelength. These signals fluctuate in time because the amount of arterial blood that is present increases (literally pulses) with each heartbeat. By subtracting the minimum transmitted light from the peak transmitted light in each wavelength, the effects of other tissues is corrected for. The ratio of the red light measurement to the infrared light measurement is then calculated by the processor (which represents the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to deoxygenated hemoglobin), and this ratio is then converted to SpO2 by the processor via a lookup table based on the Beer-Lambert law.|$|R
