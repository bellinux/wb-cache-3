40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to conduct {{for the first time in}} Scotland a {{comprehensive}} analysis of this history and practice of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>advice.</b> There is a long tradition of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> being provided gratuitously for poor persons by Scots lawyers, but there is no single work dealing with the development of the subject from its roots in the 15 th century to the present day. The work is divided into five parts. Part I is purely historical and traces <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> in Scotland from 1424 to present times. Parts II to V deal in detail with <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>advice</b> as presently available under the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> and <b>Advice</b> (Scotland) Acts 1967 and 1972, and are intended primarily for the practising lawyer. Part II deals generally with <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> administration, Part III deal 3 with civil <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> under s. 1 of the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> (Scotland) Act 1967, Part IV deals with criminal <b>legal</b> <b>aid,</b> and Part V deals with legal advice and assistance. Thus, the emphasis of the work is practical, against an historical background. For example, there is no attempt to deal with the "unmet need" for legal services in Scotland, nor to probe the question of whether legal services of all types should be nationalised. Rather, the purpose of the author has been to try to satisfy another type of "unmet need"? the need for an up-to-date, properly vouched and reasoned exposition of present-day law and practice - as required by the law practitioner. The case law in Scotland is fully dealt with and the policy of the <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> authorities in Scotland in relation to various matters is also indicated in the text...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} disjuncture in the New Labour Government between the largest reform in {{fifty years of}} the nation's <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> system and the {{concurrent}} pursuit of progressive anti-poverty, social inclusion, community regeneration, and human rights social policies. The failure of the newly created Community Legal Service (CLS) to incorporate these policies reveals the contradictions in the Third Way's effort to reconcile private market, managerial efficiencies {{with the goals of}} advancing social justice. This failure to adopt a social justice mission for the reformed <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>advice</b> system, it is argued, shows the limited vision of these reforms and defines an unfinished agenda for a second term Labour Government.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen a rapid {{transformation}} of the professional structures relating to the provision of publicly funded (<b>legal</b> <b>aid)</b> <b>legal</b> <b>advice</b> and support in the U. K. Market control theorists have seen this process as {{a symptom of the}} withdrawal of State shelter for exclusive practice rights, while other commentators have seen the process as a ‘renegotiation of professionalism’ whereby lawyers have been drawn into a new relationship with stakeholders. The wider context for these developments has been the growth of New Public Management, and the contractualisation of relationships between public service providers and ‘consumers’. This process took a new direction with the development of the Community Legal Service, and the extension of support by the Legal Services Commission to advice agencies in the Not For Profit (NFP) sector, as part of a programme of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> reform. This reform, it has been argued, has been characterised by the residualisation civil legal, the marginalisation of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> lawyers working in the sector, and a drive to substitute Alternative Dispute Resolution, and advice, for civil litigation. This paper traces the history of these developments before exploring in detail the implications of the increasingly diverse character of advice providers in the sector, from professional solicitors in private practice, through paid advice workers in advice agencies to volunteer workers in Citizen’s Advice Agencies. Aspects of the different cultures within which the professional knowledge and competence of workers are deployed are discussed., such as the client-centred ethos of the NFP sector, for example time-work cultures. The development of a Quality Assurance system for all publicly funded legal advice workers is discussed in terms both of its effect of these cultures, and as an example of significant change in the relationship between the State and NGOs. The issue of knowledge capture and standardisation appears increasingly...|$|R

Following the Labour {{election}} victory in the 1945 general election many of Beveridge's reforms were implemented {{through a series of}} Acts of Parliament. On 5 July 1948, the National Insurance Act, National Assistance Act and National Health Service Act came into force, forming the key planks of the modern UK welfare state. The universal system that was to be called National Insurance, in which the rich paid in and the state paid out to the rich just as to the poor, was justified on the grounds of both fairness and lower cost. Universal benefits, such as the Universal Child Benefit, were particularly beneficial after the Second World War when the birth rate was low, and may have helped drive the 1950s baby boom.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the role of}} the John Hilton Bureau newspaper advice service, which ran {{under the auspices of the}} News of the World between 1942 and the late 1960 s. The Bureau merits attention from historians on account of the light it can shed on how ordinary Britons accessed the law and legal advice before and after the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> and <b>Advice</b> Act 1949. It also provides insight into how relationships between the state and individual differed between a highly-regulated wartime state and the supposedly affluent, consumerist welfare state that followed it. The article also argues that the John Hilton Bureau evolved from a service defined by the reputation of the eponymous Hilton, a Cambridge professor and radio personality, to one that saw itself as a crusading organisation standing up for the ‘little man’ against a bureaucratic welfare state and unscrupulous traders. The Bureau is finally a reminder that the post-war welfare state was not simply divided between the public and voluntary sectors, but also included an array of private sector interests. The Bureau’s position outside of the public and voluntary sectors enabled it to be a critical and challenging voice, untainted by a sense of charity, but its location within a profit-making organisation also made it vulnerable in the longer term...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid,</b> Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (LASPO) 2012 {{declared}} {{the end of}} <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> in immigration in England and Wales {{except for a few}} strictly specified exceptions. Access to justice will be denied for large numbers of migrants and their families. The changes will also mean the large-scale removal of effective legal checks on UK Border Agency decision-making in immigration matters, a significant increase in litigants in person in the Tribunals and the High Court, an inevitable drop in quality of legal argument, and, arguably, in judicial decision-making. Immigration is of course not the only area of law in which this decline is likely to take place, but is the only area in which the loss of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> is likely to lead directly to the break-up of families and the removal of long-term residents from the UK in breach of their human rights. However, before we simply blame the recession, or the present government, we should look back over the years to see how the management of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>legal</b> <b>advice</b> in the broadest sense in the areas of immigration and asylum has been littered with unintended consequences including the chaos of perverse contractual incentives and the driving out of excellent, committed and brilliant lawyers, exhausted by the attempt to make quality pay. In this analysis we can see the declining quality of provision of publicly-funded legal services in immigration and asylum as a paradigm for a wider problem of how to maintain and improve standards in a public service delivered by a profession but controlled by price...|$|R

Article 7 of the Convention states, [...] "Central Authorities shall co-operate with each other and promote co-operation amongstthe competent authorities in their respective States to secure the prompt return ofchildren and to achieve the other objects of this Convention," [...] and lists the measures that they are supposed to take in order to achieve these ends.

40|$|English matrimonial law {{until the}} mid-nineteenth century was {{administered}} by the ecclesiastical courts. The high legal fees charged by these courts restricted the number of matrimonial disputes which came before them. Moreover they were not empowered to grant divorce a vinculo. This matrimonial relief could be obtained only from Parliament but few husbands could meet the heavy expenses of a Private Act. The transfer of divorce hearings to a civil court in 1857 benefitted the middle class, though {{the mass of the}} people still remained debarred by inability to pay legal and court fees. Wives were additionally handicapped by economic and legal disadvantages. The need to provide working class wives with a quick, cheap and accessible means of protection from cruel husbands led to the establishment of the matrimonial jurisdiction of magistrates' courts in 1878. Study of the resort to divorce before the Second World War shows that it was the de facto non-availability of divorce rather than the lack of acceptable grounds that resulted in the great majority of broken marriages being dealt with in the summary court. Concern over evidence that the inability of working class spouses to obtain divorce resulted in the formation of illicit unions, {{led to the development of}} <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> provisions culminating in the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> and <b>Advice</b> Act of 1949. This Act has been of special benefit to wives seeking divorce. <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid,</b> higher real wages and greater acceptance of divorce within the community have allowed an increasing number of broken working class marriages to be dissolved. Findings from a sample of 1961 divorce petitions show that social class and the rate of divorce are inversely associated. However, a broad breakdown into a non-manual/manual dichotomy hides variations within individual class groupings. Thus, white-collar workers have a higher rate of divorce than do manual workers. The social class of petitioners was also found to be associated with such demographic characteristics such as age at marriage and divorce. Although the divorce courts have been opened to all sections of the population, the criminal courts continue to hear the matrimonial disputes of the very poor. Evidence from a survey of maintenance orders held in magistrates' courts in 1966 suggests that some 165, 000 marriages are neither martially united nor legally dissolved. Half of these separated spouses never seek divorce. <p...|$|R
