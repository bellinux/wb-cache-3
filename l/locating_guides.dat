40|$|ABSTRACT: Guided wave {{inspection}} of composite skin–honeycomb core struc-tures is an efficient and sensitive alternative to other common inspection methods. This paper shows that sweeping experimentally through the dispersion curves {{is an effective}} way to experimentally <b>locate</b> <b>guided</b> wave modes sensitive to skin–core delamination. Composite skin–Nomex honeycomb core specimens were developed with simulated delaminated areas. The delaminated areas were detected with guided waves and confirmed with conventional ultrasonic testing methods. Calculated phase velocity dispersion curves are given to define the practical phase velocity and frequency ranges. Example wave structures in this range are given to illustrate the change in sensitivity as frequency is swept for a given mode...|$|R

The nature of this dialogue requires a leadership approach that plays both a courageous and imaginative role in liberating its workforce.

50|$|In 1962, the animals' intelligence, {{exceptional}} diving ability, and trainability led to {{the foundation}} of a new research program at Point Mugu, California, where a research facility was built on a sand spit between Mugu Lagoon and the ocean. The intention was to study the dolphins' senses and capabilities, such as their natural sonar and deep-diving physiology, and to determine how dolphins and sea lions might be used to perform useful tasks, such as searching for and marking objects in the water. A major accomplishment was the discovery that trained dolphins and sea lions could be reliably worked untethered in the open sea.In 1965, a Navy dolphin named Tuffy participated in the SEALAB II project off La Jolla, California, carrying tools and messages between the surface and the habitat 200 feet (60 m) below.

The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of CPS insertion at C 3 -C 7 in vitro using novel calipers based on the gravity line. Nine cadaveric cervical spines underwent computed tomography scanning and preoperative design. A lateral fluoroscopic view was taken to measure the intra-operative sagittal angle by C-arm with hanging cross structured K-wires. By referring to the gravity line, caliper A was used to locate the entry point, while caliper B was employed to guide the screw insertion. Postoperative CT scans were performed to assess the accuracy of the screw placements, according to the Neo classification. Overall, 78 (88. 6 %) of the 88 pedicle screw placements were classified as grade 0 (correct position), 4 (4. 5 %) were grade 1 (non-critical perforation), 4 (4. 5 %) were grade 2 (critical perforation), and 2 (2. 3 %) were grade 3 (critical perforation).
