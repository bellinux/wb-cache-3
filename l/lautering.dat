5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during <b>lautering,</b> when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is <b>lautering,</b> in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E
2500|$|Barley is {{the most}} {{commonly}} malted grain, {{in part because of}} its [...] high content of [...] enzymes, though wheat, rye, oats , rice and corn are also used. Also very important is the retention of the grain's husk, even after threshing, unlike the bare seeds of threshed wheat or rye. This protects the growing acrospire (developing plant embryo) from damage during malting, which can easily lead to mold growth; it also allows the mash of converted grain to create a filter bed during <b>lautering</b> (see brewing).|$|E

The generalized F-test could be superior to individual <b>Läuter's</b> tests and the classical Hotelling T 2 -test for the general purpose of testing the multivariate normal mean.

50|$|Paul <b>Lauters</b> or Paul Lauteri (16 July 1806, Brussels - 12 November 1875, Brussels), was a Belgian printmaker, {{illustrator}} and painter.|$|R
50|$|Born Pauline <b>Lauters,</b> {{she married}} the {{architect}} Deligne in 1853; her second marriage {{was to the}} leading tenor Louis Guéymard in 1858.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lauters</b> studied {{under the}} {{sculptor}} Charles Malaise (1775-1836) at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts from 1820 to 1823. From 1823 {{he worked for}} the Gouban & Dewasme-Pletinckx lithographic company {{at the same time as}} Jean-Baptiste Madou. In 1836 he taught at the École Royale de Gravure. He collaborated with the painter Théodore Fourmois in 1839, producing images of the abbey ruins at Villers-la-Ville. In 1840 <b>Lauters</b> produced illustrations for Les Aventures de Till Eulenspiegel and for Les Aventures de Jean-Paul Choppart. During this period François Stroobant was his student. In 1846 <b>Lauters</b> illustrated Le Juif errant. In 1848 he was appointed professor at the Académie des Beaux-Arts of Brussels. He illustrated several popular books including Les Environs de Bruxelles (12 lithographs) and La Légende de Thyl Uilenspiegel (woodcuts, 1868) by Charles de Coster. About 1872 Amédée Lynen (1852-1938) was his student. In 1874 he published Principes de paysages.|$|R
50|$|Most breweries use {{infusion}} mashing, {{in which}} the mash is heated directly to go from rest temperature to rest temperature. Some infusion mashes achieve temperature changes by adding hot water, {{and there are also}} breweries that do single-step infusion, performing only one rest before <b>lautering.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mashing is {{the process}} of mixing milled, usually malted, grain with water, and heating it with rests at certain {{temperatures}} to allow enzymes in the malt to break down the starches in the grain into sugars, especially maltose. <b>Lautering</b> is the separation of the extracts won during mashing from the spent grain to create wort. It is achieved in either a lauter tun, a wide vessel with a false bottom, or a mash filter, a plate-and-frame filter designed for this kind of separation. <b>Lautering</b> has two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract that remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water.|$|E
50|$|Steps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing, <b>lautering,</b> boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. There {{are three}} main {{fermentation}} methods, warm, cool and spontaneous. Fermentation may {{take place in}} an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the cask or bottle. There are several additional brewing methods, such as barrel aging, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square.|$|E

50|$|The Musical World (24 February 1855) {{reported}} that Madame <b>Lauters</b> had been coached by Gilbert Duprez:Never could singer be under more unfit master for an opera like Der Freischütz. M. Duprez {{seems to have}} considered this masterpiece from the Castil-Blaze point of view; and as the &#39;maestro&#39; had taken liberties with this great composer's text, the &#39;professore&#39; thought he might, with equal good grace, embellish and vary the melodies. He set himself to work, and spared not roulades, shakes, and ricercate, whereof Weber had no idea, and which, had he heard them, would have driven him mad. Madame <b>Lauters</b> thought she could not go wrong in following the advice of so great {{a master of the}} art vocal as M. Duprez, and accordingly she repeated, note for note, what he had taught her. The public delighted at a tour de force, quand même, applauded 'to the echo;' and it was only on reading the feuilletons of the principal journalists that Madame <b>Lauters</b> woke from her dream of contented happiness. Like a sensible woman she profited by advice, though the cup was bitter and the dose strong. I have heard her again, and was delighted to find she had discarded M. Duprez and returned to Weber. A greater improvement, a more decided change for the better, I could hardly have imagined; nor could there be a greater treat than to hear Weber's exquisite melodies uttered by the rich and musical voice of Madame <b>Lauters.</b>|$|R
50|$|When kilning is complete, {{the grains}} are now termed malt, {{and they will}} be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which {{contains}} the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing. Milling also separates the seed from the husk. Care must be taken when milling to ensure that the starch reserves are sufficiently milled without damaging the husk and providing coarse enough grits that a good filter bed can be formed during <b>lautering.</b> Grains are typically dry-milled with roller mills or hammer mills. Hammer mills, which produce a very fine mash, are often used when mash filters are going to be employed in the <b>lautering</b> process because the grain does not have to form its own filter bed. In modern plants, the grain is often conditioned with water before it is milled to make the husk more pliable, thus reducing breakage and improving lauter speed.|$|E
5000|$|Mashing {{converts}} the starches released {{during the}} malting stage into sugars {{that can be}} fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed {{together to create a}} cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This [...] "conversion" [...] is called saccharification. The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or [...] "wort", which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as <b>lautering.</b> Prior to <b>lautering,</b> the mash temperature may be raised to about 75 - 78 C (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as sparging).|$|E
50|$|Large breweries have {{self-closing}} inlets on {{the bottom}} of the tun through which the mash is transferred to the lauter tun, and one outlet, also {{on the bottom}} of the tun, into which the spent grains fall after <b>lautering</b> is complete. Craft breweries often have manways on the side of the mash tun for spent grain removal, which then must be helped along to a large extent by the brewer.|$|E

Under the influence of Constantin Meunier and the Dutch landscape painter Paul Gabriël who was then living in Brussels and the reading of Hendrik Conscience's novels which extolled the virtues of the peasants of the Campine, Van Leemputten started to devote himself almost exclusively to the depiction of that region and its inhabitants.

50|$|Starch is an {{enormous}} molecule made up of branching chains of glucose molecules. β-amylase breaks down these chains from the end molecules forming links of two glucose molecules, i.e. maltose. β-amylase cannot break down the branch points, although some help is found here through low α-amylase activity and enzymes such as limit dextrinase. The maltose will be the yeast's main food source during fermentation. During this rest starches also cluster together forming visible bodies in the mash. This clustering eases the <b>lautering</b> process.|$|E
50|$|During mashing, the {{coarsely}} ground barley malt {{is subjected to}} hydration with water at different temperature-time regimes, which helps in a slow break down of starch molecules into simple carbohydrates, bringing in the balanced combination of carbohydrates and proteins. In the <b>lautering</b> stage, all the soluble solids from the barley malt are extracted avoiding harsh and astringent components from the barley malt husk, leaving behind wort. The extracted wort is boiled along with hops which adds a hoppy aroma and bitter taste to the malt extract. The malt extract is stabilized and sterilised during boiling.|$|E
