40|$|In many {{countries}} where international trade is dense, many sectors were negatively {{affected by the}} crisis. One of the sectorswhich were affected by the crisis was the logistics sector. The surplus capacity which {{was caused by the}} trading volume shrinkingas a result of the global crisis and by decreased orders took effect in the world and therefore in our country with its global logisticsdimension. Since logistics activities have a significant share in operating costs, even small cost differences occurred in the activities suchas transportation, storing, stock management, packaging, etc. directly affect competitive power. In this context, the logistics sector is a sector which is directly affected by all kinds of fluctuations in the economy of acountry. The financial crisis reduces the demand for logistics services and the sector becomes narrow. In the present study, it isaimed to reveal whether the sector which is quite new for our country is capable of dealing with the decreased trading volume ornot using SWOT analysis. The stakeholders in the present study are logistics sector, transportation sector, the Turkish State Railways, the TurkishAirlines, the Turkey Maritime Organization, storage firms, academicians, students in the departments of <b>logistics,</b> the employeesof <b>Directorate</b> General of Customs Control. 248 of the 600 questionnaire forms sent to the abovementioned stakeholders were filled and the results were based on thefindings obtained. The strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and the threats related to the logistics sector and competitionanalysis under the effect of the global crisis have been unrevealed {{based on the results of}} the survey data administered to thestakeholders. The results obtained are as follows;Strengths• Increased demand of qualified human resources of firms,• Strong capital structures of firms,• Rich alternatives of firms over selecting transporting points,• Big size of fleet in land transportation,• Possible points to locate a logistics base and harbours,• Ability to establish supply chain,,• Low cost of human resources,• Employment of human resources that have experience in logistics training,• Experience in crisis management. Weaknesses• Lack of qualified personnel and lack of experience in firms,• Lack of use of technology in firms,• Lack of use of information technologies, • Lack of information technologies in use,• Under use of environmentally friendly transportation systems,• Over use of land transport,• Lack of information of and interest in legal regulations,• Difficulty in external funding,• Very less interest in railway transportation,• Lack of infrastructure investment by firms in ports,• Lack of interfirm cooperation toward establishment of logistics bases. Opportunities• Increasing number of departments to provide logistics educations in universities. • Rapid development in logistics technologies,• Geographic location that permit different modes of transportation,• Experience in market economy,• Legal regulations that encourage environmentally friendly transportation,• Human resources that will be employed in logistics sector,• Geographical location suitable for logistical bases. Threats• Lack of qualified personnel,• Political instability and chaos,• Ever increasing oil prices,• Competitive advantage of foreign firms in the market,• Terror problem,• Lack of infrastructure in modes of transportation,• The adaptation problem that will appear in the use of environmentally friendly transportation systems,• Lack of infrastructure in point of transfer and distribution,• Inelastic structure of rail transportation,• Economic crisis. When the effects of the global crisis, which penetrated the entire world, on Turkish logistics sector are analyzed, it is seenthat, as SWOT analysis results show, being located in a strategic geographical position was not enough for the sector not to beaffected by the crisis. Inefficient use of environmentally friendly transportation systems amplifies the problem of harmonizationwith the European Union countries. Despite our young and dynamic population, lack of trained personnel in the sector and lackof experience amplifies the negative effects of the crisis on the sector. It is thought that competition will change direction as the sector grows and reshapes. It is anticipated that competition will bebetween foreign companies and domestic large companies rather than between domestic large and small companies with thecompletion of the investments of international logistics companies in Turkey in the next few years. The companies which are ableto provide services in the largest geography with the largest service diversity and which minimize their costs will get the biggestcompetition opportunity. Low logistics service quality despite high logistics costs within the framework of logistics processes are the leading factors inthe development of the logistics sector. It is important to optimize especially operational process costs and the time costs of otheroperations among logistics costs in the future and in these days when the global crisis takes effect. In addition, the measuresdirected to accelerate flow of goods such as reducing stock costs, establishing a working environment close to zero stock,shortening delivery times, creating a door to door delivery environment will increase logistics performance. One of the significantfactors is information technology infrastructure. The quality of the information and data related to physical movements is of greatimportance for all parties, and directly affect logistics performance. The main way for the sector to obtain a competitive power, to accomplish the desired targets and to sustain it is a logisticsphysical infrastructure, facilitated customs clearance, facilitated adaptation and processes, regulations related to transportationlegislation and the cooperation between the stakeholders of the sector (enterprise, state, chambers, unions). It is understood fromthe results of the analysis made that the logistics sector needs to establish a balance between the surviving strategies and theimprovement strategies in terms of cost and efficiency in order to maximize and sustain its competitive power. The main way for the sector to obtain a competitive power, to accomplish the desired targets and to sustain it is a logisticsphysical infrastructure, facilitated customs clearance, facilitated adaptation and processes, regulations related to transportationlegislation and the cooperation between the stakeholders of the sector (enterprise, state, chambers, union...|$|R
