500|$|The {{final phase}} of {{principal}} photography took place in Alberta in late November2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort, Fortress Mountain. An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build. The production {{had to wait for}} a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived. The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favorite James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969): [...] "What I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> it that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{focused on}} the Macintosh platform, not Windows-based {{personal}} computers, because the Mac market was more open and Jones had been raised on the platform.

With no money to hire other personnel, the two assembled Minotaur boxes by hand in Seropian's apartment. While the pair remained low on funds—Seropian's wife was largely supporting him—the modest success of Minotaur gave the duo enough money to develop another project.|$|E

500|$|Jones met Alex Seropian in {{his second}} year at the University of Chicago, {{studying}} computer science.

Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever it is you <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|E

500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority... 'I'm {{going to do it}} my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's what I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> her, this energy. [...] was special and had this mystical quality." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Mick Garris was {{attached}} to direct but eventually left the project, and Wes Craven was offered the film but turned it down. Then, Stephen Sommers called Jacks and Daniel in 1997 with his vision of The Mummy [...] "as a kind of Indiana Jones or Jason and the Argonauts with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time". Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> it on a bigger scale. He had {{wanted to make a}} Mummy film since 1993, but other writers or directors were always attached. Finally, Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18-page treatment. At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failure of , and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s. Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15million to $80million.|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{played his}} first game aged nine as a wicket-keeper in the North Fitzroy Central School team, {{the average age of}} which was 14. In a school final, he once made 112 of the total of 140. Aged twelve, he joined the local Fitzroy club and rose to the first grade team when he was fourteen. By this stage he had {{transferred}} to Collingwood Technical School. On the advice of the Victorian coach, Arthur Liddicut, Harvey stopped wicket-keeping to focus on his batting. Joe Plant another Fitzroy veteran also gave advice on batting. Both Liddicut and Plant identified Harvey's potential as a batsman." [...] What they <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> him was his modesty, his eagerness to pick up every point in the game, and his willingness to listen to the old hands." [...] Briefly playing for Fitzroy Football Club, Harvey gave up the sport and played baseball during winter. After leaving school, Harvey worked as an apprentice fitter and turner for the Melbourne City Council. The apprenticeship was supposed to take three years, but it eventually took six years because Harvey's cricket career caused frequent absences.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|Paltrow's final {{appearance}} in the [...] "A Night of Neglect" [...] episode was met with divergent reactions. Both MTV journalist Aly Semigran and Gonzalez approved of Holly's departure, the latter of whom stating that Glee writers gave the character an appropriate ending and rounded out her arc. In contrast, CNN writer Lisa Respers France was dismayed by the character's exit and favored Holly's [...] "memorable" [...] characterization in the episode. The Washington Post Lisa de Moraes expressed interest in a season three return, and Canning described Holly as [...] "charming as ever" [...] in the episode. Myles McNutt, writing for The A.V. Club, felt the installment [...] "captured the occasional awkwardness of Paltrow's presence on the show", and wrote that casting such a prominent actress [...] "has its disadvantages when you know that she's only around on a temporary basis". TVLine correspondent Michael Slezak noted that Will and Emma's romance—and that Paltrow probably {{was not ready to}} commit to the series full-time—led to Holly's adieu. Slezak concluded that what he <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> Holly, was that she did not succumb to Will, which, according to Slezak, made him less annoying.|$|E
500|$|Pope Francis is [...] "the first Pope who {{has dealt}} with Opus Dei closely as a bishop", and {{according}} to James V. Schall, S.J., is a [...] "friend of Opus Dei." [...] Francis referred to St. Josemaria as [...] "a precursor of Vatican II in proposing the universal call to holiness." [...] In the analysis of John Allen, Pope Francis' strong dislike for clericalism, which he calls [...] "one of the worst evils" [...] in the Church is a key factor for [...] "what Francis admires about Opus Dei, since Escrivá’s emphasis on {{the dignity of the}} laity was a challenge to the ultra-clerical ethos of Spanish Catholicism in the late 1920s." [...] He has a devotion to St. Josemaria, and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes, when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome. Francis beatified Alvaro del Portillo, the successor of Escriva. What Bergoglio most <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> Opus Dei was the work done for the poor by one of its schools in Buenos Aires. He thanks Opus Dei for its work to further the holiness of priests in the Roman Curia.|$|E

500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] is just going to be the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end."

500|$|Scott Derrickson {{did not see}} a lookbook for Doctor Strange, instead putting {{together}} his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and {{his vision of the}} film to Marvel.

Taika Waititi created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they [...] "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was [...] "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films. For Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they [...] "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", {{putting together}} [...] "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, you name it. We did like a 30-page book that had everything that we’d do with the character, from the theme of the movie to the tone of the film to the fighting style to what we <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> the character and what we didn’t like".
