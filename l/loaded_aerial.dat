40|$|In this work, a {{trajectory}} tracking controller structure for a systemcomposed of a <b>load</b> and an <b>aerial</b> vehicle, which are {{connected by a}} rope, is presented. The main goal is to design a controller that guarantees that the load tracks a desired trajectory asymptotically. The load is modeled as a point mass while the aerial vehicle {{is assumed to be}} fully actuated. The <b>load</b> and the <b>aerial</b> vehicle are connected via a ropelike structure of fixed length that can only withstand tensile forces along itsorientation. This system can be transformed into a form that resembles the form of systems used to describe underactuated aerial vehicles. A backstepping procedure is used to design a nonlinear control law whichis based on a controller for a double integrator. A bounded controllaw for double integrators is developed such that the position of the load converges to the desired trajectory for initial positions that are arbitrarily far away from the desired trajectory. The proposed controller structure has been verified both in simulations and with experiments using quadcopters at the Smart Mobility Lab at KTH...|$|R

50|$|An aerial crane or {{flying crane}} is a {{helicopter}} used to lift heavy <b>loads.</b> As <b>aerial</b> cranes, helicopters carry loads connected to long cables or slings {{in order to}} place heavy equipment when other methods are not available or economically feasible, or when the job must be accomplished in remote or inaccessible areas, such as the tops of tall buildings or {{the top of a}} hill or mountain, far from the nearest road. Helicopters were first used as aerial cranes in the 1950s, {{but it was not until}} the 1960s that their popularity in construction and other industries began to catch on. The most consistent use of helicopters as aerial cranes is in the logging industry to lift large trees out of rugged terrain where vehicles aren't able to reach, or where environmental concerns prohibit the buildings of roads. These operations are referred to as longline because of the long, single sling line used to carry the load.|$|R

50|$|Soil survey, soil mapping, is {{the process}} of {{classifying}} soil types and other soil properties in a given area and geo-encoding such information. It applies the principles of soil science, and draws heavily from geomorphology, theories of soil formation, physical geography, and analysis of vegetation and land use patterns. Primary data for the soil survey are acquired by field sampling and by remote sensing. Remote sensing principally uses aerial photography, but LiDAR and other digital techniques are steadily gaining in popularity. In the past, a soil scientist would take hard-copies of aerial photography, topo-sheets, and mapping keys into the field with them. Today, a growing number of soil scientists bring a ruggedized tablet computer and GPS into the field with them.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the study of}} cooperative manipulation of a cable-suspended <b>load</b> with two <b>aerial</b> robots and without explicit communication. The role of the internal force for the asymptotic stability of the beam-position/beam-attitude equilibria is analyzed in depth. Using a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that if a non-zero internal force is chosen then asymptotic stabilization of any desired beam-pose configuration can be achieved with a decentralized and communication-less master-slave admittance controller. If, conversely, a zero internal force is chosen, as done {{in the majority of}} the state-of-the-art algorithms, the attitude of the beam is not controllable without communication. Non-zero internal force can be interpreted then as a fundamental factor that enables the use of cables as implicit communication means between the two aerial vehicles in replacement of the explicit ones. Furthermore, the formal proof of the system output-strictly passivity with respect to an energy-like storage function and a certain input-output pair is given. This proves the stability and the robustness of the method even during motion. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations with added noise and realistic uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{field and}} laboratory scale study of 10 European lakes treated between 2006 and 2013 with a lanthanum (La) modified bentonite (LMB) to control sediment phosphorus (P) release was conducted. The study followed the responses in sediment characteristics including La and P fractions and binding forms, P adsorption capacity of discrete sediment layers, and pore water P concentrations. Lanthanum phosphate mineral phases were confirmed by solid state 31 P MAS NMR and L III EXAFS spectroscopy. Rhabdophane (LaPO 4 · nH 2 O) {{was the major}} phase although indications of monazite (LaPO 4) formation were also reported, in the earliest treated lake. Molar ratios between La and P in the sediments were generally above 1, demonstrating excess La relative to P. Lanthanum was vertically mixed in the sediment down {{to a depth of}} 10 cm for eight of the ten lakes, and recovery of La in excess of 100 % of the theoretical <b>aerial</b> <b>load</b> indicated translocation of the LMB towards the deepest areas of the lakes. Lanthanum was generally recovered from bed sediment samples following sequential chemical extraction from the HCl fraction.

This is beta software and the methods and algorithms are continuously being improved upon. Please report any errors you find in the software to the Remote Sensing Laboratory. The algorithms for tree detection used in the application {{are based on a}} PhD thesis by Richard J ames Pollock (1996), University of British Columbia, Canada. The application is build upon two software libraries, Intel® Image Processing Library, IPL ©and wxWindows ©. The I PL is used for image processing and wx Windows is used as a graphical user interface. The report contains three major sections, a manual, a method description and a software description. The manual is for someone, without any prior knowledge of template matching, who wants to run the software. The method and software descriptions are for someone that wants to build a similar application as Tree D or as a support for in-house development at the Remote Sensing Laboratory. The TreeD 0. 8 application is available at the Remote Sensing Laboratory, SLU and is primarily used as a research tool for single tree detection. The software runs on a Microsoft® Windows 2 000 workstation. The application binary depends on the Intel® Image Processing Library, IPL © DLLs and consequently they need to be put into the same folder as the program. All of these binaries can be found at SLU. The input to the application is an aerial/satellite image (central or orthogonal projection), a tree library, information about the camera and solar positions, and a path to a directory to put the results in. The current status of the input variables can be viewed and changed before starting the correlation of the image.

40|$|Managers and {{communities}} are now artificially reintroducing instream woody habitat (IWH) to rivers following historic large-scale removal. Riverscape-scale datasets that quantify existing habitat conditions are fundamental to setting the priorities and allocating resources for such programs. Unfortunately, such datasets are rare, primarily because existing assessment approaches {{are limited in}} their accuracy (remote sensing) or are costly and labour intensive (field assessments). This study used both field assessments and aerial data to improve the accuracy of remotely sensed measures of IWH and estimate current IWH volumes and subsequent condition (compared with reference levels) across approximately 28 [*] 000 [*]km of stream in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria. We found that aerial measures, when {{used in conjunction with}} measures of stream size and riparian overhang, produced significantly better estimates of IWH <b>loads</b> than using <b>aerial</b> data alone. The statewide assessment indicated that streams currently have IWH volumes, on average, 41 % lower than reference levels that represented an average reduction of 0. 0207 [*]m 3 [*]m− 2. The degree of IWH condition was highly variable across regions (20 – 95 % reductions from reference levels), a likely reflection of regional variation in land use practices and past river work activities. This scale of IWH reduction may pose major negative impacts on the ecological integrity of these streams. Whilst the approach used during this study has temporal and spatial limitations, it was designed as a generalised, rapid and relatively inexpensive method to measure stream condition and assist with priority setting at state and regional levels.

40|$|Lake Rotorua {{is a large}} (area 79 km²), shallow (mean depth 10. 8 m), {{polymictic}} lake {{in central}} North Island, New Zealand. The lake is eutrophic, with a mean external <b>aerial</b> <b>load</b> of 18. 5 mg m⁻² d⁻¹ for total nitrogen and 1. 2 mg m⁻² d⁻¹ for total phosphorus. Blooms of cyanobacteria and occasional anoxia of bottom waters occur during summer (December–March). We used a vertically resolved water quality model, DYRESM–CAEDYM, to examine {{the relative importance of}} internal and external nutrient inputs on water column nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass, with particular emphasis on cyanobacteria. External nutrient loads associated with nine major inflows to the lake and three additional inflows representing smaller geothermal and coldwater flows and residual flows, were represented as inputs to the model. Other forcing inputs to the model included local meteorological data, discharge from the only outflow, the Ohau Channel, and measured rates of sediment nutrient release obtained from benthic chamber deployments which were used to prescribe ranges of sediment nutrient release that were simulated dynamically within the model. Profiles of water column nutrient concentrations, surface chlorophyll a concentrations and continuous temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements were used to validate the model. Simulated water column temperature and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH 4) concentrations closely matched field measurements, and captured the timing and duration of stratification events as well as subsequent changes in bottom water nutrient concentrations. Surface water concentrations of chlorophyll a were also similar between simulated and observed data. Model simulations indicate that reductions in sediment nutrient fluxes would be more effective in reducing cyanobacterial biomass than similar proportional reductions in catchment fluxes, due to the coincidence of large sediment nutrient release events with high cyanobacterial biomass. This finding indicates that only a significant and prolonged reduction in external loads, which in turn reduces internal loads, will ultimately reduce cyanobacterial biomass in Lake Rotorua...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we address}} {{problems}} that can occur during <b>load</b> transport using <b>aerial</b> robots, i. e., small scale quadrotors. First, detailed models of such transportation system are derived. These models include nonlinear models of a quadrotor, {{a model of a}} quadrotor carrying a fixed load and a model of a quadrotor carrying a suspended load. Second, the problem of quadrotor stabilization and trajectory tracking with changes of the center of gravity of the transportation system is addressed. This problem is solved using model reference adaptive control based on output feedback linearization that compensates for dynamical changes in the center of gravity of the quadrotor. The third problem we address is a problem of a swing-free transport of suspended load using quadrotors. Flying with a suspended load can be a very challenging and sometimes hazardous task as the suspended load significantly alters the flight characteristics of the quadrotor. In order to deal with suspended load flight, we present a method based on dynamic programming which is a model based offline method. The second investigated method we use is based on the Nelder-Mead algorithm which is an optimization technique used for nonlinear unconstrained optimization problems. This method is model free and it can be used for offline or online generation of the swing-free trajectories for the suspended load. Besides the swing-free maneuvers with suspended load, load trajectory tracking is another problem we solve in this dissertation. In order to solve this problem we use a Nelder-Mead based algorithm. In addition, we use an online least square policy iteration algorithm. At the end, we propose a high level algorithm for navigation in cluttered environments considering a quadrotor with suspended load. Furthermore, distributed control of multiple quadrotors with suspended load is addressed too. The proposed hierarchical architecture presented in this doctoral dissertation is an important step towards developing the next generation of agile autonomous aerial vehicles. These control algorithms enable quadrotors to display agile maneuvers while reconfiguring in real time whenever a change in the center of gravity occurs. This enables a swing-free load transport or trajectory tracking of the load in urban environments in a decentralized fashion.

40|$|By taking {{advantage}} of complementary communication technologies, distinct sensing functionalities and varied motion dynamics present in a heterogeneous multi-robotic network, {{it is possible to}} accomplish a main mission objective by assigning specialized sub-tasks to specific members of a robotic team. An adequate selection of the team members and an effective coordination are some of the challenges to fully exploit the unique capabilities that these types of systems can offer. Motivated by real world applications, we focus on a multi-robotic network consisting off aerial and ground agents which has the potential to provide critical support to humans in complex settings. For instance, aerial robotic relays are capable of transporting small ground mobile sensors to expand the communication range and the situational awareness of first responders in hazardous environments. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we extend work on manipulation of cable-suspended <b>loads</b> using <b>aerial</b> robots by solving the problem of lifting the cable-suspended load from the ground before proceeding to transport it. Since the suspended load-quadrotor system experiences switching conditions during this critical maneuver, we define a hybrid system and show that it is differentially-flat. This property facilitates the design of a nonlinear controller which tracks a waypoint-based trajectory associated with the discrete states of the hybrid system. In addition, we address the case of unknown payload mass by combining a least-squares estimation method with the designed controller. Second, we focus on the coordination of a heterogeneous team formed by a group of ground mobile sensors and a flying communication router which is deployed to sense areas of interest in a cluttered environment. Using potential field methods, we propose a controller for the coordinated mobility of the team to guarantee inter-robot and obstacle collision avoidance as well as connectivity maintenance among the ground agents while the main goal of sensing is carried out. For the case of the aerial communications relays, we combine antenna diversity with reinforcement learning to dynamically re-locate these relays so that the received signal strength is maintained above a desired threshold. Motivated by the recent interest of combining radio frequency and optical wireless communications, we envision the implementation of an optical link between micro-scale aerial and ground robots. This type of link requires maintaining a sufficient relative transmitter-receiver position for reliable communications. In the third part of this thesis, we tackle this problem. Based on the link model, we define a connectivity cone where a minimum transmission rate is guaranteed. For example, the aerial robot has to track the ground vehicle to stay inside this cone. The control must be robust to noisy measurements. Thus, we use particle filters to obtain a better estimation of the receiver position and we design a control algorithm for the flying robot to enhance the transmission rate. Also, we consider the problem of pairing a ground sensor with an aerial vehicle, both equipped with a hybrid radio-frequency/optical wireless communication system. A challenge is positioning the flying robot within optical range when the sensor location is unknown. Thus, we take advantage of the hybrid communication scheme by developing a control strategy that uses the radio signal to guide the aerial platform to the ground sensor. Once the optical-based signal strength has achieved a certain threshold, the robot hovers within optical range. Finally, we investigate the problem of building an alliance of agents with different skills in order to satisfy the requirements imposed by a given task. We find this alliance, known also as a coalition, by using a bipartite graph in which edges represent the relation between agent capabilities and required resources for task execution. Using this graph, we build a coalition whose total capability resources can satisfy the task resource requirements. Also, we study the heterogeneity of the formed coalition to analyze how it is affected for instance by the amount of capability resources present in the agents.
