40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring <b>loaded</b> <b>socket</b> uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket.

40|$|Abstract — On a {{multi-socket}} architecture {{with load}} below peak, {{as is often}} the case in a server installation, it is common to consolidate <b>load</b> onto fewer <b>sockets</b> to save processor power. However, this can increase main memory power consumption due to the decreased total cache space. This paper describes inter-socket victim cacheing, a technique that enables such a system to do both load consolidation and cache aggregation at the same time. It uses the last level cache of an idle processor in a connected socket as a victim cache, holding evicted data from the active processor. This enables expensive main memory accesses to be replaced by cheaper cache hits. This work examines both static and dynamic victim cache management policies. Energy savings is as high as 32. 5 %, and averages 5. 8 %. I...|$|R

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 10328 was designed to test most lower-limb prosthetic components. However, this standard does not include prosthetic sockets. We measured static failure <b>loads</b> of prosthetic <b>sockets</b> using a modified ISO 10328 and then compared them with the criteria set by this standard for other components. Check socket (CS) strengths were influenced by thickness, material choice, and fabrication method. Copolymer socket (CP) strengths depended on thickness and fabrication methods. A majority of the CSs {{and all of the}} CPs failed to pass the ISO 10328 ductile loading criterion. In contrast, the strengths of definitive laminated sockets (DLs) were influenced more by construction material and technique. A majority of the DLs failed to pass the ISO 10328 brittle loading criterion. Analyzing prosthetic sockets from a variety of facilities demonstrated that socket perfor-mance varies considerably between and within facilities.

For analysis purposes, the most adverse <b>socket</b> <b>loading</b> is obtained at the push-off stage of gait; this loading is idealized as an axial in-plane loading on the bottom edge of the circular cylindrical socket shell whose top edge is considered fixed. Finite element stress analysis of the socket shell (with uniform and graded wall thickness) are performed for various orientations of the cutout and for various types of corner fillets. A lateral cutout with a streamline fillet is recommended. The wall material (i. e., thickness) distribution is determined so as to minimize the stresses, while ensuring that the wall material's stress limits are not exceeded.

However all sizes {{and types of}} {{construction}} require an effective method for attaching the ropes to other structures. One popular termination technique, particu-larly for larger diameter ropes, consists of using a steel conical socket into which a polyester resin mix is poured, creating a joint which secures the individual wires of the rope. The UK Health and Safety Laboratory were contracted by the UK Health and Safety Executive- Offshore Safety Division {{to carry out a}} series of large scale impact tests on 25 mm compacted stranded wire rope (this rope size is commonly used for offshore cranes and diving bell handling equipment) to determine if rope's performance was affected by strain rate. It was noted early in the testing programme that under dynamic <b>loading,</b> the rope <b>socket</b> often failed, whilst under static loading the wire rope always failed. The experimental data showed that the force and energy absorbed when the socket failed was considerably lower than the minimum specified for the wire rope.

40|$|Objectives: The {{impact of}} single {{implants}} on oral health-related {{quality of life}} (OHRQoL) is scarcely investigated, especially when combined with immediate placement and <b>loading</b> in extraction <b>sockets.</b> The aim was to describe prospectively the changes of OHRQoL with single implants placed in the esthetic zone in healed ridges or in extraction sockets after 5 years. Material and Methods: Ninety-six patients, enrolled at three clinical centers, received 102 single implants placed in a healed ridge (n = 54 implants/ 50 patients) or in extraction sockets (n = 48 implants/ 46 patients). Implants were immediately provisionalized, and permanent crowns were cemented after 12 weeks. Oral health impact profile questionnaires (OHIP- 14) were completed before surgery, after 1 (provisional crown), 6 (permanent crown), 12 and 60 months, respectively. The overall OHIP- 14 score pertains to seven domains with two items each and was assessed on a Likert scale of 0 – 4 (0 = never and 4 = very often). The evolution of the total OHIP- 14 score and changes within all OHIP domains over time and between groups were assessed with a linear mixed-effect model analysis. Results: After 5 years, overall implant survival was 98 %. The total OHIP- 14 score for both groups combined decreased from 0. 50 at baseline to 0. 17 at 6 months (P < 0. 001), indicative of improvement. For both groups, this remained stable up to 5 years (P = 0. 41). However, after 5 years, the total OHIP- 14 score revealed a statistically significantly higher improvement in the healed group compared with the extraction group (P = 0. 027). Conclusion: Missing a single tooth in the maxillary esthetic zone leads to limited OHRQoL problems as reflected by a low overall OHIP score. However, OHRQoL improves less in the extraction group, reflecting that replacing a missing tooth is perceived as more beneficial than replacing a present tooth...|$|R

Historically, prosthetists have relied on past experience, patient feedback, and indirect indications of <b>load</b> to gauge <b>socket</b> fit. The clinical measurement of interface pressures {{has the potential to}} provide quantitative, objective information to help in the evaluation of prosthetic fit. Tests of the Tekscan F-Socket system have been performed over flat and curved surfaces, but not using axial load and the {{presence of}} a gel liner to more closely simulate a clinical setting. This study investigates how drift and cyclic drift errors of the F-Socket system are affected by surface curvature and the presence of a gel liner interface. For drift, a known constant axial load was applied by a servo-hydraulic testing machine for 20 minutes. Samples were taken at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. For cyclic drift, load was alternated in a known range at 0. 5 Hz for 10 minutes. Samples were taken at 1, 5, and 10 minutes. These tests were performed under four conditions: flat rigid, flat with liner, round rigid, and round with liner. It was found that drift error was significantly affected by the curvature of the model, but not by the presence of a gel liner. It was also found that cyclic drift was not affected by the curvature of the model, but was by the presence of a gel liner. Further study should be done with other curvatures, other liners, and other sensor properties such as hysteresis and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose : Cone beam CT (CBCT) {{provides}} three‐dimensional {{information and}} could absolutely {{be useful for}} evaluating circumferential implant bone levels. However, the accuracy and precision of the technique has not been described. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the accuracy and precision of CBCT (i-CAT) using periapical radiographs (PA) as a reference and to evaluate the circumferential bone level on CBCT around immediately loaded single implants placed in healed ridges (CIT) and extraction sockets (IIT). Material and methods : PA and CBCT radiographs were obtained from 26 single Astra Tech Osseospeed™ implants 1 year after immediate loading. For accuracy analysis, the 3 mesial and 3 distal interproximal levels obtained by CBCT were pooled to enable a comparison with PA. Precision was analyzed by intra- and inter-examiner reliability calculation from mesial and distal sites on CBCT. The circumferential bone level considered all 8 positions assessed on CBCT. Results : Accuracy of CBCT was low (R= 0. 325 /p= 0. 019) given the fact that bone level of the total group was 0. 70 mm (SD 0. 78, range 0. 00 - 3. 20) on PA and 0. 23 mm (SD 0. 27, 0. 00 - 1. 20) on CBCT (p< 0. 001) with only 42 % of the measurements showing deviation within 0. 2 mm. However, intra- and inter-examiner reliability were favourable (R≥ 0. 611 /p< 0. 001, ≥ 83 %). The mean circumferential bone level on CBCT was 0. 21 mm (SD 0. 30) and 0. 26 mm (SD 0. 18) for IIT and CIT, respectively. The impact of the treatment strategy was not significant. Conclusion : PA should be the standard technique in the clinical situation and CBCT is a valuable technique when more accurate information is needed. CBCT correlates poorly with interproximal bone level on PA, however, the precision of CBCT was high. CBCT requires further improvements of hardware and/or software. Within the limitations of the study there is an indication that the buccal bone 1 year after implant treatment is evenly preserved when implants are immediately <b>loaded</b> in extraction <b>sockets</b> or in healed bone...|$|R
40|$|Limb {{amputation}} is {{a surgical}} procedure performed {{to remove a}} whole or {{a part of a}} limb in an attempt to save the residual limb from any further damage. Amputees typically use artificial limbs (also called “prostheses”) as rehabilitation tools to restore their daily activities and cosmetic appearance. Unfortunately, almost all amputees are dissatisfied with their existing prostheses because of the poor fitting of prosthetic sockets. Despite the considerable advances in the pressure measurement techniques employed over the past five decades to map pressure distribution within prosthetic sockets, these techniques still exhibit several limitations, including their bulkiness (i. e., strain gauge transducers) and vulnerability to hysteresis, drift, and creases (i. e., piezoresistive and capacitive transducers). Therefore, developing a new technique that offers valid and reliable pressure measurement within prosthetic sockets is deemed necessary to help prosthetic professionals fabricate better-designed sockets that provide a good fit and amputee’s satisfaction. This research aims to investigate the feasibility of optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors as a potential alternative to the aforementioned techniques to spot peak pressures within prosthetic sockets. First, a single FBG flexible sensing pad was designed and evaluated at the anterior proximal region of the residual limb to assess its performance in dynamic conditions. This sensor was tested in real time by inserting a heavy-duty balloon into the socket and inflating/deflating it using an air compressor to mimic the actual amputee’s gait. Promising results in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, and hysteresis were obtained. These findings encouraged me to fabricate a series of FBG sensing pads with full consideration of three key fabrication parameters: different FBG embedding depth, sensing pad thickness, and host material hardness. Results revealed that the FBGs embedded in the neutral layer of hard and thick sensing pads exhibited the highest sensitivity and excellent accuracy. This concept was subsequently employed to fabricate four new expandable sensing pads with at least two sensing sites each to cover the proximal and distal sub-regions of each socket aspect. An amputee was involved to evaluate the in situ performance of this technique. The results were compared with the pressure measurements obtained using the commercially available F-socket sensors to validate the findings. The results revealed the advantages of the new sensor design as it could successfully detect all the events of an amputee’s gait. Higher pressure values were logged by the FBG sensors compared with the F-socket, which was attributed to the thickness of the sensor. However, the trend on pressure changes was similar for both sensor types. Eliminating the thickness drawback was achieved by embedding an array of FBGs within a custom fabricated silicone liner that is typically inserted in prosthetic sockets to cushion the transfer of <b>loads</b> from the <b>socket</b> to the residual limb. This FBG instrumented liner was designed so it could function both as a cushioning material and a sensing tool. No previous studies have implemented such a technique in prosthetic applications. Therefore, this research was the first investigation into the potential use of such a technique in prosthetic applications...|$|R
