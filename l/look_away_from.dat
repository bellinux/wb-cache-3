5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E

25|$|Roger Ebert {{instantly}} praised {{it as one}} of {{the greatest}} films he had ever seen, claiming: Taxi Driver is a hell, from the opening shot of a cab emerging from stygian clouds of steam to the climactic killing scene in which the camera finally looks straight down.

25|$|The dashboard's design {{originated}} {{from a large}} number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' radio and climate control modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the road to be able to operate them properly. As a result, {{a large portion of the}} third generation's dash was devoted to the radio and climate control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and climate control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the Integrated Control Panel.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{created the}} size of each robot with {{the size of}} their vehicle mode in mind, {{supporting}} the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth. The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why [...] "aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel". This reflected a desire to move to a more alien <b>look,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the [...] "blocky" [...] Transformers. Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line. The robots also had to look alien, or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man.|$|E
500|$|For the role, Bana shaved his head, gained thirty pounds, {{and spent}} two days with Read to perfect his mimicry. During filming he arrived on set {{at four in the}} morning and spent five hours being covered in Read's {{trademark}} tattoos. In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews. American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that [...] "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him". Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001. Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.|$|E

500|$|Joyner {{stated the}} episode uses [...] "the {{idea of having}} what the viewers are led to believe as reality exposed as a sham". Alexander affirmed this could be {{interpreted}} as questioning [...] "the assumptions we bring to the things we see – we can capture nearly any issue from all angles and pin it to virtual glass forever, but still only own a piece of the story, the unknowable remainder filled in by our own preconceptions". Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it [...] "builds on this idea of the reflection that you know is fake but can't <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> and internalizes it". With the plot twist, Stuart said, [...] "we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything". He also affirmed it questions [...] "our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story".|$|E
500|$|Director Tanuja Chandra, while filming Sangharsh in 1998, {{ascribed}} Zinta's screen {{appeal to}} {{her lack of}} acting pretense, commenting, [...] "She doesn't act, she's so real that you just can't <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her". Reviewing Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Hindustan Times, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that [...] "there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who [...] "can mould herself—the way she speaks, works and her body language—and adapt herself to roles," [...] while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of Mission Kashmir) credits her {{with the ability to}} [...] "make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation." [...] In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, [...] "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne– for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you might {{have to go back to}} Natalie Wood." [...] American critic Derek Elley considers her to be [...] "one of Bollywood's best pure actresses." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs are}} 6/4 meter, while some {{suggest that they}} are adaptations from violin tunes. [...] Yet, the barline does not always reflect the verbal rhythm. In {{comparing}} the song [...] "Ballowe my babe lye still and sleepe", no. 46 of Drexel 4257, with the version that appears in Elizabeth Roger's Virginal Book, Duckles notes that the (earlier) virginal version is in duple meter with no trace of hemiolas, while the version in the Gamble manuscript has them, suggesting a modernization of an older song. [...] Another example of continuo style is [...] "Like Hermitt poore in pensiue place obscure" [...] (no. 15), a lyric attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh and dating from 1591. [...] In comparing Alfonso Ferrabosco's setting from his Ayres of 1609 to one by Nicolas Lanier in Drexel 4257, Duckles admits the possibility that Lanier's may {{have been inspired by}} that of Ferrabosco. But the musical characteristics of the Lanier setting, including simplicity of texture, distinct phrases, use of an échappée, and the suggestion of [...] a rhythmic motif through use of a recurring pattern of eighth notes, point to contemporary text setting techniques. [...] The song [...] "Drowsie sun, why dostt thou stay" [...] by Thomas Brewer (no. 253) shows expressive false relations and harmonic word painting, foreshadowing later developments in British sacred music. Brewer's songs are among the earliest examples of the Italian pathetic style in English music and represent the mature style of continuo song. Devices such as an octave leap <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> lute song to continuo song.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the time}} of his 1976 MoMA exhibition, Eggleston was {{introduced}} to Viva, the Andy Warhol [...] "superstar", with whom he began a long relationship. During this period Eggleston became familiar with Andy Warhol's circle, a connection that may have helped foster Eggleston's idea of the [...] "democratic camera", Mark Holborn suggests. Also in the 1970s Eggleston experimented with video, producing several hours of roughly edited footage Eggleston calls Stranded in Canton. Writer Richard Woodward, who has viewed the footage, likens it to a [...] "demented home movie", mixing tender shots of his children at home with shots of drunken parties, public urination and a man biting off a chicken's head before a cheering crowd in New Orleans. Woodward suggests that the film is reflective of Eggleston's [...] "fearless naturalisma belief that by looking patiently at what others ignore or <b>look</b> <b>away</b> <b>from,</b> interesting things can be seen." ...|$|E
