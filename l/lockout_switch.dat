5000|$|Power windows {{have come}} under some {{scrutiny}} after several fatal accidents in which children's necks have become trapped, leading to suffocation. Some designs place the switch in a location on a hand rest {{where it can be}} accidentally triggered by a child climbing to place his or her head out of the window. To prevent this, many vehicles feature a driver-controlled <b>lockout</b> <b>switch,</b> preventing rear-seat passengers (usually smaller children) from accidentally triggering the switches. This also prevents children from using them as toys and pets riding with their heads out windows from activating the power window switch.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau http://www.poltronafrau.com/portal/page/portal/UI/webpages/poltronafrau/home?lang=en of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window <b>lockout</b> <b>switch</b> installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door pull handle.|$|E

50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the plush leather interior was designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau of Italy. The seats were made by Poltrona Frau at a rate of only five a day. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement used in the larger Nissan Infiniti Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window <b>lockout</b> <b>switch</b> installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door pull handle. This version of the Leopard was the first car sold in Japan to include a passenger-side airbag as standard equipment.|$|E
