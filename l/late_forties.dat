5|$|Charles T. Hinde (July 12, 1832– March 10, 1915) was an American industrialist, tycoon, riverboat captain, businessman, and entrepreneur. He managed many {{businesses}} and invested in numerous business ventures {{over the course}} of his life. Hinde served in executive leadership positions in the river navigation, shipping, railroad, and hotel businesses. By his <b>late</b> <b>forties,</b> Hinde had already amassed a great fortune from his work in the steamboat and railroad industries.|$|E
5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful man in his <b>late</b> <b>forties,</b> Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill {{in the hope that}} he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, but Bill insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E
5|$|In 996 {{when her}} father was posted to a {{four-year}} governorship in Echizen Province, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance on a trip that could {{take as long as}} five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 – c. 1001), a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his <b>late</b> <b>forties</b> {{at the time of their}} marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Accounts of their marriage vary: Richard Bowring writes that the marriage was happy, but Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband.|$|E
40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{correspondence}} exchanged by Paul Celan and poet and editor Petre Solomon {{beginning with the}} <b>late</b> <b>fourties.</b> The author builds on the definition that J. Dérrida gave to friendship – a dual relation that involves a shared affectivity, shared choice and also a symbolic “third”, which is the continuum of the discourse, {{in the case of}} friendship carried on through letters. Friendship is the pretext for an original analysis of the “secrecy” typical to Paul Celan’s poetry; the letters partially reveal some of the “secrets” of Celan’s poetry within the secure space of a discourse destined to a friend. Thus, the correspondence is the intruder and also an interpreter of the poetic mechanisms specific to Paul Celan...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{hardware}} {{realization of the}} Simplex Method, the central method of linear programming. We customized the algorithm regarding numerical stability (arithmetics) as well as hardware proximity. The resulting hardware {{is based on a}} parallel architecture with up to eight processing units, employing standard FPUs, RAMs and custom VLSI-chips. It has been designed for use in an IBM PC/AT environment. Introduction The Simplex Method, introduced in the <b>late</b> <b>fourties</b> by George B.

25|$|Gifford {{continued}} to play for Warwickshire into his <b>late</b> <b>forties,</b> and when he retired from playing {{at the age of}} 48 in 1988, he had taken 2,068 first-class wickets. The reduction in the amount of first-class cricket played means that he is likely to remain the last man to have broken the 2,000 mark. Never much of a batsman, he made only three half-centuries in more than 800 innings, his 7,000 runs coming at an average of just 13. After retirement, Gifford went into coaching and became coach of first Sussex, and then Durham.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Arsenic is a {{potentially}} hazardous metalloid {{that can cause}} skin cancer. We want to demonstrate a case of chronic arsenicosis and the potential of chemoprevention with retinoids. Case Report: This is a case report of a 72 -year-old male patient who was exposed to arsenics by dust and direct skin contact over 3 years in a chemical plant in the <b>late</b> <b>fourties.</b> He developed multiple arsenic keratosis clincialll resembling actinic keratoses, Bowen’s disease and palmar minute keratoses. To prevent a transformation into invasive cancer and to lower the burden of precancerous and in situ cancer lesions, he was treated orally with acitretin 20 mg/day. During 9 months of chemopreventive retinoid therapy a partial response of pre-existent skin lesions was noted. Treatment was well tolerated. During follow-up of 5 years no invasive malignancy developed. Conclusions: Intense exposure to arsenics during {{a relatively short period}} of 3 years bears a life-long health hazard with the delayed development of multiple in situ carcinomas and precancerous lesions. Chemoprevention with retinoids can induce a partial response. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1764, John Garland, another Irish {{engineer}} {{at the service of}} Spain who was military governor of Valdivia, convinced him to move to the neighbouring, and less established, colony of Chile as his assistant. He was initially commissioned as a junior subaltern in the Spanish army. In 1770, now in his <b>late</b> <b>forties,</b> the president of Chile appointed him captain of a column of cavalry to resist the attacks of the Araucanian Indians, whom he defeated, founding the fort of San Carlos in the south of the province of Arauco. He gained the good-will of the Indians by his humanity and benevolence, and recovered big swathes of territory that had been lost by the Spaniards.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 a {{proposal}} by Iran {{and several other}} countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations' schools failed. Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceaucescu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the <b>late</b> <b>forties</b> and part of the fifties, Esperanto activities and the formation of Esperanto associations were forbidden. In spite of these factors more people continued to learn Esperanto, and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in Esperanto in the period between the World Wars and after them. Esperanto is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of native speakers, although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.|$|E
25|$|After the 1945 {{passage of}} the GI Bill, a massive influx of former {{servicemen}} began to enter college and strained the capacities of many state public university systems. While this wave was expected to subside by the early 1950s, state and federal statistics released in the <b>late</b> <b>forties</b> all projected a massive demand for {{access to higher education}} in California in the near future. The UC system was then composed only of established campuses at Berkeley and Los Angeles, (Santa Barbara State had just entered the UC system in 1944) which were already operating near capacity. In 1947, the Regents and an Education Committee of the State Legislature appointed a large-scale study of California's needs, dubbed the Strayer Committee (after its chair, George D. Strayer, professor emeritus of Teachers College, Columbia University). As the Strayer Committee was empowered to make recommendations regarding the establishment of any new state campuses, a group of Riverside citrus growers and civic leaders, including many Cal (Berkeley) alumni, formed the Citizens University Committee (CUC) to lobby for a small liberal arts college attached to the UC Citrus Experiment Station. After diligent lobbying by the CUC, which sent gifts of oranges and grapefruit to every member of the Legislature, the Strayer committee recommended that Riverside become the location for the fourth UC undergraduate campus. (It also recommended that the existing Agricultural College at Davis be expanded to serve undergraduates.) Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage drafted Senate Bill 512, which allocated $6 million for the construction of the new college. Governor Earl Warren signed the bill approving the establishment of the College of Letters and Science in Riverside in 1949, after reducing its initial allocation for construction to $4 million.|$|E

50|$|The dairy and stud farms of Ballyfermot were {{acquired}} by the authorities in the 1930s. They were developed into suburban housing estates needed to alleviate the post war housing shortage. This development, along with estates at Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown and other pockets in the south city, and Cabra, Finglas and Donnycarney along with smaller pockets in the north city provided modern accommodation to facilitate the Dublin City Council public/private housing programs. Initially leased to waiting lists, these modest high quality, well constructed homes were sold to their residents even prior to the similar Thatcher government initiatives in the U.K. The first estate {{was built in the}} <b>late</b> nineteen <b>forties</b> at Ballyfermot Lower.
