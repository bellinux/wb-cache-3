40|$|BACKGROUND: Postural {{abnormalities}} {{are often}} found in children. At this stage of life, posture undergoes many adjustments and adaptations due to body changes. Objective: To qualitatively identify the postural abnormalities which occur most frequently among children aged OBJECTIVE: Reven and ten years, comparing boys and girls, and to evaluate these subjects' lumbar flexibility. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-one children were photographed in the sagittal and frontal planes. The variables analyzed were: ankle (valgus and varus), tibiotarsal angle (opened and closed), knee (hyperextension and semiflexion, valgus and varus), pelvis (anteversion and retroversion; lateral pelvic inclination), trunk (antepulsion and retropulsion), <b>lumbar</b> spine (<b>hyperlordosis</b> and rectification), thoracic spine (hyperkyphosis and rectification), cervical spine (hyperlordosis and rectification), scoliosis, shoulder (imbalance and protraction), scapula (winged, abducted and adducted) and head (tilt and protraction). The lumbar flexibility was assessed using Schöber's index. RESULTS: The boys had greater incidence of winged scapula, shoulder imbalance, protraction of shoulders and head and cervical hyperlordosis than the girls did. Conversely, the girls had greater incidence of head tilt and larger Schöber index values. CONCLUSIONS: There were abnormalities in children's postural development that are probably related to muscle, skeletal and flexibility differences between the genders.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{the relationship between}} anterior disc displacement and global posture (plantar arches, lower limbs, shoulder and pelvic girdle, vertebral spine, head and mandibles). Common {{signs and symptoms of}} anterior disc displacement were also identified. INTRODUCTION: Global posture deviations cause body adaptation and realignment, which may interfere with the organization and function of the temporomandibular joint. METHODS: Global posture evaluation was performed in a group of 10 female patients (20 to 30 years of age) with temporomandibular joint disc displacement and in a control group of 16 healthy female volunteers matched for age, weight and height. Anterior disc displacement signs, symptoms and the presence of parafunctional habits were also identified through interview. RESULTS: Patients with disc displacement showed a higher incidence of pain in the temporomandibular joint area, but there were no differences in parafunctional habits between the groups. In the disc displacement group, postural deviations were found in the pelvis (posterior rotation), <b>lumbar</b> spine (<b>hyperlordosis),</b> thoracic spine (rectification), head (deviation to the right) and mandibles (deviation to the left with open mouth). There were no differences in the longitudinal plantar arches between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a close relationship between body posture and temporomandibular disorder, though {{it is not possible to}} determine whether postural deviations are the cause or the result of the disorder. Hence, postural evaluation could be an important component in the overall approach to providing accurate prevention and treatment in the management of patients with temporomandibular disorder...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN:: A {{retrospective}} study. OBJECTIVE:: Our study {{opted to}} clarify the remaining issues of lumbar lordosis (LL) in regard to (1) its physiologic values, (2) age, (3) gender, (4) facet joint (FJ) arthritis and orientation using CT scans. SUMMARYOF BACKGROUND DATA:: Recent studies have questioned whether LL really decreases with age, but study sample sizes have been rather small and mostly been based on X-rays. Since hyperlordosis increases the load transferred through the FJs, it seems plausible that hyperlordosis may lead to FJ arthritis at the lower lumbar spine. METHODS:: We retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 620 individuals, {{with a mean age}} of 42. 5 (range, 14 - 94) years, who presented to our traumatology department and underwent a whole body CT scan, between 2008 and 2010. LL was evaluated between the superior endplates of L 1 and S 1. FJs of the lumbar spine were evaluated for arthritis and orientation between the L 2 and S 1. RESULTS:: (1) The mean LL was 49. 0 ° (SD 11. 1 °, range 11. 4 - 80. 1 °). (2) LL increased with age and there was a significant difference in LL in our age groups (≤ 30, 31 - 50, 51 - 70 and ≥ 71 y) (P= 0. 02). (3) There was no significant difference in LL between females and males (50 ° and 49 °) (P= 0. 17). (4) LL showed a significant linear association with FJ arthritis (P= 0. 0026, OR= 1. 022 [1. 008 - 1. 036]) and sagittal FJ orientation at L 5 /S 1 (P= 0. 001). In a logistic regression analysis the cut-off point for LL was 49. 4 °. CONCLUSION:: This is the largest CT-based study on LL and FJs. LL significantly increases with age. As a novelty finding, hyperlordosis is significantyly associated with FJ arthritis and sagittal FJ orientation at the lower <b>lumbar</b> spine. Thus <b>hyperlordosis</b> may present with back pain and patients may benefit from surgical correction, for example in the setting of trauma...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> is a {{condition}} that occurs when the lumbar region (lower back) experiences stress or extra weight and is arched to point of muscle pain or spasms. <b>Lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> is a common postural position where the natural curve of the lumbar region of the back is slightly or dramatically accentuated. Commonly known as swayback, it is common in dancers. Imbalances in muscle strength and length are also a cause, such as weak hamstrings, or tight hip flexors (psoas). A major feature of <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> is a forward pelvic tilt, resulting in the pelvis resting {{on top of the}} thighs.|$|E

50|$|Although hyperlordosis {{gives an}} {{impression}} of a stronger back, incongruently {{it can lead to}} moderate to severe lower back pain. The most problematic symptom is that of herniated disc where the dancer has put so much strain on their back that the discs between the vertebrae have been damaged or have ruptured. Technical problems with dancing such as difficulty in the positions of attitude and arabesque can be a sign of weak iliopsoas. Tightness of the iliopsoas results in a dancer having difficulty lifting their leg into high positions. Abdominal muscles being weak and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps being tight are signs that improper muscles are being worked while dancing which leads to <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis.</b> The most obvious signs of <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> is lower back pain in dancing and pedestrian activities as well as having the appearance of a swayed back.|$|E
50|$|Measurement and {{diagnosis}} of <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> can be difficult.

5000|$|One way {{to prevent}} a hip labrum tear is to {{decrease}} {{the pressure on the}} anterior region.The labrum is about 2 to 3 mm thick but is wider and thinner in the anterior portion. Studies have found that in the United States and European countries, hip labral tears are commonlyfound in the anterior region. Muscular imbalance of the pelvis can develop lower crossedsyndrome. It is caused by tight hip flexors and erector spinae with inhibited weak gluteals andabdominals. Imbalance of the muscles can lead to an anterior pelvic tilt, increased hipflexion, and <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> of the lumbar spine. This increases the pressure in the anteriorlabrum [...] Weak gluteals during hip extension has also shown increased joint pressure in theanterior labrum. To prevent a hip labrum tear, you will have to strengthen muscles orstretch tight muscles that might cause any muscular imbalance. A great exercise to strengthenthe gluteus is the side lying hip abduction. You will be lying on your side with your legs on top of each other. You will raise the top leg up while keeping the knee and hip straight. This exercisetargets the gluteus medius and is effective especially in those with an anterior pelvic tilt. To stretch a tight hip flexor, you can do the kneeling hip flexor stretch that targetsthe iliopsoas. These exercises are a great way to strengthen and stabilize the pelvisand hip joint to prevent a hip labrum tear.|$|E

40|$|The lumbar {{shape in}} females {{is thought to}} be unique, {{compensating}} for <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis.</b> Yet, the morphological adaptation of various vertebral parameters in the thoracic and lumbar spine to this unique posture in young and adult females has only been partially addressed in the literature. Our aim was to investigate the gender association to vertebral shape in the thoracic and lumbar spine as a possible adaptation to <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> in young and adult females. A three-dimensional digitizer was used to measure the vertebral body sagittal wedging, relative spinous process thickness, and relative interfacet width at the T 1 –L 5 level. Two hundred and forty complete, non-pathological skeletons of adults and 32 skeletons of young individuals were assessed. Three major results were found to be independent of age and ethnicity: (a) VB sagittal wedging in females was significantly less kyphotic than males from T 9 to L 2 (T 11 excluded) with a cumulative mean difference of 8. 8 °; (b) females had a significantly relatively thinner lumbar spinous processes and (c) females had a relatively wider superior interfacet distance (T 9 –T 10 and L 1 –L 4) than males. We conclude that the combination of less kyphotic VB wedging in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae, relatively greater interspinous space and larger interfacet width in the lumbar spine in females are key architectural elements in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis</b> in females and may compensate for the bipedal obstetric load during pregnancy...|$|E

PURPOSE: To identify which postural alterations occur most often in students between 7 and 10 years of age, to identify preventive measures, and to provide information to parents and teachers about the problem of bad posture. METHODS: Thirty three girls in each of 4 age groups between 7 and 10 years of age were assessed, resulting in a sample of 132 subjects. Photos of each girl in the sagittal and frontal planes were examined for postural deviations. RESULTS: The main postural deviations found were knock-knee, medial rotation of the hip, antepulsion, pelvic anteversion, knee hyperextension, <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis,</b> valgus ankle, imbalanced shoulders, lateral pelvic inclination, scoliosis, trunk rotation, thoracic hyperkyphosis, winged scapula, shoulder protraction, abducted scapula, medial rotation of shoulders, and head tilt.

40|$|The distal arthrogryposes are a {{heterogeneous}} group of conditions characterized by congenital contractures of hands and feet, and autosomal dominant inheritance. The concurrence of ophthalmoplegia and additional ocular findings distinguish distal arthrogryposis type 5 (DA 5). This rare subtype {{has been described}} in 33 patients to date and its clinical spectrum of physical findings is still poorly understood. We report on a family with three individuals with DA 5. The index case came to our attention because of restricted forearm pronation-supination and juvenile macular dystrophy. Further examination revealed short stature, firm muscles, stiff spine with <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis,</b> generalized mild limitation of the large joints, external rotation of the hips, unilateral ptosis, exophoria, and abnormal photopic and scotopic responses on electroretinogram testing. However, there was no overt evidence of contractures of the distal joints.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it {{is known}} that muscle {{weakness}} is a major cause of postural instability and leads to an increased incidence of falls in patients with neuromuscular disease, the relative contribution of lower extremity and trunk muscle weakness to postural instability has not been studied well. METHODS: We determined the relationship between muscle fatty infiltration and sagittal-plane balance in ten patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Sagittal-plane platform translations were imposed in forward and backward directions on patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and healthy controls. Stepping thresholds were determined and kinematic responses and center-of-mass displacements were assessed using 3 dimensional motion analysis. In the patients, magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the amount of fatty infiltration of trunk and lower extremity muscles. FINDINGS: Stepping thresholds in both directions were decreased in patients compared to controls. In patients, significant correlations were found for fatty infiltration of ventral muscles with backward stepping threshold and for fatty infiltration of dorsal muscles with forward stepping threshold. Fatty infiltration of the rectus abdominis and the back extensors explained the largest part of the variance in backward and forward stepping thresholds, respectively. Center-of-mass displacements were dependent on intensity and direction of perturbation. Kinematic analysis revealed predominant ankle strategies, except in patients with <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis.</b> INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate that trunk muscle involvement is most critical for loss of sagittal-plane postural balance in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.

RYR 1 -related myopathies are usually of early-childhood onset. Here we present 11 patients from 8 families with a late-onset axial myopathy associated with RYR 1 variants. Patients presented between the third and seventh decade of life to neuromuscular centres in Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom with predominant axial muscle involvement, comprising variable degrees of <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis,</b> scapular winging and/or camptocormia. Marked myalgia was commonly associated. Serum creatine kinase levels were normal or moderately elevated. Muscle imaging showed consistent involvement of the lower paravertebral muscles and the posterior thigh. Muscle biopsy findings were often discrete, featuring variability in fibre size, increased internal nuclei and unevenness of oxidative enzyme staining, but only rarely overt cores. RYR 1 sequencing revealed heterozygous missense variants, either previously associated with the MHS trait or localizing to known MHS mutational hotspots. These findings indicate that MHS-related RYR 1 mutations may present later in life with prominent axial weakness but not always typical histopathological features.

Its presence and severity have been related to many factors, including biotype, age, sex, circulatory changes, and, as some authors have suggested, mechanical alterations such as <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis.</b> OBJECTIVE: To correlate the degree of cellulite with the angle of lumbar lordosis in asymptomatic women. METHODS: Fifty volunteers were evaluated by digital photos, palpation, and thermograph. The degree of cellulite was classified {{on a scale of}} 1 - 4. Analyses were performed on the superior, inferior, right and left buttocks (SRB, IRB, SLB, ILB), and the superior right and left thighs (SRT, SLT). The volunteers underwent a lateral-view X-ray, and the angle of lumbar lordosis was measured using Cobb's method (inferior endplate of T 12 and the superior endplate of S). The data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Spearman's correlation. A significance level of 5 % was adopted. RESULTS: Volunteers had a mean age of 26. 1 ± 4. 4 years and a mean body mass index of 20. 7 ± 1. 9 kg/m².

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Postural {{deviations}} {{are frequent}} in childhood and may cause pain and functional impairment. Previously, {{only a few}} studies have examined the association between body posture and intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Objective: To assess the prevalence of postural changes in school children, and to determine, using multiple logistic regression analysis, whether factors such as age, gender, BMI, handedness and physical activity might explain these deviations. Methods: The posture of 288 students was assessed by observation. Subjects were aged between 6 and 15 years, 59. 4 % (n = 171) of which were female. The mean age was 10. 6 (± 2. 4) years. Mean body weight was 38. 6 (± 12. 7) kg and mean height was 1. 5 (± 0. 1) m. A digital scale, a tapeline, a plumb line and standardized forms were used to collect data. The data were analyzed descriptively using the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis (significance level of 5 %). Results: We found the following deviations to be prevalent among schoolchildren: forward head posture, 53. 5 %, shoulder elevation, 74. 3 %, asymmetry of the iliac crests, 51. 7 %, valgus knees, 43. 1 %, thoracic hyperkyphosis, 30. 2 %, <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis,</b> 37. 2 % and winged shoulder blades, 66. 3 %.

Conclusion: These findings contribute to the understanding of how and why these deviations develop, and to the implementation of preventive and rehabilitation programs, given that some of the associated factors are modifiable...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Scoliosis {{was evident}} in {{eighteen}} of eighty-eight patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. The predominant pattern of spinal defor-mity was a structural thoracolumbar double curve that extended to the sacrum and was associated with pelvic obliquity and <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis.</b> Significant con-tractures about the hips, dislocation of the hip, or both were present in all patients but one. Most of the curves were progressive and they became rigid and fixed at an early age. There was progression of the pelvic obliquity coincident with progression of the curve. Treatment by corrective casts or a Milwaukee brace was ineffective and if surgical treatment directed at the pelvic ob-liquity did not correct that deformity, spine fusion to the sacrum appeared necessary. Arthrogryposi s multiplex congen ita (amyoplasia con-genita) is a syndrome of persistent joint contractures pres-ent at birth. It was originally described by Otto in 1841 as a congenital myodystrophy. The syndrome is relatively rare, being present in 0. 03 per cent of neonates. The etiology of this disease entity remains conjectural, and in-vestigation currently centers around whether it is myopathic or neuropathic. The usual older descriptions of the arthrogrypotic pa-tient ignored involvement of the spine, or a statement was made that ‘ ‘ {{in contrast to the}} limbs, the trunk is relatively unaffected ’ ‘ 14 Recently, however, it has become increas-ingly evident that the spine is frequently involved and to a severe degree.

METHODS: Twenty three patients referred over a 10 year period with rigidity and spasms in association with continuous motor unit activity, but without evidence of neuromyotonia, extrapyramidal or pyramidal dysfunction or focal lesions of the spinal cord were reviewed. The patients were divided into those with an acute or subacute illness, leading to death within 1 year, and those with a chronic course. The latter were divided into those in whom rigidity and spasms dominated in the axial muscles, or in one or more distal limbs, {{at the time of their}} first assessment. RESULTS: This simple division identified three distinct groups of patients. (1) Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity: two patients had a rapidly progressive condition characterised by widespread rigidity which resulted in death within 6 and 16 weeks. One patient had negative anti-GAD and anti-neuronal antibodies, but had markedly abnormal CSF and widespread denervation. The principal pathological findings in this case were a subacute encephalomyelitis which primarily affected the grey matter. In the remaining patient anti-GAD antibodies were not tested, and postmortem was refused. (2) Stiff man syndrome: eight patients had rigidity and painful spasms of the lumbar paraspinal, abdominal, and occasionally proximal leg muscles associated with a <b>lumbar</b> <b>hyperlordosis.</b> There was no involvement of the upper limbs, distal lower limbs, sphincters or cranial nerves. Seven had anti-GAD antibodies and most had additional evidence of autoimmune disease. Neurophysiologically there was continuous motor unit activity with abnormal exteroceptive reflexes, but a normal interference pattern during spasms. The patients all responded to baclofen/diazepam and remained ambulant. (3) Stiff limb syndrome: thirteen patients had rigidity, painful spasm, and abnormal postures of the distal limb, ususphincter or brainstem involvement. Generalised myoclonic jerks were not a feature. Only two had truncal rigidity, and another two had anti-GAD antibodies. Most had no evidence of autoimmune disease. Neurophysiologically they had continuous motor unit activity in the affected limb, abnormal exteroceptive reflexes, and abnormally segmented EMG activity during spasms. The disease ran a protracted course, and most patients had only a partial response to baclofen or diazepam. About half became wheelchair bound. CONCLUSIONS: The stiff limb syndrome seems distinct from the stiff man syndrome or progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity, and is an important cause of rigidity and spasm in the setting of continuous motor unit activity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} whether the stiff limb syndrome may {{be separated from}} the stiff man syndrome and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity on simple clinical grounds, and whether such a distinction has implications for aetiology, treatment, and prognosis.  METHODS— Twenty three patients referred over a 10 year period with rigidity and spasms in association with continuous motor unit activity, but without evidence of neuromyotonia, extrapyramidal or pyramidal dysfunction or focal lesions of the spinal cord were reviewed. The patients were divided into those with an acute or subacute illness, leading to death within 1 year, and those with a chronic course.

Generalised myoclonic jerks were not a feature. Only two had truncal rigidity, and another two had anti-GAD antibodies. Most had no evidence of autoimmune disease.
