40|$|License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Vestibular hearing in human is evoked {{as a result}} of the auditory sensitivity of the saccule to low-frequency high-intensity tone. The objective was to investigate the relationship between vestibular hearing using cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) and speech processing via word recognition scores in white noise (WRSs in wn). Intervention comprised of audiologic examinations, cVEMPs, and WRS in wn. All healthy subjects had detectable cVEMPs (safe vestibular hearing). WRSs in wn were obtained for them (66. 9 ± 9. 3 % in the right ears and 67. 5 ± 11. 8 % in the <b>left</b> <b>ears).</b> Dizzy patients in the affected ears, had the cVEMPs abnormalities (insecure vestibular hearing) and decreased the WRS in wn (51. 4 ± 3. 8 % in the right ears and 52. 2 ± 3. 5 % in the <b>left</b> <b>ears).</b> The comparison of the cVEMPs between the subjects revealed significant differences (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction: Noise is {{considered}} {{as the most}} common cause of harmful physical effects in the workplace. A sound that is generated from within the inner ear is known as an otoacoustic emission (OAE). Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) assess evoked emission and hearing capacity. The aim of this study was to assess the signal-to-noise ratio in different frequencies and at different times of the shift work in workers exposed to various levels of noise. It was also aimed to provide a statistical model for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of OAEs in different frequencies based on the two variables of sound pressure level (SPL) and exposure time. Materials and Methods: This case–control study was conducted on 45 workers during autumn 2014. The workers were divided into three groups based on the level of noise exposure. The SNR was measured in frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 [*]Hz in both ears, and in three different time intervals during the shift work. According to the inclusion criterion, SNR of 6 [*]dB or greater was included in the study. The analysis was performed using repeated measurements of analysis of variance, spearman correlation coefficient, and paired samples t-test. Results: The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the three exposed groups in terms of the mean values of SNR (P > 0. 05). Only in signal pressure levels of 88 dBA with an interval time of 10 : 30 – 11 : 00 AM, there was a statistically significant difference between the right and <b>left</b> <b>ears</b> with the mean SNR values of 3000 frequency (P[*]=[*] 0. 038). The SPL had a significant effect on the SNR in both the right and <b>left</b> <b>ears</b> (P[*]=[*] 0. 023, P[*]=[*] 0. 041). The effect of the duration of measurement on the SNR was statistically significant in both the right and <b>left</b> <b>ears</b> (P[*]=[*] 0. 027, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrated that after noise exposure during the shift, SNR of OAEs reduced from the beginning to the end of the shift...|$|R
