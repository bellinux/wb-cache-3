5000|$|The Model 11 (1922) 70 mm mortar is {{exceptional}} among Japanese mortars in that, {{although a}} muzzle-loading weapon, {{it has a}} rifled bore. The Japanese marking is [...] "11th year model high-angle infantry gun". A monopod, similar to {{the support of the}} US 4.2-inch chemical mortar, is another telling feature. The total weight of the weapon is 133.75 lb, of which 99.5 lb represents the weight of the base plate. The traverse of the piece is 410 mils (23 degrees), and its elevation is 661 to 1,370 mils (37 to 77 degrees). A gunner's quadrant is used to lay in the weapon. It has a level vial, actuated by a knob, a movable arm, and a fixed elevation scale. The elevation scale is graduated in half-degree units from 0 to 55 degrees. The movable arm has a vernier scale which permits readings of 1/16th degree. Before the weapon can be fired, by means of a lanyard attached to a striker arm, a <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> on the breech end of the tube must be set in its recess.|$|E
40|$|A rotary latch is disclosed, {{including}} a hollow, cylindrical outer member and a concentrically arranged inner rotor. The rotor is rotatable within the outer cylindrical member. The outer cylindrical member includes {{a pair of}} aligned openings as a cylinder first end facing a <b>latch</b> <b>pin.</b> The rotor includes a pair of aligned slots at a rotor first end facing the <b>latch</b> <b>pin.</b> Slot extensions are provided in the rotor, the slot extensions extending generally perpendicularly to the slots and generally parallel to the rotor first end. In a first position, the outer cylindrical member openings and the rotor slots are aligned to allow receipt of the <b>latch</b> <b>pin.</b> In a second position, the openings and the slot extensions are aligned thereby engaging the <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> within a closed area defined by the rotor slot extensions and the outer cylinder openings...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pyrotechnic actuated release mechanism which is mechanically two fault tolerant for effecting release. It is particularly {{well suited for}} releasably connecting structures {{to be used in}} the space environment or in other aerospace applications. The device comprises a fastener plate and fastener body, each attachable to either one of a pair of structures to be joined. The fastener plate and the body are fastenable by a toggle supported at one end on the fastener plate and mounted for universal pivotal movement thereon. At its other end, which is received in a central opening in the fastener body and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein, the toggle is restrained by three retractable <b>latching</b> <b>pins.</b> Each pin is individually retractable by combustion of a pyrotechnic charge. While retraction of all three pins releases the toggle, the fastener is mechanically two fault tolerant since the failure of any single or pair of the <b>latch</b> <b>pins</b> to retract results in an asymmetrical loading on the toggle and its pivotal movement to effect a release. An annular bolt is mounted on the fastener plate as a support for the socket mounting of the toggle whereby its selective axial movement provides a means for pre-loading the toggle...|$|R
5000|$|To prevent this, the DC-10 used a [...] "fail safe" [...] {{latching}} system {{held in place}} by [...] "over top dead center latches", five C-shaped latches mounted on a common torque shaft that are rotated over fixed <b>latching</b> <b>pins</b> ("spools") fixed to the fuselage. Because of their shape, when the latches are in the proper position, pressure on the door does not place torque on the latches that could cause them to open, and actually further seats them on the <b>pins.</b> Normally the <b>latches</b> are opened and closed by a screw jack powered by an electric actuator motor.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, in 1991, an {{incident}} occurred at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport involving the malfunction of a United Airlines Boeing 747 cargo door. At the time, United Airlines' maintenance staff were investigating {{the cause of}} a circuit breaker trip. In the process of diagnosing the cause, an inadvertent operation of the electric door latch mechanism caused the cargo door to open spontaneously despite being closed. An inspection of the door's electrical wiring discovered insulation breaches, and isolating certain electrical wires allowed the door to operate normally again. The lock sectors, latch cams, and <b>latch</b> <b>pins</b> on the door were inspected, and did not show signs of damage of the type predicted by the NTSB's original hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|A {{vertical}} dropped-weight {{impact test}} machine has a dropped-weight barrel vertically supported on {{upper and lower}} support brackets. The dropped-weight barrel is chambered to receive a dropped-weight assembly having a <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> at its upper end, a damping unit in the middle, and a tup at its lower end. The tup is adapted for gathering data during impact testing. The <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> releasably engages a <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> coupling assembly. The <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> coupling assembly {{is attached to a}} winch via a halyard for raising and lowering the dropped-weight assembly. The lower end of the dropped-weight barrel is provided with a bounce-back arresting mechanism which is activated by the descending passage of the dropped-weight assembly. After striking the specimen, the dropped-weight assembly rebounds vertically and is caught by the bounce-back arresting mechanism. The damping unit of the dropped-weight assembly serves to dissipate energy from the rebounding dropped-weight assembly and prevents the dropped-weight assembly from rebounding from the self-arresting mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A {{latching}} mechanism {{in which there}} is linear movement and rotational movement is described. The umbilical doors of the space shuttle orbiter are required to be open during vehicle launch. After the external tank is released, the doors are closed. Presently, the device for maintaining the doors in an open position is mounted on the external tank and therefore has a single mission life. The {{latching mechanism}} of the invention is mounted in the orbiter and therefore is returned and has multimission capability. The latching mechanism is comprised of a pair of concentric nested, cylindrical cams and motors to actuate the cams, and <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> all contained within a cover mounted on a support bracket carried by the substructure. A shaft having a <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> is mounted inside the inner cylindrical cam...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{difficulties}} which were encountered in deploying the Viking 1 lander's surface-sampler arm are discussed. When the surface sampler jammed during its initial operation, {{the problem was}} studied {{with the aid of}} tests on a full-scale lander mock-up. It was found that the difficulty was caused by a boom <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> which had failed to fall clear. The surface-sampler arm could subsequently be freed by modifying the original command sequence. Another difficulty could be overcome by a similar approach...|$|E
5000|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors on}} the DC-10 are plug doors, designed to prevent opening while the aircraft is pressurized, but the cargo hatch is not. Owing to its large radius, the cargo hatch on the DC-10 could not open inside the fuselage without taking up valuable cargo space, so the hatch was designed to open outward, allowing cargo to be stored directly behind it. The outward-opening design would allow the hatch to be blown open by the pressure inside the cargo area if the latch failed during flight. To prevent this, the DC-10 used a latching system that incorporated [...] "over-center latches" [...] - four C-shaped latches mounted on a common torque shaft that were rotated over <b>latching</b> <b>pins</b> ("spools") fixed to the aircraft fuselage. Due to their shape, when the latches were in the proper position, internal pressure on the hatch did not place enough torque to open them. The latches were engaged by electric actuators, with a hand crank provided as a backup.|$|R
2500|$|The 747's {{cargo door}} used {{a series of}} {{electrically}} operated latch cams into which the door-edge <b>latch</b> <b>pins</b> closed. The cams then rotated into a closed position, holding the door closed. A series of L-shaped arms (called locking sectors) were actuated by the final manual moving of a lever to close the door; these were designed to reinforce the unpowered latch cams and prevent them from rotating into an unlocked position. [...] The locking sectors were made out of aluminum and were too thin a gauge {{to be able to}} keep the latch cams from moving into the unlocked position against the power of the door motors. Electrical switches cut electrical power to the cargo door when the outer handle was closed; but if one of those were faulty, the motors could still draw power and rotate the latch cam to the open position. The same event could happen if frayed wires were able to power the cam-motor, even if the circuit power was cut by the safety switch.|$|R
5000|$|An {{extension}} {{of this technique}} is Charlieplexing where the ability of some microcontrollers to tri-state their output pins means larger numbers of LEDs can be driven, without using <b>latches.</b> For N <b>pins,</b> {{it is possible to}} drive n2-n LEDs ...|$|R
40|$|An {{actuated}} <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> {{developed to}} meet {{the need for a}} reusable locking device is described. The unit can function as a pin puller or as a pin pusher latch. Initial prototype testing demonstrated the feasibility of the device with the unit being driven from a 28 V dc supply and using 15 W to drive a 12 mm diameter pin through a stroke of 10 mm with a side load of 100 N in 120 ms. High wear rates with a MOS 2 lubrication on the ballscrew and angular contact bearings have necessitated the reduction in the duty cycle from 1000 cycles in air and vacuum to 100 in air and 1000 in vacuum...|$|E
40|$|Examination of {{the erosion}} of the surface of Mars caused by the descent engines of the Viking 1 lander {{indicates}} that the soil is stronger and/or denser than the 'lunar nominal' soil (an artificially produced soil with a particle size distribution similar to results for lunar soils obtained by Apollo 11) used in preflight site alteration tests. There is further evidence to suggest that the finer grains are not as small as those of the lunar nominal material, and that the soil under the lander footpads is relatively stiff. The crater, depressions, and ejecta associated with the impact of a <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> which fell from the surface sampler are consistent with terrestrial soils with very low cohesions, small grain size, and a density of 1. 2 to 1. 7 g/cu cm...|$|E
40|$|FOCUS, a {{simulation}} environment for conducting fault-sensitivity analysis of chip-level designs, is described. The environment {{can be used}} to evaluate alternative design tactics at an early design stage. A range of user specified faults is automatically injected at runtime, and their propagation to the chip I/O pins is measured through the gate and higher levels. A number of techniques for fault-sensitivity analysis are proposed and implemented in the FOCUS environment. These include transient impact assessment on <b>latch,</b> <b>pin</b> and functional errors, external pin error distribution due to in-chip transients, charge-level sensitivity analysis, and error propagation models to depict the dynamic behavior of latch errors. A case study of the impact of transient faults on a microprocessor-based jet-engine controller is used to identify the critical fault propagation paths, the module most sensitive to fault propagation, and the module with the highest potential for causing external errors...|$|E
5000|$|The {{crash was}} caused when an {{improperly}} secured cargo {{door at the}} rear of the plane broke off, causing an explosive decompression which severed cables necessary to control the aircraft. Because of a known design flaw left uncorrected before and after the production of DC-10s, the cargo hatches did not latch reliably, and manual procedures were relied upon to ensure they were locked correctly. Problems with the hatches had occurred previously, most notably in an identical incident that happened on American Airlines Flight 96 in 1972, the so-called [...] "Windsor Incident". Investigation showed that the handles on the hatches could be improperly forced shut without the <b>latching</b> <b>pins</b> locking in place. It was noted that the pins on the hatch that failed on Flight 981 had been filed down to make it easier to close the door, resulting in the hatch being less resistant to pressure. Also, a support plate for the handle linkage had not been installed, although manufacturer documents showed this work as completed. Finally, the latching had been performed by a baggage handler who did not speak Turkish or English, the only languages provided on a warning notice about the cargo door's design flaws and the methods of compensating for them. After the disaster, the latches were redesigned and the locking system significantly upgraded.|$|R
50|$|Mortise locks {{may include}} a {{non-locking}} sprung latch {{operated by a}} door handle. Such a lock is termed a sash lock. A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a 'dead lock'. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking <b>latch,</b> usually a <b>pin</b> tumbler rim lock.|$|R
25|$|In 1896, at {{serial number}} 164,100, a {{spring-loaded}} base <b>pin</b> <b>latch</b> replaced the cylinder pin retaining screw and by 1900, at serial number 192,000, the Colt Single Action was certified {{for use with}} smokeless powder. In 1920, larger, highly visible sights replaced the original thin blade and notch. The revolvers remained essentially unchanged from that point until cessation of manufacture {{at the beginning of}} World War II.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis of}} the impact of transient faults on a microprocessor-based jet engine controller, used in the Boeing 747 and 757 aircrafts is described. A hierarchical simulation environment which allows the injection of transients during run-time and the tracing of their impact is described. Verification of the accuracy of this approach is also provided. A determination of the probability that a transient results in <b>latch,</b> <b>pin</b> or functional errors is made. Given a transient fault, there is approximately an 80 percent chance that there is no impact on the chip. An empirical model to depict the process of error exploration and degeneration in the target system is derived. The model shows that, if no latch errors occur within eight clock cycles, no significant damage is likely to happen. Thus, the overall impact of a transient is well contained. A state transition model is also derived from the measured data, to describe the error propagation characteristics within the chip, and to quantify the impact of transients on the external environment. The model is used to identify and isolate the critical fault propagation paths, the module most sensitive to fault propagation and the module with the highest potential of causing external pin errors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this {{research}} we present multi-body dynamics analysis {{can be applied}} in product development using {{a case study of}} a Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) with a spring-actuated linkage, which can save time and cost considerably. In particular, we demonstrate how to evaluate and improve durability of the MCCB based on multi-body dynamics and finite element simulation given SM 45 C steel used for the MCCB links. Toward this goal, a 3 D MCCB dynamic model is first developed and dynamic forces are analyzed by using the multi-body dynamics software, ADAMS. Finite element simulation is then performed to examine maximum principal stresses considering deflections and dynamic loads. Further, mechanical properties of SM 45 C steel are measured experimentally from tensile and fatigue tests. As a result, we verify that stress loads acting on the <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> of the spring-actuated linkage are critically higher, which ultimately leads to a low-cycle fatigue fracture of the pin. Based on our analytically estimated maximum principal stresses in the MCCB and experimentally measured mechanical properties of SM 45 C steel, we evaluate design durability and improve our design. As a result, using a 4 mm diameter pin and modifying SM 45 C with heat treating that includes quenching and tempering, we successfully achieve a MCCB product development, which provides sufficient strengths to prevent yielding and fatigue failures from repeated dynamic loads...|$|E

The device 10 comprises a fastener plate 11 and fastener body 12, each attachable {{to a different}} one {{of a pair of}} structures to be joined. The fastener plate 11 and body 12 are fastenable by a toggle 13 supported at one end on the fastener plate and mounted for universal pivotal movement thereon. At its other end which is received in a central opening in the fastener body 12 and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein the toggle 13 is restrained by three retractable latching pins 61 symmetrically disposed in equiangular spacing about the axis of the toggle 13 and positionable in latching engagement with an end fitting on the toggle. Each pin 61 is individually retractable by combustion of a pyrotechnic charge 77, the expanding gases of which are applied to a pressure receiving face 67 on the <b>latch</b> <b>pin</b> 61 to effect its retraction from the toggle. While retraction of all three pins 62 releases the toggle, the fastener is mechanically two fault tolerant since the failure of any single one or pair of the latch pins to retract results in an asymmetrical loading on the toggle and its pivotal movement to effect a release.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis is}} described which studies the susceptibility of a microprocessor based jet engine controller to upsets caused by current and voltage transients. A design automation environment {{which allows the}} run time injection of transients and the tracing from their impact device to the pin level is described. The resulting error data are categorized by the charge levels of the injected transients by location and by their potential to cause logic upsets, <b>latched</b> errors, and <b>pin</b> errors. The results show a 3 picoCouloumb threshold, below which the transients have little impact. An Arithmetic and Logic Unit transient {{is most likely to}} result in logic upsets and pin errors (i. e., impact the external environment). The transients in the countdown unit are potentially serious since they can result in latched errors, thus causing latent faults. Suggestions to protect the processor against these errors, by incorporating internal error detection and transient suppression techniques, are also made...|$|R
