5|$|The station {{opened to}} coal traffic on 27 July 1898 and to {{passengers}} on 15 March 1899. It was the terminus of the GCR's London extension main <b>line–</b> {{the last major}} railway line to be built into London until High Speed 1. The Great Central Railway linked London to stations in , , Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. Local services from northwest Middlesex, High Wycombe and Aylesbury also terminated at Marylebone. The GCR moved its headquarters to Marylebone from Manchester in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Walter (Michael Fassbender) is an android- a newer {{version of}} the David <b>line-</b> serving aboard the colony ship Covenant. Walter {{maintains}} the ship while the colonists are in cryosleep, {{when there is an}} unexpected neutrino flare from a nearby star, which damages the ship, forcing him to awaken the crew. After Christopher Oram orders the ship to divert from Origae-6 for the closer and more habitable Engineer home world, Walter joins the expedition force that lands on the planet. In the ensuing Alien outbreak, he is attacked by a Neomorph, which bites off his hand. He joins the survivors in taking refuge at David's base, where he becomes acquainted with David and their differences in programming are revealed in one another. Walter surmises that David killed Shaw and when he confronts him about this fact and refuses David's offer to join him, David impales him with a flute, seemingly destroying him. Walter temporarily recovers and engages David in a melee – David emerges victorious and assumes Walter's identity.|$|E

Jenkins, but the Union <b>line-</b> men from the First Michigan cavalry, the First New Jersey Cavalry and the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry- held. Stuart ordered Jackson's four gun battery into action. Custer ordered Pennington to answer. After a brief exchange in which two of Jackson's guns were destroyed, there was a lull.|$|E
25|$|The {{school had}} three badges during its history. The {{first was the}} Bath Technical College badge which was a simple design - BTC in thin red letters within a shield {{outlined}} with a thin red <b>line-</b> and this lasted until the Bath Technical School was renamed in 1949. The second badge lasted until early 1954 and is recorded on the school photograph of March 1950 and the school website. The third badge, which lasted until 1970, was designed in early 1954 by Mr Ken Box, Head of Art and included the motto, 'NISI DOMINUS FRUSTRA'. The literal translation is 'UNLESS THE LORD IN VAIN'. This is not much help. The motto is based on Psalm 127 and the more usual translation is 'EXCEPT THE LORD APPROVE WE LABOUR IN VAIN' while another translation might be 'UNLESS THE LORD IS WITH US OUR EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN'.The badge has the Book of Knowledge open to show the motto, over the City wall with the Avon beneath. The open pages are white with yellow ends, the City wall is yellow, the river Avon white and the background a shade of blue.|$|E
25|$|When {{the group}} of flags of the European Union are flown, the {{sequence}} is alphabetical, based on the first letter of the country's name. The flags should be flown {{from left to right}} with the European Union flag flown from the first flagstaff before the group. An alternative order of flags is to begin on the left with the national flag and place the European Union flag on the far right of the group, as seen by an observer. With regard to international flags; where either an even or an odd number of flags are flown in line on staffs of equal height, the national flag should be first on the right of the <b>line—</b> that is on the observer's left as he or she faces the flags. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown on the immediate left of the national flag, or as seen by an observer, on the immediate right of the national flag. Where, however, an odd number of flags are displayed from staffs grouped so that there is one staff in the centre and higher than the others, the national flag should be displayed from the staff so placed. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown from the first flagstaff on the right, or as seen by an observer, on the first flagstaff on the left. Only one national flag should be displayed in each group of flags or at each location. In all cases, the national flag should be in the place of honour. When the national flag is displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or other background, the green should be on the right (an observer's left) in the horizontal position or uppermost in the vertical position. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should be above and behind the speaker's desk. While being carried, the flag should not be dipped by way of salute or compliment except to the dead during memorial ceremonies.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff at}} Billboard {{described}} Streisand's cover as a [...] "musical gem", while author Allison J. Waldman enjoyed Streisand's personal take on it. Greenwald from AllMusic liked the singer's cover and {{wrote of the}} song's hook, [...] "Streisand's performance– particularly her phrasing of this <b>line–</b> is unforgettable". Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone compared her rendition to Wonder's version and wrote that it was [...] "almost as interesting as the original".|$|E
500|$|Early plans {{called for}} a tunnel running from before the McLean station to beyond the Spring Hill station, with all four {{stations}} in between being below ground. When the contractor hired to design the Silver <b>Line–</b> a consortium of Bechtel and Washington Group International– found the costs to be too high, the design was changed to use a short tunnel, running only between the Tysons Corner and Greensboro stations (underneath higher ground) with all four stations being at or above ground. In March 2006, the contractor was ordered to examine an alternative [...] "large bore" [...] tunnel digging technique (successfully used in Europe) {{with the potential to}} lower costs of a tunnel through the entire Tysons section. The contractor found that there would not be a significant cost reduction and proposed staying with the short tunnel option.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the urban}} area of Runcorn grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, and {{again with the}} growth of the New Town during the 1960s and 1970s, the {{surrounding}} area, mainly {{to the west of the}} town, has experienced only a small growth in population. [...] The villages are small and discrete, and are separated by farmland and woodland. [...] The area covered by the list is crossed by roads, railways, and canals, with which some of the listed buildings are associated. [...] The oldest of these are the canals: the Bridgewater Canal, the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Weaver Navigation and the Manchester Ship Canal. [...] The railways consist of the West Coast Main <b>Line–</b> the section between Crewe and Warrington, and the branch to Liverpool– and the Chester-Manchester Line. [...] The major roads are the M56motorway and the A6road, together with sections of the A533, the A557 and the A558roads.|$|E
500|$|French pair Blel Kadri (...) and Jérémie Galland (...) both {{launched}} their {{attacks in the}} closing stages, but were overhauled {{by a bunch of}} riders from which Alejandro Valverde (...) looked to have the legs {{on the rest of the}} field, sprinting from [...] out. Valverde was briefly troubled by the sprint of Australian road race champion Simon Gerrans (...) , with Valverde ultimately prevailing at the <b>line–</b> just as was the case at the Tour Down Under in a two-up sprint– by half a wheel length, with 's Gianni Meersman rounding out the podium ahead of 's Luis León Sánchez and 's Xavier Florencio; both of whom had {{launched their}} own attacks in the closing metres. Valverde's victory– his fourth of the season since returning from a doping ban– was enough to move him into the lead of the points classification, while the bonus seconds awarded on the line moved him into sixth place overall, 20 seconds down on race leader Wiggins.|$|E
500|$|Allusions to the {{painting}} were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of {{the painting}} were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model {{as part of his}} Follies. In this successful version of September Morn, the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A burlesque act, deeming itself the [...] "September Morning Glories", was also created, as was a three-act musical based on the painting. The latter– featuring a fifty-strong chorus <b>line–</b> was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill, Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing [...] "little or no clothing" [...] passed himself off as [...] "September Morn" [...] at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references {{to the painting}} continued into the 1950s. For instance, in Tennessee Williams's 1957 play Orpheus Descending, the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he [...] "might keep turning the light on {{to take another look at}} it".|$|E
500|$|A {{railroad}} <b>line–</b> the Lucin Cutoff– runs {{across the}} lake, crossing {{the southern end}} of Promontory Peninsula. [...] The mostly solid causeway supporting the railway divides the lake into three portions: the northeast arm, northwest arm, and southern. [...] This causeway obstructs the normal mixing of the waters of the lake because there are only three [...] breaches. Because no rivers, except a few minor streams, flow directly into the northwest arm, Gunnison Bay, it is now substantially saltier {{than the rest of the}} lake. [...] This saltier environment promotes different types of algae than those growing in the southern part of the lake, leading to a marked color difference on the two sides of the causeway. On December 1, 2016, the causeway was open under a newly constructed [...] bridge that allowed water to flow from the southern arm of the lake into northwest arm. At the time of opening of causeway the northwest arm was nearly three feet lower than the southern arm. As of April 29, 2017, the levels of both arms of the lake have risen due to spring runoff, and the northwestern arm is within one foot of the southern arm.|$|E
500|$|The violin was Nielsen's own {{instrument}} and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard {{procedures in the}} First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden modulations and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op.35 of 1912 was written for the violinist Peder Møller who earlier that year had premiered the composer's Violin Concerto. The work {{is an example of}} the composer's progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic Emilius Bangert wrote of the premiere (which was given by Axel Gade), [...] "The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken <b>line–</b> a flow of notes– where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating". Two other works are for violin solo. The Prelude, Theme and Variations, Op. 48 (1923) was written for Telmányi, and, like Nielsen's Chaconne for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The Preludio e Presto, Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer Fini Henriques.|$|E
500|$|The {{locomotives}} were unreliable at first. Soon after opening, Locomotion No. 1 broke a wheel, {{and it was}} {{not ready}} for traffic until 12 or 13 October; Hope, the second locomotive, arrived in November 1825 but needed a week to ready it for the <b>line–</b> the cast-iron wheels were a source of trouble. Two more locomotives of a similar design arrived in 1826; that August 16s 9d was spent on ale to motivate the men maintaining the engines. By the end of 1827 the company had also bought Chittaprat from Robert Wilson and Experiment from Stephenson. Timothy Hackworth, locomotive superintendent, used the boiler from the unsuccessful Chittaprat to build the Royal George in the works at Shildon; it started work at the end of November. John Wesley Hackworth later published an account stating that locomotives would have been abandoned {{were it not for the}} fact that Pease and Thomas Richardson were partners with Stephenson in the Newcastle works, and that when Timothy Hackworth was commissioned to rebuild Chittaprat it was [...] "as a last experiment" [...] to [...] "make an engine in his own way". Both Tomlinson and Rolt state this claim was unfounded and the company had shown earlier that locomotives were superior to horses, Tomlinson showing that coal was being moved using locomotives at half the cost of horses. Robert Young states that the company was unsure as to the real costs as they reported to shareholders in 1828 that the saving using locomotives was 30 per cent. Young also showed that Pease and Richardson were both concerned about their investment in the Newcastle works and Pease unsuccessfully tried to sell his share to George Stephenson.|$|E
500|$|The Southern {{terminus}} of the Yellow Line is {{adjacent to}} Kings Highway (Virginia Route 241) in Fairfax County, Virginia. The line heads northeast on a bridge over Hunting Creek and the Washington Beltway (Interstate 95) to a station {{just south of}} Eisenhower Avenue, which serves a number of government office buildings including the United States Patent Office. The Yellow Line then merges with the Blue Line and follows the right-of-way of the CSX Railroad through the City of Alexandria. The line enters a short tunnel under U.S. Route 1. After crossing a bridge over Four Mile Run, the line enters Arlington County on an elevated structure above the National Airport parking lots. At {{the north end of}} the airport, the Yellow Line enters a tunnel under 18th Street South and South Hayes Street. The tunnel continues along the southwest face of the Pentagon which is a two level station to facilitate a fork with the Blue Line. After the Pentagon station, the Yellow Line emerges from its tunnel east of the Pentagon and crosses the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge over the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Potomac River, and Ohio Drive. At the end of the bridge, the Yellow Line re-enters a tunnel near the Jefferson Memorial and crosses under the Washington Channel. The tunnel merges with the Green Line tunnel under 7th Street Southwest just south of the L'Enfant Plaza. The joint Yellow <b>Line—</b> Green Line tunnel continues north through downtown Washington under 7th Street, turns west under Florida Avenue and U Street, and then north under 14th Street Northwest. The tunnel then turns toward the northeast under Park Road and New Hampshire Avenue. [...] The tunnel then bends eastward under Rock Creek Cemetery and Fort Totten Park to emerge just before entering the lower level of the Fort Totten station. The track continues northeast as just the Green Line to the Greenbelt terminus.|$|E

The NYPD tracked every planned action and set up traps. As marches began, police would emerge from their hiding places– building vestibules, parking garages, or vans– and corral the dissenters with orange netting that read 'POLICE <b>LINE–</b> DO not CROSS,' establishing areas they ironically called 'ad-hoc free speech zones.' One by one, protesters were arrested and detained – some for nearly two days."
