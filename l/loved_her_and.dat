I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could.
