50|$|The <b>long-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Nasica longirostris) is {{a species}} of bird in the Dendrocolaptinae subfamily, of the woodcreepers. It is the only species in the {{monotypic}} genus Nasica.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the largest}} woodcreepers and the largest furnariids, though the slender <b>long-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> is longer and the great rufous woodcreeper is larger overall. There is some size {{variation}} across the range, with typical birds measuring 28-31 cm (11-12.5 in) long and weighing about 120 grams (4.2 oz). Large strong-billed woodcreepers can measure up to 35 cm (14 in) and weigh 169 grams (6 oz). The most distinctive feature of this typically marked striped, brownish bird (other than its size) is its massive, semi-decurved bill, which may be brown or blackish.|$|E
5000|$|The woodcreepers are {{generally}} fairly uniform in appearance. They {{range in size}} from the wedge-billed woodcreeper (13 cm) to the strong-billed woodcreeper (35 cm). Males tend to be slightly larger than females on average, but considerable overlap in size occurs in most species. Pronounced sexual dimorphism in size and plumage is rare. Bill size and shape accounts for much of the variation between the species. Bills can be straight or highly decurved, and can account for as much as a quarter of the length of the bird (as happens in the <b>long-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper).</b> The plumage is usually subdued and often brown, or sometimes rufous or other dark colours. Many species have patterns such as checking, spotting, or barring on their plumage. The feathers of the tail are rigid and are used for supporting the body when climbing tree trunks; the tail can support most of the body weight and birds that lose their tail find climbing difficult. Woodcreepers climb by flexing their legs and hopping up the trunk. The feet of the woodcreepers are also modified for climbing. The front toes are strongly clawed and toe IV is as long as toe III to increase the ability of the bird to grasp around branches. The legs are short but strong. Woodcreepers are also characterized by a belly feather growth pattern not found in any other birds.|$|E
