5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

Williams was a medical student at University of Pennsylvania when he managed to acquire enough money to buy Fitzgerald's; he left college after {{becoming}} the owner of the nightclub. Williams gave the new nightclub the name of the Manhattan neighborhood because [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people live there". The district, known as [...] "Kentucky Avenue and the Curb", had become the home for African-Americans in the racially-segregated city since the end of World War I. The new nightspot joined other popular black entertainment venues in the district such as Grace's Little Belmont, the Wintergarten, and the Paradise Club. Along with Harlem's [...] "Cotton Club", it was a place for the moneyed set to enjoy an evening of African-American entertainment. When the club opened in 1935, there were slot machines along with a basketball court {{on the top floor of}} the building. In the 1940s the club became known as Clifton's Club Harlem.|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher".

But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E
500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E

It's clear that like a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her {{as much as anything else}} in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E

40|$|Fragrance is {{the most}} {{important}} trait among the domesticated characteristics of rice (O. sativa L.). The recessive fragrance gene on chromosome 8 is associated with rice fragrance. The gene for fragrance in a fragrant rice variety shows the presence of a mutation portion (i. e., an eight base pair deletion in exon 7). This allele is responsible for rice fragrance. In the present study, 65 self-supplied seed <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> rice (O. sativa L.) from Thailand and Laos were assessed for purity of the fragrance grain of each sample for this locus using a PCR assay. The results indicate that black rice germplasm were genotyped for homozygous fragrant, heterozygote and non-fragrant homozygous. The data from the 65 samples show that 7. 7 and 23 % of the samples were heterozygous and non-fragrant homozygous, respectively. Heterozygous individuals, black rice plants that carry both the fragrant allele and non-fragrant allele of the fragrance gene and non-fragrant seeds need to avoid because they are non-fragrant and give rise to a mixture of fragrant and non-fragrant seed <b>lots.</b> Therefore, domestication <b>of</b> <b>black</b> rice in order to maintain grain aroma would require the use <b>of</b> quality <b>black</b> rice seed germplasm...|$|R
