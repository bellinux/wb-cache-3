25|$|Each {{method has}} {{noteworthy}} limitations. The method of {{mechanics of materials}} is limited to very simple structural elements under relatively simple <b>loading</b> <b>conditions.</b> The structural elements and <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows the solution of structural elements of general geometry under general <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. The solution of elasticity problems also requires the solution {{of a system of}} partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than the solution of mechanics of materials problems, which require at most the solution of an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method is perhaps the most restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it generally possible to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.|$|E
25|$|Hooke's law only {{holds for}} some {{materials}} under certain <b>loading</b> <b>conditions.</b> Steel exhibits linear-elastic behavior in most engineering applications; Hooke's law is valid for it throughout its elastic range (i.e., for stresses below the yield strength). For some other materials, such as aluminium, Hooke's law {{is only valid}} {{for a portion of}} the elastic range. For these materials a proportional limit stress is defined, below which the errors associated with the linear approximation are negligible.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{adaptive}} and distributed algorithms for motion coordination {{of a group}} of m vehicles. The vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, spatial location and service requirement are stochastic; the objective is to minimize the average time demands spend in the system. The general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment. In this paper, we first devise new policies for the 1 -DTRP that: (i) are provably optimal both in light <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> (i. e., when the arrival rate for the demands is small) and in heavy <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> (i. e., when the arrival rate for the demands is large), and (ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against changes in <b>load</b> <b>conditions.</b> Then, we show that specific partitioning policies, whereby the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a certain set of rules in its own region, are optimal in heavy <b>load</b> <b>conditions.</b> Building upon the previous results, we finally design algorithms for the m-DTRP that (i) are adaptive and distributed, and (ii) have strong performance guarantees in heavy <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> and stabilize the system in any <b>load</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

For this purpose 39 cadaver finger (14 hands, 10 donors) were fixed into an isokinetic loading device. The forces in the flexor tendons and at the fingertip were recorded. In the concentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition</b> A 2 and A 4 ruptures as well as alternative events such as fracture of a phalanx or avulsion of the flexor tendons were almost equally distributed, whereas the A 2 pulley rupture was the most common event (59 %) in the eccentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition</b> and alternative events were rare (23. 5 %). The forces in the deep flexor tendon, the fingertip and in the pulleys were significantly lower in the eccentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition.</b> As the ruptures occurred at lower loads in the eccentric than in the concentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition</b> it can be concluded that friction may be an advantage for climbers, supporting the holding force of their flexor muscles but may also increase the susceptibility to injury...|$|R

30|$|An {{additional}} aspect {{affecting the}} UUT perceived QoS is the instantaneous <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> of the network. To reproduce the desired <b>load</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{the existence of}} a number of emulated users is assumed. The traffic of emulated users is not real IP traffic {{as in the case of}} the UUT. Instead, it is artificially generated according to accurate traffic models implemented in RAN emulators. This traffic is internally used to reproduce the desired <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> under which the UUT traffic is transmitted in the RAN emulators. In order to reproduce the same <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> in the CN part, the RAN emulators periodically inform the TG about the instantaneous traffic amount being processed. The TG then uses this information to generate the same traffic load in the CN by injecting packets through the edge routers. For downstream emulated users, IP packets are injected in the ER and captured in the IRs. Analogously, upstream emulated traffic is injected by the TG in the IRs and captured in the ER. This approach has been proven to be appropriate in order to reproduce the desired <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> under which the performance of the UUT traffic can be analyzed.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of Bureau of Mines {{research}} {{is to reduce the}} cost of coal mining by improving the efficiency of longwall supports. One method of achieving this goal is the optimization of stress distribution within the support structure, resulting in a lower overall weight, more fully stressed shield. However, before stress optimization can be initiated, <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> must be defined that cause maximum stress in the various support components. A finite-element model of a longwall shield was used to identify these critical <b>load</b> <b>conditions.</b> These <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> were then evaluated in the Bureau's mine roof simulator (MRS) by instrumentation of a longwall shield and measurement of strains in each of the shield components. The critical (canopy-base contact) <b>load</b> <b>conditions</b> were identified that can cause structural failure at less than rated shield (hydraulic yield) capacity. Comparisons were made between full-contact and partial-contact <b>load</b> <b>conditions.</b> Other parameters investigated included the stiffness of the contact material, changes in shield geometry, rate of load application, and effects of horizontal constraint.
