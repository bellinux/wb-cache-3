5|$|The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> {{appears on}} the $1000 Colombian Peso coin. In the United States, the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is the {{official}} state reptile of South Carolina and also the state saltwater reptile of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{bacteria}} such as Pseudomonas and Salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as Penicillium infect <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> nests and cloacae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is found}} in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in {{saltwater}} and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become , producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.|$|E
50|$|The Leatherback Trust also {{supports}} other <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> conservation initiatives throughout Costa Rica {{and around the}} world.

5|$|The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, nesting over the broadest geographical range of any sea turtle. It inhabits the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{activities}} have {{negative effects on}} <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> populations. The prolonged time required for loggerheads to reach sexual maturity and the high mortality rates of eggs and young turtles from natural phenomena compound the problems of population reduction {{as a consequence of}} {{human activities}}.|$|E
5|$|The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is omnivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws {{serve as an}} effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} of the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is only {{apparent in}} adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are {{shorter than the}} females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are wider and less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads than females. The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, laparoscopy (an operation performed on the abdomen), histological examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with radiolabeling).|$|E
5|$|The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is omnivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It {{has a greater}} list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), {{hatchling}} turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E
50|$|The Western Australian {{coast is}} the site of a {{significant}} number of rookeries of <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (Caretta caretta), green <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (Chelonia mydas), and hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata), all of which are classified Vulnerable to Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The nesting sites are particularly numerous for <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> whose rookeries range from Shark Bay to Gnaraloo Bay in the south, and Ningaloo Reef to the Cape Range National Park in the north.|$|R

5|$|The species most {{frequently}} adopted {{as a state}} reptile is the painted turtle, with four states designating it: Colorado (the western subspecies), Illinois, Michigan, and Vermont. Three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi—represent themselves with the American alligator. A species of box turtle, Terrapene carolina or common box turtle, has been chosen by three states, with North Carolina and Tennessee using the Terrapene carolina carolina (eastern box turtle) subspecies, and with Missouri using the Terrapene carolina triungus (three-toed box turtle) subspecies. Two bordering western states, California and Nevada, chose the desert tortoise. The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> was named by South Carolina as state reptile, while Florida chose it as state saltwater reptile. Florida also named an official tortoise, the gopher tortoise, the same animal as Georgia's state reptile.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{conditions}} {{occurred in}} parts of the other eastern islands. Along the southern shore of Sal, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria. Pier restoration was incomplete as of May2017, about 2.5years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira, and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport. At the height of the hurricane, flooding forced nearly 130people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80percent of the <b>Loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> nests on the beaches of Sal, a crucial nesting site for this species. Overall, Sal suffered CVE$30million ($300,000) in damage from the hurricane. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of Santiago and Fogo, peaking at 13in (330mm) over the mountains of Santiago and causing widespread damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In São Miguel, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Conversely, the rains replenished water reserves and filled a large dam in São Salvador do Mundo to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands. Structural damage across Santiago, largely in flooded urban areas, reached CVE$87million ($860,000).|$|E

40|$|Biochemical and hematologic {{reference}} intervals {{have been}} reported for <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (Caretta caretta, Linnaeus 1758), but low sample numbers and simple statistical analyses have constrained their diagnostic usefulness During June 2007 May 2008, 101 <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, were captured by hand from boats, clinically assessed to determine health status, blood was sampled, and biochemical and hematologic variables were measured Of these turtles, 66 were classified as clinically healthy and 23 as unhealthy Reference intervals were calculated using data from clinically healthy turtles. Of the clinically unhealthy turtles, 82 and 45 % {{had at least one}} biochemical and hematologic result, respectively, outside of at least one or the calculated intervals However, only low proportions of unhealthy <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> had abnormal results for each variable The highest percentage of unhealthy turtles that were outside at least one estimated reference interval was 35 %, for thrombocyte counts Neither sex nor maturity category (mature versus large immature) influenced the risk of being clinically unhealthy. These are the first plasma biochemical and hematologic reference intervals reported for <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> from the southwestern Pacific Ocean We conclude that, for <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> in Moreton Bay, separate reference intervals are required for mature and immature turtles for thrombocyte counts and for male and female turtles for lymphocyte, heterophil, and total white cell counts, otherwise, a single reference interval can be used regardless of age or sex. When estimating reference intervals in <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> it is desirable to use both methods for calculating reference intervals used in this study because intervals can differ substantially between methods for some variables Joint interpretation using reference intervals front both methods allows the categorization of results as "normal," "suspect," or "abnormal...|$|R

50|$|Effective January 11, 2010 the NMFS, NOAA, and Department of Commerce {{removed the}} {{limit on the}} number of fishing gear {{deployments}} for the Hawaii-based pelagic shallow-set longline fisheries and simultaneously increased the number of incidental interactions allowed with <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> This ruling stated that longline fisheries may not interact with over 46 <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> a year, a number thought to not interfere with survival and recovery of <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> This ruling was revised March 10, 2011 {{to reduce the number of}} allowed interactions from 46 a year to 17, a revision aimed to protect the loggerheads and maintain fishery yield. November 18, 2011 the pelagic shallow-set longline fisheries in Hawaii reached the annual limit on physical interactions with turtles and was closed by NMFS. Incidental interaction limit for loggerhead turtles was increased from 17 to 34 interactions a year starting November 5, 2012.|$|R

500|$|Carl Linnaeus {{gave the}} loggerhead its first {{binomial}} name, Testudo caretta, in 1758. Thirty-five other names emerged {{over the following}} two centuries, with the combination Caretta caretta first introduced in 1902 by Leonhard Stejneger. The English common name [...] "loggerhead" [...] refers to the animal's large head. The <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> belongs to the family Cheloniidae, which includes all extant sea turtles except the leatherback sea turtle. The subspecific classification of the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is debated, but most authors consider it a single polymorphic species. Molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> with the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, and green sea turtles. The extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined; however, second-generation hybrids have been reported, suggesting some hybrids are fertile.|$|E
