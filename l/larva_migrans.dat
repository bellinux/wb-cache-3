Ancylostoma caninum, the common dog hookworm, occasionally develops into an adult to cause eosinophilic enteritis in people, but their invasive larvae can cause an itchy rash called cutaneous <b>larva</b> <b>migrans.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{inappropriate}} hosts such {{as humans}} A. caninum {{is able to}} enter the skin but cannot proceed into the circulation {{and on to the}} intestine; instead the disease dermal <b>larva</b> <b>migrans</b> results, caused by movement of the nematode within the skin and which can persist for several months without intervention.|$|E

This large, complex cave {{contains}} one of the most notable bat roosts on the island, {{and is one of the}} few known historical sites for the possibly extinct bat, Phyllonycteris aphylla. Because of the biological importance of the system, and the inherent dangers involved in exploring it (i.e. noxious gases, histoplasmosis, Cutaneous <b>larva</b> <b>migrans,</b> difficult footing), casual visitation is discouraged.|$|E
50|$|Cryotherapy by {{application}} of liquid nitrogen {{to the skin}} {{has been used to}} kill cutaneous <b>larvae</b> <b>migrans,</b> but the procedure has a low cure rate and a high incidence of pain and severe skin damage, so it now is passed over in favor of suitable pharmaceuticals. Topical {{application of}} some pharmaceuticals has merit, but requires repeated, persistent applications and is less effective than some systemic treatments.|$|R
50|$|When adult worms {{attach to}} the villi of the small intestine, they suck on the host's blood, which may cause {{abdominal}} pain, diarrhea, cramps, and weight loss {{that can lead to}} anorexia. Heavy infections can lead to the development of iron deficiency and hypochromic microcytic anemia. This form of anemia in children can give rise to physical and mental retardation. Infection caused by cutaneous <b>larvae</b> <b>migrans,</b> a skin disease in humans, is characterized by skin ruptures and severe itching.|$|R
40|$|Dogs {{belong to}} the group of animals that were the first to be domesticated. They live in {{cohabitation}} with humans and share their environment much more intimately than any other animal specie. The close contact between strays and pets, on the one side, and the pollution of urban areas with the feces of these animals, on the other, close the chain of infection with parasites, which jeopardizes also human health in the final link of that chain. Dogs are carriers and the true hosts to large numbers of species of zoonotic parasites - Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Echinoccocus granulosus, Dipyllidium caninum, Toxocara canis, Ancylostomidae spp. and others, whose eggs or other developmental forms they eliminate into the environment through feces. The {{increase in the number of}} cases of toxocarosis in humans (syndrome of visceral <b>larvae</b> <b>migrans),</b> ancylostomosis (cutanea <b>larvae</b> <b>migrans),</b> hydatidosis, toxoplasmosis, or cryptosporidiosis are the best indicators of these relations. In order to resolve this problem, it is necessary to conduct systematic investigations of their parasitic fauna with the maximum cooperation of the animal owners, compulsory health education of the population in the area of the diseases that are transferred from animals to humans, and, certainly, carrying out the dehelminthization of dogs...|$|R
25|$|Larval {{invasion}} of the skin (mostly in the Americas) can produce a skin disease called cutaneous <b>larva</b> <b>migrans</b> also known as creeping eruption. The hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin, where they give rise to intense, local itching, usually on the foot or lower leg, known as ground itch. This infection is due to larvae from the A. Braziliense hookworm. The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin, causing serpiginous vesicular lesions. With advancing movement of the larvae, the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty. The lesions are typically intensely itchy.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{diseases}} that affect dogs or humans are not transferable {{between the two}} species. [...] Diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are terrmed zoonoses.

40|$|Background: Gnathostoma spinigerum causes <b>larva</b> <b>migran</b> {{in human}} which is endemic in Southeast Asia. Information {{regarding}} larva migration is limited. In this study, we investigated the parasite migra­tion by recovery of worms {{from the whole}} body of mouse after oral infection with advanced third stage larvae (AL 3). The percentage of blood eosinophils was examined in parallel. Methods: Mice were orally infected with AL 3 and histological study of organs was investigated in order to study the migration of AL 3, along with blood eosinophilia. Results: At 1 hr post infection (PI), the larvae remained in the stomach, thereafter at 3, 5, 7, 10 and 24 hr PI; they were recovered from various organs including liver, mesentery, esophagus, diaphragm, lung, heart and dorsal fat. At day 15 PI, they were mostly found in muscles (76. 47 %). The average worm recovery (5 months) was 78. 03 %. The worms {{were found in the}} liver at every time point. Larva encystment was detected. There was a significant difference in blood eosinophils between the 8 larvae- (average 9. 33 % + 6. 25 %) and the 15 larvae-infected groups (average 22. 66 % + 11. 03 %). Surprisingly, the blood eosinophils (average 19. 00 % + 2. 92 %) were not higher in the higher infective dose- group (25 larvae). Conclusion: Liver was involved by G. spinigerum throughout the study. We detected larva encyst­ment which had never been reported in human gnathostomiasis. The highest percentage of eosino­phil occurred during the invasive stage...|$|R

50|$|The Toxocaridae are a {{zoonotic}} {{family of}} parasitic nematodes that infect canids and felids and which cause toxocariasis in humans (visceral <b>larva</b> <b>migrans</b> and ocular <b>larva</b> <b>migrans).</b> The worms {{are unable to}} reproduce in humans.|$|E

50|$|The medical {{signs in}} human gnathostomiasis {{are caused by}} {{migration}} of the immature worms (L3s). Migration in the subcutaneous tissues causes intermittent, migratory, painful, pruritic swellings (cutaneous <b>larva</b> <b>migrans).</b> Migration to other tissues (visceral <b>larva</b> <b>migrans),</b> can result in cough, hematuria, and ocular involvement, with the most serious manifestations eosinophilic meningitis with myeloencephalitis.

5000|$|Visceral <b>larva</b> <b>migrans</b> (VLM) is a {{condition}} in humans caused by the migratory larvae of certain nematodes, humans being a dead-end host, and was first reported in 1952. Nematodes causing such zoonotic infections are Baylisascaris procyonis, Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati, and Ascaris suum. [...] These nematodes can infect but not mature in humans and after migrating through the intestinal wall, travel with the blood stream to various organs where they cause inflammation and damage. Affected organs can include the liver, heart (causing myocarditis) and the CNS (causing dysfunction, seizures, and coma).

Depending on geographic location, degree of eosinophilia, eye and/or pulmonary signs the terms ocular <b>larva</b> <b>migrans</b> (OLM), Weingarten's disease, Frimodt-Møller's syndrome, and eosinophilic pseudoleukemia are applied to toxocariasis.

[...] This zoonotic, helminthic infection is a rare cause of blindness and may provoke rheumatic, neurologic, or asthmatic symptoms. [...] Humans normally become infected by ingestion of embryonated eggs (each containing a fully developed larva, L2) from contaminated sources (soil, undercooked meat, fresh or unwashed vegetables.).|$|E

50|$|Larva currens (Latin for racing larva) is an itchy, {{cutaneous}} condition {{caused by}} infections with Strongyloides stercoralis.

50|$|A {{few days}} after {{ingestion}} epigastric pain, fever, vomiting, and loss of appetite resulting from migration of larvae through intestinal wall to the abdominal cavity {{will appear in the}} patient. Migration in the subcutaneous tissues (under the skin) causes intermittent, migratory, painful, pruritic swellings (cutaneous <b>larva</b> <b>migrans).</b> Patches of edema appear after the above symptoms clear and are usually found on the abdomen. These lesions vary in size and can be accompanied by pruritus, rash, and stabbing pain. Swellings may last for 1 to 4 weeks in a given area and then reappear in a different location. Migration to other tissues (visceral <b>larva</b> <b>migrans),</b> can result in cough, hematuria, ocular (eye) involvement, meningitis, encephalitis and eosinophilia. Eosinophilic myeloencephalitis may also result from invasion of the central nervous system by the larvae.|$|E
