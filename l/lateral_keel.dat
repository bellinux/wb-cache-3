50|$|The {{shortfin mako}} shark is {{cylindrical}} in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and {{the area around the}} mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the {{shortfin mako shark}}, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one <b>lateral</b> <b>keel</b> on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the makos from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus Lamna.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} Tylosurus {{needlefishes}} together with common Belone needlefishes appeared in Thermaikos Gulf (North Aegean Sea, Greece) from 2012 to 2014, especially from May to August. The Tylosurus individuals were identified {{because of the}} absence of gill rakers and the presence of black thin <b>lateral</b> <b>keel</b> on caudal peduncle. From June 2013 to July 2014, 112 specimens of Tylosurus needlefishes were collected from commercial fisheries and a detailed morphometric and meristic analysis was applied for species identification. Measurements were recorded on each specimen, for six distance characters (TL, SL, FL, BL, HL, MBH). The length of fins (pectoral, ventral, dorsal, anal) was measured, various proportions between body and fin length were estimated and the number of fin rays was counted. Total length (TL) ranged from 59. 3 to 111. 6 cm. The soft rays in ventral fins were 6, in dorsal fin were 23 - 26 (mainly 24 with 53 %) and in anal fin were 21 - 23 (mainly 22 with 51 %). Body length to head length (BL/HL) ranged from 2 to 2. 82, BL to pectoral fins length (BL/P) ranged from 8. 3 to 10. 8, BL to ventral fins length (BL/V) ranged from 10. 9 to 17. 7, BL to anterior dorsal fin lobe height (BL/D) ranged from 10. 5 to 15. 3 and BL to anterior anal fin lobe height (BL/A) ranged from 9. 3 to 14. 3. The anal fin lobe ranged from 4. 9 to 7. 4 % of standard length. Moreover, the specimens had greater size in length, greater values in morphometrics (i. e. BL/P etc) and higher values in meristics than those reported for the congeneric species Tylosurus choram (Rüppell, 1837) and Tylosurus crocοdilus (Péron & Lesueur, 1821). The resulted diagnostic features are in accordance to the literature for the systematics of Tylosurus acus imperialis (Rafinesque, 1810). Thus, specimens were identified as T. acus imperialis confirming its occurrence in Thermaikos Gulf waters appearing the northern geographic expansion in the Aegean Sea...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{fish liver}} oils as a dietary {{supplement}} has been practiced {{for hundreds of}} years but not until a comparatively recent date has it been known that the virtue of these oils lies in their vitamin content. Because of this increased knowledge of vitamins, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products analyzed many species of fish in a search for new sources of this much desired food fortifier. Additional stimulus to the search for vitamins in other fish was also furnished by the second World War which curtailed the production of cod liver oil and eventually cut off European supplies. Laboratory tests showed that the soupfin shark along the Pacific Coast of North America has a liver richer in vitamin A than any other fish yet analyzed. As a result, the California fishery for this shark increased at a spectacular rate. By 1942 an investigation of the fish and its fishery was deemed necessary. This required study of the biology of the fish to determine if the population could continue to support the fishery, and an analysis of the vitamin A content of the livers both to understand the causes for the variation in yield between individuals and to ascertain whether methods in practice by the industry produced the highest possible vitamin yield. The soupfin shark (Galeorhinus zyopterus) is classified with the family of true sharks, Galeidae, in which are included the tiger, great blue, smooth-hounds, leopard, and bay shark. The family has a wide distribution in the oceans of the world. The species Galeorhinus zyopterus is found from Cedros Island, Lower California, to northern British Columbia. The soupfin attains a size of slightly over six feet. Its head is flattened dorso-ventrally with the snout projecting well beyond the eyes. It has five gill openings and an anal fin. The first dorsal fin is located about midway between the pectorals and ventrals. The tail, not lunate in shape, is considerably shorter than the body and is deeply notched. There is no <b>lateral</b> <b>keel</b> on the caudal peduncle. The teeth are sharp, placed in several rows and are notched on the outer edge below the point, with {{the lower part of the}} notch divided into two to five points. The position of the second dorsal and anal fins offers the simplest means of distinguishing soupfin from other species of sharks found in California. These fins are inserted opposite each other just anterior to the caudal peduncle and are of about the same height. In lateral view an extension of the anterior and posterior edges of the two fins would intercept to form an almost perfect diamond. To the casual observer, small specimens of soupfin may be confused with brown and grey smooth-hound sharks. However, the second dorsal fin of the smooth-hounds is inserted in advance of the anal fin and exceeds this fin in both length of base and in height. If close attention is given to the insertion and the relative height of the second dorsal and anal fins, the distinction between small soupfin and smooth-hounds is quite marked and should offer no difficulties...|$|E
