40|$|Iron {{blast furnace}} {{is used in}} the {{metallurgical}} field to extract molten pig iron from its ore through a reduction mechanism. The furnace is a vertical shaft with circular cross section. It has five main parts: stack, belly, bosh, tuyeres and hearth. Amongst these regions, hearth is the most important one for the asset <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>furnace.</b> Erosion of refractory lining of the hearth reduces the furnace’s campaign life. So it is necessary to understand the interactions occurring between the slag, molten metal and the refractories. But the severe operating conditions and very high temperature inside the hearth make it impossible to practically observe the processes taking place within it. In order to overcome this problem, the hearth is modelled by using various Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) soft-wares such as ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS-CFX, FLUENT for CATIA V 5, ANSYS CFD-Flo etc. The numerical model is then supplied with data which are already known from practical situations as boundary conditions. Proper physical properties of the materials are also used as input. The software runs several simulations and provides us with the result that can validate the experimental observations up to the most accurate level. In this study, temperature distribution profile inside a blast furnace hearth has been shown by modelling a simple hearth with the help of ANSYS 15. 0 Workbench. The model is simulated by changing some parameters and making several assumptions. The discrepancy in the calculated and the observed temperature opens up new scope for further improvement...|$|E

40|$|Generally speaking, <b>a</b> blast <b>furnace</b> is {{the main}} {{equipment}} in Ironmaking and the campaign <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blast <b>furnace</b> depends on its remaining hearth refractory lining [1]. The Acousto Ultrasonic- Echo (AU-E) is a stress wave propagation technique that uses time and frequency data analysis to determine coarse-grained material thicknesses, such as refractory and stave materials in operating blast <b>furnaces.</b> <b>A</b> mechanical impact {{on the surface of}} the structure (via a hammer or a mechanical impactor) generates a stress pulse, propagating into the furnace layers. The wave is partially reflected by the change in refractory layer properties, but the main pulse propagates through the solid refractory layers until its energy dissipates. The signal is mainly reflected by the refractory/ molten metal interface, or alternatively by the build up/air or molten metal interfaces that are formed between internal layers or at external boundaries. In this paper, we describe the AU-E technique in details and demonstrate a few results that are indicative of the technique reliability and accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{campaign}} <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blast <b>furnace</b> {{is limited}} by the erosion of hearth refractories. Flow and temperature distributions of the liquid iron have a significant influence on the erosion mechanism. In this work, an improved three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model is developed to simulate the flow and heat transfer phenomena in the hearth of BlueScope¿s Port Kembla No. 5 Blast Furnace. Model improvements feature more justified input parameters in turbulence modeling, buoyancy modeling, wall boundary conditions, material properties, and modeling of the solidification of iron. The model is validated by comparing the calculated temperatures with the thermocouple data available, where agreements are established within ± 3 pct. The flow distribution in the hearth is discussed for intact and eroded hearth profiles, for sitting and floating coke bed states. It is shown that natural convection affects the flow in several ways: for example, the formation <b>of</b> (<b>a)</b> stagnant zones preventing hearth bottom from eroding or (b) the downward jetting of molten liquid promoting side wall erosion, or (c) at times, a vortex-like peripheral flow, promoting the ¿elephant foot¿ type erosion. <b>A</b> significant influence <b>of</b> coke bed permeability on the macroscopic flow pattern and the refractory temperature is observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractory}} {{is a major}} limitation to the campaign <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blast <b>furnace.</b> Titanium from titania addition in the burden or tuyere injection can react with carbon and nitrogen in molten pig iron to form titanium carbonitride, giving the so-called titanium-rich scaffold or buildup on the hearth surface, to protect the hearth from subsequent erosion. In the current article, a mathematical model based on computational fluid dynamics is proposed to simulate the behavior of solid particles in the liquid iron. The model considers the fluid/solid particle flow through a packed bed, conjugated heat transfer, species transport, and thermodynamic of key chemical reactions. <b>A</b> region <b>of</b> high solid concentration is predicted at the hearth bottom surface. Regions of solid formation and dissolution can be identified, which depend on the local temperature and chemical equilibrium. The sensitivity to the key model parameters for the solid phase is analyzed. The model provides an insight into the fundamental mechanism of solid particle formation, and it may form a basic model for subsequent development to study the formation of titanium scaffold in the blast furnace hearth...|$|R
40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} typically governs the asset <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blast <b>furnace.</b> Since operating conditions within the hearth make it practically impossible for direct measurement and visualisation, physical and mathematical models {{play an important}} role in understanding and assessing the cause-effect phenomena between the liquid iron, coke bed and refractories. A numerical model has been developed to predict the iron flow and temperature distribution within the packed bed and refractories. <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> case studies have been investigated for Port Kembla’s No. 5 blast furnace, which is entering the 15 th year of its current campaign. These case studies considered the effects of coke free layers (floating/sitting deadman), hearth deposits, coke bed fouling and localised refractory erosion. The refractory temperature distributions predicted by the model compare well with the blast furnace thermocouple measurements and as a result, the model has become a valuable predictive tool for hearth design and control.

40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of the furnace cooling {{is very important for}} the metallurgical industry, because it can substantially increase output and operation <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>A</b> three dimensional mathematical model for the temperature field of the blast furnace stave cooler has been developed and analyzed. The temperature and heat dissipated by stave cooler is examined by using the finite element method. The cast steel stave is studied and computational analysis is made to know the effect of the cooling water velocity, temperature, and the lining material on the maximum temperature of the stave hot surface. The refractory lining materials, which are used in this experiment, are high alumina bricks with different stave materials (copper, aluminum and cast iron). The obtained numerical calculations are compared with that obtained from experiments performed at Rourkela Steel Plant, Odisha taking a stave in belly zone having maximum heat load shows very good agreement...|$|R
