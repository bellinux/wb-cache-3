5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the <b>lurch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering <b>lurch,</b> throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E

5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or <b>lurch</b> the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|In his five-volume {{analysis}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Ramsay Weston Phipps speculated on why Moreau gained renown by the supposed skill of his retreat. Phipps suggested {{that it was not}} skillful for Moreau to allow the inferior columns of Latour, Nauendorf and Fröhlich to herd him back to France. Even during his advance Moreau was irresolute. Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who participated in the campaign as an infantry brigadier, noted that Jourdan made many errors but the French government's errors were worse. The French were unable to pay for supplies because their currency was worthless, so the soldiers stole everything. This ruined discipline and turned the local populations against the French. Jourdan seemed to have an unwarranted faith in Moreau's promise to follow Charles. His decision to give battle at Würzburg was partly done so as not to leave Moreau in the <b>lurch.</b>|$|E

40|$|We study a {{one-dimensional}} {{model of}} integrate-and-fire neurons that {{are allowed to}} fire only one spike, and are coupled by excitatory synapses with delay. At small delay values, this model describes a disinhibited cortical slice. At large delay values, the model is a reduction of a model of thalamic networks composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, in which the excitatory neurons show the post-inhibitory rebound mechanism. The velocity and stability of propagating continuous pulses are calculated analytically. Two pulses with different velocities exist if the synaptic coupling is larger than a minimal value; the pulse with the lower velocity is always unstable. Above a certain critical value of the constant delay, continuous pulses lose stability via a Hopf bifurcation, and <b>lurching</b> pulses emerge. The parameter regime for which <b>lurching</b> occurs is strongly affected by the synaptic footprint (connectivity) shape. A bistable regime, in which both continuous and <b>lurching</b> pulses can propagate, may occur with square or Gaussian footprint shapes but not with an exponential footprint shape. A perturbation calculation is used in order to calculate the spatial <b>lurching</b> period and the velocity of <b>lurching</b> pulses at large delay values. For strong synaptic coupling, the velocity of the <b>lurching</b> pulse is governed by {{the tail of the}} synaptic footprint shape. Moreover, the velocities of continuous and <b>lurching</b> pulses have the same functional dependencies on the strength of the synaptic coupling strength g syn : they increase logarithmically with g syn for an exponential footprint shape, they scale like (ln g syn) 1 / 2 for a Gaussian footprint shape, and they are bounded for a square footprint shape or any shape with a finite support.

25|$|On 16 March 1918, Rudolf Berthold was {{transferred}} to Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2) to replace Hauptmann Adolf Ritter von Tutschek, killed in action the previous day. The German Spring Offensive was launched on 21 March. Berthold was in a tenuous and stressful situation. He had suffered {{the loss of his}} best friend, left his old squadron in the <b>lurch,</b> was taking command of an unfamiliar larger unit, and was not on flight status. His partial solution to his dilemma was {{to take advantage of a}} loophole. Customarily, a Luftstreitkräfte commander being transferred swapped a cadre of his unit into his new assignment. Berthold effected a wholesale exchange of Jasta 18 people and aircraft into Jagdstaffel 15 in the wing. Jasta 15 became the wing's Stab Staffel (command squadron). Berthold then departed for Buddecke's funeral in Berlin on 22 March to give a eulogy. He returned to his new assignment two days into the new German offensive, to find that the infantry divisions his wing was supposed to support were complaining about their lack of air cover. Jagdgeschwader 2's performance improved under its grounded commander's guidance, as the Germans advanced 65 kilometers in eight days.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{alliance}} began {{a new era}} {{in political}} and commercial relations with England. However, of more immediate benefit to the Allies was the port of Lisbon, which would provide year round naval access to the Mediterranean, as well as support from the Portuguese army to fight for the Grand Alliance in Spain. As part of the agreement Peter II had demanded that Archduke Charles be sent in person to Portugal. In the King's estimation the presence of the Archduke would help facilitate an anti-Bourbon rising in Spain, but it would also guarantee that the Allies would not leave him in the <b>lurch</b> once he had forfeited his French alliance. To Queen Anne's ministers replacing the Duke of Anjou with Archduke Charles appeared a good way to break Spain's trade monopoly in its colonial empire, knowing that Habsburg control over Spanish America was in England's commercial interest; moreover, it satisfied the Grand Strategic concept of pressing Louis XIV across multiple fonts. However, the agreement also meant the Allies were now committed to a war to secure the whole Spanish inheritance for the Austrian Habsburgs. At first the Emperor had been hesitant as his immediate goals were in Italy not Spain. Nevertheless, it was the weight of English gold and diplomacy which prevailed, and on 12 September 1703 Archduke Charles was crowned Charles III of Spain in Vienna. He arrived in Lisbon, via London, in early March 1704.|$|E

500|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was {{recorded}} by [...] "Dub" [...] Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser shotgun microphone and a Uher [...] "Report 4000" [...] reel-to-reel tape recorder. It {{was the first}} audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed; some sources consider it the first live bootleg. Though the sound {{is not nearly as}} clear as the official release of Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording, especially one of that era. The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound. Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States, recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album. At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham's staff, who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on <b>Lurch</b> Records in early 1970.|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{described}} the song as a [...] "hefty slab of dramatic rock {{which includes the}} band's trademark electric guitars with melodic choruses".

[...] He further praised the [...] "catchy-as-cholera" [...] chorus and gave a mixed review about the lyrics and the title saying [...] "fortunately their words {{seemed to have been}} a touch overzealous; though it's clear from the trailer for the group's third album that they've been spending a night or two on the tiles." [...] Lewis Corner of the same publication concluded: [...] "'What You Want' proved... the band's melodious rock sensibilities remain firmly in tact". Tamar Anitai of MTV, Theon Weber of Spin, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and Edna Gundersen of USA Today chose the song as an album highlight. Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson also chose it as a highlight, further describing it as [...] "fierce". Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood wrote that [...] "'What You Want' rides its central riff with a bulldozer's efficiency." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe found a [...] "metallic <b>lurch</b> playing off of Lee's goth-empress vocals" [...] in the song.

500|$|David has no {{obligation}} {{to share with the}} Finley & Figg partners the proceeds of this case, which was his own initiative. However, his sense of loyalty prevents him from leaving an ailing firm and ailing fellows in the <b>lurch.</b> David returns to the office and tells Oscar and Wally of his settlement. He offers to pay the debts left from the Krayoxx fiasco, amounting to $200,000 and pays off the mortgage on the firm's office building, gives the loyal secretary Rochelle a $100,000 bonus and splits the remaining $1.2 million evenly with them (a far more generous settlement than they planned to give him, had the Krayoxx money come in). In return, the three of them are to sign a 12-month contract to enter an equal partnership and will no longer be an ambulance-chasing firm. A bit embarrassed, Oscar and Wally agree to the new contract. However, the two of them can't really function under these new terms, and later that year the partnership falls apart. Finley begins spending less time in the office and eventually retires a happy man, having recently remarried and being much more satisfied with his new wife, while Figg packs up and moves to Alaska. [...] Zinc opens his own product liability practice, David E. Zinc, Attorney-at-Law and hires Rochelle as his new secretary. Soon winning two further lead poisoning cases, he seems well embarked on a professionally and financially satisfying career.|$|E
