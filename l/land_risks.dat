5000|$|The {{undisclosed}} principal concept often {{arises in}} the context of real estate transactions, where a buyer risks a seller being less inclined to sell <b>land,</b> <b>risks</b> a seller demanding a higher price, or risks a seller becoming a holdout if the seller knows or can guess the identity of the buyer or the buyer's intended purpose for the land which would afford the land a higher value. The purchase of the land required to build the Walt Disney World resort in Orange County, Florida was accomplished with agents working for Walt Disney Productions as their undisclosed principal. Over eighteen months in 1964 and 1965, agents secretly working for Disney attorneys purchased 27,400 acres of Florida ranchland, swamp, scrub woods and road frontage for an average price of only R5.20 per acre ($5 million total). It is unlikely that Disney {{would have been able to}} acquire the land except at prohibitively high prices of hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre had the sellers known their buyer's identity, given the prices at which nearby land sold after Disney completed its acquisitions and publicly announced its plan. (The project could also have been delayed for years or decades as owners of crucial pieces of land held out for higher offers.) ...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{has emerged}} as a {{dominant}} decision-making paradigm in UK environmental regulation. Much of its appeal rests on the assumption that it provides an objective way of judging the significance of environmental problems so that defensible and proportionate regulatory action can be taken. However, this assumption is challenged in the risk literature. Consideration of the risk assessment process shows that it requires methodological judgements and there is debate whether these are made on objective (scientific) or SUbjective grounds. The UK contaminated land regime provides an ideal case study to examine the way that these methodological judgements are made. The regime is explicitly risk-based, with decisions about the significance of contaminated <b>land</b> <b>risks</b> made in theory {{solely on the basis of}} technical risk assessments. This research examines the factors that influence key methodological jUdgements in contaminated land risk assessment and explores the extent to which they affect subsequent decisions about the significance of contaminated <b>land</b> <b>risks.</b> A survey of UK risk assessment practitioners shows that many of them consider risk assessment to be at least partly SUbjective, although opinions vary on the extent to which specific methodological steps are subjective. Interviews with risk assessors conclude that personal, commercial, technical and organisational factors influence their methodological choices. Similar interviews with local authority officers conclude that their ability to critically evaluate and influence these judgements is diminished by variable expertise, limited resources, inadequate regulatory guidance and low transparency of reporting. Cumulatively, these factors have a material bearing on the findings of an assessment. It is concluded that current contaminated land risk assessment is a social process in which non-scientific considerations significantly influence key judgements. It follows that risk assessment does not actually provide an objective basis for deciding the acceptability of contaminated <b>land</b> <b>risks.</b> This conclusion. has a wider significance for the use of risk assessment in environmental regulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{organization}} of water supply to and on ships differs considerably {{from that of}} water supply on <b>land.</b> <b>Risks</b> of contamination can arise from source water at the port or during loading, storage, or distribution on the ship. The {{purpose of this article}} is to review documented outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with passenger, cargo, fishing, and naval ships to identify contributing factors so that similar outbreaks can be prevented in the future. METHODS: The authors reviewed 21 reported outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with ships. For each outbreak, data on pathogens/toxins, type of ship, factors contributing to outbreaks, mortality and morbidity, and remedial action are presented. RESULTS: The findings of this review show that the majority of reported outbreaks were associated with passenger ships and that more than 6, 400 people were affected. Waterborne outbreaks due to Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, noroviruses, Salmonella spp, Shigella sp, Cryptosporidium sp, and Giardia lamblia occurred on ships. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was the pathogen most frequently associated with outbreaks. One outbreak of chemical water poisoning also occurred on a ship. Risk factors included contaminated port water, inadequate treatment, improper loading techniques, poor design and maintenance of storage tanks, ingress of contamination during repair and maintenance, cross-connections, back siphonage, and insufficient residual disinfectant. CONCLUSIONS: Waterborne disease outbreaks on ships can be prevented. The factors contributing to outbreaks emphasize the need for hygienic handling of water along the supply chain from source to consumption. A comprehensive approach to water safety on ships is essential. This may be achieved by the adoption of Water Safety Plans that cover design, construction, operation, and routine inspection and maintenance...|$|E

The study applies a one period, two date model with uncertainty in both production and end-of-period land price.

The several contributors to landing dispersions (navigation and atmospheric uncertainties, spacecraft modeling, winds, and margins) are discussed, as are the analysis tools used. JPL’s MarsLS program, a MATLAB-based landing dispersion visualization and statistical analysis tool, was used to calculate the probability of landing within hazardous areas. By convolving this with the probability of landing within flight system limits (in-spec landing) for each hazard area, a single overall measure of <b>landing</b> <b>risk</b> was calculated for each landing ellipse. In-spec probability contours were also generated, allowing a more synoptic view of site risks, illustrating the sensitivity to changes in landing location, and quantifying the possible consequences of anomalies such as incomplete maneuvers.

40|$|Studies of risk {{perception}} across multiple disciplines conclude similar findings, {{one of which}} is that the perceived risk of extreme and rare events, such as earthquakes, is underestimated before the event and overestimated after the event occurs.

40|$|Two of {{the main}} {{desertification}} indices or <b>land</b> degradation <b>risks</b> in agricultural areas are soil erosion and contamination. Increased land degradation is one possible, and important, consequence of global climate change. Therefore, it is a priority to predict global environmental change impacts on these degradation <b>risks.</b> <b>Land</b> evaluation is a formal way to develop the capability to predict <b>land</b> degradation <b>risks</b> or vulnerability caused by interactive changes in land use and climate. The fundamental purpose of land evaluation is to predict the consequences of change. As {{a part of the}} ACCESS model, and by using standard land evaluation techniques, a qualitative prediction approach was developed to assess the risks of soil erosion and contamination in agricultural lands. Through this bio-physical approach, it is easy to modify parameters to create new evaluating scenarios, run the evaluation models, and observe their effects. The Andalucia Region of Spain was used as the test region for this approach, based on the current climate and two climate change scenarios. The evaluation results show that 16 % and 27 % of the Andalucian land area is at elevated risk of soil rainfall erosion and contamination, respectively; and a further 58 % and 33 % at medium risk. For the present drought scenario, the modelling approach predicts that in 59 % of <b>land</b> the erosion <b>risk</b> decreases, while for 24 % of land this vulnerability increases. These values are 40 % and 60 %, respectively, for soil contamination vulnerability. The second scenario assumes the predicted climate change for 2050 AD for the Mediterranean area. This evaluation predicts that in 18 % of <b>land</b> the erosion <b>risk</b> decreases, and increases in 47 % of land. For the contamination vulnerability the predicted values {{are similar to those of}} the first scenario. Thus, change in rainfall amount affected erosion risks strongly, but this change proved to have little direct influence on contamination vulnerability...|$|R
