40|$|As patent {{licensing}} {{has become the}} prime driver of technology trade, understanding the rationales behind a properly-deﬁned payment structure of the agreements is essential. Speciﬁcally, among the other remuneration components, upfront fees are critical in license negotiations since they imply a signiﬁcant initial investment y the <b>licensee</b> and represent a source of liquidity for the licensor. We investigate how contractual ﬂexibility, market uncertainty and technical uncertainty shape pfront fees from the <b>licensee’s</b> perspective. Upfront fees are shown to be positively associated with contractual ﬂexibility and market uncertainty, while technical ncertainty is positively associated with upfront fees only if the license warrants contractual ﬂexibility to the <b>licensee.</b> <b>Licensees</b> therefore do not necessarily see ncertainty as a negative attribute of a patent license, {{but rather as a}} potential value, above all if in presence of contractual ﬂexibility...|$|R
50|$|<b>Licensees</b> — Any {{company or}} {{organization}} that agrees {{to refrain from}} using its patent portfolio against the Linux System may become an OIN <b>licensee.</b> <b>Licensees</b> benefit from royalty-free access to a valuable and growing portfolio of strategic patents, {{as well as from}} ongoing communication with OIN concerning Linux-related patent issues. In so doing, <b>licensees</b> facilitate their access to OIN resources such as Linux Defenders, which is designed to address patent issues with the potential to impact Linux. OIN <b>licensees,</b> be they founding members, associate members or <b>licensees,</b> contribute to an ever-expanding community of companies that share a common goal of ensuring freedom of action in and across the GNU/Linux ecosystem. Through their unified commitment to Linux, they limit the negative effect of patent-based challenges mounted by companies antagonistic to Linux and open source innovation.|$|R

40|$|To provide {{guidance}} on {{the definition of}} Leak-Before-Break (LBB) analysis and its application {{for the evaluation of}} nuclear power plant piping systems. B. BACKGROUND It has come {{to the attention of the}} staff through recent discussions with <b>licensees,</b> <b>licensee</b> submittals, and internal staff discussions that <b>licensees</b> may be performing analyses purported to be "LBB analyses " for purposes not approved by the NRC. LBB is an analysis procedure with a limited scope of applicability and requires NRC review and approval. This directive discusses the existing regulatory positions related to this issue and provides inspection guidance in this area. C. DISCUSSION The NRC undertook a plan to assess the applicability of LBB analyses to nuclear power plant piping systems with the establishment of the Piping Review Committee and the Pipe Break Task Group during the early 1980 s. The work of the Pipe Break Task Group culminated in the publication of NUREG- 1061, Vol. 3 in November 1984, which delineated the staff's assessment of LBB applicability. Subsequently, the NRC amended the scope of General Design Criteria...|$|R
