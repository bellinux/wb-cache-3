500|$|Kershaw {{started the}} 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but {{did so by}} walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, {{throwing}} just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, [...] "I didn't give our team any kind of chance. It's just not a good feeling to let your teammates down, <b>let</b> <b>everybody</b> down. It stings, it hurts. I've got to figure things out." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 1999 Tournament of the Americas, Nash led Canada to {{the silver}} medal, {{qualifying}} {{the team for}} the Olympics {{for the first time}} in 12 years; he was named tournament MVP. Nash captained Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over Spain and a stunning 83–75 win over favoured Yugoslavia when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists. Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a five-point loss to France and Nash left the court in tears. Nash expressed disappointment with the result, saying [...] "It hurts a lot. I feel like I <b>let</b> <b>everybody</b> down. We could have been in the championship game. We were good enough." [...] Nevertheless, he did see a possible silver lining, saying [...] "Hopefully kids [...] will be inspired to play—that's what I really hope." [...] A victory in its final game of the tournament, a placement game against Russia, enabled Canada to salvage seventh place. Nash's Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 Lionel Conacher Award, which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} how to make use of a secret with-out publishing the source. The point of the departure is the so-called Zimmermann Telegram which, at least to some extent, motivated the U. S. A. to join the Allies in the war against Imperial Germany. The paper analyzes how Admiral Hall, Director of British Naval Intelligence, managed to convince the US Government that he can read the Telegram, written in cryptographic code, without <b>letting</b> <b>everybody,</b> including the Germans, know that his department can decipher the German code. A game theoretic model is presented which supports the historical analysis...|$|R
