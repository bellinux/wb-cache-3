40|$|The pile {{loading test}} {{programme}} for the KCRC West Rail project provided an unusual opportunity to measure {{load carrying capacity}} of <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> founded in soils and rocks {{as well as the}} load-settlement relationships. <b>Large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> founded in soils were reviewed and studied in detail, in particular the degree of friction mobilization using a "mobilisation rating" factor. The behaviour of <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> constructed under water with temporary casing and under bentonite are different. For the former case, over 90 % of the ultimate shaft resistance is mobilised at an average local pile displacement of 2 % the pile diameter. For the latter case, friction capacity is achieved at a local pile displacement of less than 1 % of the pile diameter. The average shaft resistance normalized with N̄ and β̄ under bentonite are only 0. 6 (kPa) and 0. 1, respectively i. e. 50 % and 70 % less than the average values for the piles constructed under water. The design of shaft resistance capacity of piles founded in soils is normally based on either effective stress approach or SPT N approach, however, assuming a constant relationships between shaft resistance and SPT N or effective overburden stress are misleading. Clear trends have been identified in this research by three alternative approaches, τ̄/N̄ against N̄, β̄ against N̄ and β̄ versus σnu'̄. Side resistance of rock socket piles is analysed with regard to the rock type and the analysed results is compared with the findings and correlations from the literature. Specific attention is given to the degree of mobilization in addition to the capacity of side resistance. With regard to the capacity of side resistance, empirical correlations with the unconfined compressive strength (rock or concrete whichever is the lowest) are suggested for granitic rocks in Hong Kong and Singapore separately. The empirical correlation for granitic rock socket in Hong Kong is consistent with the lower bound correlation suggested by Horvath et al (1983). The failure load criteria adopted in Hong Kong were not developed with slow maintained load tests on <b>large</b> diameter long <b>bored</b> <b>piles.</b> <b>Large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> have considerable load resistance capacity and it is often impractical to reach the failure load as defined by the various criteria. From the results of this study, a new non-subjective semi-empirical method is proposed for estimating the lower bound interpreted failure loads for piles founded in weathered rocks and saprolitic soils. The method is based on a lower bound estimation of the movement required to mobilize toe resistance and incorporates observations of shaft shortening from pile loading tests. The newly proposed method may allow more effective and consistent designs for large diameter piles in weathered materials...|$|R
40|$|In Hong Kong <b>large</b> {{diameter}} long <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> and barrettes {{are often}} used to support tall buildings to resist both vertical and horizontal loads. These piles penetrate through and may be founded in saprolitic soils or rocks. Generally, the design for side shear resistance (often called skin friction) of <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> (drilled caissons or shafts) in saprolites involves considerable uncertainty and design parameters must usually be verified by field tests. In this paper, 28 full-scale load tests on <b>large</b> diameter machine <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> constructed in various saprolitic soils were reviewed in detail, in particular the degree of mobilization of side shear resistance using a mobilization rating factor. The diameter of these floating piles ranges from 1. 0 m to 1. 5 m and the depth from 22 m to 75 m. The authors were heavily involved in the recent construction and testing of 12 of these <b>piles.</b> For <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> constructed under water, 90 % ultimate side shear resistance was mobilized at an average local pile displacement of 1. 9 % of the pile diameter with a 95 % confidence range of 0. 9 % to 3. 0 %. For piles constructed under bentonite, ultimate side shear resistance was achieved at a local pile displacement of 1 % of the pile diameter. For non-grouted <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> constructed under water, the mobilized side shear resistance lies between 0. 5 (N) over bar and 2. 0 (N) over bar (kPa) and (β) over bar values fall within 0. 1 and 0. 5, with average values of 1. 2 (N) over bar (kPa) and 0. 3 respectively. Post-grouting improves the capacity of side shear resistance {{by a factor of}} about 2 as compared with the non-grouted piles constructed under water.

40|$|Hong Kong is a {{small city}} with a dense population. Due to limited land {{resources}} and dense population, skyscrapers are built to meet the commercial and residential needs. To fulfill the functional requirements, the superstructure is usually supported by piles through a thick cap. A <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> foundation {{is one of the}} most common deep foundation systems with a high capacity adopted in Hong Kong. Most of those piles are founded on Grade III or better rock. However, as lack of field experience and high quality database, the behavior of such pile foundation system is still unclear. These <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> are designed as the end bearing piles. In addition, the load distribution among the piles and the load shared by the pile cap are also not properly addressed in the local design. In order to properly address the above-mentioned issues related to the design of pile foundation, in particular for <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles,</b> a comprehensive field study was launched. Furthermore, the numerical simulations were also carried out. A comprehensive field study was carried out on the behavior of a building supported by <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles.</b> The building (40 -storey public housing) is Y-shaped with three wings (Wing A, Wing B, and Wing C) and a central core (Central Core). The superstructure is resting on a Y-shaped foundation cap (2. 3 m in thickness) which is supported by 18 <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> (2. 2 m in diameter). The piles terminated at Grade III or better rocks. The field test results indicated that the pile group took up most of the applied load, while the cap had an insignificant contribution to the capacity of the foundation system. The axial force in the pile increased from the outer edge to the inner area of the cap. The shaft resistances mobilized in the soil layer and the rock layer were significant. As a result, the axial force reduced to a not significant level at the toe. The finite element model could generally reflect the <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> deformation and the load distribution along the pile. The numerical simulation results could generally reveal the load distribution among the piles. Based on the numerical analyses, the load distribution among the piles was strongly dependent on the cap stiffness. Moreover, when some pile stiffness reduced, the applied load will redistribute among the piles. More loads will transfer to the nearby stiff piles. The effected region of redistribution in axial force increased with the cap stiffness. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> are {{a common}} type of {{foundations}} adopted in Hong Kong. As <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> are constructed underground, visual examinations of potential pile defects are not feasible. Thus, quality assurance measures such as integrity tests and static loading tests {{play an important role}} to ensure the construction workmanship and quality. According to results from quality assurance tests, pile imperfections, especially at the pile toe, are not uncommon. As large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> are usually designed as end bearing piles, engineers concern much about how toe defects affect the pile performance. This thesis aims to investigate the occurrence of pile defects and the effect of pile defects on the behavior of <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles.</b> The construction and quality assurance of <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> in Hong Kong were first reviewed. Survey studies on the causes and occurrence rates of pile defects were then carried out. Lastly, five centrifuge model tests and corresponding numerical simulations were carried out to study the effect of pile defects on the performance of pile foundations. In the survey study, a questionnaire survey on quality assurance measures and occurrences of potential pile defects was conducted. Besides, several case studies in Hong Kong on potential defects such as toe debris and cracks were carried out. About 86 % of the pile toes in the investigated projects are found intact. Moreover, the occurrence rate of toe debris has been decreased gradually with time {{as a result of the}} extra attention paid to the construction workmanship and advances in construction techniques. In the centrifuge modeling, two series of static loading tests were performed to simulate large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> 2 m in diameter. The first series of tests included two tests on single piles while the second series of tests included three tests on pile groups. Excessive settlement was measured from the defective single pile and there was a 30 % reduction in its ultimate capacity. In the pile groups with defective piles, the applied load was largely taken by piles without defects. The reductions in the ultimate capacities of the pile group with soft toes and the pile group with short piles were 14 % and 51 %, respectively. When the applied vertical load was large, lateral failure mechanisms could also be induced even if the applied vertical load was concentric. FB-Pier, a finite element program, was adopted for the analysis of the defective single piles and pile groups simulated in the centrifuge.

This paper attempts to review the applicability of the formulae published in the literature in granite formation of Malaysia. A program of field testing tests was conducted to measure the axial response of <b>bored</b> <b>piles.</b> A total of 15 <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> of diameter varying from 1000 mm to 1500 mm were constructed in decomposed granite using techniques including advancing of temporary casing and with drilling slurry composed of bentonite fluids.

40|$|The {{complete}} load-settlement behaviour of piles can {{be assessed}} by using analytical and numerical methods or by performing load tests.

40|$|As a {{necessity}} {{to support an}} increasing magnitude of loads from tall buildings and long span bridges, the piling practice in the Bangkok Plain has moved several phases from driven pre-cast reinforced and prestressed concrete piles of smaller cross sections to spun <b>piles</b> and <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles.</b> The Chao Phraya plain in which the Bangkok city is located is low-lying and consists of a broad basin filled with sedimentary soils which form alternate layers of clay, sand, and clay. The upper clay layer is soft and highly compressible followed by a stiff clay layer extending to about 20 m or so and then followed by a layer of sand. Driven piles are normally taken down to this upper sand layer. However when the demand for a higher capacity arise, these piles cannot be extended in length due to construction problems and as such <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> are needed to be taken down to as deep as 50 to 60 m.

According to the literature, there are no published cases of full-scale lateral pile response subjected to a different combination of axial and lateral loads. Therefore, this case deals with a full-scale axial loaded pile [13] to make a comparison with a case study of axial loaded piles. Results of laboratory and field tests are used to identify the soil profiles and soil properties, pile load tests are well instrumented. The case study consists of a <b>large</b> diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> of 1.2  m diameter which were used {{for the construction of a}} new 2.2  km road dual carriageway viaduct on an existing road [13]. The road project is situated in Port Klang, and links the West Port to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The piles were tested vertically to assess the axial bearing capacity of designed piles. The length of each <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> is approximately 75  m with steel casing being used for the top 30  m. The <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> were designed to carry loads ranging from 300 to 600  kN. The generalized subsoil properties consist of very soft silty clay with traces of sea shells with depth 20  m. Below this layer is a 10  m of soft silty clay followed by a layer of medium dense to dense silty sand and medium stiff silty clay of about 20 and 7  m depth, respectively. Finally the lowest layer consists of very dense fine grained sand. Comparable data were obtained between the experimental results of the three piles and the presented simulation model in the case of axial test. The magnitude of deflection of the piles was not the same as the field test due possibly to the variability of soil properties. The result obtained from the finite element simulation is closer to the result measured from pile number one.|$|R

40|$|In the LRFD {{methodology}} for ultimate limit state design, resistance factors {{can be applied}} to both resistances and loads. Resistance factors at a target reliability level can be derived based on statistical data on resistances and load effects using reliability theory. In this paper, resistance factors for limit state design of large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> are developed using a design point method, based on the statistics of prediction model performance obtained from Hong Kong load test cases. A design method for large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> in soils and a design method for large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> socketed in rocks are considered. The resistance factors for the shaft and toe resistance components are calculated separately. Copyright ASCE 2009...|$|R

This happens because the debris flow has a high speed and carry a mixture of sediment and other materials. Of infrastructure is built on rivers area flow pattern makes the need for special handling to maintain the protected structure with a substantial investment. This study focuses on the modeling and observation influence debris flow on bridge piers with three (3) conditions: unprotected bridge piers, using gabion protection, and <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> protection on the model. By using a discharge of 1. 54 liters/sec on a scale model of the maximum scours depth is obtained that occurred on bridge piers unprotected condition, that is equal to 1. 7 cm and the minimum scours occurs in conditions of safety piers the <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> is equal to 1. 48 cm. The maximum scours volume occurs in the downstream bridge using gabion protected, amounting to 400 cm 2, while the minimum volume of sediment scours occurs by using a safety <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> 257. 5 cm 3. By the using protected piers <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> more effective to resist scours due to debris flows. This is due to the construction of <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> does not impede the flows that occurs so that the effect scours will reach a point of equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{variation}} in soil layers, {{it is not}} easy for engineer to be assured that theoretical design of piles comply with the actual site condition. Thus, every design of piled foundations carries its own uncertainty and risk. This study evaluates the applicability of six methods to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> by static load test at site. Analyses and evaluation were conducted on six <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> of different sizes and length. The methods are Chin-Kondner’s Method, Brinch Hansen’s Method, DeBeer’s Method, Butler & Hoy’s Method, Fuller & Hoy’s and Decourt’s Method. The pile capacities determined using the different methods were compared with the theoretical method such as semi-empirical method and simplified soil mechanic method within Kenny Hill formation. Results of the analyses show that the best performing method is DeBeer’s Method. Fuller & Hoys’s and Butler & Hoy’s methods is the recommended method for <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> design practice as it is consistent in predicting the <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> capability. Chin-Kondner’s method is the over predicted most than the others interpretation methods...|$|R

Based on the research result, it is concluded that maximum and minimum temperature happens on 80 hours hydration process after a foundry with maximum temperature 43, 94 °C and minimum 20 °C; so the temperature difference on the <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> foundation is 23, 94 °C. From the temperature difference, the maximum tension value is 0, 56 N/mm 2 and allowed tension is 2, 27 N/mm 2. So, it is generaly stated that Suramadu <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> foundation is saved from cracking because the value of maximum tension is lower than allowed concrete tension...|$|R
