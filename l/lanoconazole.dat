2500|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{treatments of}} infections caused by Exserohilum {{are still very}} scarce. Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with amphotericin B, itraconazole and/or voriconazole. Although E. rostratum is sensitive to amphotericin B, a common antifungal agent, the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent drug repurposing screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and <b>lanoconazole</b> as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints. It {{has also been shown}} to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has potential as a treatment for CNS infections as well, though not reaching levels as high as the azoles.|$|E
40|$|In vitro and in vivo antidermatophyte {{activities}} of NND- 502, a new imidazole antimycotic agent, {{were compared with}} those of two existing antifungal agents, <b>lanoconazole</b> and terbinafine. NND- 502 exhibited strong in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton spp.; its MIC was 1 to 4 times lower than that of <b>lanoconazole</b> or terbinafine. In an in vivo study with a guinea pig model of tinea pedis, 7 -day topical treatment with a 0. 5 % solution of NND- 502 (dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400) was more effective than that with a 0. 5 % solution of either <b>lanoconazole</b> or terbinafine for eradicating fungi from the infected feet. When the duration of treatment was shortened to 3 days, a topical 1 % solution of NND- 502 achieved a complete mycological cure, while topical 1 % solutions of <b>lanoconazole</b> and terbinafine did not...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{efficacy of}} short-term treatment with a 1 % cream of <b>lanoconazole,</b> a new imidazole antimy-cotic agent, {{in comparison with}} that of a 1 % cream of terbinafine was evaluated in the guinea pig model of tinea pedis. Each agent was topically applied once a day for 3 or 7 consecutive days, starting on day 10 postinfection, and a culture study was conducted on day 5 after the last treatment with each agent. The 1 % cream of <b>lanoconazole</b> was as highly effective as the 1 % cream of terbinafine in terms of eradicating the fungi from the infected feet. <b>Lanoconazole,</b> (6) -(E) -[4 -(2 -chlorophenyl) - 1, 3 -dithiolan- 2 -ylidene]- 1 -imidazolylacetonitrile, is a new imidazole antimy-cotic agent, and clinical trials with 1 % cream and solution preparations completed in Japan demonstrated its therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of various dermatomycoses includ-ing tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and cutaneous candidiasis (9). Consistently, in preclinical studies the same preparations of <b>lanoconazole</b> exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy in guinea pig models of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and cutaneous can...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{efficacy of}} 1 % cream and 1 % solution of <b>lanoconazole,</b> a new imidazole antimycotic agent, {{in the model}} of cutaneous candidiasis in prednisolone-treated guinea pigs was evaluated in comparison with that of comparable formulations of bifonazole. Each preparation was topically applied once a day for 3 consecutive days, starting {{on the fifth day}} postinfection, and quantitative culture study wsa conducted on the ninth day postinfection. Both formulations of <b>lanoconazole</b> were much more highly effective in terms of eradication of fungi than the bifonazole formulations...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mode of}} action of the newly synthesized optically active imidazole compound, NND- 502, () -(E) -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 3 -dithiolan- 2 -ylidene]- 1 -im-idazolylacetonitrile, its effect on ergosterol biosynthesis in cell-free extracts of Candida albicans was examined and {{compared with that of}} the (S) -enantiomer of NND- 502 in addition to <b>lanoconazole</b> and bifonazole, both of which are clinically used for the treatment of dermatomycoses. NND- 502 was found to interfere with ergosterol biosynthesis by inhibition of sterol 14 a-demethylase, while no interference due to the (S) -enantiomer of NND- 502 was found, indicating that the stereochemical orientation of the 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl group {{plays an important role in}} the interac-tion with the enzyme. In terms of drug concentration exerting 50 % inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, NND- 502 was 2 · 5 and 28 times more effective than that of <b>lanoconazole</b> and bifonazole, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of KP- 103, a novel triazole derivative, against pathogenic fungi that cause dermatomycoses and its therapeutic efficacy against plantar tinea pedis and cutaneous candidiasis in guinea pigs were investigated. MICs {{were determined by}} a broth microdilution method with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-buffered RPMI 1640 medium for Candida species and with Sabouraud dextrose broth for dermatophytes and by an agar dilution method with medium C for Malassezia furfur. KP- 103 was the most active of all the drugs tested against Candida albicans (geometric mean [GM] MIC, 0. 002 μg/ml), other Candida species including Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata (GM MICs, 0. 0039 to 0. 0442 μg/ml), and M. furfur (GM MIC, 0. 025 μg/ml). KP- 103 (1 % solution) was highly effective {{as a treatment for}} guinea pigs with cutaneous candidiasis and achieved mycological eradication in 8 of the 10 infected animals, whereas none of the imidazoles tested (1 % solutions) was effective in even reducing the levels of the infecting fungi. KP- 103 was as active as clotrimazole and neticonazole but was less active than <b>lanoconazole</b> and butenafine against Trichophyton rubrum (MIC at which 80 % of isolates are inhibited [MIC 80], 0. 125 μg/ml) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (MIC 80, 0. 25 μg/ml). However, KP- 103 (1 % solution) exerted therapeutic efficacy superior to that of neticonazole and comparable to those of <b>lanoconazole</b> and butenafine, yielding negative cultures for all samples from guinea pigs with plantar tinea pedis tested. This suggests that KP- 103 has better pharmacokinetic properties in skin tissue than the reference drugs. Because the in vitro activity of KP- 103, unlike those of the reference drugs, against T. mentagrophytes was not affected by hair as a keratinic substance, its excellent therapeutic efficacy seems to be attributable to good retention of its antifungal activity in skin tissue, in addition to its potency...|$|E
