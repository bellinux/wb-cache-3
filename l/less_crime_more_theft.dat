40|$|The main {{argument}} {{of a recent}} book by John Lott is summarized in the title: <b>More</b> Guns, <b>Less</b> <b>Crime</b> [26]. There are three parts to this argument: 1. {{that there were more}} guns 2. that there was <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> 3. that <b>more</b> guns caused <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> Lott’s argument depends on all three parts being true. If any one of the parts is incorrect, the entire argument fails. In fact, as I will show in the next three sections of this document, all three parts are wrong: 1. there weren’t significantly more guns (see Section 1) 2. there wasn’t <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> (see Section 2) 3. even if there was <b>more</b> guns and <b>less</b> <b>crime,</b> <b>more</b> guns did not cause <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> (see Section 3) 1 Were there more guns?

40|$|Despite an {{abundance}} of literature demonstrating that immigration and crime are unassociated, public opinion often reflects the contrary. I examine a source that could contribute to this disconnect between research and public opinion – media framing – particularly, how the specific way that news outlets talk about immigration and crime, along with where they are located geographically, influence how prominently these stories are covered. I employ content analysis of newspaper articles from 2008 - 2012, which I geo-locate and pair with structural covariates gathered from several other data sources. I use multilevel models to analyze the effect of article-level framing and county-level contextual characteristics on article prominence in newspapers. Findings reveal that newspapers in counties with less immigrants and <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> are <b>more</b> likely to prominently feature articles discussing immigration and crime. Furthermore, articles with negative frame of immigration-crime {{are more likely to}} be put on the front page, regardless of contextual characteristics.

5000|$|Journalist H. L. Mencken, {{writing in}} 1925, {{believed}} the opposite to be true: Five years of Prohibition have had, at least, this one benign effect: they have completely disposed {{of all the}} favorite arguments of the Prohibitionists. None of the great boons and usufructs that were to follow {{the passage of the}} Eighteenth Amendment has come to pass. There is not less drunkenness in the Republic, but more. There is not <b>less</b> <b>crime,</b> but <b>more.</b> There is not less insanity, but more. The cost of government is not smaller, but vastly greater. Respect for law has not increased, but diminished. Some supporters of Prohibition, such as Rev. Charles Stelzle who wrote Why Prohibition! (1918), believed that prohibition would eventually lead to reductions in taxes, since drinking [...] "produced half the business" [...] for institutions supported by tax dollars such as courts, jails, hospitals, almshouses, and insane asylums. In fact, alcohol consumption and the incidence of alcohol-related domestic violence were decreasing before the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted. Following the imposition of Prohibition, reformers [...] "were dismayed to find that child neglect and violence against children actually increased during the Prohibition era." ...|$|R
40|$|Do <b>more</b> guns cause <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> or <b>more</b> <b>crime?</b> Some authors {{argue that}} the spread of {{firearms}} encourage violent solutions to interpersonal conflicts. Other authors, however, suggest that the defensive use of gun decreases economic crime. In this paper we proposed an identification strategy to estimate the effect of guns on violent crimes and on property crime. The strategy {{was based on the}} use of instrumental variables that allowed us to explore the temporal and cross-section variation of the crimes and prevalence of guns in cities. The instrument was developed based on the Statute of Disarmament (ED) - a national law passed in December 2003. The identification hypothesis is that the impact of ED on the demand for weapons would be greater as higher the prevalence of weapons previous the occurrence of the Law. We presented evidence that the policy of disarmament, operated in the state of S 3 o Paulo between 2001 and 2007, was one of the relevant factors that led to the decrease in violent crime, particularly homicides (average elasticity around 2. 0). On the other hand, we found no evidence of any effect on other crimes with economic motivation as larceny, vehicle theft, and trafficking of illicit drugs, suggesting the irrelevance of the potential effect of deterring crime by the armed victim...|$|R

Three areas are identified: "focal" beats, within which the CCTV cameras were installed; "displacement" beats, which were continuous to the focal beats; and "other " beats, comprising the remainder in the police division. With regard to both overall recorded crime and separate types of offences, the research finds significant decreases in the focal area, no spatial displacement, and some diffusion of benefit to the displacement area. There was some dilution of impact over time. There was no evidence that the proportional effect of CCTV changes by time of day, according to periods when surveillance with cameras would be <b>more</b> or <b>less</b> difficult. <b>Crime</b> fell <b>more</b> steeply as the first cameras were installed, with diminishing increases in effect as more were put in place.

50|$|The {{impact of}} {{foreclosure}} goes beyond just homeowners but also expands to towns and neighborhoods as a whole. Cities with high foreclosure rates often experience <b>more</b> <b>crime</b> and <b>thefts</b> with abandoned houses being broken into, garbage collecting on lawns, {{and an increase}} in prostitution. Foreclosures also impact neighboring housing sales on two levels—space and time. For any given time frame, foreclosures have a greater negative impact when they are closer to the property attempting to be sold. The conventional view suggested is that the increase in foreclosures will cause declines in the sales value of neighboring properties, which, in turn, will lead to an extension of the housing crisis. Another significant impact from increased foreclosure rates is on school mobility of children. In general, research suggests that switching schools is damaging for children, although this does significantly depend {{on the quality of the}} origin and destination schools. A study done in New York City revealed that students who changed schools most often entered a school with lower, on average, test scores and overall school performance. The effect of these moves on academic performance for individual students requires further research. Foreclosures also have an emotional and physical effect on people. In one particular study of 250 recruited participants who had experienced foreclosure, 36.7% met screening criteria for major depression.|$|R

40|$|Raising the {{sanction}} {{will always}} reduce {{the utility of}} the criminal. However, raising the sanction will not always lead to <b>less</b> <b>crime,</b> and may lead to <b>more</b> <b>crime.</b> If a criminal has the opportunity to commit multiple criminal acts and has fixed and variable costs of committing these acts, then an increase in the criminal sanction, over a certain range of sanctions, may actually lead the criminal to commit <b>more</b> <b>crime.</b> The reason is that as the sanction is increased, the criminal may increase his expenditures on fixed costs, which may decrease his variable costs of committing a criminal act. Once the criminal pays his fixed costs, they will be sunk costs, and thus they will no longer enter into the criminal's decision process of committing criminal acts. But the variable cost of crime will enter into the criminal's decision process. If raising the sanction leads to decreasing variable costs of crime then raising the sanction may actually lead to <b>more</b> <b>crime.</b> The example of the criminal's decision to purchase a radar detector and to speed is used to illustrate the point.

40|$|Key Points 	Social {{services}} help New Zealanders to live healthy, {{safe and}} fulfilling lives. They {{provide access to}} health services and education opportunities, and protect and supp ort the most vulnerable. The quality of these services and access to them are crucial to the ongoing wellbeing of New Zealanders. 	The government funds social services {{with the aim of}} improving outcomes that people value, such as better health, <b>less</b> <b>crime,</b> and <b>more</b> and better jobs. 	Social services are only one influence among many that determine outcomes. Other important influences include family, friends and community, work and colleagues, early physical and social experiences, and economic deprivation. 	This inquiry is about finding ways to improve individual and social wellbeing through more effective social services. The inquiry has examined (among other things) : -the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches to commissioning and purchasing social services; -the lessons learnt from recent initiatives and new approaches, in New Zealand and overseas; -how social services can best target and help those with high needs and at high risk of poor outcomes; -how to improve outcomes through better coordination of services, within and between government agencies and service providers; - how to take advantage of emerging opportunities offered by existing and new datasets, new information technologies and data analytics to learn about the effectiveness of different ser vices for different groups, and to spread this learning; and - the institutional arrangements that would support smarter commissioning, purchasing and contracting of social services. 	The Commission has been impressed with the hard work, perceptive thinking a nd commitment of the many people and organisations, outside and within government, who help deliver social services to those in need. 	  	The role of this inquiry is not to critique the performance of government agencies and service providers. Rather, its role is to make recommendations that will improve the system. 	  	 In developing its draft findings and recommendations the Commission has drawn evidence from many sources, including research papers and extensive consultation. It received 134 submissions on its is sues paper and has held more than 100 face-to-face meetings. 	  	The Commission has made 81 draft findings and 47 draft recommendations, and posed 8 questions. Recommendations range from modest ways to improve commissioning and contracting to bold suggestions for changes to roles and responsibilities.

40|$|Estimating {{the extent}} of {{environmental}} crime in Florida, or in the three counties of Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, is difficult with the present system of record-keeping. Nevertheless, arrest, citation, and warning records from the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission document {{a rise in the}} number of environmental violations occurring throughout the state from 1988 through 1992. Arrest records from the state law enforcement agency, FDLE, indicate 1, 936 environmental crimes arrests were made throughout Florida during 1993, including 618 in Dade, 103 in Broward, and 79 in Palm Beach. A four-year incident total combining the records ofFDLE and the Game Commission reveals 7, 894 documented cases of environmental violations. These data indicate environmental crime is a serious problem. The three above counties have designated professionals to respond to and investigate environmental crimes; however, none were able to estimate environmental crime within their respective jurisdictions, better than the available, and relatively poor, FGFWFC and FDLE data. Data provided by the State Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s Offices in the three local counties indicate varying levels of environmental criminal activity, although little historical information is available and records are just now beginning to be collected and saved for future trend analysis. The philosophy and approach taken by an agency in handling environmental crime helps to explain the FDLE, FGFWFC, and three State Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s Offices 2 ̆ 7 data. A county reporting fewer arrests does not necessarily have <b>less</b> <b>crime</b> or <b>more</b> poorly trained officers. In Palm Beach County, fewer arrests may be the result of a proactive approach toward educating the offender and preventing violation recurrences. A lack of communication among the various counties was identified as one area to be improved on. Although attempts have been made to facilitate networking between and among the counties, and between the agencies involved in environmental issues, separate agendas still prevail and hamper the overall effectiveness of efforts to handle environmental crime. The true extent of environmental crime across the state and within the three local counties remains unknown. The results of this study, although an underestimation, indicate levels of environmental criminal activity which should raise concerns. It must also be realized that the cumulative effects of such violations pose a great threat to the welfare of the environment. In the case of environmental crime, the whole may be a great deal more than the sum of its parts...|$|R
