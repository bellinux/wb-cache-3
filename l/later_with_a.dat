5|$|There are {{at least}} four known snowscapes by Renoir: Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne (1868); Winter Landscape (1868); Snowy Landscape (1870–75); and another work also titled Snowy Landscape (1875). Along with Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne, Renoir {{would return to the}} imagery of the Bois de Boulogne years <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large {{painting}} called The Morning Ride (1873), alternatively titled Madame Henriette Darras, which was rejected by the Salon in that year.|$|E

5|$|After a {{good run}} of form with Tottenham {{and being the}} third top goal scorer in the Premier League just behind Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero with 16 goals on 19 March 2015, Kane was named by manager Roy Hodgson in the England squad to face Lithuania in a UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} match and Italy in a friendly. He made his international debut at Wembley Stadium, replacing Wayne Rooney {{in the second half}} of the match against Lithuania, and scoring just 80 seconds <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> header from a Raheem Sterling cross. On 30 March 2015, the day before the Italy match, Hodgson announced that Kane would start alongside Rooney, and he played the full 90 minutes of the 1–1 draw at Juventus Stadium.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} safety Sean Foudy {{left the}} Rough Riders {{as a free}} agent, Allen competed with Hency Charles and Ken Walcott in training camp for the starting role. Allen emerged as the starter in July, but he was sidelined a month <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knee injury. While Allen returned quickly from the injury, he was replaced by Walcott as starter and {{was moved to the}} reserve list for a short time. He was reactivated after Walcott was injured with turf toe, but Remi Trudel was started at safety in place of Allen.|$|E
5|$|Although Michigan {{was able}} to score first, it was Michigan State that {{dictated}} {{the pace of the}} game. After Michigan's 34-yard field goal, the only scoring in the first quarter, Michigan State responded with a 61-yard rushing touchdown by Edwin Baker, which were the first points of the second quarter. Michigan took the lead a few minutes <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 12-yard touchdown reception by Martell Webb, but the Spartans responded with a 41-yard rushing touchdown by Le'Veon Bell, and later added to their lead with a 38-yard field goal by Dan Conroy just before halftime. State built on their lead in the third quarter with 2 touchdowns: first a 41-yard reception by Mark Dell, then an 8-yard run by Larry Caper. Michigan's only points of the second half came on a 4-yard rushing touchdown by Denard Robinson. Michigan State sealed their win with a 28-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, Müller {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Bayern Munich through 2013. During {{the second half of}} the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter, usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04, and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career, in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern. The title was confirmed a week <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 win at Hertha BSC, a match which Müller started.|$|E
5|$|Michigan scored {{first when}} Cameron Gordon {{picked up a}} Purdue fumble and ran it back 58 yards for a touchdown, their first {{defensive}} points of the season. They added to their lead a few minutes <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 9-yard touchdown pass to Roy Roundtree. Purdue scored their first points {{late in the first}} quarter with a 20-yard field goal by Carson Wiggs, and then added more points in the second quarter when Ricardo Allen intercepted a Denard Robinson pass and ran it back 94 yards for a touchdown. They then came within a point of a tie a few minutes later by kicking a 46-yard field goal, but would not come any closer. Early in the third quarter, Michigan's Vincent Smith ran in a 19-yard touchdown, but the extra point failed. Purdue's only score of the second half was a 40-yard field goal that came in the third quarter. Michigan sealed their win late in the fourth quarter with a 3-yard touchdown run by Stephen Hopkins.|$|E

5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} {{at home and}} then at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for a woman at the time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second, a slim volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit and contribute to the annual editions of Oxford Poetry, which she did for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character. The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{had won a}} {{significant}} victory, but now had 23 wounded and was very low on ammunition. Frazier landed on the newly captured airstrip in his Piper Cub at 12:30. He rejected the airstrip as unsuitable for Dakotas, and oversaw the preparation of a new airstrip on better ground near Mission Hill. This was still a difficult approach, as aircraft had to land upwind while avoiding Mission Hill. Although it was not known if the airstrip would be ready, Hutchison flew in for a test landing there the next day, 21 September, at 15:30. He collected the wounded and flew them to Nadzab, and returned an hour <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> load of rations and ammunition. He also brought with him Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, {{the commander of the}} 21st Infantry Brigade, and his headquarters, who took charge of the area. Around 18:00, six more transports arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Aggies {{scored on}} their opening {{possession}} with a 35-yard touchdown with a screen pass from Stephen McGee to Mike Goodson. The Longhorns mustered twofirst downs, but {{were forced to}} punt. Texas A ended their subsequent drive three plays <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> punt of their own. The Longhorns again successfully penetrated into Texas A territory, but Mack Brown opted to call a pooch punt by Colt McCoy on fourthdown and four from the Aggie 37-yard line. The Aggies answered with an eighteen-play drive that stalled on the UT-14 yardline and the Aggies {{had to settle for}} a 31-yard field goal by Matt Szymanski.|$|E

Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to his door, to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40. Migg comes back <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew Charles Bukowski, whom Tom as an aspiring author idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink.|$|E
5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week <b>later,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E

5|$|William's grave is {{currently}} {{marked by a}} marble slab with a Latin inscription dating from the early 19th century.

The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time, but in 1562, during the French Wars of Religion, the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost, {{with the exception of one}} thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years <b>later</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the French Revolution, but was eventually replaced with the current marker.|$|E
