5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury.

With its low cost of <b>living,</b> <b>the</b> city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E
5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name.

Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks.|$|E

40|$|In {{late medieval}} English society the dead {{remained}} amongst <b>the</b> <b>living</b> through <b>the</b> Church’s all pervasive intercessory practices (memorial, commemorative, and liturgical services) to send succour to souls in Purgatory. In 1576 the Church of England officially dismissed {{the doctrine of}} Purgatory as an invented fiction and all intercessory services were abandoned effectively separating <b>the</b> <b>living</b> from <b>the</b> dead. Such cultural and religious changes were traumatic for many and even those who welcomed the reformed religion had {{to find new ways}} to remember the dead. My dissertation looks at four of Shakespeare’s great works (the Henry VI plays, Hamlet, Titus Andronicus, and Macbeth) and examines the ways in which, through performance, these plays create a space inhabited by <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and <b>the</b> dead which simultaneously evokes traditional dealings with the dead and mourning for those traditions thus allowing a re-imagining of relationships between <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and <b>the</b> dead...|$|R

5|$|Antankarana culture shares many common {{points with}} that of their Sakalava neighbors. Their rituals are similar and honor {{many of the same}} ancestors, and members of both groups adhere to many of the same fady, making it {{difficult}} at times to distinguish the two groups from one another. Relations between the two are amicable. In a custom unique to the Antankarana, called the tsangatsaine, two trees growing before the house of a noble family are tied together to symbolize the unity of the community. and the merger of past with present and the dead with the <b>living.</b> <b>The</b> Antankarana, like many other coastal groups, practice tromba (spirit possession) as a means to commune with ancestors. The royal ancestral spirits that possess tromba mediums are almost always of Sakalava ancestry. It is widely believed that the spirits of the dead often inhabit crocodiles, and it is often fady among the Antankarana to kill these animals. The Antankarana also believe in tsiny, a kind of nature spirit.|$|E
