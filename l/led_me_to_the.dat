500|$|The Last Exit {{was also}} notable {{as a popular}} {{destination}} for Seattle's amateur and professional Go and chess players including Peter Biyiasas, Viktors Pupols, and Yasser Seirawan, who wrote of the venue, [...] "Those first chess lessons soon <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legendary Last Exit on Brooklyn coffee house, a chess haven where an unlikely bunch of unusual people congregates to do battle." [...] Interviewed by Sports Illustrated in 1981, Seirawan described the Last Exit as [...] "Scrabble players, backgammon players, chess and game hustling... This became my home. This was to become my family." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{decisions}} to interpret § 8 construed {{it not to}} apply to the crimes charged. In United States v. Bevans (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to a murder committed on a navy vessel within state waters. In United States v. Palmer (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to piracy by U.S. citizen defendants, in the employ of a South American government at war with Spain, committed against Spanish ships and citizens. President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer. He wrote in his diary that the Court had [...] "cast away the jurisdiction which a law of congress had given, that its [...] "reasoning [...] a sample of judicial logic—disingenuous, false, and hollow," [...] and that it gave him [...] "an early disgust for the practice of law, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unalterable determination never to accept judicial office." ...|$|E

I was struggling so hard {{to figure out what it}} was that I was supposed to be doing. I kept thinking I’m supposed to be doing something creative. I can’t believe I have such a knack for the vernacular and I don’t have anywhere to apply it." [...] “I felt I had not found my true path. And then a series of events occurred that <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where I didn’t have anything to lose if I wrote a screenplay." [...] She began writing sitcoms with a comedian friend but was plagued by second thoughts about her work. Khouri was frustrated and kept [...] "contemplating and meditating" [...] until she got this idea of [...] "two women going on a crime spree." [...] She felt as if a light bulb had gone on over her head, making her more interested in the idea.|$|E

60|$|He paused, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farther {{end of the}} yard, for {{the workmen}} had begun to arrive and <b>to</b> cluster round <b>the</b> dipping trough.|$|R
60|$|We got up, and he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{verandah}} which surrounded his house. We paused <b>to</b> look at <b>the</b> gay {{flowers that}} rioted in his garden.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. She did. I shouldn't {{like you}} to have <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> answer.|$|E
60|$|Fortune had favored me at last. My lucky star had <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mistress}} of the house.|$|E
60|$|So {{they took}} me and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal house, and pushed me through {{the doorway of the}} great hut.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{head of the}} stair. [...] "This {{unexpected}} occurrence," [...] he said, [...] "has caused us {{rather to}} lose sight of the original purpose of our journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{what you said}} to our Dame Margery--Mannerly Margery, as I call her--heard as much, at least, as <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> guess <b>the</b> rest, for I have got an eye in my head, I promise you." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> resistlessly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seat, {{away from}} {{the noise of the}} regimental band and the dancers, and then sat himself down at the far end from me, like a great surly bear that he was.|$|R
60|$|And so he kindly <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, {{and holding}} a wax-candle, lighted me up the one flight of stairs.|$|E
60|$|She <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cliff, and up it {{to perhaps}} twice {{the height of}} a man, then round a {{projecting}} rock.|$|E
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door and}} pointed to the high grey wall which towered up amongst the debris of the {{shattered}} houses.|$|E
60|$|The {{thought of}} a plank <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> floor, and, going over it carefully, I soon came to a short board, one end of which was loose. Raising it, I pulled with all my might, and the board came up.|$|R
60|$|As the {{afternoon}} was waning I retraced my steps and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranch. The driver boy, whom I had heard called Dick, {{was looking for}} me, evidently at Miss Sampson's order, and he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, fair nephew," [...] said Charles of Sicily, [...] "be {{content with}} your old uncle, {{and come to}} my apartments, where I will set before you the necessities that have <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{conclude}} <b>the</b> truce that is baffling your eager desire of deeds of arms." ...|$|R
60|$|And issuing {{from behind}} the counter, and taking me by the arm like an old acquaintance, he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bar of the hotel.|$|E
60|$|The servant <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room {{which the}} Countess had just left. I entered it, {{and found myself}} {{face to face with}} the Count.|$|E
60|$|When the Scripture Class {{had broken}} up for the day, duty ought to have taken me home. Curiosity led me astray--I mean, <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stationer's window.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't do it," [...] he said, {{checking}} himself. [...] "This tunnel {{may have}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other mine, {{and if the}} people ahead {{are some of the}} night shift they'll be likely to have considerable sport at my expense." ...|$|R
50|$|The signs, whether {{free-standing}} or attached <b>to</b> walls, reminded <b>me</b> of inscriptions, {{and this}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think about <b>the</b> inscriptional origins of Roman caps and the everlasting problem of reconciling capitals with lowercase. For me, {{the moment when}} the first true synthesis occurred was in the type of De Aetna. This <b>led</b> <b>me</b> in turn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beinecke Library <b>to</b> pore over their copy of the book and its type—the archetype of Roman type for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rather {{taken aback}} by the success of my experiment," [...] {{interposed}} Lydia. [...] "I invited you purposely to meet one another. The resemblance between you <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> suspect <b>the</b> truth, and my suspicion was confirmed by the account Mr. Byron gave me of his adventures." ...|$|R
60|$|He spoke no more; but, having {{lifted up}} his hands in prayer, <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre of the Holy, and with a swift motion put out the lamp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you talk}} like a wise man," [...] she laughed; then, holding my hand, she <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree {{and sat down}} by my side on the poncho.|$|E
60|$|She took my hand, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sofa. We sat down, side by side. Her {{face was}} {{composed}} to a sad tranquillity. She was quiet; she was herself again.|$|E
60|$|That trail <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hunter's cabin, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> miner's shack {{on whose}} {{rough-hewn}} walls the fire-light flickered {{in a kind}} of silent music. It set me once again in the atmosphere of daring and filled me with the spirit of pioneer adventure.|$|R
6000|$|Then he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guard's bed, {{on which}} I sat myself down, being strangely {{interested}} in this play. He drew the curtain in front of me, and I heard him return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre {{of the room and}} clap his hands. Someone entered, saying, ...|$|R
60|$|My {{suggestion}} was acted on {{the moment we}} returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. Miss Halcombe <b>led</b> <b>me</b> round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> servants' offices, and we found {{the girl in the}} dairy, with her sleeves tucked up to her shoulders, cleaning a large milk-pan and singing blithely over her work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is thou, Charmion!" [...] I said. [...] "What ails thee? Art thou cramped with {{standing}} {{so long in}} thy hiding-place? Why didst not thou slip hence when Cleopatra <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> balcony?" ...|$|E
60|$|Theresa. No, no! I {{will not}} betray. Oh, husband, spare me! Let not {{the hand that}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> altar be stained with blood I would so gladly shed for thee. I cannot answer thee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} you, if you like, point by point {{along the line}} of {{reasoning}} which I followed myself, and which will inevitably lead you, as it <b>led</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> only possible solution of the mystery.|$|E
60|$|Then I recollected where I was, {{and struck}} the man between the eyes, {{partially}} stunning him. He {{stepped down from}} the platform at once, and, cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet, <b>led</b> <b>me</b> round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> burrow which he had indicated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Illustrious Highness! I did {{not trust}} my old limbs in so hard a strife without hopes of a reward. But it was not gold, nor any vanity to be seen among my equals with that {{glittering}} jewel, that <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> scorn of the gondoliers, and the displeasure of the great." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. As I lay {{asleep in}} Italy There came {{a voice from}} over the Sea, And with great power it forth <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>To</b> walk in <b>the</b> visions of Poesy.|$|R
