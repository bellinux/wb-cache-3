40|$|We {{describe}} reversals of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) {{with the}} phase of a voluntary cyclic whole-body sway movement. Subjects (n = 9) held a standard load in extended arms and released it by a bilateral shoulder abduction motion in a self-paced manner at different phases of the sway. The <b>load</b> <b>release</b> task was also performed during quiet stance in three positions: {{in the middle of}} the sway range and close to its extreme forward and backward positions. Larger APAs were seen during the sway task as compared to quiet stance. Although the direction of postural perturbation associated with the <b>load</b> <b>release</b> was always the same, the direction of the APAs in the leg muscles reversed when the subjects were close to the extreme forward position as compared to the APAs in other phases and during quiet stance. The trunk muscles showed smaller APA modulation at the extreme positions but larger modulation when passing through the middle position, depending on the direction of sway, forward or backward. The phenomenon of APA reversals emphasizes the important role of safety in the generation of postural adjustments associated with voluntary movements. Based on these findings, APAs could be defined as changes in the activity of postural muscles associated with a predictable perturbation that act to provide maximal safety of the postural task component...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The thermal {{response}} of skin to pressure alone and to pressure with shear was compared under cyclic loading con-ditions. Stresses {{were applied to}} the anterior aspect of the leg of three healthy subjects for time intervals up to 10 min, and the difference in temperature between the stressed site and a con-tralateral control site was assessed after <b>load</b> <b>release.</b> The ther-mal recovery time (TRT), the time interval between <b>load</b> <b>release</b> and either a maximum or a stabilization in the temper-ature difference vs. time record was determined. Results demonstrated that for a resultant stress of 142. 9 kPa, TRTs were longer for combined pressure and shear than for pressure alone. For Subjects A, B, and C, TRT increases were 1. 5 min, 5. 5 min, and 2. 0 min respectively. For a resultant stress magnitude of 71. 4 kPa, increases were 1. 5 min, 3. 5 min, and- 0. 5 min respectively. Comparing responses for different resultant stress magnitudes for pressure-only application, TRTs were 1. 5 min, 1. 5 min, and 5. 5 min longer for the 142. 9 -kPa condition than for the 71. 4 -kPa condition for Subjects A, B, and C.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of sediment <b>loads</b> <b>released</b> by sewer overflow discharges {{are important for}} being able to provide protection to vulnerable receiving waters. These predictions are sensitive to the estimated sediment characteristics and on the site conditions of in-pipe deposit formation. Their application without a detailed analysis and understanding of the initial conditions under which in-sewer deposits were formed normally results in very poor estimations. In this study, in-sewer sediment samples deposited during dry periods in a combined sewer system were collected, and their properties assessed. Parameters in a sediment transport relationship for in-pipe deposits were estimated by simulating the in-pipe deposit formation conditions in laboratory erosion tests. The measured parameters were then used to simulate sediment transport through a small combined sewer network for a number of rain events for which rainfall, hydraulic, and water quality data were available.

40|$|UnrestrictedRecent {{research}} suggests that chronic low back pain {{may be due to}} altered neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the morphology, fatigability, and activation of the lumbar multifidus in healthy persons and persons with chronic low back pain. To accomplish this objective, three studies were undertaken.; The purpose of study # 1 was to determine whether persons with chronic unilateral low back pain have diminished multifidus muscle volume. Volume was diminished by 18. 1 % only at L 5 -S 1 region with no differences between the painful and nonpainful sides. The results indicate considerable localized, bilateral multifidus atrophy in persons with chronic unilateral low back pain despite low disability and similar activity levels to the matched control subjects.; The purpose of study # 2 was to determine whether the lumbar extensors, particularly the deep fibers of multifidus, are more fatigable in persons with chronic low back pain. Normalized median frequency slopes were not different between groups or muscles. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the deep fibers of multifidus are more fatigable in persons with chronic low back pain.; The purpose of study # 3 was to determine whether the activation of the lumbar extensors was delayed in persons with chronic low back pain and whether the delay was greatest in the deep fibers of multifidus. EMG recordings of the lumbar extensors were conducted during a sudden <b>load</b> <b>release</b> perturbation to the trunk. The activation of the extensors following the <b>load</b> <b>release</b> was not significantly different between groups. Feedforward activation of the deep multifidus among subjects with chronic low back pain was found in fewer subjects and fewer trials. There were no group differences in feedforward activation of the superficial multifidus.; A common finding across studies # 1 and # 3 was evidence of selective impairment of the deep fibers of multifidus. This finding was not supported by study # 2. Since the lumbar extensors are a highly redundant system, load sharing by the other lumbar extensors could explain the lack of differences in fatigability. Alternatively, retained activity level, despite chronic low back pain, preserved the lumbar extensors from physiological fatigability. The findings from studies # 1 and # 3 suggest that muscle impairment in persons with chronic low back pain may be predominately in the deep fibers of multifidus...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} of the hardness technique and its application to polymer systems is presented. The method {{is based on the}} local deformation produced on a material surface by an indenter upon application of a given load. Conventional methods based on the optical measure of the residual impression left behind upon <b>load</b> <b>release</b> represent a rather simple technique for a rapid evaluation of the surface mechanical properties. In the past two decades, depth-sensing indentation devices based on the monitoring of the load and displacement throughout an indentation have progressively substituted traditional testers. Smaller loads can be applied capable of producing penetration depths in the nanoscale. Indentation hardness has nowadays gained widespread application in polymer science. Besides its aforementioned technical advantages, one has to add its extreme sensitivity to detect nanostructural changes occurring in polymer materials. Behind this ability is the intimate correlation between the mechanisms of local deformation and the polymer basic nanostructural entities. The present contribution intends to provide the reader a general overview {{of the state of the}} art of indentation hardness in relation to nanostructure and morphology in glassy and semicrystalline polymers including blends.

However, it is unclear whether this notion can be generalized to locomotor adaptation in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).

They were instructed to walk on a treadmill while light-, medium-, and heavy-resistance loads were applied to the right ankle to perturb leg swing. Each of the three resistance-load conditions were specific to the subject and determined by each subject's maximum voluntary contraction of the hip flexors. We observed that subjects tended to make larger errors when the resistance-load condition was greater. Following resistance <b>load</b> <b>release,</b> subjects showed an aftereffect consisting of an increase in stride length. Further, the aftereffect was retained longer in the medium-resistance load condition than in the heavy- and light-resistance load conditions.

40|$|International audienceLow {{back pain}} is a pain {{felt in the}} lumbar region of the spine. Among a large series of care strategies, lumbar belt {{might be used to}} treat this pathology. Several {{clinical}} trials have shown the efficiency of lumbar belts [1]. Despite the high quantity of affected patients each year (about 80 % of the French population have /will suffer back pain in their life), few authors investigated the mechanism of action of belts. It is usually reported that the main mechanical effect of a lumbar belt is the pressure applied on the trunk. This pressure on the abdominal skin and muscles induce an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, a decrease of intra-discal pressure, and a proprioceptive reaction of the posture. Unfortunately, the link between the textile characteristics, the belt design and the pressure applied on the trunk has been poorly studied. Recently, Bonnaire [2] proposed a clinical study using optical methods and pressure map sensors; Munoz [3] proposed a detailed finite element model, closely linked to medical imaging showing the <b>load</b> <b>release</b> in the intervertebral disc, but resorting to a clinical study is a tedious task, and some early stage information should be of great help when designing new belts.

A combination of X-ray and neutron scattering provided unprecedented insights into the local structure of these complexes. Lipopeptide-based complexes self-assembled into layered structures with large-scale fractal features, hosting DNA in the interstices. Bola-amphiphile scaffolds were characterized by planar structures with DNA strands presumably sandwiched in-between peptide nanotapes. Importantly, complexation {{did not affect the}} structural integrity of DNA in either of the two complexes. The bolaamphiphile conjugates displayed high levels of molecular ordering in contrast to the liquid-crystalline features observed in lipopeptide assemblies.

The physiological (rectal and tympanic temperatures, heart rate), psychophysical (thermal sensation and discomfort, perceived exertion) and thermal effects (thermal imaging) of the S 10 respirator were measured in four healthy males (31 ± 4. 5 yrs). Each subject completed two 45 min trials consisting of acclimation (10 min), treadmill walking (30 min) and rest (5 min) in a hot environment (30 °C dry bulb and 60 % relative humidity), while wearing the UK MK IV overgarment with the S 10 respirator (MASK) and without (CON). Generally, there was no additional thermal strain while wearing the S 10 respirator. However, subjects reported thermal discomfort of the face as being significantly (p< 0. 05) more uncomfortable after 30 mins of exercise compared to being unmasked. In conclusion, the mask partially inhibited evaporative cooling of the face giving the user the perception of being more heat stressed than when unmasked, which was not matched by the recorded physiological strain.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the texture, {{dislocation}} and lattice strain evolution under uniaxial tension. The in situ experiments were carried out using high-energy X-ray diffraction and a 20 kN universal tensile machine. The anisotropic mechanical behavior is revealed through the reflex-dependent lattice strain evolution of flat samples under uniaxial tension. The as-received material is a 29. 5 mm thick aluminum block with strong texture gradient along the block thickness. In the first experiment, two tensile samples from 7. 5 mm below the surface were prepared along the RD (rolling direction). The two samples have the deformation texture (copper type) with sharpness of 10 mrd (multiples of random distribution). One sample is used to study the texture evolution and the other sample is {{used to determine the}} lattice strain evolution and dislocation evolution during uniaxial tension. During the tensile test, the texture changes slightly due to the low amount of deformation from initial state to sample fracture. In contrast, significant changes in reflex-dependent lattice strains are observed. In the elastic region, the { 111 } lattice planes are the stiffest, as in theory, but the { 200 } lattice planes are not the most compliant ones due to the interaction with neighboring grains having other orientations. Moreover, the Young’s modulus of { 311 } lattice planes is less affected by the texture of 10 mrd. The work hardening during plastic deformation shows a clear dependence on the grain orientations, as shown by the reflex-dependent lattice strains. The essential difference of work hardening as a function of grain orientation is based on two types of dislocation arrangements, the so called [111] tension stress state and [100] tension stress states. <b>Load</b> <b>release</b> first starts on the { 111 } and { 222 } lattice planes before macroscopic UTS (ultimate tensile strength). After UTS all lattice planes experience <b>load</b> <b>release.</b> The dislocation density evolution indicates that in the elastic region, dislocation density decreases as the tensile stress increases. From YS (yield strength), the increase of dislocation density causes the work hardening. Near UTS region, the dislocation density becomes constant. Further beyond UTS, some grain orientations show further work hardening while other grain orientations show softening. It leads to a slight increase in the dislocation density. In the fracture region, a significant increase of dislocation density is observed. It results from the reversal stress (compressive stress) which is formed outside the necking zone, caused by the return of elastic strain. In a second experiment the anisotropic behavior of AA 7020 -T 6 sample with maximum orientation density of 29. 7 mrd was investigated. For this purpose, three flat samples {{from the center of the}} Al-block were prepared, with the orientations of 0 ° to RD, 45 ° to RD and 90 ° to RD. The uniaxial tensile tests were carried out till UTS, which shows three stress-strain curves with different yield strengths, ultimate tensile strengths and elongations. The in situ experiments were performed in HEMS@PetraIII/DESY. Due to the low elastic anisotropy of aluminum, the yield strengths, which were determined from the reflex-dependent lattice strain evolution, show only small variation. The plastic anisotropy is much stronger, which can be observed from the lattice strain evolution of all the three samples. The tensile test of the 45 ° to RD sample shows lowest values of YS and UTS. The variation of lattice strain shows that differently oriented grains undergo different stresses. This effect is greatest in the 45 ° to RD sample. Overall, the 45 ° to RD sample shows the most specific characteristics, because less (111) and more (200) grain orientations are available...|$|E
40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{processing}} of structural lightweight components there exists an increasing demand {{for the application of}} magnesium base wrought alloys, which are highly textured due to the forming process. However, magnesium has a poor deformability at room temperature due to the hexagonal structure that limits its application considerably. Although the focus of recent research activities is on investigations of the texture evolution and the mechanical behaviour of magnesium base alloys during processing and in service, there still exists a lack of understanding of their mechanical-technological characteristics e. g. the knowledge about the deformability or the cyclic deformation behaviour with respect to the initial crystallographic texture.
