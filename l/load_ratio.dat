This is pertinent to the design of pultruded GFRP beams, which behave linear elastically and have inherently low flexural stiffness. Simply supported and clamped beams subjected to four symmetric, equally spaced groups of equal point loads are analysed and formulae for their maximum deflections and moments are presented. These are then converted to <b>load</b> <b>ratios</b> for equal deflection and strength limits. It is shown that <b>load</b> <b>ratios</b> similar to the target ratios are achievable and the corresponding <b>load</b> spacing <b>ratios</b> λ are given.

40|$|Nanoporous {{palladium}} with {{a specific}} surface area of 29. 12 m 2 g- 1 was created using highly loaded palladium hydride wires subjected to a fast electrical pulse of energy. The delivered energy of approximately 0. 5 J was insufficient to melt unloaded palladium wires, but in contrast, caused highly loaded palladium hydride wires to disintegrate. An element such as palladium, which was studied in these experiments, {{has the capacity to}} store hydrogen and deuterium to extremely high concentrations. Additionally, electrical explosion experiments of palladium hydride wires were performed on single samples at the <b>loading</b> <b>ratios</b> ranging from 0. 5 up to 0. 96, approaching the highest experimentally achieved <b>loading</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. It was found that nanoporous palladium was created by the pulsing of palladium hydride wires at <b>loading</b> <b>ratios</b> higher than the threshold of 0. 6.

50|$|Larger {{models with}} two front discs use a dual CBS System. The system was first {{installed}} in a Honda CBR1000F in 1993. Here, applied brake pressure at the front is also applied to the rear wheel and vice versa. If the front lever is applied, pressure is built up at 4 of the 6 pots in the 2 calipers at the front. A secondary master cylinder at the front wheel distributes remaining pressure to the rear wheel through a proportional control valve and acts on 2 of the 3 calipers.

5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} {{of nearly all}} engineering structures are threatened {{by the presence of}} cracks. Structural failure occurs if a crack larger than a critical size exists. Although most well designed structures initially contain no critical cracks, subcritical cracks can grow to failure under fatigue loading, called fatigue crack growth (FCG). Because it is impossible or impractical to prevent subcritical crack growth in most applications, a damage tolerant design philosophy was developed for crack sensitive structures. Design engineers have taken advantage of the FCG threshold concept to design for long fatigue lives. FCG threshold (DK th) is a value of DK (crack-tip loading), below which no significant FCG occurs. Cracks are tolerated if DK is less than DK th. However, FCG threshold is not constant. Many variables influence DK th including microstructure, environment, and <b>load</b> <b>ratio.</b> The current research focuses on <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects on DK th and threshold FCG. Two categories of <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects are studied here: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects operate in the crack wake and include fatigue crack closure mechanisms. Intrinsic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects operate in the crack-tip process zone and include microcracking and void production. To {{gain a better understanding of}} threshold FCG <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> effects (1) a fatigue crack closure model is developed to consider the most likely closure mechanisms at threshold, simultaneously, and (2) intrinsic <b>load</b> <b>ratio</b> mechanisms are identified and modeled.
