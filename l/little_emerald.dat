Gwendolen had said to herself that she would never wear those diamonds: they had horrible words clinging and crawling about them, as from some bad dream, whose images lingered on the perturbed sense. She came down dressed in her white, with only a streak of gold and a pendant of emeralds, which Grandcourt had given her, round her neck, and the <b>little</b> <b>emerald</b> stars in her ears.|$|E
6000|$|In {{regard to}} colour hardly {{anything}} need here be said; {{for every one}} knows how splendid are the tints of birds, and how harmoniously they are combined. The colours are often metallic and iridescent. Circular spots are sometimes surrounded {{by one or more}} differently shaded zones, and are thus converted into ocelli. Nor need much be said on the wonderful differences between the sexes, or of the extreme beauty of the males of many birds. The common peacock offers a striking instance. Female Birds of Paradise are obscurely coloured and destitute of all ornaments, whilst the males are probably the most highly decorated of all birds, and in so many ways, that they must be seen to be appreciated. The elongated and golden-orange plumes which spring from beneath the wings of the Paradisea apoda (see fig. 47 of P. rubra, a much less beautiful species), when vertically erected and made to vibrate, are described as forming a sort of halo, in the centre of which the head “looks like a <b>little</b> <b>emerald</b> sun with its rays formed by the two plumes.”[126] In another most beautiful species the head is bald, “and of a rich cobalt blue, crossed by several lines of black velvety feathers.”[127] ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{without more}} ado he filled the basin and {{throwing}} off his tattered robe began to wash {{himself to the}} waist, round which he wore another garment, of dirty cotton I thought, which looked like a woman's petticoat. Watching him I noted two things, that his poor body was as scratched and scarred as though by old thorn wounds, as were his face and hands, also marked with great bruises as though from kicks and blows, and secondly that hung about his neck was a wondrous golden image about four inches in length. It was of rude workmanship with knees bent up under the chin, but the face, in which <b>little</b> <b>emeralds</b> were set for eyes, was of a great and solemn dignity.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn emerald deposit at Byrud, in {{southern}} Norway, yielded significant quantities of crystals and gem rough {{in the late}} 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Complex multiphase inclusions in the emeralds consist of water, gaseous methane, halite, sylvite, calcite, and a sulfide assemblage (pyrrhotite, galena, and sphalerite). This sulfide assemblage {{makes it easy to}} distinguish Byrud emeralds from those from other localities with a binocular microscope. The chemical composition of Byrud emeralds is also characteristic: They are colored mostly by vanadium (up to 1 wt. % V 2 O 3), and contain low sodium and magnesium (0. 1 wt. % oxide or less). Moreover, the relative amounts of iron, magnesium, chromium, rubidium, and cesium appear to be diagnostic. Infrared absorption spectra show that they contain <b>little</b> water. <b>Emeralds</b> from the Byrud deposit are still occasionally recovered by hobbyist collectors from the mine dumps...|$|R

60|$|Felicity, and Cecily, Dan, Felix, Sara Ray and I {{were sitting}} one evening on the mossy stones in Uncle Roger's hill pasture, {{where we had}} sat the morning the Story Girl told us {{the tale of the}} Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess. But it was evening now and the valley beneath us was brimmed up with the glow of the afterlight. Behind us, two tall, shapely spruce trees rose up against the sunset, and through the dark oriel of their sundered {{branches}} an evening star looked down. We sat on a <b>little</b> strip of <b>emerald</b> grassland and before us was a sloping meadow all white with daisies.|$|R
60|$|The soil, too--let others pen-and-ink the sea, the air, (as I {{sometimes}} try)--but now I feel {{to choose}} the common soil for theme--naught else. The brown soil here, (just between winter-close and opening spring and vegetation)--the rain-shower at night, and the fresh smell next morning--the red worms wriggling out of the ground--the dead leaves, the incipient grass, and the latent life underneath--the effort to start something--already in shelter'd spots some <b>little</b> flowers--the distant <b>emerald</b> show of winter wheat and the rye-fields--the yet naked trees, with clear insterstices, giving prospects hidden in summer--the tough fallow and the plow-team, and the stout boy whistling to his horses for encouragement--and there the dark fat earth in long slanting stripes upturn'd.|$|R

2500|$|Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat {{gave the}} film a mixed review, stating: [...] "It's a {{reasonably}} entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't {{shy away from}} depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a <b>little</b> short. And <b>emeralds</b> are prettier anyway." [...] Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: [...] "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary." [...] Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film [...] "C", he stated: [...] "Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an [...] "important" [...] film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, stating that [...] "director Edward Zwick {{tried to make a}} great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one." ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{research}} {{presented here}} attempts {{to identify and}} analyse the reported selection criteria used in the appointment of Australian vice-chancellors (VCs) and to contrast this with the selection criteria actually used. Design/methodology/approach - Contemporary research into the nature, role and purpose of section criteria in appointment processes has chiefly been conducted {{in the private sector}} and across various hierarchical levels. The research is based on a PhD entitled "The recruitment and selection of vice-chancellors for Australian universities". The research for the thesis had ethics approval and involved interviews with former and incumbent chancellors, VCs, consultants, representatives of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and selection panel members. Central to this research was the selection criteria and the skill bases selection criteria attempted to measure. A questionnaire was also sent to those listed above. Findings - The findings show that a matching of organisational antecedents with candidate attributes does occur. The research also highlights the key selection criteria used to appoint VCs. It also demonstrates how these key criteria are universally applied but in different orders depending upon the various foci of universities. Non-stated, but important, criteria and competencies are also discussed. Originality/value - No other research exists outlining the skill sets and competencies required by Australian VCs. It is hoped that this research will form the basis for further research and discovery into this field that we know so <b>little</b> about. © <b>Emerald</b> Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
6000|$|It {{had become}} quite dark, the lamps were lighted. We crossed {{the road to}} the Café Roma, and found a table on the {{pavement}} among the crowd. In a moment we had our tea. The evening was cold, with ice in the wind. But the crowd surged on, back and forth, back and forth, slowly. At the tables were seated mostly men, taking coffee or vermouth or aqua vitae, all familiar and easy, without the modern self-consciousness. There was a certain pleasant, natural robustness of spirit, and something of a feudal free-and-easiness. Then arrived a family, with children, and nurse in her native costume. They all sat at table together, perfectly easy with one another, though the marvellous nurse seemed to be seated below the salt. She was bright as a poppy, in a rose-scarlet dress of fine cloth, with a curious <b>little</b> waistcoat of <b>emerald</b> green and purple, and a bodice of soft, homespun linen with great full sleeves. On her head she had a rose-scarlet and white head-dress, and she wore great studs of gold filigree, and similar ear-rings. The feudal-bourgeois family drank its syrup-drinks and watched the crowd. Most remarkable is the complete absence of self-consciousness. They all have a perfect natural [...] "sang-froid," [...] the nurse in her marvellous native costume is as thoroughly at her ease as if she were in her own village street. She moves and speaks and calls to a passer-by without the slightest constraint, and much more, without the slightest presumption. She is below the invisible salt, the invisible but insuperable salt. And it strikes me the salt-barrier is a fine thing for both parties: they both remain natural and human on either side of it, instead of becoming devilish, scrambling and pushing at the barricade.|$|R
