The aims of this study are 1) evaluating the association of MRI features with clinical presentation and outcome of CES and 2) comparing lumbar spinal canal diameters of <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> patients with CES versus <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> patients without CES, operated because of sciatica. MRIs of CES patients were assessed for the following features: level of disc lesion, type (uni- or bilateral) and severity of caudal compression. Pre- and postoperative clinical features (micturition dysfunction, defecation dysfunction, altered sensation of the saddle area) were retrieved from the medical files. In addition, anteroposterior (AP) lumbar spinal canal diameters of CES patients were measured at MRI. AP diameters of <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> patients without CES, operated for sciatica, were measured for comparison. 48 CES patients were included. At MRI, bilateral compression was seen in 82 %; complete caudal compression in 29 %. MRI features were not associated with clinical presentation nor outcome. AP diameter was measured for 26 CES patients and for 31 <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> patients without CES, operated for sciatica. Comparison displayed a significant smaller AP diameter of the lumbar spinal canal in CES patients (largest p = 0. 002). Compared to average diameters in literature, diameters of CES patients were significantly more often below average than that of the sciatica patients (largest p = 0. 021). This is the first study demonstrating differences in lumbar spinal canal size between <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> patients with CES and <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> patients without CES, operated for sciatica.

On the other hand, in both good and poor cases, {{the tip of the}} nucleotome could not flex posteriorly because of strong resistance. In these cases, preoperative CTD showed disc protrusion with a narrow dye base. The findings following open discectomies of poor cases showed that the dye lacking area consisted of a relatively intact annulus fibrosus. A relatively intact annulus fibrosus may obstruct the flexion of the nucleotome, resulting in a poor outcome in such cases. 6 例の腰椎椎間板へルニアの症例に対して, CTガイドのもとで Nucleotome Flex II による経皮的椎間板摘出術を施行した. 優の成績が得られた症例においては, 術中のCT所見において, nucleotome の先端が椎間板の後方部分（へルニアに近い部分）に到達していた. これらの症例では術前のCT椎間板造影像において, 造影剤の充満されている部分の中で nucleotome が屈曲していた. 他方, 良と不可の症例においては, nucleotome は強い抵抗のため後方へ屈曲できなかった. これらの症例の術前のCT椎間板造影像では, Castro のいう narrow dye base とし、う所見であった. 不可の症例では, 引き続き open discectomy が行われたが, narrow dye base において認められた造影剤が入りこまない部分は比較的健常な線維輪であった. 比較的健常な線維輪が nucleotome の屈曲を妨げ, その結果としてヘルニアに近い椎間板の後方部分が切除されなかったため, 成績が不良となったと考えられた...|$|R

A 41 -year-old man was admitted with radiating pain and numbness in the left lower extremity with a left posterolateral disc extrusion at L 5 -S 1 level.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of lumbar spine pathologies made substantial progress {{at the turn}} of the twentieth century. The authors review the original publication of Otto Veraguth in 1929 reporting on the successful resection of a <b>herniated</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>disc,</b> published exclusively in the German language. His early report is put into the historical context, and its impact on the {{understanding of}} pathologies of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is estimated. The Swiss surgeon and Nobel Prize laureate Emil Theodor Kocher was among the first physicians to describe the traumatic rupture of the IVD in 1896. As early as 1909 Oppenheim and Krause published 2 case reports on surgery for a <b>herniated</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>disc.</b> Goldthwait was the first physician to delineate the etiopathogenes is between annulus rupture, symptoms of sciatica, and neurological signs in his publication of 1911. Further publications by Middleton and Teacher in 1911 and Schmorl in 1929 added to the understanding of lumbar spinal pathologies. In 1929, the Swiss neurologist Veraguth (surgery performed by Hans Brun) and the American neurosurgeon Walter Edward Dandy both published their early experiences with the surgical therapy of a <b>herniated</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>disc.</b> Veraguth's contribution, however, has not been appreciated internationally to date. The causal relationship between lumbar disc pathology and sciatica remained uncertain for some years to come. The causal relationship was not confirmed until Mixter and Barr's landmark paper in 1934 describing the association of sciatica and lumbar disc herniation, after which the surgical treatment became increasingly popular.

40|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) {{is a rare}} neurologic {{complication of}} <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> for which emergency surgical decompression should be undertaken. Despite the common belief that the restoration of functions that are affected by CES can take several years postoperatively, follow up seldom exceeds {{the first year after}} surgery. Long term outcome of especially micturition, defecation and sexual function-which are by definition affected in CES-are unknown. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate 1) postoperative long term outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function in CES patients 2) attitude of patients towards received hospital care with regard to (recovery of) these functions. CES patients were selected by screening the records of all patients operated on <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> in our university hospital between 1995 - 2010. A questionnaire was sent to the selected CES patients evaluating current complaints of micturition, defecation and sexual function and attitude towards delivered care with focus on micturition, defecation and sexual function. Thirty-seven of 66 eligible CES patients were included (response rate 71 %, inclusion rate 56 %). Median time after surgery was 13. 8 years (range 5. 8 - 21. 8 years). Dysfunction at follow up was highly prevalent: 38 % micturition dysfunction, 43 % defecation dysfunction and 54 % sexual dysfunction. Younger age at presentation was associated with sexual dysfunction at follow up: for every year younger at presentation, odds ratio for sexual dysfunction at follow up was 1. 11 (p = 0. 035). Other associations with outcome were not identified. Two-third of the CES patients wished their neurosurgeon had given them more prognostic information about micturition, defecation and sexual function. The presented data demonstrate that dysfunction of micturition, defecation and sexual function are still highly prevalent in a large number of CES patients even years postoperatively. These alarming follow up data probably have a devastating effect on personal perceived quality of life, which should be studied in more detail. CES patients communicate a clear demand for more prognostic information. The presented figures enable clinicians to inform their CES patients more realistically about long term postoperative outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function after surgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|A new {{decompression}} table system applying fifteen 60 second tractions of {{just over}} one half body weight in twenty one-half hour sessions was reported to give good or excellent relief of sciatic and back pain in 86 % of 14 patients with herniated discs and 75 % of patients with facet joint arthrosis. (Shealy, C. N.,Borgmeyer, V., AMJ. Pain Management 1997, 7 : 63 - 65). Herniated and degenerated discs can be shown at discography-discomanometry to have elevated intradiscal pressures made even worse by sitting and standing, thus preventing proper disc nutrition. Therefore decompressing the over pressurized disc should allow for healing and repair of disc prolapse, herniation and annulus tears. Serial MRI of 20 patients treated with the decompression table shows in our study up to 90 % reduction of subligamentous nucleus herniation in 10 of 14. Some rehydration occurs detected by T 2 and proton density signal increase. Torn annulus repair is seen in all. Transligamentous ruptures show lesser repair.

40|$|AbstractLumbar <b>herniated</b> <b>discs</b> {{commonly}} {{occur in}} patients 20 – 40  years of age, {{and result in}} acute symptoms of shooting and intractable pain in the low back and/or lower extremities. However, the prognosis of these patients {{is considered to be}} very good. Moreover, 70  % of these patients have been reported to be free from sciatica at approximately 6  months after the first onset. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have described the spontaneous resorption process of <b>herniated</b> <b>discs,</b> which is a major cause of the reduction of symptoms in patients. New advancements in MRI have recently been developed that have facilitated the examination of nerve tract fibers and identification of symptomatic nerve tissue. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the resorption process of a <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> has been determined. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF (tumor necrosis factor) -α, angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, and enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases are intricately related to each other. In our previous studies, matrix metalloproteinase- 7 (MMP- 7) has been shown to {{play a crucial role in}} the initiation of <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> resorption. Therefore, we developed recombinant human MMP- 7 for intradiscal therapy through an industry–university joint research program. We have already performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to confirm its efficacy; this therapy avoids the side effects associated with surgery, such as nerve tissue damage. Moreover, the phase 1 / 2 studies of recombinant human (rh) MMP- 7 are currently ongoing in the United States, and careful monitoring is required for these clinical trials. In conclusion, patients with <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>discs</b> may benefit from the development of a less invasive treatment for disc herniation, which can be applied even immediately after the onset of disease symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background MRI {{has proven}} to be an {{extremely}} valuable tool in the assessment of normal and pathological spinal anatomy. Accordingly, it is commonly used to assess containment of discal material by the outer fibers of the anulus fibrosus and posterior longitudinal ligaments. Determination of such containment is important to determine candidacy for intradiscal techniques and has prognostic significance. The accuracy of MRI in detecting containment has been insufficiently documented. Methods The MRI's of fifty consecutive patients undergoing open lumbar microdiscectomy were prospectively evaluated for disc containment by a neuroradiologist and senior spinal surgeon using criteria available in the literature and the classification of Macnab/McCulloch. An independent surgeon then performed the surgery and documented the actual containment status using the same methods. Statistical evaluation of accuracy was undertaken. Results MRI was found to be 72 % sensitive, 68 % specific, and 70 % accurate in detecting containment status of <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>discs.</b> Conclusion MRI may be inaccurate in assessing containment status of lumbar disc herniations in 30 % of cases. Given the importance of containment for patient selection for indirect discectomy techniques and intradiscal therapies, coupled with prognostic significance; other methods to assess containment should be employed to assess containment when such alternative interventions are being considered. </p...|$|R

Predefined factors that could possibly be a predictive factor were collected: gender, age at surgery, level of surgical pathology, profession of the patient, and at discharge: leg pain, back pain, medication used for leg pain, new neurological deficit after the surgical procedure, {{and the number of}} days of their postoperative stay at the hospital. The factors were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two patients were identified. Twenty-nine patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging during their postoperative follow-up. None of the predefined factors at discharge had any predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: The need for a regular appointment at the outpatient clinic for patients who underwent the first surgery can be questioned. Preoperatively and postoperatively, extensive instructions about postoperative issues related to work and lifestyle should be given. By Web or telephone, these patients should complete questionnaires at regular intervals to evaluate to outcome of the surgery. In case of unsuspected events, persistent, or recurrent complaints the patient should visit the clinic or outpatient clinic...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Urban {{green spaces}} works and {{maintenance}} are high-risk activities and usually represent possible sources of injuries. The management issues {{are complex and}} strongly influenced by companies' policies in terms of safety management and human factor. A high number of tasks - including protecting {{public health and safety}} and safe working procedures - need to be faced by professional arborists or gardeners. Method The present paper provides a preparatory groundwork for modeling and describing the real risk levels during the abovementioned activities. The methodology represents a useful tool for decision making both for group leaders and safety coordinators. This goal is reached by collecting data emerging from several workplaces located in North East Italy regarding the frequency and severity of injuries. Results The preliminary results point out that the most frequent injuries in green maintenance activities are represented by cuts, contusions, and ocular lesions, but none of them have lead to particularly serious consequences for the operators; indeed, the high levels of severity are related to traumas, fractures, and acute <b>lumbar</b> <b>herniated</b> <b>discs.</b> The riskiest activities are related to pruning, especially using mobile elevating work platforms, and grass cutting, especially when operated in escarpments and banks. Workers' behavior and companies' safety policies are key elements for a correct safety management system...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{disappearance}} of a <b>herniated</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>disc</b> {{is known to}} occur. This case study describes a 45 -year-old patient whose symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy resolved and follow-up imaging showed complete {{disappearance of}} the disc prolapse. This phenomenon strengthens the role of conservative treatment {{in the management of}} lumbar disc protrusions. Keywords conservative treatment; disappearing disc; lumbar disc protrusion...|$|R
50|$|Laminotomies {{are also}} {{performed}} {{to create a}} window into the spinal canal in order to fix a problem that is within the spinal canal. Laminotomies are frequently used as a way to surgically repair a spinal disc herniation at any level of the vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, <b>lumbar).</b> A <b>herniated</b> <b>disc</b> can compress spinal nerves and cause intense pain and impaired sensation. Removing a portion of the lamina allows physicians to be able to access and repair the <b>herniated</b> <b>disc.</b> Laminotomies may also be used to treat intraspinal lesions such as spinal tumor or problems with the blood vessels supplying the spinal cord. In any scenario where the inside of the spinal canal must be accessed or there is an increase in pressure in the spinal canal, laminotomy may be used to treat the disorder or alleviate symptoms.|$|R
