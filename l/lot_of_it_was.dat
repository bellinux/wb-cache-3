I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals — but a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.|$|E

I {{went through a lot}} of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, {{what the fuck are}} you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|E

500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd be on the road {{for a long time and}} we had no life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] I think everybody was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E

[...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale's split and two-week break was [...] "not cool", but asked [...] "how brilliant was Sun's smackdown on her bad daddy?". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. [...] I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> set-up for … [...] ), but it was definitely {{in the spirit of}} what I love about the show." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes. [...] All the flashforward scenes tonight were right on the money as far as I was concerned." [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post [...] "really liked this episode" [...] and concluded that it [...] "definitely showcased the new breath of life the fourth season gave to the show." ...|$|E

Drummer Andrew Cyrille said Sun Ra's comments were [...] "very interesting stuff... whether you believed it or not. And a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times <b>it</b> <b>was</b> humorous, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ridiculous, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right on the money." ...|$|R

They didn't want {{to have a lot of}} the dirty laundry, so a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> cut down."

2500|$|Beatles for Sale was the Beatles' fourth album {{release in}} the space of 21 months. Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager, later reflected: [...] "No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that's what the Beatles did at the end of 1964. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> down to naiveté, {{thinking}} that this was the way things were done. If the record company needs another album, you go and make one." [...] Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: [...] "They were rather war weary during Beatles for Sale. One must remember that they'd been battered like mad throughout 1964, and much of 1963. Success is a wonderful thing but it is very, very tiring." ...|$|E

He was far more complex than the Beatles and mostly like [...] Stravinsky in orchestral music where the key changes and key centers change four or five times within a pop tune, which is unheard of." [...] On Pet Sounds and other work, author Jim Fussili observed a repeated nuance of Wilson's to [...] "wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work". Tony Asher remembers: [...] "one of the things that I really enjoyed, was that first time I'd hear him hunting for a chord change and I'd think 'Man, he's just gone right off the edge because he's not ever gonna get close. He's way out there in some area that's just—he'll never get back. And if he's successful, gets out of there, people are going to say, I've lost my tone center, don't know where the hell I am and stuff. And then, eventually, he'd figure out what it was he wanted to do. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just hunting and pecking, the way some of us type." ...|$|E
