5|$|The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is {{operated}} as a corporation and {{is owned by}} the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999. The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter <b>Leaver,</b> were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 29 September 1803, Jackall sighted and chased a sloop running along the shore between Nieuport and Dunkirk. The wind fell so <b>Leaver</b> sent 11 men in a boat to board the quarry.

Jackall, which had been using her sweeps, and {{with the assistance of}} a light breeze that had arisen, came up and provided support for the boat and the sloop, which the boarding party had gotten off. The sloop turned out to be from Dunkirk, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and possibly serving to transport troops. Despite the fire from the sloop before she grounded, and the guns on shore, which were within 25 yards of the sloop, the British sustained no casualties. The sloop turned out to be San Façon.|$|E

40|$|This {{introductory}} {{working paper}} provides the background information necessary to permit {{analysis for the}} project, “Social Exclusion of Youth in Europe: Cumulative Disadvantage, Coping Strategies, Effective Policies and Transfer, EXCEPT”. Focusing on recent school <b>leavers</b> in European countries, it compares various indicators for youth labour market exclusion and insecurity {{which are based on}} several micro-data sources. The report interprets the situation on the labour market during three periods and it is built around three main research topics: labour market exclusion, insecure employment and the labour market transitions affecting recent school <b>leavers.</b> The main results of this report in summary are: •	recent school <b>leavers</b> experience more disadvantage on the labour market than prime age workers: {{they are more likely to}} be unemployed or NEET (neither in education, employment nor training), •	the labour market situation of recent school <b>leavers</b> was damaged by the current economic crisis in the majority of European countries (except Germany), •	unemployment of recent school <b>leavers</b> varies considerably between the European countries; Greece, Spain, Italy and Croatia provide the worst employment prospects for graduates, •	educational attainment is the most important factor that improves the chance of recent school <b>leavers</b> to enter the labour market, •	labour market insecurity for recent school <b>leavers</b> is closely related to labour market policy and country specific employment regulations, •	in Southern Europe recent school <b>leavers</b> are overrepresented as temporary and part-time workers and are forced into these types of employment owing to the lack of available permanent job contracts, •	in post-socialist countries, atypical, insecure forms of employment are a rare phenomenon for both recent school <b>leavers</b> and prime age workers, •	in Spain, Greece and Italy, the labour market exclusion of recent school <b>leavers,</b> as depicted by high unemployment rates, overlaps high employment insecurity, •	labour market entry trajectories differ between EU countries for recent school <b>leavers.</b> In Southern Europe and some post-socialist countries there is low labour market mobility, while in Austria and The Netherlands, and the UK, the transition of recent graduates into employment is much faster.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Existing {{research has shown that}} care <b>leavers</b> {{are one of the most}} disadvantaged groups in society and are at particular risk of experiencing negative long-term outcomes including unemployment, homelessness and mental health problems. This thesis makes a contribution to knowledge in this area by focusing upon a group of care <b>leavers</b> about whom very little is currently known: care <b>leavers</b> in higher education. These are young people who despite the odds, have succeeded educationally and are overcoming their early disadvantage to make a successful transition from care into adulthood. This thesis uses Bourdieu's theory on transformation and reproduction in society and the concepts of capital, field and habitus to explore care leavers' experiences of higher education. It considers how the support available to care <b>leavers</b> from their local authorities and higher education institutions has developed since Jackson and colleagues (2005) Going to University from Care study first highlighted deficits in the level of support provided to care <b>leavers.</b> This thesis also compares the experiences of care <b>leavers</b> with students from other disadvantaged backgrounds to understand where care <b>leavers</b> have specific support needs as a result of not being supported at university by their birth parents. Finally, this thesis considers the impact of the Buttle UK Quality Mark, developed in response to the findings of Jackson and colleagues (2005) and awarded to universities demonstrating a commitment to supporting care <b>leavers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Early {{welfare reform}} {{research}} showed {{high rates of}} employment for TANF <b>leavers.</b> However, work-focused welfare may not be effective during an economic downturn. We investigate the employment of Wisconsin TANF <b>leavers,</b> contrasting outcomes among early <b>leavers</b> (1998) with those who left during the 2001 recession. We use data from administrative records on about 6000 welfare <b>leavers,</b> tracking quarterly employment for 3 years after they left benefits. Separate panel data analyses of those exiting in two different time periods show that individual <b>leavers</b> {{are less likely to}} be employed when their local unemployment rate is high in the later cohort; no relationship is found for the early cohort.

Despite an extensive literature examining these changes and their impacts, {{there have been few}} studies that consider the effects of these reforms {{from the perspective of the}} recent period. The analysis here focuses on the characteristics and employment of welfare recipients in Maryland and Missouri, 1991 - 2004. We find that there has been only modest change in the observable characteristics of those entering, remaining on or leaving welfare, but the importance of employment has grown for each of these groups. We also examine the dynamics of employment and welfare recidivism, comparing cohorts of <b>leavers</b> prior to and after welfare reform. We find that after welfare reform <b>leavers</b> are much more likely to be working. Although in Maryland those working have earnings that are somewhat below employed <b>leavers</b> prior to reform, in Missouri earnings for employed <b>leavers</b> are unchanged. In both states, the types of jobs <b>leavers</b> hold have not changed substantially, and <b>leavers</b> are less likely to return to welfare following reform. welfare reform...|$|R
