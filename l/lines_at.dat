A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center {{with the western}} mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection would {{reduce the number of}} passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange <b>lines</b> <b>at</b> Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remains unfunded.|$|E

50|$|In {{projective}} geometry, any pair of <b>lines</b> always intersects <b>at</b> some point, but {{parallel lines}} do not intersect {{in the real}} plane.

Also, if any pair of <b>lines</b> intersect <b>at</b> a point on the <b>line</b> <b>at</b> infinity, then the pair of lines are parallel.|$|R
