50|$|In Commissioner v. Court Holding Co., 324 U.S. 331 (1945) the Supreme Court {{affirmed the}} tax court's {{treatment}} of a <b>liquidating</b> <b>dividend</b> and sale by shareholder as a sale of the corporation.|$|E
50|$|In December 1929 the {{corporation}} had assets of $4,235,598. The liquidating {{value of its}} capital stock was $46.34 per share. The trust directors voted a final <b>liquidating</b> <b>dividend</b> of$47.17, payable after March 3, 1930. Remaining cash which amounted to $4,045,358, was distributed pro rata among stockholders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Liquidating</b> <b>{{dividends}}</b> : <b>Liquidating</b> <b>dividends</b> {{occur when}} there is an excess of dividends declared over earnings of the acquired company since the date of acquisition. Regular dividends are recorded as dividend income whenever they are declared.|$|R
50|$|The {{purchasing}} company {{uses the}} cost method {{to account for}} this type of investment. Under the cost method, the investment is recorded at cost at the time of purchase. The company does not need any entries to adjust this account balance unless the investment is considered impaired or there are <b>liquidating</b> <b>dividends,</b> both of which reduce the investment account.|$|R
40|$|Rule l 0 b- 5 of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act allows {{investors to}} sue firms for {{misrepresentation}} or omission. Since firms are principal-agent contracts between owners contract designers - and privately informed managers, owners {{are the ultimate}} firms' voluntary disclosure strategists. We analyze voluntary disclosure equilibrium in a game with two types of owners: expected <b>liquidating</b> <b>dividends</b> motivated (VMO) and expected price motivated (PMO). We find that Rule l 0 b- 5 : (i) does not deter misrepresentation and may suppress voluntary disclosure or, (ii) induces some firms to adopt a partial disclosure policy of disclosing only bad news or only good news. ...|$|R
50|$|A liquidating {{distribution}} (or <b>liquidating</b> <b>dividend)</b> {{is a type}} of nondividend distribution made by {{a corporation}} or a partnership to its shareholders during its partial or complete liquidation. Liquidating distributions are not paid solely out of the profits of the corporation. Instead, the entire amount of shareholders' equity is distributed. When a company has more liabilities than assets, equity is negative and no liquidating distribution is made at all. This is usually the case in bankruptcy liquidations. Creditors are always senior to shareholders in receiving the corporation's assets upon winding up. However, in case all debts to creditors have been fully satisfied, there is a surplus left to divide among equity-holders. This mainly occurs during voluntary liquidations of solvent corporations.|$|E

Cash dividends are nice because a shareholder can <b>liquidate</b> their cash <b>dividends.</b> When a certain company on the market is profitable and doing well they can get cash dividends declared {{by the board of}} directors. A cash dividend is the distribution via cash of the profits the company makes. The common shareholders, the owners of the company, receive this cash dividend.|$|R
