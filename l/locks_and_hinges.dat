5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E
60|$|The {{apartment}} {{which was}} used by the party for their sitting and eating room was usually a large hall, with a brick or stone floor, and a vaulted ceiling above, painted in fresco. The walls of the room were usually painted too. There was generally a small and very coarse carpet under the table, and sometimes one before the fireplace. The doors were massive; and the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> upon them, and also the andirons and the shovel and tongs, were of the most ancient and curious construction. The first thing which the children did, on being ushered into one of these old halls, was to walk all about, and examine these various objects in detail. Rollo made drawings of a great many of them in his drawing book, to bring home and show to people in America.|$|E

50|$|The present {{aisles of}} the nave date from {{about a hundred}} {{years after the first}} names on that board. The great door of the main (south) {{entrance}} may similarly date from about 1350-1400. It may have been locally made, or perhaps only its <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> are of local construction. The door is unusual in that it folds in the middle. The ornamented ironwork is said to be of Hampshire workmanship.|$|R
60|$|Poole {{swung the}} axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, {{and the red}} baize door leaped against the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges.</b> A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the {{fittings}} were of excellent workmanship; {{and it was not}} until the fifth, that the <b>lock</b> burst <b>and</b> the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.|$|R
60|$|This was enough. Laidlaw {{threw his}} heavy bulk against the door, burst <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinge,</b> <b>and</b> sent it {{flat on the}} garret floor. Blinding smoke met and almost choked him as he fell, and Sam, {{tumbling}} over him, caught up the first person his hands touched and bore her out. It was old Liz--half dressed, and wrapped in a blanket! Susy, also half dressed, and with a shawl wrapped round her shoulders, {{was carried out by}} Laidlaw. Both were unhurt, though half stifled by smoke, and greatly alarmed.|$|R
50|$|The apartment, {{in which}} almost the whole film takes place, was {{designed}} in a sound studio {{on the outskirts}} of Paris. Production designer Dean Tavoularis placed a priority on making the set look authentically American, having numerous products and appliances shipped from the U.S., and going to the trouble of spending {{tens of thousands of dollars}} to rent <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> that look American rather than European.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Ashton-in-Makerfield was anciently a {{township}} in {{the parish}} of Newton-in-Makerfield (as Newton-le-Willows was once known), Winwick and hundred of West Derby. With neighbouring Haydock, Ashton-in-Makerfield was a chapelry, but the two were split in 1845. The place {{has long been a}} centre for the manufacture of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges,</b> but also sits on the Lancashire Coalfield, and so was a coal mining district.|$|E
50|$|Sintered {{metal powder}} {{is used to}} make {{frangible}} shotgun shells called breaching rounds, as used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. These shotgun shells are designed to destroy door deadbolts, <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door. They work by destroying the object they hit and then dispersing into a relatively harmless powder.|$|E
60|$|The {{one real}} terror which she felt {{was that she}} would go mad. Nay! {{that she was in}} a measure mad already. For hours now,--or was it days?... or years?... she had heard nothing save that rhythmic walk of the sentinel, and the kindly, tremulous voice of the Abbe {{whispering}} consolations, or murmuring prayers in her ears, she had seen nothing save that prison door, of rough deal, painted a dull grey, with great old-fashioned <b>lock,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> rusty with the damp of ages.|$|R

60|$|Ffoulkes nodded, and anon in this squalid room, ill-lit, ill-ventilated, barely furnished, was {{presented}} {{one of the}} most curious spectacles of these strange and troublous times: two English gentlemen, the acknowledged dandies of London drawing-rooms, busy picking <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> filing <b>hinges</b> like any common house-thieves.|$|R
50|$|After the British {{surrender}} it was rebuilt, including with salvaged glass, nails, <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> {{recovered from}} the burned home. General Schuyler conducted his business affairs from the home. It has been visited by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, the Marquis de Lafayette and President Franklin Roosevelt. It {{was given to the}} U.S. government. It has no electricity or running water and remains largely as it was in 1777. The home is open from late May to Labor Day.|$|E
50|$|After Kentucky {{became the}} 15th state in early 1792, five commissioners from various {{counties}} were appointed on June 20 {{to choose a}} location for the capital. They were John Allen and John Edwards (both from Bourbon County), Henry Lee (from Mason), Thomas Kennedy (from Madison), and Robert Todd (from Fayette). A number of communities competed for this honor, but Frankfort won. According to early histories, the offer of Andrew Holmes' log house as capitol for seven years, a number of town lots, £50 worth of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges,</b> 10 boxes of glass, 1,500 pounds of nails, and $3,000 in gold helped the decision go to Frankfort.|$|E
50|$|A house {{dated to}} 450 BCE, built of warichchi (wattle and daub) has been {{discovered}} near Kirindi oya. Another has been found at Adalla, Wirawila, and at Valagampattu evidence {{has been discovered}} of houses dating from 50 CE to 400 CE. The kitchen utensils are still there. In medieval times, the rich had large houses built of stone, mortar and lime, with tiled roofs and whitewashed walls. There were rooms and apartments with doors and windows. The windows had fanlights. The doors had keys, <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges.</b> The houses had compounds or courtyards and balconies. There were separate rooms for pounding paddy, a storeroom or atuva for paddy, and sheds for keeping chariots. Latrines are also mentioned. All houses however had small kitchens.|$|E

50|$|In 1901, Ardeshir {{turned to}} experimenting with safes. Ardeshir {{resolved}} {{to build a}} safe that was not only burglarproof, but fireproof as well, which as he determined, most safes were not. Ardeshir made dozens of designs on paper and held innumerable discussions with his engineers and craftsmen, until it was finally determined {{that the only way}} to ensure security and stability was to make the safe out of a single sheet of steel. The resultant design had altogether sixteen bends, each side of the cross-shaped sheet being folded forward and then being folded twice more (inwards) to form the front door frame. Joints were welded, not riveted, and the coffer was covered by a second sixteen-bend sheet offset to the first by 90 degrees. The door was double plated, with the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> attached to the inner plate and the joints covered by the outer plate. The total weight was 1¾ tons. Altogether three patents covered the Ardeshir design. The first safes entered the market in 1902.|$|R
5000|$|Late in 2015, Judge Howard Halm {{dismissed}} the suit, agreeing with the hotel's arguments. [...] "The {{very nature of}} the water tank would make it unreasonable for (Lam) to assume that she was allowed to climb it and open the lid," [...] he wrote. Thomas Johnston, the Lams' attorney, remained unconvinced, noting that the hotel has since secured the tank entrance with a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> installed <b>hinges.</b> [...] "This was an accident waiting to happen," [...] he said. He was unsure whether he and the Lams would appeal.|$|R
50|$|The Spasić House is {{the most}} {{characteristic}} traditional house in the Velika Hoča village. It was built {{during the first half}} of the 19th century by a family ancestor, who was a pilgrim to Jerusalem. What makes this building unique are its pronounced facades, its cantilevered elements on the upper floor, the large gates with separated entrances for pedestrians and vehicles, old-fashioned <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges,</b> and the decorative stone slate canopies. It is also a Bed and Breakfast house that offers two double bedrooms, a bathroom and a ‘Jerusalem Chamber’ in the first floor. The ‘Jerusalem Chamber’ {{is the most}} representative part of the house, which has a family iconostasis and relicts brought by the pilgrimage. On the ground floor are found the living room, kitchen, bedroom and a bathroom.|$|E

5000|$|Breaching rounds are {{designed}} to destroy door deadbolts, <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door, as traditional buckshot can. These frangible rounds are made of a dense sintered material, often metal powder in a binder such as wax, which can destroy a lock or hinge and then immediately disperse. They are used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. Amongst police, these rounds are nicknamed [...] "master keys", and their use is known as [...] "Avon calling". Ideally, breaching rounds {{may be used in}} a standard combat shotgun or riot shotgun, or in a specialized shotgun, often attached to a rifle, such as the KAC Masterkey or M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System. The most effective use of this round is with a [...] "stand-off breacher" [...] attached to the muzzle of a specially converted shotgun. The stand-off is held {{on the surface of the}} door and vents gases to prevent overpressure.|$|E

25|$|As a rule, {{cabinets}} of the 15th {{century were}} rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria {{the lower part}} was often enclosed, {{as well as the}} upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the piece of furniture. A very pretty instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the <b>lock</b> plates <b>and</b> <b>hinges,</b> is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|R

40|$|The swing-lock {{removable}} partial denture (RPD) {{can address}} some specific partially edentulous situations better than conventional partial denture designs. The concept {{is recommended for}} maximizing stability and retention by access to more tooth surfaces and undercuts with the unique clasping mechanism offered by the incorporation of <b>lock,</b> <b>hinge,</b> <b>and</b> gate assemblies. Since its introduction, the swing-lock RPD has gained some degree of acceptance. However, it is infrequently used by clinicians because it is technique-sensitive, especially during <b>hinge</b> <b>and</b> <b>lock</b> fabrication, <b>and</b> the durability of the retentive element of the locking mechanism decreases with the progressive wear of the metal latch attachment. This article presents a new design for a swing-lock RPD by use of a vertical bar and plastic clip attachment {{as an alternative to}} the <b>hinge</b> <b>and</b> latch attachment. The suggested modification in the locking mechanism may overcome some of the problems associated with the conventional swing-lock RPD. King Saud Universit...|$|R

60|$|Eleven o'clock was {{the family}} hour for going to bed at Baregrove Square. Zack's first {{proceeding}} on entering his room was to open his window softly, put on an old traveling cap, and light a cigar. It was December weather at that time; but his hardy constitution rendered him as impervious to cold as a young Polar bear. Having smoked quietly for half an hour, he listened at his door till the silence in Mr. Thorpe's dressing-room below assured him {{that his father was}} safe in bed, and invited him to descend on tiptoe--with his boots under his arm--into the hall. Here he placed his candle, with a box of matches by it, on a chair, and proceeded to open the house door with the noiseless dexterity of a practiced burglar--being always careful to facilitate the safe performance of this dangerous operation by keeping <b>lock,</b> bolt, <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> well oiled. Having secured the key, blown out the candle, and noiselessly closed the door behind him, he left the house, and started for the Haymarket, Covent Garden, or the Strand, a little before midnight--or, in other words, set forth on a nocturnal tour of amusement, just at the time when the doors of respectable places of public recreation (which his father prevented him from attending) were all closed, and the doors of disreputable places all thrown open.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{work began}} once the main structure was complete. John Phillips was {{employed as a}} carpenter for the Library's floors, windows and bookcases. Joseph Artari was chosen to be the project's plasterer, employing Charles Stanley and Thomas Toberts alongside him. In March 1745, the Trustees intervened to help ensure no work was proceeding by candlelight as the Library neared completion. A portrait of Radcliffe was sent to John Michael Rysbrack, who was tasked with creating a six-feet tall marble statue of the Library's benefactor. It was installed by Townesend and Smith. The responsibility for the ironwork for the gates for the seven exterior arches of the library was given to Robert Bakewell of Derby. His original estimate proved too low, however, explained by Gibbs to {{be a result of}} the French war. It eventually cost £364. The Trustee's meeting of 13 March 1746 reveals that the remaining work consisted of the paving of the library inside and out, the staircase rail, <b>and</b> the <b>locks,</b> <b>hinges</b> <b>and</b> bolts for the bookcases.|$|R
40|$|The {{gentleman in}} this case study {{presents}} with the typical etiology of a brachial plexus injury, status post motorcycle accident. The accident occurred several years ago with surgical intervention including a shoulder allograft and arthrodesis {{as well as a}} transradial amputation. Because of the presence of a complete brachial plexus injury it is difficult to decipher the rationale behind a transradial amputation. Many of us have fit individuals who had suffered these type of injuries and have opted for transhumeral amputations. Difficulty arises from attempting to accommodate the non-functional articulation, namely the elbowjoint. Past prosthetic fittings have been with a conventional, elbow disarticulation style prosthesis with external <b>locking</b> <b>hinges</b> <b>and</b> voluntary opening terminal device. Due to the limited excursion of this gentleman and his wear on the contralateral shoulder for these many years, it was time to consider a different prosthetic design The design consideration was to utilize some of the components that he presently functions with and to add electronic components which require limited excursion and strength in order to operate...|$|R
