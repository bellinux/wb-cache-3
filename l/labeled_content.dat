After optimization of the mobile phase conditions, a baseline {{resolution of the}} stereoisomers of 24 out of 53 N-derivatized di- and tri-peptides was obtained. 3, 5 -Dinitrobenzoyl- and 3, 5 -dichlorobenzoyl-peptide stereoisomers were separated with exceptionally high selectivity and resolution.

The method involves separation on YMC C 18 column(150 mm x 4. 6 mm x 5 µm particle size). The optimized mobile phase consists of Phosphate buffer (pH 3) and Acetonitrile (80 : 20 v/v) with a flow rate of 0. 8 ml/min and UV detection at 220 mn. Retention time was 2. 138 min (Metformin Hydrochloride), 2. 943 min (Teneligliptin), 5. 075 Pioglitazone. Linearity range was 9. 98 - 600 ug/ml (Metformin Hydrochloride), 0. 51 - 24 ug/ml (Teneligliptin). Accuracy was {{in the range of}} 99. 41 - 100. 74 % for both drugs. Precision was 0. 8 % and 0. 9 % for Metformin Hydrochloride and Teneligliptin. LOD and LOQ are 0. 72 ug/ml and 2. 40 ug/ml for Metformin Hydrochloride, 0. 15 ug/ml and 0. 51 ug/ml for Teneligliptin. The method developed is sensitive, accurate and precise. Retention time and run time were also less and hence the method is economical.

40|$|Two novel polysaccharide-based chiral {{stationary}} phases (CSPs), {{known as}} Sepapak- 2 (cellulose tris(3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenylcarbamate)) and Sepapak- 4 (cellulose tris(4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenylcarbamate)),have been evaluated {{in this work}} for the chiral separation {{of a group of}} 16 pesticides including herbicides,insecticides and fungicides. The optimization of the mobile phase employed in nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) enabled the chiral separation of seven pesticides on Sepapak- 2 and of nine pesticides on Sepapak- 4. Due to the fact that Sepapak- 4 gave better results, this column was selected to compare nano-LC and capillary electrochromatography (CEC) under the same conditions that consisted in the use of a 90 / 9 / 1 (v/v/v) ACN/H 2 O/ammonium formate (pH 2. 5) background electrolyte (BGE). As expected, both the efficiency and the chiral resolution obtained in CEC experiments were higher than in nano-LC for all the analyzed compounds. The analytical characteristics of the CEC developed methodology were evaluated in terms of linearity, LODs, LOQs, precision, selectivity, and accuracy allowing its application to the quantitation of metalaxyl and its enantiomeric impurity in a commercial fungicide product marketed as enantiomerically pure (metalaxyl-M) and in soil and tap water samples after solid phase extraction (SPE).

Unfortunately, the same property {{opens the door to}} unwanted communication, marketing, and propaganda.

Our system, Ostra, bounds the total amount of unwanted communication a user can produce {{based on the number of}} trust relationships the user has, and relies on the fact that it is difficult for a user to create arbitrarily many trust relationships. Ostra is applicable to both messaging systems such as email and content-sharing systems such as YouTube. It does not rely on automatic classification of content, does not require global user authentication, respects each recipient’s idea of unwanted communication, and permits legitimate communication among parties who have not had prior contact. An evaluation based on data gathered from an online social networking site shows that Ostra effectively thwarts unwanted communication while not impeding legitimate communication. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{elaboration}} of dentin collagen precursors by the odontoblasts in the incisor teeth of 30 – 40 -g rats was investigated by electron microscopy, histochemistry, and radioautography after intravenous injection of tritium-labeled proline. At 2 min after injection, when the labeling of blood proline was high, radioactivity {{was restricted to}} the rough endoplasmic reticulum, indicating {{that it is the}} site of synthesis of the polypeptide precursors of collagen, the pro-alpha chains. At 10 min, when the labeling of blood proline had already declined, radioactivity was observed in spherical portions of Golgi saccules containing entangled threads, and, at 20 min, radioactivity appeared in cylindrical portions containing aggregates of parallel threads. The parallel threads measured 280 – 350 nm in length and stained with the low pH-phosphotungstic acid technique for carbohydrate and with the silver methenamine technique for aldehydes (as did extracellular collagen fibrils). The passage of label from spherical to cylindrical Golgi portions is associated with the reorganization of entangled into parallel threads, which is interpreted as the packing of procollagen molecules. Between 20 and 30 min, prosecretory and secretory granules respectively became labeled. These results indicate that the cylindrical portions of Golgi saccules transform into prosecretory and subsequently into secretory granules. Within these granules, the parallel threads, believed to be procollagen molecules, are transported to the odontoblast process. At 90 min and 4 h after injection, label was present in predentin, indicating that the <b>labeled</b> <b>content</b> of secretory granules had been released into predentin. This occurred by exocytosis as evidenced by the presence of secretory granules in fusion with the plasmalemma of the odontoblast process. It is proposed that pro-alpha chains give rise to procollagen molecules which assemble into parallel aggregates in the Golgi apparatus. Procollagen molecules are then transported within secretory granules to the odontoblast process and released by exocytosis. In predentin procollagen molecules would give rise to tropocollagen molecules, which would then polymerize into collagen fibrils...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze the education- related schemas guiding {{teachers}} and highly educated, professional immigrant parents in a small southern California elementary school district, and to describe how facets of these schemas converged or diverged as parents and teachers drew upon their social and cultural backgrounds during interactions with one another. First, participants' schemas about teaching and learning were categorized by the degree to which they identified with either a virtue-oriented, effort-based, traditionally- defined model of teaching and learning (<b>labeled</b> <b>Content</b> Classic) or a mind-oriented, innate ability-based, progressive model of teaching and learning (labeled Knowledge Construction). The teachers who participated in this study gravitated toward Knowledge Construction, while the parents who had recently moved to the United States identified more strongly with Content Classic. Those parents who were partially educated outside the U. S. but had been in American for a decade or more tended to espouse "hybrid" schemas, incorporating aspects of both Content Classic and Knowledge Construction models of teaching and learning. Second, teachers described parent- teacher conferences in a consistent, teacher-led style emphasizing the communication of academic information. According to the interviewed educators, the parent's role during conferences and all interactions was to demonstrate trust in the teacher's expertise, judgment, and advice, a behavior they noted when Asian immigrant parents were described as gracious and thankful during conferences. Parent participants who believed that a child's effort was the most important determinant of academic success were interested in their children's relative standing (rank) in the class and concrete, specific ways to help their children practice skills at home. Teachers, who identified more closely with a Knowledge Construction schema, felt that students' self-esteem and intrinsic motivation should be nurtured through encouragement to maximize their innate ability. Consequently, teachers at times believed that immigrant parents were pushing their children too hard or were disproportionately fixated on academic acceleration. This study's disentanglement of culture as a variable separate from SES and education illuminated key areas where educators can engage and ease the transition of immigrant students and parents into a new context, regardless of their demographic...|$|E
40|$|Information and {{documentation}} services {{available on the}} Internet through web servers are growing in an exponential manner. The logical evolution of the Internet over the last 10 years has been producing a replacement of static web pages and documents by dynamically generated documents. This is due both to user interaction with work processes and flows defined by service creators and to the availability of growing information repositories. This has meant a progressive evolution from a concept of web page publishing which was quite simple in its origins to more complex and differentiated schemes relying on procedures and techniques based on information management. The increasing complexity of services and systems supporting them has made it necessary to formulate a theoretical and practical corpus capable of combining classical information management techniques within organizations with the particular features of the digital environment. This evolution which has been accelerating during {{the first years of}} the 20 th Century has had an impact not only information management methods and techniques but also on the very technology used for information management; and consequently the market for products and services (GILBANE, 2000). If it is true that during the second half of the 1990 's we could distinguish between products for document management, information retrieval, etc., since the turn of the century there has been a convergence between all platforms. Nowadays it has become easy to find solutions that intend to be global and to provide support for the whole process of information management within an organization. The kind of tools that have been developed to serve this purpose have been <b>labeled</b> <b>Content</b> Management Systems (CMS) and have become integrated with document management systems as well as with those dealing with information retrieval. To this we must add that keeping control over processes has become a key element within the current conception of information management. This explains why processes are generally accompanied by workflow systems. The sum of these factors enables us to outline a scenario in which documentary management tools have been incorporating the range of capabilities which are necessary for managing the processes which create, store, treat and present information in the digital environment. This does not however imply that there exists a total convergence between content management systems and document management systems. On the market we may find content management systems which do not provide the correspondingly desirable documentary capabilities and vice versa. It is also impossible to consider content management and record management to be identical. Yes they are intimately linked, but they are not the same. It is only by studying and evaluating the features and capabilities of available tools that it is possible to determine whether they can provide an adequate solution for a specific problem or context. This issue is further complicated by existing differences between web content management and content management for companies; literature and commentary about these can be found in specialized reports and documents published by companies working in this sector. Moreover, the growing complexity of many organizations' portals, both internal and external, which are supported by content management systems, as well as the digital publishing processes necessary for their production, makes content management systems develop as mutilayered applications which often reach high levels of complexity. On the human side, content management tools can only be understood within a collaborative and distributed work environment, for it is only with this kind of entourage that their full potential can be realized. From the reading of the previous paragraphs it can be deduced that, as opposed to traditional passive document treatment approaches, the more up-to-date tools have widened the limits of record treatment, extending all the way from the creation process for its initial stages, and reaching the processes of new publication and personalization for its final stages. This leads to the configuring of a circular or iterative diagram for documentary treatment. To this we must add the necessary reflection over the concept and features of digital documents. The life cycle of digital documents shows significant changes over the traditional life cycle of documents, with the concept of document itself evolving in much the same way. It has become obvious that the way in which informative- documentary activities are carried out must be reformulated in order to face the new digital environment...|$|E
