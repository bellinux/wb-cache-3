Alternatively, Ricoh's 'VF-2', an external electronic viewfinder, can be attached to the hot shoe which, offers 920,000 pixels and 100% field of view. The separate units slide onto the body via a stainless steel rail and lock into place. They can then be released by a lever on the camera's body. Both the body and <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> use magnesium alloy exterior. Each <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> has its own unique specifications relating to its sensor and optics, meaning that different lens units will change the features, behavior and performance of the camera body to varying degrees when attached.|$|E

50|$|Rangefinder cameras {{allow the}} {{distance}} to objects to be measured {{by means of a}} coupled parallax unit on top of the camera, allowing the focus to be set with accuracy. Single-lens reflex cameras allow the photographer to determine the focus and composition visually using the objective lens and a moving mirror to project the image onto a ground glass or plastic micro-prism screen. Twin-lens reflex cameras use an objective lens and a focusing <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> (usually identical to the objective lens.) in a parallel body for composition and focusing. View cameras use a ground glass screen which is removed and replaced by either a photographic plate or a reusable holder containing sheet film before exposure. Modern cameras often offer autofocus systems to focus the camera automatically by a variety of methods.|$|E
50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A flash sync terminal is part of the <b>lens</b> <b>unit,</b> and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|E
3000|$|Adjustable iris lenses can be manual or {{automatic}}. For {{the manual}} lenses, user selects a fixed setting, while the automatic ones feature a dynamical adjustment following a measurement. If this measurement and the aperture control {{occur in the}} <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> using the actual video signal as input, {{it is said to}} be a video (AC) iris lens. Alternatively, when the measurement occurs outside the <b>lens</b> <b>unit,</b> it is called a DC iris and an external signal is used to drive the lens. The iris is an adjustable opening (aperture), that controls the amount of light coming through the lens (i.e., the [...] "exposure"). The more the iris is opened, the more light it lets in and the brighter the image will be. A correct iris control is crucial to obtain the optimum image quality, including a balanced contrast and resolution and minimum noise.|$|E
25|$|Light {{scattered}} {{in a blue}} sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which {{is dependent on the}} position of the sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the <b>lens</b> <b>units</b> of a compound eye, and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring {{over the course of a}} day. This provides not only directional but also temporal information.|$|R
50|$|The CPL {{consists}} of a central position target with up to four pairs of doublet <b>lens</b> <b>units</b> {{around the perimeter of}} the background disc. The <b>lens</b> <b>units</b> are spaced at 45-degree axes using the positions: green |, yellow /, red—and a lunar white \ for restricting also being present in some installations. The main head is surrounded by up to 6 markers at the 12:00, 2:30, 4:30, 6:00, 8:30 and 10:30 o'clock positions. The function of the main head was block occupancy information with green representing two or more clear blocks, yellow one clear block and red/lunar white representing a restricting indication, meaning the engineman was permitted to enter his train into an occupied block. The orbitals provide speed information, 12 o'clock being Normal speed, 6 being Medium speed (Limited speed if flashing), 10 being Normal to Medium (Limited if flashing), 2 being Normal to Slow, 8 being Medium to Medium, 4 being Medium to Slow and no lit orbitals being Slow to Slow. This CPL was first deployed on the Staten Island Railroad (a B&O subsidiary) in the 1920s, and deployed system-wide shortly thereafter. Parts of the Chicago and Alton Railroad received CPLs later, when the B&O gained control of that line. In the 1980s both Amtrak's Chicago Union Station and Metra's Chicago Northwestern Station installed dwarf CPLs to replace earlier signals in those terminals.|$|R

40|$|The current fiber-based {{illumination}} {{systems of}} laparoscopes {{are unable to}} uniformly illuminate a large enough area in abdomen due to the limited numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber bundle. Most energy is concentrated in a small region {{at the center of}} the illumination area. This limitation becomes problematic in laparoscopes which require capturing a wide field of view. In this paper, we propose an aspherical lens array which is used to direct the outgoing rays from the fiber bundle of laparoscope to produce a more uniformly illuminated, substantially larger field coverage than standalone fiber source. An intensity feedback method is developed to design the aspherical <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> for extended non-Lambertian sources, which is the key to the design of this lens array. By this method, the <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> is obtained after only one iteration, and the lens array is constructed by Boolean operation. Then, the ray-tracing technique is used to verify the design. Further, the lens array is fabricated and experimental tests are performed. The results clearly show that the well-illuminated area is increased to about 0. 107 m 2 from 0. 02 m 2 (about 5 x larger than a standard fiber illumination source). More details of the internal organs can be clearly observed under this improved illumination condition, which also reflects the significant improvement in the optical performance of the laparoscope...|$|E

The long defunct Chicago Signal Company had a version that used standard 5-3/8" [...] switch lamp lenses (often of Macbeth manufacture) instead of the otherwise standard inverse-convex and stepped lens type found in the standard inner doublet design. The Union version was later updated to a single unit akin to the GRS model. As modular color light signals have become widespread, target-type configurations have been typically offered alongside vertical type configurations. The triangular color light signal was especially useful in physically restricted and confined areas.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{we report on}} a unique and ancient type of eye, in which the lower surface of the upper calcite <b>lens</b> <b>units</b> possessed an enigmatic central bulge making the dioptric {{apparatus}} similar to a bifocal lens. This eye belonged to the trilobite Dalmanitina socialis, which became extinct several hundred million years ago. As far as we know, image formation by bifocal lenses of this kind did/does not occur in any other ancient or modern animal visual system. We suggest that the function of these bifocal lenses may be to enable the trilobite to see simultaneously both very near (e. g. floating food particles and tiny preys) and far (e. g. sea floor, conspecifics, or approaching enemies) in the optical environment through the central and peripheral lens region, respectively. This was the only reasonable function we could find to explain the puzzling lens shape. We admit {{that it is not}} clear whether bifocality was necessary for the animal studied. We show that the misleading and accidental resemblance of an erroneous correcting lens surface (designed by René DesCartes in 1637 [DesCartes, R. (1637). Oeuvres de DesCartes. La Géometrie. Livre 2. pp. 134. J. Maire, Leyden] to the correcting interface in the compound Dalmanitina lens may be the reason why the earlier students of the Dalmanitina lens did not recognize its possible bifocality...|$|R

5000|$|The {{prototype}} was a modular camera {{named the}} [...] "Yoshino Flex". In June 1956 the Shinkodo Works created its first handmade example camera, and on reaching perfection in October 1958 with Yoshino's eighth prototype camera, the development costs {{had reached a}} sum of 200 million Yen, a huge sum at that time. The final prototype bore the Latinized nameplate [...] "ZENZA BRONICA"—the Bronica Z (Zen-za) rollfilm camera—and first appeared at the Philadelphia Camera Show in March 1959, where it received ecstatic industry press coverage and left a deep lasting impression of being the world's dream camera. The Bronica Z modular camera system, shortly later with slight modifications renamed the Zenza Bronica D (Deluxe) and successor Bronicas, using large-coverage film format, high-quality Nikkor lenses supplied by the then Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd., (Nikon Corporation) became instant successes in the deluxe camera market worldwide. The Bronica D was the Japanese answer and first serious challenger to the Swedish Hasselblad cameras, and in several technical ways outclassed the Swedish offerings. Such was the design success of Bronica, that in the United States it attracted influential figures from the photographic industry such as Burt Keppler who met with Yoshino.

That causes displacement of the lens working surfaces centers when assembling the <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> into the objective body. A functional diagram of the station for automated gluing and centering of lenses in the frames is shown; the accuracy of its work is considered. We present the ways of accuracy improvement of lenses centering in the frames carried out on this station, thanks to the centering along not one, but two working surfaces of the lens. The design of composite frames has been developed for performing exact centering of lenses at assembly for the various options of their deployment in the frames. Modernization of technological process for the lens automated alignment has been performed to implement centering along both working surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} eyes of trilobites, an extinct {{group of}} marine arthropods, contain many sub-millimeter sized calcium carbonate lenses whose microstructures {{are the key}} to understanding how this ancient visual system functioned. The lenses had to be constructed by the animal very precisely in order to avoid double refraction but the mechanisms by which they focused light remain controversial. Optical models of the schizochroal eyes that typify phacopine trilobites, accepted since the 1970 s, have assumed that the calcite of each lens had a uniform crystallographic orientation and light was focused onto underlying photoreceptor cells via intralensar structures. These models, and others that have been developed subsequently, were tested by mapping the lenses of different trilobite species by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and using both carbon-coated and uncoated cross-sections of the lenses; the latter within the SEM operated in low vacuum mode. Some species did indeed form their lenses from calcite of a uniform orientation and focusing was assisted by using intralensar structures of different chemical compositions. Other species had lenses with a very different and highly intriguing microstructure whereby light may have been ‘guided’ to a central single crystal using an outer <b>lens</b> <b>unit</b> composed of calcite with a radially arranged c axis.
