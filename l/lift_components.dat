50|$|AAW {{developed}} from the simple observation that the aeroelasticity can be offset by the deployment of other control surfaces on the wing. In particular, almost all modern aircraft use some form of slat along the wing's leading edge to provide more lift during certain portions of flight. By deploying the slats {{at the same time}} as the ailerons, the torque can be equalled out on either side of the spars, eliminating the twisting, which improves the control authority of the ailerons. This means that less aileron input is needed to produce a given motion, which, in turn, will reduce aileron drag and its associated negative control aspects. Better yet, the wing is already designed to be extremely strong in the <b>lift</b> <b>component,</b> eliminating the torque requires lift, converting the undesired torque into an acceptable <b>lift</b> <b>component.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{acoustic}} resonance on the dynamic lift force {{acting on the}} central tube in square and normal triangle tube arrays is investigated experimentally. For each array pattern three different tube spacing ratios, corresponding to small, intermediate and large spacing ratios, are tested. The resonant sound field in the tube array is found to cause two main effects. First, it generates a “sound-induced” dynamic lift due to the resonant acoustic pressure distribution {{on the surface of}} the tube, and secondly, it synchronizes vorticity shedding from the tubes and thereby enhances the hydrodynamic lift force due to vortex shedding. The combined effect of these two unsteady lift forces depends on the phase shift between them, which is dictated by the frequency ratio of the acoustic mode to the natural vortex shedding frequencies. When the flow velocity is increased during the coincidence resonance range, the phase shift increases rapidly and therefore the effects of the two <b>lift</b> <b>components</b> change from reinforcing to counteracting each other. For the pre-coincidence lock-on range, the frequency ratio remains larger than unity and the two <b>lift</b> <b>components</b> always reinforce each other. Numerical simulations are also performed to compute the sound-induced lift force, and sound-enhancement coefficients are developed to estimate the effect of sound on the vortex shedding forces. The simulation and experimental results are implemented in a simplified design guide, which can be used to evaluate the dynamic lift forces acting on the tubes during acoustic resonances...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified that prehension {{is composed of}} a reach and a grasp component and that the position {{and size of the}} object can independently affect each. However, no effects on prior to contact prehension kinematics have been reported for manipulations in object mass. We felt that this 'lack of a finding' was surprising, as a more accurate grip position on heavier objects would prevent slippage and rotation when lifting the object. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased object mass would effect the grasp component movement kinematics prior to contact in preparation for a stable final grip placement on the object. We report two experiments in which participants reached, grasped and lifted objects of various size and mass, and their movement kinematics were recorded using a motion tracking system. The results showed that the mass of the object significantly influenced prior-to-contact grasp kinematics. Both studies showed that the heavy compared to light objects caused increased peak grasp aperture, a final finger and thumb placement on the object that more closely passed through the object centre of mass, increased lift delay and reduced peak lift velocity. The data are discussed in terms of how object mass influences the reach, grasp and <b>lift</b> <b>components</b> of prehensile movement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{article focuses}} on {{theoretical}} developments in modeling and control of High-Speed Super-cavitating Vehicles (HSSV). A simplified model of longitudinal dynamics is developed for control, and a dynamic inversion based inner-loop control technique is proposed to handle the switched, time-delay de-pendent behavior of the vehicle. Two outer-loop control schemes are compared for guidance level tracking. (DARPA Advanced Technology Office, 2005 Ashley, 2001) has generated renewed interest in cavitation. Supercavitation can provide significant benefits in drag reduction by maintain-ing a stable single vaporized water bubble around the vehicle {{making it possible to}} extend the velocity range of underwater applications. The sharp edge of a cavitator mounted on the nose of the vehicle creates a large pressure gradient at high velocity. This phenomenon leads to flow separation, which can create a cavity bubble encompassing the entire body. Only small regions of the vehicle are in contact with water. The cavitator and fins at the aft end (if present) provide lift to stabilize the body and may be used for guidance level control tasks. The cavitator size, shape and forward velocity determine the dimensions of the cavity bubble in which the body must fit. Any other contact with the fluid phase is undesirable from a drag reduction standpoint. In this vehicle configuration, with no additional <b>lift</b> <b>components,</b> the vehicle is unstable inside th...|$|E
