5000|$|An {{investor}} lead {{is a type}} of a sales lead. An investor lead is {{the identity}} of a person or entity potentially interested in participating in an investment, and represents the first stage of an investment sales process. Investor leads are considered to have some disposable income that they can use to participate in appropriate investment opportunities in exchange for return on investment in the form of interest, dividend, profit sharing or asset appreciation. Investor lead lists are normally generated through investment surveys, investor newsletter subscriptions or through companies raising capital and selling the database of people who expressed an interest in their opportunity. Investor lead lists are further sold to businesses by <b>lead</b> <b>brokers</b> such as InvestorLeads.com, UmbrellaCapitalManagement.com, InfoUsa.com, Harris Info Source, FNIN, InvestorInspector.com and many others. Investor Lead lists are commonly used by small businesses looking to fund their [...] or simply needing expansion capital that was not readily available by banks and traditional lending sources.|$|R

40|$|The intramonthpattem of broker {{commission}} earnings is examinedfor {{a sample}} of one hundred brokers from a national brokerage firm. It is hypothesized that the structure of <b>broker</b> commissions <b>leads</b> to distortions in trading. The evidence shows {{that in the last}} five days of the production month, more than one-fourth of the brokers earned a significantly higher proportion of their monthly commissions than would be expected if trading were uniform across the month. This suggests that the structure of the commission system may <b>lead</b> some <b>brokers</b> to encourage individual investors to unnecessarily trade securities {{near the end of the}} production month to boost their commission income.

30|$|G {{allows the}} system to account for this ability of the broker to earn more by sharing the {{resources}} among various requests. For example, considering a hypothetical scenario, assume that the ith request has a service time of 1800  s. However, the broker needs the request to be executed for 2500  s to accrue a profit. Using a service time of 1800  s may lead to rejection of the request. However, using a value of G of 1.4 increases the assumed user cost to 2520 times the rate per second and may allow the request to be accepted. The value of G may <b>lead</b> the <b>broker</b> to incur a loss if the estimate made by G cannot be fulfilled by future requests.|$|R
40|$|NASA {{produces}} {{vast amounts}} {{of information about the}} Earth from satellites, supercomputer models, and other sources. These data are most useful when made easily accessible to NASA researchers and scientists, to NASA's partner Federal Agencies, and to society as a whole. A NASA goal is to apply its data for knowledge gain, decision support and understanding of Earth, and other planetary systems. The NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) Geospatial Interoperability Office (GIO) Program leads the development, promotion and implementation of information technology standards that accelerate and expand the delivery of NASA's Earth system science research through integrated systems solutions. Our overarching goal is to make it easy for decision-makers, scientists and citizens to use NASA's science information. NASA's Federal partners currently participate with NASA and one another in {{the development and implementation of}} geospatial standards to ensure the most efficient and effective access to one another's data. Through the GIO, NASA participates with its Federal partners in implementing interoperability standards in support of E-Gov and the associated President's Management Agenda initiatives by collaborating on standards development. Through partnerships with government, private industry, education and communities the GIO works towards enhancing the ESE Applications Division in the area of National Applications and decision support systems. The GIO provides geospatial standards leadership within NASA, represents NASA on the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Coordination Working Group and chairs the FGDC's Geospatial Applications and Interoperability Working Group (GAI) and supports development and implementation efforts such as Earth Science Gateway (ESG), Space Time Tool Kit and Web Map Services (WMS) Global Mosaic. The GIO supports NASA in the collection and dissemination of geospatial interoperability standards needs and progress throughout the agency including areas such as ESE Applications, the SEEDS Working Groups, the Facilities Engineering Division (Code JX) and NASA's Chief Information Offices (CIO). With these agency level requirements GIO <b>leads,</b> <b>brokers</b> and facilitates efforts to, develop, implement, influence and fully participate in standards development internationally, federally and locally. The GIO also represents NASA in the OpenGIS Consortium and ISO TC 211. The OGC has made considerable progress in regards to relations with other open standards bodies; namely ISO, W 3 C and OASIS. ISO TC 211 is the Geographic and Geomatics Information technical committee that works towards standardization in the field of digital geographic information. The GIO focuses on seamless access to data, applications of data, and enabling technologies furthering the interoperability of distributed data. Through teaming within the Applications Directorate and partnerships with government, private industry, education and communities, GIO works towards the data application goals of NASA, the ESE Applications Directorate, and our Federal partners by managing projects in four categories: Geospatial Standards and Leadership, Geospatial One Stop, Standards Development and Implementation, and National and NASA Activities...|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Miami Police Detectives Nick Mendoza and Carl Stoddard (Travis Willingham) make a drug bust {{that goes}} violent. After arresting a fleeing suspect, Captain Julian Dawes (Benito Martinez) has Nick partner up with Khai Minh Dao (Kelly Hu) {{to follow a}} <b>lead</b> to cocaine <b>broker</b> Tyson Latchford (Adam J. Harrington). Forcing his {{associate}} to wear a wire, they find a new drug called Hot Shot being sold {{in the streets of}} Miami and rescue Tyson from a group of armed men. In the process Khai is severely wounded, putting her out of action for several weeks. After returning (against her doctor's orders), Dawes orders the two to bring in Leo Ray (Graham Shiels) from the Elmore Hotel but are forced to fight their way through armed men connected to drug dealer Remy Neltz (T.J. Storm), who is distributing the Hot Shot drug. While capturing Leo, Khai beats him up for seemingly insulting her.|$|R
40|$|Brokers are {{agents who}} arrange sales without taking {{ownership}} of the commodity, earning their money on a commission. Brokers are a common but often controversial presence in wholesale markets of East and Southern Africa. Efficient brokering can be beneficial by matching buyers and sellers more effectively than if each had to search independently for someone to transact with. Yet buyers and sellers can be harmed if brokers are able to behave in uncompetitive, collusive, or unethical ways. In Soweto market of Lusaka, common complaints lodged by sellers are that brokers force sellers to use them by threatening {{the security of the}} sellers’ produce, and that the brokers add “hidden” commissions when selling a farmer or trader’s produce. This policy brief explores the role of brokers in the marketing of fresh produce in Soweto Market. It concludes that, while brokers appear to provide some valued service to some sellers, the chaotic nature of the market and the lack of any regulatory and enforcement structure <b>leads</b> to questionable <b>broker</b> behaviour including charging of hidden commissions. As government and city officials grapple with how to improve fresh produce wholesaling, it is imperative that they focus not just on physical infrastructure but also on the governance, regulatory, and enforcement structures without which new market places will be of little use.
