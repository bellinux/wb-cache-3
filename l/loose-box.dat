60|$|The mare {{was showing}} signs of delicately-hinted impatience; the paddock, with its teasing insects and very {{indifferent}} grazing, had not thrust out {{the image of her}} own comfortable well-foddered <b>loose-box.</b> Elaine divested her habit of some remaining crumbs of bun-loaf and jumped lightly on to her saddle. As she rode slowly down the lane, with Keriway escorting her as far as its gate, she looked round at what had seemed to her, a short while ago, just a picturesque old farmstead, a place of bee-hives and hollyhocks and gabled cart-sheds; now it was in her eyes a magic city, with an undercurrent of reality beneath its magic.|$|E
50|$|In 1899 new {{premises}} for the Institute {{were constructed}} in the then Brisbane suburb of Normanby (now within Spring Hill). The two-storey red brick building, located next to the Brisbane Grammar School residence on College Road, included rooms for Mr Pound and clerical work; a general laboratory; plus chemistry, incubator, sterilizing and photographic rooms on the ground floor, and a museum, library and lecture room on the first floor. Outbuildings included two stalls and <b>loose-boxes,</b> plus other facilities for stock used in experiments.|$|R

40|$|The air of <b>loose-boxes</b> holding pigs {{affected}} with swine vesicular {{disease was}} sampled for virus. In the multistage impinger virus to a titre of 102 · 6 TCID 50 was associated with particles greater than 6 μm., 101 · 6 with particles 3 - 6 μm. and 101 · 4 or less with particles less than 3 μm. In the noses of workers {{in contact with the}} pigs for periods not less than 5 min., virus to a titre of 102 · 4 TCID 50 was found. Virus was recovered from the air for 2 - 3 days during the disease and maximum titre in pigs infected by injection or by contact occurred on the second to third day after generalization of the lesions. The amounts of virus were about 160 -fold less than those recovered from pigs affected with foot-and-mouth disease, and the quantity and time of excretion suggest that the source of {{swine vesicular disease}} virus in the aerosol may be from the lesions and skin rather than from the respiratory tract...|$|R
60|$|Under Mr Abney's rule, {{the stables}} {{had lost their}} {{original}} character. They had been divided into three compartments, each separated by a stout wall. One compartment became a gymnasium, another the carpenter's shop, the third, in which we were, remained a stable, though in these degenerate days no horse ever set foot inside it, its only use being to provide {{a place for the}} odd-job man to clean shoes. The mangers which had once held fodder were given over now to brushes and pots of polish. In term-time, bicycles were stored in the <b>loose-box</b> which had once echoed to the tramping of Derby favourites.|$|E
60|$|She was calmly {{exposed to}} his embrace {{if he had}} only dared; {{but he did not}} dare, {{and went back to the}} <b>loose-box</b> wall. Biting his finger, he stared at her gloomily. She was {{stroking}} the muzzle of her horse; and a sort of dry rage began whisking and rustling in his heart. She had refused him--Harbinger! He had not known, had not suspected how much he wanted her. How could there be anybody else for him, while that young, calm, sweet-scented, smiling thing lived, to make his head go round, his senses ache, and to fill his heart with longing! He seemed to himself at that moment the most unhappy of all men.|$|E
60|$|Yale took {{to himself}} {{a glass of}} the old brandy, three cheroots, and his friend Martyn; and they all left the Mess together. Yale and Martyn conferred for two hours in Yale's quarters; but only the bull-terrier who keeps watch over Yale's boot-trees knows what they said. A horse, hooded and sheeted to his ears, left Yale's stables and was taken, very unwillingly, into the Civil Lines. Yale's groom went with him. Two men broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paint-pots and some large scenery-brushes. Then night fell over the Cantonments, {{and there was a}} noise as of a horse kicking his <b>loose-box</b> to pieces in Yale's stables. Yale had a big, old, white Waler trap-horse.|$|E
40|$|The air of <b>loose-boxes</b> {{which had}} {{previously}} held pigs infected with foot-and-mouth disease was sampled for virus after various procedures. Removal of infected pigs {{led to a}} 12 - to 16 -fold reduction {{in the amount of}} virus after 5 min. and a 400 -fold reduction after 60 min. After heavy spraying (1 · 2 mm. of water in 5 min.) the amount of virus was reduced 500 -fold compared to 30 -fold after light spraying (0 · 20 mm. of water in 5 min.). The partition of infectivity associated with particle size was measured. The partition found after light spraying was similar to that found 5 min. after the pigs had been removed. Heavy spraying brought about a reduction in the infectivity associated with the large particles (> 6 μm.) but had no effect on particles less than 3 μm. A similar partition was found 60 min. after the pigs had been removed. The findings are discussed in relation to the spread of foot-and-mouth disease by the airborne route...|$|R
6000|$|Our {{characters}} are all a month older {{than they were}} when the last-described adventures and conversations occurred, and {{a great number of}} the personages of our story have chanced to reassemble at the little country town where we were first introduced to them. Frederic Lightfoot, formerly maitre d'hotel in the service of Sir Francis Clavering, of Clavering Park, Bart., has begged leave to inform the nobility and gentry of ------shire that he has taken that well-known and comfortable hotel, the Clavering Arms, in Clavering, where he hopes for the continued patronage of the gentlemen and families of the county. [...] "This ancient and well-established house," [...] Mr. Lightfoot's manifesto states, [...] "has been repaired and decorated in a style of the greatest comfort. Gentlemen hunting with the Dumplingbeare hounds will find excellent stabling and <b>loose-boxes</b> for horses at the Clavering Arms. A commodious billiard-room has been attached to the hotel, and the cellars have been furnished with the choicest wines and spirits, selected, without regard to expense, by C. L. Commercial gentlemen will find the Clavering Arms a most comfortable place of resort: and the scale of charges has been regulated for all, so as to meet the economical spirit of the present times." ...|$|R
40|$|In two {{replicated}} trials we initially {{aimed to}} investigate positional foraging preferences in stabled horses {{presented with a}} standard forage. Using the same protocol we then investigated preferences for single and multiple forage sources and interactions with the effect of location. Ten stabled horses, four females and six geldings, aged from 18 months to 21 years, maintained at Writtle College Stud took part in these trials. In Trial 1 four 60 litre containers holding 2. 7 kg of chopped English ryegrass were located in {{the centre of the}} front, back, left and right walls of the horses' 3. 5 m 2 Monarch-style <b>loose-boxes.</b> In Trial 2 three containers each containing 2. 7 kg of forage (chopped Italian ryegrass, chopped timothy, chopped alfalfa) and one container containing 2. 7 kg of an equal parts mixture of these three forages (i. e. 0. 9 kg of each forage) were presented in the same locations according to a Latin Square design to control for location order effects. In both trials the horses' behaviour was recorded for 30 minutes using wall mounted video cameras. Data was harvested from tapes according to an 11 behaviour mutually exclusive ethogram using the Observer v. 5 package and analysed using SPSS v. 12. Data were analysed using Freidman's analysis. In Trial 1 a significant difference in position was found with total foraging duration greatest in the front position (P< 0. 005, df 3, 2 = 14. 0). In Trial 2 a significant difference in duration of foraging was found with highest duration recorded for single ryegrass (P< 0. 001, df 3, 2 = 21. 4). When a variety of forages were presented the effect of location was NS. In these short term trials horses showed a preference for foraging location when a single forage was presented. When a variety of forages were presented single ryegrass was the preferred forage and forage preferences overrode positional preferences...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} two youths had twisted canvas round {{some of the}} pillars of the colonnade, making a sort of <b>loose-box</b> with a two-foot air-way all round the top. There was no door, but there were {{unlimited}} windows.

60|$|His house stood {{recessed}} {{from the}} road, and the stables, which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a room, were behind, their lower portions being lost amid bushes of laurel. Inside the blue door, open half-way down, {{were to be}} seen at this time the backs and tails of half-a-dozen warm and contented horses standing in their stalls; and as thus viewed, they presented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a Moorish arch, the tail being a streak down the midst of each. Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in from the outer light, the mouths of the same animals could be heard busily sustaining the above-named warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay. The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered about a <b>loose-box</b> at the end, whilst the steady grind of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ground plan}} of these stables was {{designed}} by us (Loudon) in 1809 for the late Col. Mytton of Garth, Montgomeryshire; and it is proper to observe the principal object in view was, to provide accommodation for breeding and breaking of a superior description of riding horses. The situation on which these stables were placed was the summit of an elevated knoll, protruding {{from the side of}} a hill; and their effect was remarkably good from all the surrounding country. The elevation actually executed from our design was different from either of those now given (figs 1702 and 1703), and, we need not say, much inferior; the later having been suggested and sketched for us by Barry, and prepared for the engraver by Mr Lamb. Fig 1702 is in the Italian style and fig 1703 is in Tudor Gothic. The form of a riding-house is generally that of a parallelogram:though that at Brighton, some in London and the veranda at Garth ...are circular.’’ John Claudius Loudon ‘’ Encyclopædia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture.’’ Longmans, London. pp965 and 966 1839 [...] The plans for the circular Riding House were derived from Pordens Riding House at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton (1804-8). In 1834 Loudon published two rejected designs for the Garth Riding House, one of which he says was by Charles Barry and the other by himself The designs that were actually built are very different to Loudonss design and have been in executed to match the decorative features of the presumably earlier main house.The stables were circular, 84 ft in diameter, with triangular merlons, ogee windows again, and with an external covered passage (with cast-iron stations) all round, where horses - even with carriages - could be exercised out of the rain. The <b>loose-boxes</b> were arranged radially, in a round-house. Today, only the mid-C19 brick farm buildings survive. The arrangement is a huge three-sided courtyard, entered between barns at the top; at the ends of the arms are two cottages.|$|R
60|$|Hear this, Governments of India {{from the}} Punjab to Madras! The doors come true to the jamb, the cases, {{which have been}} through a hot weather, are neither warped nor cracked, nor are there unseemly tallow-drops and flaws in the glasses. The maroon cloth, on or against which the {{exhibits}} are placed, is of close texture, untouched by the moth, neither stained nor meagre nor sunfaded; the revolving cases revolve freely without rattling; {{there is not a}} speck of dust {{from one end of the}} building to the other, because the menial staff are numerous enough to keep everything clean, and the Curator's office is a veritable office--not a shed or a bath-room, or a <b>loose-box</b> partitioned from the main building. These things are so because money has been spent on the Museum, and it is now a rebuke to all other Museums in India from Calcutta downwards. Whether it is not too good to be buried away in a native State is a question which envious men may raise and answer as they choose. Not long ago, the editor of a Bombay paper passed through it, but having the interests of the Egocentric Presidency before his eyes, dwelt more upon the idea of the building than its structural beauties; saying that Bombay, who professed a weakness for technical education, should be ashamed of herself. And he was quite right.|$|E
6000|$|In a large <b>loose-box</b> {{at the end}} of {{the north}} wing Barbara's {{favourite}} chestnut hunter, all but one saving sixteenth of whom had been entered in the stud book, having heard her footstep, was standing quite still with his neck turned. He had been crumping up an apple placed amongst his feed, and his senses struggled between the lingering flavour of that delicacy,--and the perception of a sound with which he connected carrots. When she unlatched his door, and said [...] "Hal," [...] he at once went towards his manger, to show his independence, but when she said: [...] "Oh! very well!" [...] he turned round and came towards her. His eyes, which were full and of a soft brilliance, under thick chestnut lashes, explored her all over. Perceiving that her carrots were not in front, he elongated his neck, let his nose stray round her waist, and gave her gauntletted hand a nip with his lips. Not tasting carrot, he withdrew his nose, and snuffled. Then stepping carefully so as not to tread on her foot, he bunted her gently with his shoulder, till with a quick manoeuvre he got behind her and breathed low and long on her neck. Even this did not smell of carrots, and putting his muzzle over her shoulder against her cheek, he slobbered a very little. A carrot appeared about the level of her waist, and hanging his head over, he tried to reach it. Feeling it all firm and soft under his chin, he snuffled again, and gave her a gentle dig with his knee. But still unable to reach the carrot, he threw his head up, withdrew, and pretended not to see her. And suddenly he felt two long substances round his neck, and something soft against his nose. He suffered this in silence, laying his ears back. The softness began puffing on his muzzle. Pricking his ears again, he puffed back a little harder, with more curiosity, and the softness was withdrawn. He perceived suddenly that he had a carrot in his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|So he told himself, {{but he knew}} {{thoroughly}} {{well that}} he had found his level. He had ceased to struggle against the fascination of his present surroundings. The slow, quiet comfort and interest of country life appealed with enervating force to the man whom death had half conquered. The pleasures of the chase, well-provided for in every detail, and dovetailed in with the assured luxury of a well-ordered, well-staffed establishment, were exactly what he wanted and exactly what his life down here afforded him. He was experiencing, too, that passionate recurring devotion to an old loved scene that comes at times to men who have travelled far and willingly up and down the world. He was very much at home. The alien standard floating over Buckingham Palace, the Crown of Charlemagne on public buildings and official documents, the grey ships of war riding in Plymouth Bay and Southampton Water with a flag at their stern that older generations of Britons had never looked on, these things seemed far away and inconsequent amid the hedgerows and woods and fallows of the East Wessex country. Horse and hound-craft, harvest, game broods, the planting and felling of timber, the rearing and selling of stock, the letting of grasslands, the care of fisheries, the up-keep of markets and fairs, they were the things that immediately mattered. And Yeovil saw himself, in moments of disgust and self-accusation, settling down into this life of rustic littleness, concerned over the late nesting of a partridge or the defective draining of a <b>loose-box,</b> hugely busy over affairs that a gardener's boy might grapple with, ignoring the struggle- cry that went up, low and bitter and wistful, from a dethroned dispossessed race, in whose glories he had gloried, in whose struggle he lent no hand. In what way, he asked himself in such moments, would his life be better than the life of that parody of manhood who upholstered his rooms with art hangings and rosewood furniture and babbled over the effect? ...|$|E
6000|$|Leaving {{the rock}} at last, I went towards the house. It {{was long and}} low, and rather sad, {{standing}} in a garden all mossy grass and buttercups, with a few rhododendrons and flowery shrubs, below a row of fine old Irish yews. On the stone verandah a grey sheep-dog and a very small golden-haired child were sitting close together, absorbed in each other. A woman came in answer to my knock, and told me, in a pleasant soft, slurring voice, that I might stay the night; and dropping my knapsack, I went out again. Through an old gate under a stone arch I came on the farmyard, quite deserted save {{for a couple of}} ducks moving slowly down a gutter in the sunlight; and noticing the upper half of a stable-door open, I went across, in search of something living. There, in a rough <b>loose-box,</b> on thick straw, lay a chestnut, long-tailed mare, with the skin and head of a thoroughbred. She was swathed in blankets, and her face, all cut about the cheeks and over the eyes, rested on an ordinary human's pillow, held by a bearded man in shirt-sleeves; while, leaning against the white-washed walls, sat fully a dozen other men, perfectly silent, very gravely and intently gazing. The mare's eyes were half-closed, and what could be seen of them was dull and blueish, as though she had been through a long time of pain. Save for her rapid breathing, she lay quite still, but her neck and ears were streaked with sweat, {{and every now and then}} her hind-legs quivered. Seeing me at the door, she raised her head, uttering a queer, half-human noise; but the bearded man at once put his hand on her forehead, and with a [...] "Woa, my dear, woa, my pretty!" [...] pressed it down again, while with the other hand he plumped up the pillow for her cheek. And, as the mare obediently let fall her head, one of the men said in a low voice: [...] "I never see anything so like a Christian!" [...] and the others echoed him, in chorus, [...] "Like a Christian--like a Christian!" [...] It went to one's heart to watch her, and I moved off down the farm lane into an old orchard, where the apple-trees were still in bloom, with bees--very small ones--busy on the blossoms, whose petals were dropping on to the dock leaves and buttercups in the long grass. Climbing over the bank at the far end, I found myself in a meadow the like of which--so wild and yet so lush--I think I have never seen. Along one hedge of its meandering length were masses of pink mayflower; and between two little running streams quantities of yellow water iris--"daggers," [...] as they call them--were growing; the [...] "print-frock" [...] orchis, too, was all over the grass, and everywhere the buttercups. Great stones coated with yellowish moss were strewn among the ash-trees and dark hollies; and through a grove of beeches on the far side, such as Corot might have painted, a girl was running with a youth after her, who jumped down over the bank and vanished. Thrushes, blackbirds, yaffles, cuckoos, and one other very monotonous little bird were in full song; and this, with the sound of the streams, and the wind, and the shapes of the rocks and trees, the colours of the flowers, and the warmth of the sun, gave one a feeling of being lost in a very wilderness of Nature. Some ponies came slowly from the far end, tangled, gipsy-headed little creatures, stared, and went off again at speed. It was just one of those places where any day the Spirit of all Nature might start up in one of those white gaps which separate the trees and rocks. But though I sat a long time waiting, hoping--Pan did not come.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 {{a stable}} was erected {{to the north}} of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. The Department of Agriculture and Stock Annual Report for 1910 {{described}} the building:"The stable provide four stalls, a <b>loose-box,</b> and feed-room, with a room for harness, tools, etc., and another room for small animals, specially ventilated. The manger fittings are of iron, with water-pots and hay-racks combined. The floors of stalls are laid with a special channelled stable brick, and a tramway is laid the whole length of the building with an overhead traveller for removing the carcasses of dead animals."A similar building of 12 stalls, designated as cattle byres, was erected immediately to the north but it does not survive. The total cost of the complex to October 1909 was £5,000.|$|E
40|$|Weaving {{behaviour}} {{involves the}} repetitive lateral swaying of the head, neck, forequarters and sometimes hindquarters {{of the horse}} and is generally believed to be indicative of poor welfare. The behaviour of six known weavers was recorded {{three times a day}} for 5 days in each of three different stable designs. These were a conventional <b>loose-box,</b> a conventional <b>loose-box</b> with a 1 m 2 acrylic mirror and a conventional <b>loose-box</b> in which there was a grilled 1 m 2 side window separating the resident horse from a non-weaving conspecific in an adjacent stable. Weaving and other stereotypic behaviours were significantly higher in the unmodified stable and during the late afternoon observation period. There {{was no significant difference in}} the amount of stereotypic behaviour recorded in the two modified stables. Significant differences in the behaviour patterns and location of horses during the study suggest that activity engaging with either a visual image of a horse or a hay net is associated with a reduction in weaving and other repetitive activities in the stabled horse...|$|E
