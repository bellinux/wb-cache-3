25|$|The Portrait of an American Family Tour was {{the second}} tour Marilyn Manson {{embarked}} on. It was also the band's first headlining tour under a major label. The band was on the tour from December 27, 1994 until March 11, 1995. During these concerts, the stage usually was arranged <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> room, {{much like the one}} on the album cover artwork. A table with a lamp, candy canes and multiple six-sided dice were the most commonly seen props.|$|E
25|$|The changes it {{had already}} {{undergone}} since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating {{the emergence of a}} wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.|$|E
5000|$|A jenglot [...] is a {{deformed}} humanoid {{creature in}} Indonesian culture and mythology. It {{is described as}} looking much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tiny, <b>living</b> human doll and is sometimes said to have formerly been a human being.|$|R
5000|$|Frank the Goat is LiveJournal's mascot. During {{the early}} years of the site, Frank was treated <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actual <b>living</b> being by much of the LiveJournal userbase, and his brief [...] "biography" [...] as well as his [...] "journal" [...] reflect this.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1996 {{television}} series, Walter was {{not scared}} of Dennis but instead acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> snob, <b>living</b> in <b>a</b> huge house and behaving more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spoiled brat than before. His behaviour generally resembled his pre-1970s comics behaviour, and is reflected {{again in his}} less [...] "soft" [...] modern comics roles.|$|R
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|The year 1913 saw the {{movement}} continuing to evolve. The changes {{it had already}} undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating {{the emergence of a}} wholly new cast of mind.

25|$|Of a {{different}} kind is the approach made by James Lovelock. In the 1970s he and microbiologist Lynn Margulis presented the Gaia theory or hypothesis, that states that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system. The system {{has the ability to}} react to perturbations or deviations, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature (homeostasis). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth {{may not be able to}} react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book The Revenge of Gaia, he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of greenhouse gases made by humans, is producing global warming.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Innerscope {{partnered with}} Time Warner Medialab and Temple University {{to conduct a}} study that allowed viewers to watch the Super Bowl in an {{environment}} that would resemble a live viewing of the sporting event. The research was designed to measure consumer engagement and media habits, using biometrics technology, in settings <b>like</b> <b>a</b> theater, <b>a</b> <b>living</b> room, <b>a</b> mock shopping area, and eye-tracking stations. The researchers then gave ads based on levels of biometric engagement to Temple University to measure the brain activity using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging).|$|R

2500|$|... "You {{have many}} good boys, but none {{can match the}} good {{heart and soul of}} Dominic Savio.

When he is in church he is <b>like</b> <b>an</b> angel <b>living</b> in Paradise." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{entertainment}} news site Mandatory said Partridge was [...] "a fascinatingly layered and fully realised creation {{of years of}} storytelling and a fundamentally contemptible prick — he feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> breathing person, but a living, breathing person {{that you want to}} strangle." [...] The Telegraph credited Partridge with influencing [...] "awkward" [...] sitcoms such as The Inbetweeners, Nighty Night and Peep Show, and wrote: [...] "Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character. We believe Partridge is real, from his side-parted hair down to his tasseled sports-casual loafers." [...] In 2014, Guardian writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as [...] "one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades." ...|$|E
500|$|Quatermass {{warns that}} if {{implanted}} psychic powers {{survive in the}} human race, there could also still be an ingrained compulsion to enact the [...] "Wild Hunt" [...] of a race purge, but the media event goes ahead regardless. The power cables that string into the craft fully activate {{it for the first}} time, and glowing and humming <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> thing it starts to draw upon this energy source and awaken the ancient racial programming. Those Londoners in whom the alien admixture remains strong fall under the ship's influence; they merge into a group mind and begin a telekinetic mass murder of those without the alien genes, an ethnic cleansing of those the alien race mind considers to be impure and weak.|$|E
500|$|The team {{worked to}} {{discover}} the causes and mechanics of fear, and they analyzed horror films for inspiration. [...] "Robbing the Cradle" [...] includes influences from the Silent Hill and System Shock series, from the films The Devil's Backbone, Jacob's Ladder and Session 9, and from the books House of Leaves, From Hell and The Shining. Thomas applied psychological horror techniques that he hoped would stay with the player even after the level's end. To generate fear, he used a combination of scripted sequences and unplanned, emergent factors. Every light source in the level dims and brightens at an imperceptibly slow speed, which Thomas hoped would create a [...] "subconscious sense of breathing" [...] and thereby make the Shalebridge Cradle feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> entity. Lights were programmed to flicker when approached by Puppets; however, Puppets roam the level in real-time, and so Thomas was unable to predict which lights would flicker at which times. He believed that this gave the player {{the feeling of being}} hunted.|$|E
5000|$|He has {{praised the}} Chinese government's {{policies}} in Tibet {{and has been}} strongly critical of the old Tibetan government and of the Dalai Lama. He said in an interview, [...] "I have become disappointed with the Dalai Lama," [...] and [...] "he does not behave <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reincarnated <b>living</b> Buddha but is a stooge of the Westerners." ...|$|R
50|$|A siheyuan offers space, comfort, {{quiet and}} privacy. Siheyuan walls provide {{security}} {{as well as}} protection against dust and storms. With plants, rocks, and flowers, the yard is also a garden, and acts <b>like</b> <b>an</b> open-air <b>living</b> room. The veranda divides the courtyard into several big and small spaces that are not very distant from each other. Family members talked with each other here, creating a cordial atmosphere.|$|R

500|$|Unlike Pip, the Narissa dragon {{was allowed}} {{to be more of}} a fantasy {{character}} while still looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> character and a classic Disney villain. The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a [...] "puppeteering" [...] approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each game {{level was}} devised {{by a team}} {{comprised}} on an environmental artist and level designer working collaboratively, {{as opposed to a}} workflow where the level was designed and then handed over to art teams to be detailed. Level designer Steve Gaynor recalled that by involving the level designer, they could make sure that gameplay spaces still felt like functional, real spaces, making sure that the Rapture of BioShock 2 still felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> breathing world.|$|E
60|$|If I had a {{thousand}} citizens {{in front of}} me, I {{would like to give}} them information, but you children already know all that I have found out about the Educational Alliance. It's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man <b>living</b> within thirty miles of Vesuvius and never knowing about <b>a</b> volcano. It's <b>like</b> <b>living</b> for <b>a</b> lifetime in Buffalo, eighteen miles from Niagara, and never going to see the Falls. So I had lived in New York and knew nothing about the Educational Alliance.|$|R
60|$|His {{presence}} was almost an anguish to Winifred. She prayed against it. That little cleft between his brow, that flickering, wicked, little smile {{that seemed to}} haunt his face, and above all, the triumphant loneliness, the Ishmael quality. And then the erectness of his supple body, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> symbol. The very way he stood, so quiet, so insidious, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> erect, supple symbol of life, the living body, confronting her downcast soul, was torture to her. He was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> supple <b>living</b> idol moving before her eyes, and she felt if she watched him she was damned.|$|R
30|$|Language is {{the fabric}} of human mind and a {{scientific}} study of language can provide precious understandings of neuro-cognitive processes. The study of language is differentiated on its complex levels of structuring: from informational microscopic systems, to morphological mesoscopic patterns, to semantic and narrative macroscopic pathways. The methodology we presented is mostly focused on micro and meso structures but, as language is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> complex <b>living</b> and changing organism, just as our minds are, interactions are continuously intermingling.|$|R
2500|$|From the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, an {{exhibition}} which officially introduced [...] "Cubism" [...] {{to the public}} as an organized group movement, and extending through 1913, the fine arts had evolved well beyond the teachings of Cézanne. Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, now they had been toppled. [...] "It was a total regeneration", writes Gleizes, [...] "indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realized that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it".|$|E

50|$|Prostitution in France (the {{exchange}} of sexual services for money) was legal until April 2016, but several surrounding activities were illegal <b>like</b> operating <b>a</b> brothel, <b>living</b> off the avails (pimping) and paying for sex with someone {{under the age}} of 18 (the age of consent for sex is 15).|$|R
60|$|She felt {{torn out}} of the world. There was nothing {{else in the world}} but a crimson-purple glare and sound, deafening, all-embracing, {{continuing}} sound. Every other light had gone out about her and against this glare hung slanting walls, pirouetting pillars, projecting fragments of cornices, and a disorderly flight of huge angular sheets of glass. She had an impression of a great ball of crimson-purple fire <b>like</b> <b>a</b> maddened <b>living</b> thing that seemed to be whirling about very rapidly amidst a chaos of falling masonry, that seemed to be attacking the earth furiously, that seemed to be burrowing into it <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blazing rabbit....|$|R
50|$|Lunetten is a {{neighbourhood}} in {{the southeastern}} {{part of the city}} of Utrecht, that has approximately 12.000 inhabitants. It is mainly a residential area, since there is no significant industry present. Lunetten was constructed as an urban experiment mostly during the late 1970s and 1980s. It was designed and planned by a combination of students of architecture and urban planning and the then foreseen future inhabitants. A result of this was the use of a ring-road with many circular bifurcations running back onto themselves or with dead ends. In Dutch this is called a Bloemkoolwijk ("Cauliflower-neighbourhood"). This urban setup results in the whole neighbourhood becoming <b>like</b> <b>a</b> single <b>living</b> street, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> distinct village within a city.|$|R

25|$|The architects embraced several popular Midcentury Modern design {{features}} such as geometric forms, tilted windows, a striking brick-and-glass tower, and large-scale signage. Two stone monument signs advertising the current feature stood at the driveway entrances. Exterior brick and stone were echoed in the interior, along with wood and copper, materials that reflected Midcentury residential trends. The Terrace was situated {{at the high end}} of the site with room for 1,000 cars, a nod to the automobile-centric postwar culture. The warm, elegant interiors included a sunken lounge with a copper fireplace, furnished <b>like</b> <b>a</b> luxurious <b>living</b> room of the day.|$|R
