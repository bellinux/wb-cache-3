500|$|The {{battle for}} Khâm Đức and Ngok Tavak was {{considered}} a defeat for U.S. forces, described by one historian as [...] "a Khe Sanh in reverse." [...] Unlike the previous fight at Khe Sanh, the application of American airpower [...] "averted a massacre" [...] but could not prevent the North Vietnamese from dominating the high ground surrounding Khâm Đức. General Creighton Abrams described the loss at Khâm Đức as a [...] "minor disaster". U.S. decisions at Khâm Đức may have been influenced at a higher command level {{by the events of}} Battle of Khe Sanh in 1968, which were subjected to intense media comparison with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, and the clash of operational thinking between General Westmoreland and the senior USMC generals. If there was any <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> for General Westmoreland and other U.S. commanders, the battle of Khâm Đức showed that [...] "air power was not a cure-all". The command and control system of the United States Air Force during the ordeal was imperfect, as demonstrated by the [...] "blunders involving the combat control teams." [...] A final, notable outcome of Khâm Đức was that it closed the last Special Forces CIDG camp in the I Corps Tactical Zone in close proximity to the border with Laos. This made ground surveillance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail much more difficult, allowing North Vietnam to move supplies and develop new branches of the trail. Despite setbacks, the evacuation of the Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp strongly highlighted the morale, discipline and the motivation of the U.S. Air Force personnel {{who took part in the}} operation. From the very first day of the struggle at Khâm Đức, it was clear that ground units were not prepared for an emergency evacuation, due to the lack of experience in terms of integrating the numbers and types of aircraft in such a small geographical area. U.S. aircrews had to improvise by establishing their own procedures, in order to extract both military and civilian personnel from the besieged Special Forces Camp. Despite having lost two C-130 aircraft, U.S. pilots were undeterred from completing their mission, indeed, their bravery was exemplified by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, who received a Medal of Honor for the rescue of the three-man Combat Control Team.|$|E

This is especially the case where the availability of high throughput screening techniques for the different [...] "-omics" [...] fields such as genomics, whose complexity makes them predominantly data-driven. Such data-intensive scientific discovery is by some considered to be the fourth paradigm, after empiricism, theory and computer simulation. Others reject the idea that data driven research is about to replace theory. As Krakauer et al. put it: [...] "machine learning is a powerful means of preprocessing data in preparation for mechanistic theory building, but should not be considered the final goal of a scientific inquiry." [...] In regard to cancer biology, Raspe et al. state: [...] "A better understanding of tumor biology is fundamental for extracting the relevant information from any high throughput data." [...] The journal Science chose cancer immunotherapy as the breakthrough of 2013. According to their explanation a <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> from the successes of cancer immunotherapy is that they emerged from decoding of basic biology.|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone's {{proposals}} went {{some way}} to meet working-class demands, such as the realisation of the free breakfast table through repealing duties on tea and sugar, and reform of local taxation which was increasing for the poorer ratepayers. According to the working-class financial reformer Thomas Briggs, writing in the trade unionist newspaper The Bee-Hive, the manifesto relied on [...] "a much higher authority than Mr. Gladstone...viz., the late Richard Cobden". The dissolution itself was reported in The Times on 24 January on 30 January, {{the names of the}} first fourteen MPs for uncontested seats were published; by 9 February a Conservative victory was apparent. In contrast to 1868 and 1880 when the Liberal campaign lasted several months, only three weeks separated the news of the dissolution and the election. [...] The working-class newspapers were so taken by surprise they had little time to express an opinion on Gladstone's manifesto before the election was over. Unlike the efforts of the Conservatives, the organisation of the Liberal Party had declined since 1868 and they had also failed to retain Liberal voters on the electoral register. George Howell wrote to Gladstone on 12 February: [...] "There is one <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> from this Election, that is Organization. ... We have lost not by a change of sentiment so much as by want of organised power". The Liberals received a majority of the vote in each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom and 189,000 more votes nationally than the Conservatives. However, they obtained a minority of seats in the House of Commons.|$|E

60|$|This {{small number}} of executions, and all at one time, though in {{different}} places, is seriously recommended; because {{it is certain that}} a great havoc among criminals hardens rather than subdues the minds of people inclined to the same crimes, and therefore fails of answering its purpose as an example. Men who see their lives respected and thought of value by others come to respect that gift of God themselves. To have compassion for oneself, or to care, more or less, for one's own life, is a <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> just as every other; and I believe it will be found that conspiracies have been most common and most desperate where their punishment has been most extensive and most severe.|$|E

Though in many respects debased in style, they are consummate in workmanship, and unstained in honor; there is no imperfection in them, and no dishonesty. That there is absolutely no imperfection, is indeed, as we have seen above, a proof of their being wanting in the highest qualities of architecture; but, as lessons in masonry, they have their value, and may well be studied for the excellence they display in methods of levelling stones, for the precision of their inlaying, and other such qualities, which in them are indeed too principal, yet very instructive in their particular way.|$|E

Many a hunter would have given up in disgust or despair after the first few shots were fired and it looked as if the elk were out of range and intended to keep out. But this determined young man did not give up thus easily. Hard as was that run up hill and down, and regardless of the tumbles taken, and that he was so tired he could scarcely stand, he kept on until two elk were brought down, and it was firmly settled that the third could not be captured.|$|E

60|$|The general {{character}} {{of all these}} novels may be described, in the author's own term, as psychologic realism. This means that George Eliot sought to do in her novels what Browning attempted in his poetry; that is, to represent the inner struggle of a soul, and to reveal the motives, impulses, and hereditary influences which govern human action. Browning generally stops when he tells his story, and either lets you draw your own conclusion or else gives you his in a few striking lines. But George Eliot is not content until she has minutely explained the motives of her characters and the moral <b>lesson</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> from them. Moreover, it {{is the development of}} a soul, the slow growth or decline of moral power, which chiefly interests her. Her heroes and heroines differ radically from those of Dickens and Thackeray in this respect,--that when we meet {{the men and women of}} the latter novelists, their characters are already formed, and we are reasonably sure what they will do under given circumstances. In George Eliot's novels the characters develop gradually as we come to know them. They go from weakness to strength, or from strength to weakness, according to the works that they do and the thoughts that they cherish. In Romola, for instance, Tito, as we first meet him, may be either good or bad, and we know not whether he will finally turn to the right hand or to the left. As time passes, we see him degenerate steadily because he follows his selfish impulses, while Romola, whose character is at first only faintly indicated, grows into beauty and strength with every act of self-renunciation.|$|E
