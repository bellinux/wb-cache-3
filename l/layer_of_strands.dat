40|$|Biological systems reconfigure {{their shape}} in {{response}} to external stimuli {{at the level of}} single cells, tissues, and organs, for a variety of purposes such as growth, development, and self-repair. Cell shape reconfiguration is accomplished by directing the spatial organization of molecular materials (for example, cytoskeletal proteins) through molecular circuits which sense, process, and transmit information. Embedding a similar architecture in a synthetic material may greatly advance our ability to build responsive materials which can grow, reconfigure, and self-repair. DNA and RNA are programmable biological polymers which have been used to rationally build sensors and circuits, and a variety of nanostructures. The integration of nucleic acid circuits and structures promises to yield a new class of complex, reconfigurable materials. We aim at directing assembly and disassembly of DNA nanostructures with dynamic DNA inputs and circuits, mimicking the organization of dynamic cellular materials. We focus on DNA nanotubes, and design pathways to control growth and breakage of tubes assembled from double crossover tiles. Our tiles include a toehold domain enabling strand invasion at the sticky ends of tiles. Invasion rapidly weakens the self-assembled structure, causing the nanotubes to collapse into smaller fragments. Removal of DNA species used for invasion, through second <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> displacement (denoted as anti-invasion), allows the nanotubes to reassemble isothermally. Our design thus makes it possible to control growth reversibly. We demonstrate this directed assembly process through a variety of experimental assays including optical microscopy and time-lapse movies, atomic force microscopy, and gel electrophoresis. We also characterize the influence of experimental design parameters such as toehold orientation (inside vs. outside of tube) and length, buffer conditions, and temperature, showing the overall tunability of breakage and reassembly dynamics. Here, we bridge dynamic and structural DNA nanotechnology and demonstrate the programmable, dynamic control of self-assembly of DNA nanotubes, a well-known class of micron-sized DNA nanostructures.

40|$|Within the {{priority}} program SPP 1182 of the German Research Foundation (DFG), the bond behavior <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> in ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) {{as well as}} the shear bearing behavior of pretensioned girders were investigated at the Institute of Structural Concrete at the RWTH Aachen University. This thesis deals with both of these topics. The experimental program includes 72 pull-out tests and 14 small scale beam tests to investigate the transfer length. Furthermore, 60 shear tests on pretensioned girders were carried out. Additionally, nonlinear methods were applied to derive calculation models for the bond {{as well as the}} shear behavior. The bond behavior <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> in UHPC is described with a bond model consisting of three contributions: a constant base value, a slip depending and a stress depending part of the bond strength. Similar to normal and high strength concrete, a minimum specific concrete cover c/dp = 2. 5 is required to transfer the prestressing force without splitting cracks. Using 0. 5 ’’ strands the measured transfer lengths ranged approximately between 20 and 22 cm (7. 9 and 8. 7 in.). When several <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> were arranged in girders, the transfer lengths were increased by about 20 %. The test results can be determined by the derived bond model very adequately. Altogether, 60 shear tests on pretensioned girders with and without openings in the web were carried out. The main aspects were the contributions of the steel fibers and the additional shear reinforcement to the shear capacity as well as the influences of the openings and size effects. The shear capacity of beams with steel fibers was approximately doubled or tripled compared to beams without fibers. The influence of the position and the number of openings was investigated systematically. Openings with a diameter 0. 5 d lead to a reduced shear capacity of about 75 %. Additional shear reinforcement beside the openings was adequate to nearly reach the shear capacity of beams without openings. The shear capacity of beams with several openings was similar to beams with single openings, when the distance between the openings was at least 1. 5 d. Size effects were primarily observed affecting the fiber action. While the fibers were activated favorably by a slow crack growth in beams with a small height, the sudden crack growth in higher beams leads to significantly decreased fiber efficiency. The shear capacity was described with a model based on additive terms: a contribution of the strut-and-tie model consisting of a fiber as well as a rebar part and a concrete contribution. The results of the calculation model adequately coincide with the experimental data including the own tests and further tests from literature...|$|R

These components are also used extensively in commercial construction in the US and other countries.

While it would seem logical that a structural component having double “skins ” of OSB would perform well when subjected to high lateral forces, such as those experienced during an earthquake, the US building codes have limited the use of SIPs to low to moderate seismic zones. This limitation is due to the concern that the sealants used in the manufacturing and installation of SIPs may affect their seismic performance.

While in S. aureus the uncross-linked stem peptide consists of a pentapeptide, in S. carnosus, this part of the PGN is shortened to tripeptides. Furthermore, we found the PGN composition to vary when cells were incubated under certain conditions. The collective overproduction of HlyD, FtsE and FtsX—a putative protein complex interacting with penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP 2) —caused the reappearance of classical penta stem peptides.

The strands were categorised into five strand types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, strand shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in strand dimensions in commercial material.
