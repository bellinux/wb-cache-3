5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> in {{patients}} {{results in a}} marked increase in depression. Valence asymmetry {{may be due to}} more cholinergic and dopaminergic on the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> and the right hemisphere being more noradrenergic. Patients with right hemisphere damage had reduced arousal response to painful stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Although hemispatial neglect {{has been}} {{identified}} following <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage (resulting in the neglect of {{the right side of}} space), it is most common after damage to the right hemisphere. This disparity is thought to reflect the fact that the right hemisphere of the brain is specialized for spatial perception and memory, whereas the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is specialized for language - there is redundant processing of the right visual fields by both hemispheres. Hence the right hemisphere is able to compensate for the loss of <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> function, but not vice versa.|$|E
40|$|Density {{values of}} the right and <b>left</b> <b>hemispheres</b> were {{determined}} by computerized tomography (CT scan) in 22 normal controls and 21 chronic schizophrenic patients. The data indicated that the chronic schizophrenic patients had less dense brains in both hemispheres than did control subjects. The results also found consistent density differences between the right and <b>left</b> <b>hemispheres</b> in both groups...|$|R
50|$|Joseph {{also noted}} that the patient had other {{specific}} instances of conflict between the right and <b>left</b> <b>hemispheres</b> including, the <b>left</b> hand (right <b>hemisphere)</b> carrying out actions contrary to the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere's</b> motives such as the left hand turning off the television immediately after the right hand turned it on. Joseph found that the patientâ€™s left leg would only allow the patient to return home when the patient was going for a walk and would reject continuing to go for that walk.|$|R

25|$|Research has {{indicated}} {{that women are more}} likely to be <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> dominant, and men are more likely to be right hemisphere dominant. Because of this, women recover faster from <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage, and men are more likely to recover faster from right hemisphere damage. Men who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E
25|$|While {{this theory}} seems to hold true for some emotions, this theory is {{generally}} considered outdated; however a few examples exist. For example, a study found that when subjects were primed with positive stimuli before hearing a consonant, the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> was more active than the right hemisphere. In contrast, when subjects were primed with a negative stimulus, the right hemisphere was more active than the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|In most cases, speech {{production}} {{is controlled by}} the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> In a series of studies, Wilder Penfield, among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally left-hemisphere dominant) and left-handed (generally right-hemisphere dominant) patients. They discovered that, regardless of handedness, the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural stress (hemorrhage, stroke, etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.|$|E
50|$|Other {{factors are}} {{believed}} to be relevant to language processing and verbal fluency, such as cortical thickness, participation of prefrontal areas of the cortex, and communication between right and <b>left</b> <b>hemispheres.</b>|$|R

25|$|Both hemispheres of {{the brain}} make a {{contribution}} to the McGurk effect. They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> In people that have had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> {{of the brain}}, visual features often {{play a critical role in}} speech and language therapy. People with lesions in the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.|$|E
25|$|Results from brain-imaging {{show that}} working memory tasks with visual objects {{activate}} mostly {{areas in the}} <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> whereas tasks with spatial information activate more areas in the right hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|General lesions in {{the right}} {{hemisphere}} reduce or eliminate electrodermal response (skin conductance response ((SCR)) to emotionally meaningful stimuli while the lesions in the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> do not show changes in SCR response.|$|E

25|$|It is {{currently}} believed that {{in regards to}} brain lateralization males are left-lateralized, while females are bilateralized. Studies on patients with unilateral lesions have provided evidence that females are in fact more bilateralized with their verbal abilities. It seems that when a female has experienced a lesion to the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> she is better able to compensate for this damage than a male can. If a male has a lesion in the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> his verbal abilities are greatly impaired in comparison to a control male {{of the same age}} without that damage. However, these results may also be task-dependent as well as time-dependent.|$|E
25|$|Although {{all of the}} {{diseases}} listed above are potential causes, aphasia will generally only result when there is substantial damage to the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> (responsible for language function) of the brain, either the cortex (outer layer) and/or the underlying white matter.|$|E
25|$|Language mapping is {{normally}} {{done in the}} <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain where most language areas are located, such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Cortical stimulation mapping has also identified a language area in the basal temporal cortex that was previously unknown.|$|E

30|$|Emotions are broadly {{classified}} as positive and negative, for sake of their understanding in processing in brain. Broadly, {{it is seen}} that positive emotions are processed in <b>left</b> anterior <b>hemisphere</b> (a.k.a. prefrontal cortex) of brain and negative emotions are processed in right [44]. In cases of depression, hypothesis in <b>left</b> anterior <b>hemisphere</b> hypo-arousal or right anterior hemisphere hyper-arousal leads to symptoms of depression [45]. EEG pattern supports evidence; findings shows that in cases of depression <b>left</b> anterior <b>hemisphere</b> is relatively inactive to right hemisphere [27], indicating that patients with depression have differential processing of stimuli than people without depression.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, Curtiss {{argued that}} Genie proved only {{linguistic}} stimulation could cause the lateralization of language functions, {{pointing out that}} Genie's language center had not developed in her <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> despite experiencing enough environmental stimulation to commence lateralization of other brain functions. Without this stimulation, a person would be rendered incapable of processing language from the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> {{of the brain and}} would be forced to only use the right hemisphere. The contrast between Genie's vocabulary and grammar acquisition also supported the existing hypothesis that these two processes underwent separate development during language acquisition. Genie's inability to master language despite clear progress in her cognitive development in other areas also suggested that language acquisition and cognition were separate, a new concept at the time.|$|E
25|$|As of 2002, {{there were}} 25 reports of autopsies on infants {{known to have}} FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth. The {{examination}} revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive neuroglial, leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Damage to the {{inferior}} parietal region including the anterior (supramarginal gyrus) and posterior (angular gyrus) regions resulted in reduced SCR.

25|$|In non-stuttering, normal speech, PET scans {{show that}} both hemispheres are active {{but that the}} <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> may be more active. By contrast, people who stutter yield more {{activity}} on the right hemisphere, suggesting {{that it might be}} interfering with left-hemisphere speech production. Another comparison of scans anterior forebrain regions are disproportionately active in stuttering subjects, while post-rolandic regions are relatively inactive.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and {{people who do not}} stutter. Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.|$|E
25|$|Language {{acquisition}} in multilingual {{individuals is}} contingent on two factors: {{age of the}} language acquisition and proficiency. Specialization is centered in the perisylvian cortex of the <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> Various regions of both the right and <b>left</b> <b>hemisphere</b> activate during language production. Multilingual individuals consistently demonstrate similar activation patterns in the brain when using either {{one of the two}} or more languages they fluently know. Age of acquiring the second-or-higher language, and proficiency of use determine what specific brain regions and pathways activate when using (thinking or speaking) the language. In contrast to those who acquired their multiple languages at different points in their life, those who acquire multiple languages when young, and at virtually the same time, show similar activations in parts of Broca's area and left inferior frontal lobe. If the second-or-higher language is acquired later in life, specifically after the critical period, the language becomes centralized in a different part of Broca's area than the native language and other languages learned when young.|$|E
