This {{is especially true for}} radio channels with multiple trans-mit and receive antennss, i. e. Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. This paper derives a performance hound for MIMO channel prediction. It is assumed that p r e diction is based upon estimating a model for the channel and then extrapolating that model to predict future values of the channel. A vector formulation of the Cramhr-Rao bound for functions of parameters is then used to Bnd a lower bound on the prediction error. Numerical evaluation of this bound shows that substantially longer prediction <b>lenghs</b> are pos-sible for MIMO channels than for single antenna channels. An intuitive interpretation of this result is that more of the channel structure is revealed when using multiple antenna at both ends. I...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, we {{describe}} a highly sensitive and molecular size-selective detection method for determining proteins with heteroliganded gold nanoisland on an optically transparent substrate via LSPR detection by UV-visible absorption spectrometry. To achieve this, two specific ligands of MPA and DT with different chain <b>lenghs</b> {{were used to}} fabricate nanoholes on the gold nanoisland. The thickness of the gold nanoisland and the ratio of heteroligand were optimized so as to maximize {{the sensitivity of the}} method. The area of MPA was locally activated to reactive esters to permit the binding of the protein. Upon exposure the optimized gold nanoisland to an SOD 1 solution, the limit of detection was determined to be 1.0 ng/ml, which is significantly more sensitive than other existing optical methods. Since the nanoholes may act as a sieve by virtue of their physical dimensions, the method is also molecular size-selective for SOD 1 in the presence of its aggregates. Thus, this optical spectroscopic method using heteroliganded gold nanoislands is potentially useful for the sensitive detection of small biomolecules and the molecular size-dependent screening of formulations that contain them.|$|R

In PbNCN, the cyanamide anion exhibits two different C-N bond lengths. Quantum-chemical DFT calculations {{prove that the}} cyanamide anion is comparatively easy to distort. Two modification of mercury cyanamide has been synthesized by controlling the pH value. The X-ray analysis shows that Hg atoms and the one end of NCN units form zigzag chains in HgNCN(II), and two C-N bond lengths are significantly different. In HgNCN(I) NCN unit bonds to Hg atoms from the both sides and the two C-N bond <b>lenghs</b> are almost identical. The crystal structures of Hg 2 (NCN) Cl 2 and Hg 3 (NCN) 2 Cl 2 show that there are sharing edged 20 -membered rings formed by [Hg 3 (NCN) 2] 2 + as a backbone, but the cavities of the rings are very flexible.
