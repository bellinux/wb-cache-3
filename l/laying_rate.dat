50|$|Experiments by Ando and Hartley (1982) and Simmons and Thomas (2004) {{show that}} there is a {{trade-off}} between wing morphology and reproductive ability. The macropterous individuals have an overall lower fecundity, or fertility, than the long-winged individuals. The length of a female depends on the extent of abdominal swelling due to the amount of eggs the individual is holding. The macropterous females were shorter in length than the long-winged morphs and therefore do not carry as many eggs. The number of eggs within the ovaries is the same between the two phenotypes; however, the number of eggs in production at any given time is significantly lower in extra long-winged individuals. Lowered fecundity in macropterous females is largely {{due to the fact that}} the pre-oviposition, the period between the emergence of an adult female and the start of her egg laying period, for these individuals is more than twice that of the long-winged morphs. Another cause is the lower oviposition rate that emacropterous females experience during the first half of the egg-laying period which never allows them to catch up to the normal egg <b>laying</b> <b>rate.</b> The delay in maturation and lower egg production reduces the amount of extra weight on the insect allowing it to be capable of longer flight.|$|E
50|$|Males are promiscuous; they {{disperse}} and advertise {{a territory}} that is visited by females for mating. Females are {{solely responsible for}} the rest of the reproductive effort though males have been known to stay with young chicks and seem to aid in keeping the brood together. For a nest, they scratch a depression in the ground in a bush or under a low-lying coniferous branch or fallen tree, away from other females and from the males' territories. The nest is lined with grasses, leaves, and a few feathers. Nesting season is from early May to early July. Up to 10 eggs may be laid, the usual number being 4-7. <b>Laying</b> <b>rate</b> is 1 egg every 1.4 days. Eggs are about 40 mm in length (1.5 inches) and are tawny olive or buff, marked with blotches of brown. Incubation begins with the last egg laid and lasts about 24 days. Young are about 15 g at hatching (0.5 ounces) and they are precocial; they walk out of the nest as soon as they are dry (about 8 h after hatching). They are capable of fluttering up from the ground at 1 week of age. The brood stays together and is accompanied by the hen, who broods them all night and frequently during the day until the young are 3-5 weeks old. Brooding behaviour of the female seems to be initiated by specific calls from the chicks when they are cold. At 70-100 days of age, chicks tend to leave the group and become independent.Females breed only once a year. Most females first breed at 1 year of age, but about half the males delay establishing a territory until 2 years. The species' lifespan appears to be about 5-6 years in the wild, though one study in Southwestern Alberta has found two males and one female that lived to be at least 13 years old.|$|E

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{age-specific}} fecundity {{is a key}} component of the life history of organisms and shapes their ecology and evolution. In numerous animals, including humans, reproductive performance decreases with age. Here, we demonstrate that some social insect queens exhibit the opposite pattern. Egg <b>laying</b> <b>rates</b> of Cardiocondyla obscurior ant queens increased with age until death, even when the number of workers caring for them was kept constant. Cardiocondyla, and probably also other ants, therefore resemble the few select organisms with similar age-specific reproductive investment, such as corals, sturgeons, or box turtles (e. g., [1]), but they differ in being more short-lived and lacking individual, though not social, indeterminate growth.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} influences of hybrid, feed, and housing on prevalence of keel bone fractures, but influences of behavior and production on an individual level are less known. In this longitudinal study, 80 white and brown laying hens were regularly checked for keel bone deviations and fractures while egg production was individually monitored using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) from production until depopulation at 65 weeks of age. These focal birds were kept in eight pens with 20 hens per pen in total. About 62 % of the hens had broken keel bones at depopulation. The occurrence of new fractures was temporally linked to egg laying: more new fractures occurred during the time when <b>laying</b> <b>rates</b> were highest. Hens with fractured keel bones at depopulation had laid their first egg earlier than hens with intact keel bones. However, {{the total number of}} eggs was neither correlated with the onset of egg laying nor with keel bone fractures. All birds with bumblefoot on both feet had a fracture at depopulation. Hens stayed in the nest for a longer time during egg laying during the ten days after the fracture than during the ten days before the fracture.

40|$|In various studies, chronic {{elevation}} of corticosterone levels in female birds under natural or experimental conditions resulted in female biased offspring sex ratios. In chicken, one study with injected corticosterone {{resulted in a}} male sex ratio bias. In the current study, we chronically elevated blood plasma corticosterone levels through corticosterone feeding (20 mg/kg feed) for 14 days using 30 chicken hens in each of treatment and control groups and studied the primary offspring sex ratio (here defined as the proportion of male fertile eggs determined in freshly laid eggs, i. e., without egg incubation). Mean plasma corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in the treatment group but were not associated with sex ratio, <b>laying</b> <b>rate,</b> and fertility rate. Corticosterone treatment by itself did not affect egg sex but affected sex ratio as well as <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> and fertility rate in interaction with hen body mass. Body mass had a negative association with sex ratio, <b>laying</b> <b>rate,</b> and fertility rate per hen in the corticosterone group, but a positive association with sex ratio in untreated hens. These interactions were already seen when taking the body mass {{at the beginning of}} the experiment, indicating intrinsic differences between light and heavy hens with regard to their reaction to corticosterone treatment. The effects on <b>laying</b> <b>rate,</b> fertility rate, and sex ratio suggest that some factor related to body mass act together with corticosterone to modulate ovarian functions.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to characterize the potential laying traits and underlying transcripts expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that were associated with egg production variability in five genetic stocks of chickens: two commercial lines, Red(n = 12) and Black-feather (n = 14) Taiwan country chickens (TCCs); two selected lines of TCCs, B (high body weight/comb size; n = 17) and L 2 (high-egg production; n = 14); and a commercial single comb White Leghorn (WL; n = 17). Six laying traits, age at first egg, clutch length, pause length, oviposition lag within clutch, follicle rapid growth period, and rate of yolk accumulation were measured. The significance of differential values among five chicken stocks and correlation coefficients between laying traits and number of eggs to 50 weeks of age or <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> after first egg, and the expression level of 33 transcripts were determined. Longer clutch length and shorter oviposition lag within clutch contributed to a higher number of eggs to 50 weeks of age or <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> after first egg in L 2 (P < 0. 05) and WL strains (P < 0. 05). However, their rate of yolk accumulation (P < 0. 05) and follicle rapid growth period (P < 0. 05) were different, indicating the accumulation of different alleles after long-term, independent selection. Across all five strains, numbers of eggs to 50 weeks of age were positive correlated with average clutch length (P < 0. 05) {{as well as the}} rate of yolk accumulation (P < 0. 05). Expressions of PLAGI, STMN 2, PGDS, PARK 7, ANP 32 A, PCDHA@, SCG 2, BDH and SARIA transcripts contributed to number of eggs to 50 weeks of age (P < 0. 05) or <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> after first egg (P < 0. 05). Analysis of correlation coefficients indicated that PLAGI additionally played roles in decreasing average pause length. Two transcripts, PRL and GARNL 1, specifically contributed to number of eggs to 50 weeks of age or <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> after first egg by reducing oviposition lag within clutch (P < 0. 05) and/or increasing average clutch length (P < 0. 05), respectively. Expression level of NCAM 1, contributed to <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> after first egg by association with a shorter oviposition lag within clutch (P < 0. 05). The current study attributed egg production phenotype in five strains into several laying traits; correlations between these traits and expression levels of underlying transcripts expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland were also established.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the honey production per hive and the egg <b>laying</b> <b>rates</b> of queens produced in 2007, 2008 and 2010. Thirty colonies initiated with a queen per colony at each climatic season were used during the three years. The years, started on January (summer), April (autumn), July (winter) and October (spring) and ended 12 months later, at the same periods related to each season of the later years. Honey supply were weighed before and after centrifugation to evaluate the quantity of the stored honey. Colonies with queens introduced during autumn and winter in the three years produced 57. 2 ± 6. 0 kg and 60. 7 ± 7. 5 kg of honey, respectively. In the first year of production activity, after the introduction of queens in the initial colonies, values were significantly higher than those obtained in colonies with queens introduced in the summer (39. 3 ± 7. 6 kg) and spring (41. 8 ± 3. 7 kg). Egg <b>laying</b> <b>rates</b> of queens were higher in spring (98. 2 ± 3. 9 %) and summer (88. 4 ± 7 %), indicating greater food flow (flowerings) in these seasons compared to the averages in autumn (30. 3 ± 8. 1 %) and winter (24. 5 ± 7. 2 %).

40|$|In insect societies, eggs laid {{by workers}} are {{frequently}} killed by other workers - a behaviour known as ¿worker policing¿. The traditional explanation of worker policing {{is that it}} is a mechanism to resolve intracolony conflict, and maintain the reproductive monopoly of the queen. Recently, Pirk et al. (2004) proposed that worker policing instead is aimed at removing unviable worker-laid eggs and is ultimately just another example of hygienic behaviour. Here we test this hypothesis for the common wasp Vespula vulgaris, a species with highly effective worker policing. We show that worker-laid eggs from queenless colonies have a lower hatch rate (68 %) than queen-laid eggs (82 %). Analysis of egg <b>laying</b> <b>rates</b> of queens and workers, however, shows that the difference is not big enough to explain the apparent absence of adult worker-derived males in this species...|$|R

From the first egg after molting to 50 % production the flock average 17. 6 (13. 0 - 22. 0) days and peak egg production was 77. 2 % (67. 2 - 84. 2 %) hen-day. It took the brown hen flocks an average of 34 days to reach 50 % egg production from the first day of fasting. The white flock lasted 41 days to reach 50 % production. The brown flocks reached 69 % (1. 9 - 10. 7 %) egg production above the level they had the day previous {{to the start of the}} molting program and stayed 12 (6 - 21) weeks above that <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> value. They remained for 2. 2 (0 - 8) weeks above 80 % hen-day egg production. Hen mortality average 0. 35 %/ week (0. 11 - 0. 85) during the 40 days after fasting started. These data with hens in littered floor are quite different compared to information available on force molting of flocks in cages...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the maximum inclusion levels of dietary RB with or without exogenous phytase, for laying Japanese quail. In a completely randomized design with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement, 108 quails in 36 cages received six experimental diets ad libitum from 8 to 15 week. Experimental factors were three dietary RB inclusion levels (20, 30 and 40 %) and two phytase levels (0 and 1000 FTU/kg). The level of dietary RB, phytase supplementation and their interaction had no significant effects on live weight or feed intake. The total egg production of the quail fed 40 % RB was significantly lower than that of quail fed 20 and 30 % RB. Egg <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> of the quail fed 40 % RB was significantly lower than those of the quail fed 20 or 30 % RB from 6 th week onwards. By eighth week, 30 % RB resulted in significantly lower egg <b>laying</b> <b>rate</b> compared to the quail fed 20 % RB. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the quail fed 40 % RB was significantly higher than those of 20 or 30 % RB fed. Adverse effects of phytate in 30 or 40 % RB on egg number, egg mass and FCR were not mitigated by the supplemental phytase. It is concluded that inclusion of more than 20 % RB in the diets of laying Japanese quail reduces the production performances...|$|E

Theoretical part of the thesis aimed at masculine and feminine personality, facial and vocal traits, as well as attractiveness of these traits for other individuals. The {{second part of the}} thesis consists in an empirical experiment where <b>lay</b> judges <b>rated</b> attractiveness, masculinity-femininity, and sexual orientation of facial photos and vocal recordings of homosexual and heterosexual target men. Other method used in the study was a set of questionnaires and standardized psychological tests focusing on gender nonconformity and other traits that were presumed to relate to male sexual orientation...|$|R
