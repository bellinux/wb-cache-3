25|$|New Zealand's provincial radio {{markets are}} {{surveyed}} {{once a year}} in August and September, with survey sizes of 800 to 1000 people. The largest {{of these is the}} Waikato market, in which there are 227 thousand people and 79.7 percent of people <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> each week. Locally founded The Edge has the most listeners at 47 thousand, followed by ZM with 44 thousand listeners. Partly local The Hits has 12.2 percent market share and 33 thousand listeners, just ahead of locally founded The Rock with 12.1 percent market share and 32 thousand listeners.|$|E
25|$|Auckland is the country's largest radio market. Surveys of 3000 {{people are}} {{conducted}} {{twice a year}} to garner the listener habits of more than 1.2 million {{people who live in}} Auckland's urban centres. Due in part to high levels of peak hour commuter traffic congestion, 74.6 percent <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> on a weekly basis. Newstalk ZB has maintained a long-running first place in the ratings under successive breakfast hosts Paul Holmes and Mike Hosking, with a 13.4 percent station share and a weekly cumulative audience of 178 thousand listeners in the latest Q2-14 survey for August to September 2014.|$|E

500|$|During the 1920s, Oppenheimer {{remained}} aloof from worldly matters. He {{claimed that}} he did not read newspapers or <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio,</b> and had only learned of the Wall Street crash of 1929 some six months after it occurred while on a walk with Ernest Lawrence. He once remarked that he never cast a vote until the 1936 election. However, from 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs. In 1934, he earmarked three percent of his salary—about $100 a year—for two years to support German physicists fleeing from Nazi Germany. During the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike, he and some of his students, including Melba Phillips and Bob Serber, attended a longshoremen's rally. Oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to get Serber a position at Berkeley but was blocked by Birge, who felt that [...] "one Jew in the department was enough".|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{problems}} Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store {{at the heart of}} Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{spent most}} of his {{childhood}} in India and began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study at St. Peter's School, a British-style boarding school for boys, in Panchgani near Bombay (now Mumbai). At the age of 12, he formed a school band, The Hectics, and covered rock and roll artists such as Cliff Richard and Little Richard. It has been said that one of his formative musical influences at the time was Bollywood singer Lata Mangeshkar, but one of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said that [...] "that is a lot of rubbish. The only music he listened to, and played, was Western pop music." [...] A friend from the time recalls that he had [...] "an uncanny ability to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> and replay what he heard on piano". It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself [...] "Freddie", and in February 1963 he moved back to Zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five chapters. Each chapter {{is divided into}} five parts, each {{describing}} events {{from the perspective of}} one of the five main characters: Karen, Rick, Luke, Rachel, and Player One. The first chapter, [...] "Hour One: Cue the Flaming Zeppelin", has Karen arriving at the Toronto airport on a flight from Winnipeg to meet a man she met online. She sits on a stool at the airport hotel bar in which Rick is the bartender, Rachel is at a computer terminal, and Luke is sitting at a table drinking scotch. Rachel is there with the expectation to meet a man who can father her child and approaches Luke. Karen's date goes badly as she finds the man too assertive physically and too distant intellectually. A self-help guru, Leslie Freemont, enters with his assistant Tara to welcome Rick into his empowerment program; Leslie gives a speech to the group, takes Rick's money, and leaves. Meanwhile, oil prices rapidly increase and explosions start to occur outside. With the power unreliable, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel run to Rick's vehicle to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> Karen's date, Warren, is killed by a sniper as he runs to the group, who quickly return to the bar lounge where they barricade themselves in.|$|E
500|$|Suspects and {{witnesses}} {{in a case}} can be interrogated for information, when the interviewee responds, players are given the option to either believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying. (These options, originally presented as [...] "Truth", [...] "Doubt", or [...] "Lie", were changed to [...] "Good Cop", [...] "Bad Cop", and [...] "Accuse" [...] in the 2017 remaster, which were selected by Rockstar to [...] "more accurately reflect Phelps’ behavior when a player selects each choice".) If players accuse them of lying, they must submit evidence to prove it. When interrogating two suspects at the police station, players may decide who to charge with the crime; charging the wrong suspect affects players' end rating. Players {{have the option to}} skip past an action sequence and continue through the narrative if they fail it three times. There is also a free roam mode called [...] "The Streets of L.A.", which is unlocked after each crime desk is completed, except for the Patrol desk. In this mode, the player and his partner are allowed to free roam the city of Los Angeles. The player can replay Street Crimes, find Golden Film Reels, discover Landmarks, collect Hidden Vehicles, find Badges or just cruise around and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b>|$|E

She was a childhood fan of Boney M, composer A. R. Rahman and pop artists Michael Jackson and Madonna, also she has cited Björk as an inspiration {{and has been}} influenced by The Slits, Public Enemy, Malcolm McLaren and The Clash. Noting her early inspirations, she said [...] "When I would go to bed, I’d <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> and dream about dancing and Paula Abdul and Whitney Houston, and that’s how I fell asleep.

M.I.A. describes her music as dance music or club music for the [...] "other", and {{has been described as}} an [...] "anti-popstar" [...] for refusing to conform to certain recording industry expectations of solo artists. M.I.A. possesses the vocal range of a mezzo-soprano, [...] M.I.A.'s early compositions relied heavily on the Roland MC-505, while later M.I.A. experimented further with her established sound and drew from a range of genres, creating layered textures of instruments, electronics and sounds outside the traditional studio environment. [...] Nas, Chuck D and Krist Novoselic of Nirvana have praised her work.|$|E

500|$|From Buchanan Castle, Hess was {{transferred}} briefly to the Tower of London {{and then to}} Mytchett Place in Surrey, a fortified mansion, designated [...] "Camp Z", where he stayed for the next 13 months. Churchill issued orders that Hess was to be treated well, though he {{was not allowed to}} read newspapers or <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> Three intelligence officers were stationed onsite and 150 soldiers were placed on guard. By early June, Hess was allowed to write to his family. He also prepared a letter to the Duke of Hamilton, but it was never delivered, and his repeated requests for further meetings were turned down. Major Frank Foley, the leading German expert in MI6 and former British Passport Control Officer in Berlin, took charge of a year-long abortive debriefing of Hess, according to Foreign Office files released to the National Archives. Dr Henry V. Dicks and Dr John Rawlings Rees, psychiatrists who treated Hess during this period, note that while he was not insane, he was mentally unstable, with tendencies toward hypochondria and paranoia. Hess repeated his peace proposal to John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon, then serving as Lord Chancellor, in an interview on 9 June. Lord Simon noted that the prisoner's mental state was not good; Hess claimed he was being poisoned and was being prevented from sleeping. He would insist on swapping his dinner with that of one of his guards, and attempted to get them to send samples of the food out for analysis.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyric of the 1988 song [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] as a {{meditation}} {{on the idea of}} commitment. He later said, [...] "'s clearly about a younger version of myself and my relationship with Ali," [...] and added that by nature he was a wanderer, not a family man, and that [...] "The only reason I'm here is because I met someone so extraordinary that I just couldn't let that go." [...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} examined how drivers handle task-demands induced by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> while driving. In particular, we explored {{the traces of}} a possible cognitive strategy that might be used by drivers to cope with task-demands, namely blocking-out auditory distracters. In Study 1 (N = 15), participants <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> a radio-broadcast while watching traffic videos on a screen. Based on a recall task asking about what they had <b>listened</b> <b>to,</b> we created baseline scores reflecting the general levels of blocking-out of radio-content {{when there was no}} concurrent driving task accompanying the radio-listening. In Study 2 (N = 46), participants were asked to complete two drives in the simulator: one drive in high-complexity traffic and another in low-complexity traffic. About half of <b>the</b> participants <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> a radio-broadcast while driving, and the other half drove in silence. The radio-listeners were given the same recall task that we had used in Study 1. The results revealed that the participants who drove while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> (Study 2) recalled less material from the radio-broadcast as compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> participants who did not drive (Study 1). In addition, the participants who drove while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> recalled less talk-radio excerpts when driving in high-complexity traffic than when driving in low-complexity traffic. Importantly, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> did not impair driving performance. Together, these findings indicate that blocking-out radio-content might indeed be a strategy used by drivers to maintain their driving performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
