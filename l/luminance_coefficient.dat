40|$|Designing a {{lighting}} installation involves accounting for site-specific geometric parameters and photometric characteristics {{of both the}} light sources and the road surface. The standard tool for characterizing road surface photometry is the reduced <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> table (or R-table), as defined in the 70 's by the CIE. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that these tables are no longer representative. In this context, measuring road photometry is necessary for optimizing a {{lighting installation}} and ensuring luminance level and uniformity. Until recently, this characterization was performed in laboratory using gonio-reflectometers, which implied extracting road samples. A mobile gonio-reflectometer was developed by the Strasbourg LRPC (Regional TR Laboratory) and the LCPC to allow non-destructive, on-site measurements. The first prototype of this apparatus, achieved in 2000, is called COLUROUTE (French acronym for Road <b>Luminance</b> <b>Coefficient).</b> Its mobility enables analyzing a larger part of the road surface, enhancing the representativity of the measurement. Moreover, non-destructive testing allows monitoring photometric changes in time. The instrument complies with the CIE recommendations. In particular, the measurement of the reflected light is performed at an angle of 1 °. COLUROUTE outputs comprise the reduced <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> table (R-table), the degree of lightness Q 0 and the specularity factor S 1. COLUROUTE was patented in 2003 and has been used since then for lighting optimization by administrators and designers and also, for the characterization of innovative road surfaces. Recent developments in LED technologies led to an improved version of the apparatus. In this paper, the measurement system and methodology will be first presented. The second part will report an experimental comparison between photometric measurements obtained in-situ using COLUROUTE and in a laboratory with a gonio-reflectometer...|$|E
40|$|In night-time driving, road {{lighting}} {{is important to}} road safety. Consequently, {{it is important that}} the performance of the lighting is satisfactory, not only immediately after installation, but also over time. Therefore, the performance, which in most cases is described by the road surface luminance, should be checked regularly, using condition assessment. Condition assessment of {{road lighting}} is preferably carried out using mobile measurement equipment. However, luminance is difficult, or even impossible, to measure at speed. The luminance of a road surface is partly dependent on the illuminance and partly on the reflection properties of the surface. The first parameter should be possible to measure at speed, while the latter might be characterized by the daylight <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient,</b> which can be measured using a hand-held instrument. This report describes an attempt to predict the luminance of a road surface in road lighting from mobile measurement of illuminance and hand-held measurement of the <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> in few measurement points on the surface.

40|$|Nowadays, how to {{evaluate}} image quality reasonably {{is a basic}} and challenging problem. In view of the present no reference evaluation methods, they cannot reflect the human visual perception of image quality accurately. In this paper, we propose an efficient general-purpose no reference image quality assessment (NRIQA) method based on visual perception, and effectively integrates human visual characteristics into the NRIQA fields. First, a novel algorithm for salient region extraction is presented. Two characteristics graphs of texture and edging of the original image {{are added to the}} Itti model. Due to the normalized <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of natural images obey the generalized Gauss probability distribution, we utilize this characteristic to extract statistical features in the regions of interest (ROI) and regions of non-interest respectively. Then, the extracted features are fused to be an input to establish the support vector regression (SVR) model. Finally, the IQA model obtained by training is used to predict the quality of the image. Experimental results show that this method has good predictive ability, and the evaluation effect is better than existing classical algorithms. Moreover, the predicted results are more consistent with human subjective perception, which can accurately reflect the human visual perception to image quality...|$|R

In this paper, a novel steganography technique designed for Standard Definition Digital Television (SDTV) H. 264 /AVC encoded video sequences is presented. The algorithm introduced here makes use of the compression properties of the Context Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC) entropy encoder to achieve a low complexity and real-time inserting method. The chosen scheme hides the private message directly in the H. 264 /AVC bit stream by modifying the AC frequency quantized residual <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of intrapredicted I-frames. In order to avoid error propagation in adjacent blocks, an interlaced embedding strategy is applied. Likewise, the steganography technique proposed allows self-detection of the hidden message at the target destination.

Finally, experimental results have been assessed through objective and subjective quality measures and reveal that less visible artifacts are produced with the technique proposed by reaching PSNR values above 40. 0 [*]dB and an embedding bit rate average per secret communication channel of 425 [*]bits/sec.

In order to assure road users can drive safely at nighttime, good visual condition of the road surfaces and their traffic signs is required. The main objective of this research is to evaluate lighting condition and visual legibility in some roadways in Bandung, by determining average luminance, overall uniformity, longitudinal uniformity, and <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of road surfaces and traffic signs, and comparing with the minimum criteria. Software was used to simulate the lighting condition of the roadways and to optimize the lighting parameters. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate visual legibility of some common traffic signs, based on luminance contrast of the traffic signs’ material. Generally, lighting parameters of the observed roadways had not fulfilled the minimum standard recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. Concrete surface was also found more reflective (average <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 05 cd/m 2 /lux) than asphalt one (0. 04 cd/m 2 /lux).

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} natural scene statistic-based distortion-generic blind/no-reference (NR) image quality {{assessment}} (IQA) model that operates in the spatial domain. The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficients</b> to quantify possible losses of “naturalness ” {{in the image}} due {{to the presence of}} distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-tonoise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. A software release of BRISQUE is available online...|$|R

40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{measurement and}} subjective survey was undertaken in five underground shopping streets {{to determine the}} influence of spatial and environmental characteristics on users’ subjective loudness and acoustic comfort. The analysis on the spatial characteristics shows that the subjective loudness is higher in “street type” than in “square type” underground shopping streets when the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level (LAeq) is relatively high (75 dBA). Acoustic comfort is higher in “square type” than in “street type” underground shopping streets where LAeq is relatively low (55 dBA).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the interaction between the Volvo Lane Departure Warning System (LDW) and the road markings. LDW is based on a digital camera which basically registers what the driver 9 ̆ 2 s eyes see. This implies that the road markings must be visible, i. e. there must be a certain level of the contrast between the road markings and the road surface to LDW to work. The visibility of the road markings in daylight conditions is quantified by the daylight <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> and in darkness, in head-light illumination, by the retroreflectivity. An essential question to answer was what level these two variables must meet to make the LDW to work. Is it good enough to fulfil the demands in the regulations? Another question to answer was to what extent the LDW gives undesired or incorrect alarms. Such malfunctions may cause the driver to switch off the system and should therefore not occur. The study has been accomplished in the field on public roads which were defined in advance. These roads were chosen so that several types of road markings - profiled as well as flat, new as well as worn - were tested. This fact meant that some of the road markings had good visibility in most light and weather conditions, while others were almost invisible, at least in darkness and in rain. The whole test road was 88 km long, with start and stop in Linköping. A Volvo S 80 equipped with a LDW device was driven on the road in different weather and light conditions. During the journey, the accessibility, from which the frequency of missing alarms could be estimated, was registered. Furthermore, undesired and incorrect alarms were noted manually.

40|$|With {{respect to}} traffic, {{roadworks}} are to an ever increasing extent performed during the dark hours. In these cases, lighting {{is a critical}} factor to consider. It {{is important that the}} road-user experiences good visual guidance past the road work area and {{that he or she is}} not bothered by glare from road work lighting, reflections in the roadway and other things. The safety and road work lighting should at the same time be good for the roadworker. This report reports on a pre-study of the joint Nordic project Störande ljus vid vägarbeten om natten (Disturbing lights during roadworks at night). The purpose of the project is to improve the safety both for road-users passing a roadwork area in the dark and for the persons working at the roadwork area. This particularly applies to night-time roadworks on major roads. In the main project, the disturbance that the different elements - flashing lights, vehicle lighting, electric fittings, reflections, etc. - cause the driver passing the roadwork area will be investigated, both separately and combined with each other. The project should lead to proposals for improvement and co-ordination of current regulations in the Nordic countries. Reflections in the roadway, especially when the roads are wet, can be experienced as problematic for the road-users. If the road surface is damp, glare occurs, for example from oncoming vehicle headlights or from flashing lights and signs by the road work area. In this pre-study, an investigation of the specular reflection in some typical Nordic road surfaces has been made, aimed to form the basis for planning the main study. The purpose with the pre-study has principally been to survey what values of specular reflection, retroreflection and <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> are common for road surfaces in the Scandinavian countries Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Finland, which originally should also have been part of the study, has been excluded due to resource and time limits, for the present.

The Nighttime Visibility Meter Tool addresses secondary highways devoid of roadway lighting. It is based on a conventional driving scenario, a standard computational target visibility model, and a widely used retroreflectivity monitoring apparatus. It takes pavement retroreflected <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> profiles as input, and produces small target visibility distance profiles as output. Such profiles can serve to locate local discontinuities where an obstacle on the roadway might surprise the drivers at night under headlight illumination. The Nighttime Visibility Meter Tool can take disability glare from headlight of oncoming traffic into account. Preliminary tests have demonstrated it can benefit road inspection, but as it is based on a conventional scenario, it relies on somehow arbitrary assumptions which still need to be validated, and its output needs to be calibrated in field experiments. The Glare Meter Tool was designed for in the field assessment of the level of glare from headlights of opposing vehicles in a variety of situations, without relying on subjective reports of observers. Both disability glare and discomfort glare were addressed. The net result is an instrument that is capable of acquiring an image of a scene with glare, then analyzing the image to output a number on the standard, widely-used De Boer Rating Scale for Evaluation of Discomfort Glare, and also an equivalent veiling luminance {{that can be used to}} assess the level of disability glare. The Glare Meter Tool has been demonstrated to provide accurate results in both laboratory and field experiments, but at the current level of development, its practical use in the field is compromised by dynamic range limitations and exposure time requirements. The Night Time Visibility Meter Tool is intended for monitoring whole itineraries to detect potentially low visibility situations, while the Glare Meter Tool is intended for accurately assessing the severity of glare at pre-identified spots. They complement each other because the Visibility Meter can help decide where to deploy the Glare Meter Tool. This is the reason why disability glare was introduced into the Visibility Meter Tool, while it originally considered situations without oncoming vehicles, and into the Glare Meter Tool, while it originally considered discomfort glare only.

40|$|Road {{lighting}} {{is intended to}} improve the comfort and safety of road users at night by increasing visibility levels. This purpose is best achieved by ensuring certain luminance levels and uniformities on the pavement. The luminance distribution depends on the photometric properties of both the luminaries and the pavement. Hence, the reflection properties of the pavement {{must be taken into}} account when designing a road lighting installation (CIE 66 - 1984; CIE 140 - 2000). For road lighting purposes, pavement reflection properties are specified by means of the reduced <b>luminance</b> <b>coefficient</b> r, given in a two dimensional table for a number of standardized combinations of the lighting angle g and the reflection angle b. This so called r-table is difficult to determine, so standard tables have been introduced to facilitate lighting calculations, based on a classification of dry road surfaces with respect to their degree of lightness Q 0 and their degree of specularity S 1. The four-class system R is used in France; other countries may use different systems, but even the most recent dates from the late 70 s'. Thus the values contained in the standard tables are characteristic of materials that were used decades ago. Practices in road construction have changed since that time, and new pavement materials have been used. So whether the standard data still applies to current road surfaces is a relevant question (Brusque et al, 1997; Fotios et al, 2006). To investigate on that question, the LCPC organized a series of in situ measurements to gather up-to-date data on the reflection properties of typical pavement materials, and how these properties evolve over time. Samples were taken periodically over a period of up to three years, on road sections which had been re-surfaced for that purpose. Laboratory measurements were performed by the LRPC of Clermont-Ferrand, using a CIE-compliant goniophotometer (CIE 66 - 1984). The resulting photometric data was analysed in terms of lightness and specularity to estimate the influence of several factors: material type, aggregate size and colour, and age. Very thin bituminous concretes are most common in France. They have high specularity values (R 4) at the young age, which rapidly decrease in the first few months. After three years, they end up fairly or slightly specular (R 3 or R 2), and even diffuse for those with white aggregates (R 1). Porous asphalts evolve in a similar way (from R 1 to R 3 or R 2), only they stabilize faster, and they are much darker. Surface dressings on the other hand are quite diffuse at the start (R 1), but their specularity increases over time. They end up more or less specular (R 3 or R 2), depending on the size of the aggregates, after about two years. Measured r-tables were also graphically compared to the standard tables of the corresponding class. Two types of discrepancies were observed. In some cases, particularly for diffuse materials, the tables only differed by their lightness value. But in other cases, the shape of the r-body itself differed, even after scaling the standard r-table to match lightness values. As a conclusion, there is no doubt that the reflection properties of current pavement materials in France have diverged from the standard tables. The economic impact of this discrepancy has been demonstrated by the CERTU (Chain et al, 2007) ...|$|E
