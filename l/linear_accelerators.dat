25|$|Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) based image guided {{systems have been}} integrated with medical <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> to great success. With improvements in flat-panel technology, CBCT {{has been able to}} provide volumetric imaging, and allows for radiographic or fluoroscopic monitoring throughout the treatment process. Cone beam CT acquires many projections over the entire volume of interest in each projection. Using reconstruction strategies pioneered by Feldkamp, the 2D projections are reconstructed into a 3D volume analogous to the CT planning dataset.|$|E
25|$|Currently, certain {{radiation}} therapy techniques employ {{the process of}} intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). This form of radiation treatment uses computers and <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> to sculpt a three-dimensional radiation dose map, specific to the target's location, shape and motion characteristics. Because {{of the level of}} precision required for IMRT, detailed data must be gathered about tumour locations. The single most important area of innovation in clinical practice is the reduction of the planning target volume margins around the location. The ability to avoid more normal tissue (and thus potentially employ dose escalation strategies) is a direct by-product of the ability to execute therapy with the most accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{cyclotron}} was {{an improvement}} over the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> (linacs) that were available when it was invented, being more cost- and space-effective due to the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field. In the 1920s, {{it was not possible}} to generate the high power, high-frequency radio waves which are used in modern linacs (generated by klystrons). As such, impractically long linac structures were required for higher-energy particles. The compactness of the cyclotron reduces other costs as well, such as foundations, radiation shielding, and the enclosing building. Cyclotrons have a single electrical driver, which saves both money and power. Furthermore, cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target, so the average power passed from a particle beam into a target is relatively high.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{external}} beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> which generate high energy x-rays. 2DXRT mainly {{consists of a}} single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. Conventional refers {{to the way the}} treatment is planned or simulated on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired plan. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning {{to such an extent that}} tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.|$|E
2500|$|For example, modern high-energy X-rays {{produced}} by <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> for megavoltage treatment in cancer often have higher energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do most classical gamma rays {{produced by}} nuclear gamma decay. One {{of the most}} common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in diagnostic nuclear medicine, technetium-99m, produces gamma radiation of the same energy (140 keV) as that produced by diagnostic X-ray machines, but of significantly lower energy than therapeutic photons from linear particle accelerators. In the medical community today, the convention that radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type referred to as [...] "gamma" [...] radiation is still respected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{klystron}} was {{the first}} significantly powerful source of radio waves in the microwave range; before its invention the only sources were the Barkhausen-Kurz tube and split anode magnetron, which were limited to very low power. It was invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford University. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937. [...] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of US and UK researchers working on radar equipment. The Varians went on to found Varian Associates to commercialize the technology (for example, to make small <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> to generate photons for external beam radiation therapy). Their work built on the description of velocity modulation by A. Arsenjewa-Heil and Oskar Heil (wife and husband) in 1935, though the Varians were probably unaware of the Heils' work.|$|E

40|$|A {{classical}} linear {{theory is}} used to compare large synchrotron sources to a rf <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> employed as a VUV/X-ray source. Comparisons are made on a per-pulse basis. It is demonstrated that the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> as an X-ray source is comparable to large synchrotron accelerators with wiggler insertion devices at the experiment. Applications to lithography, X-ray microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and detector calibration are examined. Excluding lithography, the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> with an appropriate laser source is a useful source of X rays for these applications. As verification, classical results are compared with quantum mechanical results and are shown {{to be in good}} agreement...|$|R
2500|$|The spiral {{path of the}} {{cyclotron}} beam {{can only}} [...] "sync up" [...] with klystron-type (constant frequency) voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying Newton's laws of motion. If the particles become fast enough that relativistic effects become important, the beam becomes out of phase with the oscillating electric field, and cannot receive any additional acceleration. The classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent {{of the speed of}} light. To accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the pole pieces as in the isochronous cyclotrons, operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the synchrocyclotrons, either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines. Cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex synchrotron or modern, klystron-driven <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators,</b> both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.|$|E
2500|$|Russell and Sigurd founded Varian Associates in 1948, {{along with}} Hansen and Ginzton. They {{initially}} created {{the company to}} commercialize the klystron and develop other technologies, such as small <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> to generate photons for external-beam radiation therapy. [...] They also were interested in nuclear magnetic resonance technology. [...] Russell's wife, Dorothy, was also active {{in the development of}} the company and its operations. The Articles of Incorporation were filed on April20,1948, and signed by nine directors: Ginzton, who had worked with the Varian brothers since his days as a doctoral student; Hansen, Richard M. Leonard, an attorney; Leonard I. Schiff, then head of the physics department at Stanford; H. Myrl Stearns, Russell, Dorothy, Sigurd and Paul B. Hunter. The company began with six full-time employees: the Varian brothers, Dorothy, Myrl Stearns, Fred Salisbury, and Don Snow. Technical and business assistance came from several members of the faculty at Stanford University, including Ginzton, Marvin Chodorow, Hansen, and Leonard Schiff. Francis Farquhar, an accountant and friend of Russell's from the Sierra Club, later became a director, as did Frederick Terman, Dean of Engineering at Stanford, and David Packard, of Hewlett-Packard. [...] Russell served as the company President and a board member until his death; Sigurd served as Vice president for engineering, and served on the Board of Directors until his death, sometimes serving as Chairman of the Board. After the deaths of both Varian brothers, Ginzton became the company's CEO.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> emit {{high energy}} X-rays; {{the process is}} usually {{referred}} to as [...] "X-ray therapy" [...] or [...] "photon therapy." [...] The term [...] "gamma ray" [...] is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called [...] "gantry") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the [...] "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of {{the movements of the}} gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue {{that is going to be}} irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of collimators. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40mm in 5mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. [...] Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.|$|E
