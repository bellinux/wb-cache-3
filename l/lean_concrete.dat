50|$|The {{ultimate}} strength of concrete {{is influenced by}} the water-cementitious ratio (w/cm), the design constituents, and the mixing, placement and curing methods employed. All things being equal, concrete with a lower water-cement (cementitious) ratio makes a stronger concrete than that with a higher ratio. The total quantity of cementitious materials (portland cement, slag cement, pozzolans) can affect strength, water demand, shrinkage, abrasion resistance and density. All concrete will crack independent of whether or not it has sufficient compressive strength. In fact, high Portland cement content mixtures can actually crack more readily due to increased hydration rate. As concrete transforms from its plastic state, hydrating to a solid, the material undergoes shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage cracks can occur soon after placement but if the evaporation rate is high they often can actually occur during finishing operations, for example in hot weather or a breezy day.In very high-strength concrete mixtures (greater than 70 MPa) the crushing strength of the aggregate can be a limiting factor to the ultimate compressive strength. In <b>lean</b> <b>concretes</b> (with a high water-cement ratio) the crushing strength of the aggregates is not so significant. The internal forces in common shapes of structure, such as arches, vaults, columns and walls are predominantly compressive forces, with floors and pavements subjected to tensile forces. Compressive strength is widely used for specification requirement and quality control of concrete. Engineers know their target tensile (flexural) requirements and will express these in terms of compressive strength.|$|R

A conceptual pavement model was examined using <b>lean</b> cement <b>concrete</b> as the sandwiched material.

Three different replacement levels namely 0 %, 10 % and 20 % are chosen for the study concern. Long range of curing periods starting from 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, 90 days and 300 days are considered in the present study. Permeability of concrete is measured in terms of current passing through it at 14 days curing. The compressive strength of the concrete with 10 % RHA has been increased significantly and for up to 20 % replacement level could be beneficially without adversely affecting the strength.

40|$|<b>Lean</b> <b>concrete</b> has, {{on account}} of its high stiffness, {{excellent}} load-spreading properties when used as a roadbase material in flexible pavements, although on the same account, appreciable stresses arise when movements are restrained by the subgrade or sub-base. Consequently, owing to the low tensile strength of the material, temperature falls result {{in the formation of}} cracks which, if sufficiently wide, may be transmitted through the superimposed bituminous surfacing. Developments in the design of flexible pavements and in the specification and use of <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> roadbases are reviewed, followed by a consideration of the causes of cracking. Expressions for the spacing and width of cracks resulting from restrained thermal contraction of a cementitious roadbase are derived in terms of the temperature fall, material properties and a constant frictional coefficient, in order to identify the critical parameters involved in each case. Thermal movement measurements were carried out on a number of cement stabilised materials in various moisture conditions and an apparatus which would cause cracking of <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> by restrained thermal movement was designed and built. A programme of tests was devised principally to determine the susceptibility of the material to cracking as a function of age, the results indicating that cracking in <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> roadbases is likely to occur within one day of placing. Additional tests were carried out to investigate the effects of inadequate compaction, the use of mixes of higher water content and cement content and the incorporation of steel fibres. It was found that mixes of increased tensile strength were more resistant to cracking, especially at early ages, but that they ultimately give rise to wider cracks which {{would be more likely to}} reflect through the bituminous surfacing.

Boats used by fishermen and to transport goods {{as well as}} people across Indonesia's many islands are mainly small to medium sized timber boats of up to 30 gross weight tonnes (GWT). Large sized timber beams are needed for the boat keel and frames. However, since 2007 logging was banned in the Nanggroe Aceh Darusalam (NAD) region. This has resulted in scarcity and increased timber costs for conventional timber boat builders in the area. Hence other suitable substitute materials, in lieu of timber, should be explored to build fishermen's purse seine boats. In this study, we explore an innovative use of reinforced concrete as substitute for large size timber keel and boat hull frames of purse seine fishermen boats. As far as we are aware, this type of exploration study specific for purse seine boats in NAD is unprecedented. Our analysis indicates that using concrete frame provides better stability and adds to the boat's strength as well as extends its life use. Further, reinforced concrete can be a more cost efficient material to substitute for boat timber frame. <b>Leaner</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> beams can be used compared to timber beams. The cost savings of using concrete for the boat frame in lieu of timber frame is estimated to be around 15 %. Construction time to build a boat using reinforced concrete frame can be reduced by almost half compared to conventional timber frame boat of the same size. The findings of this exploratory study can contribute to enrich innovations in civil engineering construction, sustain the traditional purse seine boat building industry, and ultimately the livelihood of fishermen in NAD region. Findings can also be potentially further explored for application to other type of traditional timber boat construction for inter-island sea transportation services of goods and people in Indonesia, and perhaps also for other archipelago developing nations as well...|$|R

En la antigüedad los médico-filósofos juzgaban la enfermedad como desviación de la norma y la salud como equilibrio, armonía o isonomía de las fuerzas de lo húmedo, lo seco, lo frío, lo caliente, etc. Posteriormente la medicina, notablemente influenciada por la filosofía positivista, se inclina hacia lo concreto y observable, centrándose en los procesos biológicos del organismo. Actualmente la Bioética estudia los valores humanos relacionados con la vida y la salud.

It is <b>leaned</b> toward the <b>concrete</b> and observable thing, being centered in biological processes of the organism. Today, the bioethic stedies the haman values related with life and health. The medical axiology is a discipline that systematizes the values that base the medical activity, strating from a synthesis of the knowledge that integrates the scientific interconnection of the medical sciences, the ethical thing (regulation of the relationship doctor-patient- community) and the valuable of the cultural aspect.

40|$|New road {{infrastructure}} projects {{are important and}} constitute of large investments that have to serve the society for a long time. The investments have to be durable at the lowest life cycle cost and the pavements have to sustain loads from increasing traffic intensity and heavy traffic loads. In Sweden less than 1 ‰ of the national road network consists of concrete pavements. In parts of Europe and in the U. S., on the other hand, concrete roads are used {{to a large extent}} for highways as well as rural roads. To encourage the competition between different road materials in Sweden, the tools for designing robust concrete pavements have to be brought forward. In order to emphasize plain concrete pavements as an alternative in road construction, the design must also be competitive. The current Swedish design method for concrete pavements is straightforward but offers no flexibility when designing roads with, for instance higher traffic loads. The method calculates concrete thicknesses on the conservative side since {{only a limited number of}} parameters are treated. Modern methods that take into account many more parameters in the design are being developed internationally. For a new Swedish design method, these parameters have to be established for actual conditions in Sweden. Also, the design has to be flexible and meet the demands from contractors and clients for a wider use. The aim of this project is to develop a new design method for plain concrete pavements that is more flexible than today. A new design method is also intended for the Swedish Road Administrations’ (SRA) computer based public design guide, PMS Objekt. Information for a new design method has been assembled mainly by investigating two newly developed design methods, VENCON 2. 0 in the Netherlands, and the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) in the USA. Comparative calculations between the Swedish design method and the MEPDG are presented. The comparison is made on the level of input parameters and highlights the advantageous aspects of a semi-mechanistic design procedure where the functional properties of a concrete pavement are calculated incrementally over the design period. Plain and <b>lean</b> <b>concrete,</b> separately, but also the in composite beams, have been studied in flexural fatigue testing. The results show that Tepfers’ fatigue criterion is valid for both plain and <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> when subjected to flexural fatigue loading. The results also show that the fatigue strength of composite beams of plain and <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> is mainly dependent on the strength of the <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> but that Tepfers’ fatigue criterion is applicable. The bond between plain in <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> is found to be strong and fatigue resistant, making the composite section able to accommodate higher stresses. The bond nevertheless contributes to the risk for reflection cracks in the plain concrete wear layer and a recommendation to focus on stresses in the bottom of the <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> is formulated. Also, well distributed expansion joints in the <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> are necessary. A new project for measuring temperature gradients for use in concrete pavement design is also presented. This is done with means of concrete prisms placed in the pavement and are done in order to establish actual temperature gradients for various locations in Sweden. Also, the nonlinear gradients that act in the pavement as well as the negative temperature gradients will be analysed for the use in the design. Finally, the thesis outlines a new design method for Swedish conditions. The method is possible to develop gradually and is based on FE-analysis for fast computations. In the design, stresses from traffic and temperature loads are calculated simultaneously in a number of critical locations in the concrete slab. The method will also make it possible to alter design features as slab lengths and widths, with various connections between the slabs. QC 2010113...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} {{of the behavior of}} a concrete road under fatigue loading is vital for the design and the performance prediction. A <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> sub base is used, especially in case of higher traffic intensity, for concrete roads for effective distribution of stresses in the pavement and sub grade. But there are apprehensions regarding utilization of bond between pavement quality concrete and <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> for design of rigid pavements. The present investigation presents a study on behavior of high volume fly ash concrete composite sections under flexural fatigue loading. A cement replacement level of 60 % with low calcium fly ash was used for both pavement and lean concretes. A total number of 50 composite beam sections were tested under constant amplitude non reversed cyclic loading. Fatigue life distribution followed lognormal distribution at all the stress levels. Relation between stress level and fatigue life was developed for composite section. Bond between two layers of concretes proved to be beneficial from the criteria of load carrying capacity and fatigue behavior...|$|E

Abstract: This research explored the variation of bond-breaking effect with variety of bond-breaking layers installed between the concrete pavement surface slabs and the <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> (LCB) base, {{in order to}} offer parameters for structure analysis of pavements with bond-breaking layers and to optimize the selection of bond-breaking layers for the practical road engineering projects.

Bond-breaking media applied in this research include the 3 cm asphalt concrete (AC), 1 cm emulsified asphalt slurry seal (EASS), geotextile and emulsion wax curing agent (EWCA). The findings from the field tests for bonding stress between slab-base layers indicated that EASS and EWCA did better than geotextile in reducing friction or bonding stres...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 855 on 06. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) A {{large proportion of}} the U. K. highway network constructed in the 1960 's and 1970 's contains <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> roadbase with bituminous surfacing. Pavements containing relatively high strength <b>lean</b> <b>concrete</b> have rarely required structural maintenance (thick overlay or reconstruction) but have required maintenance because of reflection cracking where the surfacing cracks above cracks in the <b>lean</b> <b>concrete.</b> The time of appearance of this cracking is very variable (2 - 20 years). Field observations indicate that roadbase transverse crack spacings are often greater than 5 m. Reflection cracking at these long spacings can be caused by thermal stresses. This project identifies conditions under which thermal reflection cracking will occur and develops a predictive model that allows estimation of the combined effect of thermal and traffic stresses. Finite element analyses indicate that initial crack development is likely to be caused by thermal stresses and final cracking will be assisted by traffic stresses. A temperature model has been developed to determine roadbase daily temperature range and surfacing temperature on a mean monthly basis. Thermal reflection cracking is considered to result from daily cycle fatigue rather than an extreme low temperature mechanism. A test rig has been developed to apply cyclic crack opening movements and simulative tests have been accelerated to 0. 1 Hz by using a "bitumen stiffness", fatigue criterion. Finite element results, displacements recorded during tests and tensile creep tests to determine mix stiffness, enable dc/dN and K 1 values and material constants (A, n) to be determined. This fracture mechanics interpretation of test results serves as the basis of the predictive model for thermal reflection cracking that is consistent with observations from an untrafficked road. The combined estimate of thermal and traffic stresses cannot however explain reflection cracking at < 5 m spacings. This cracking apparently initiates at the surface and is probably influenced by other mechanisms. University of Birmingham, the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), U. K. and Devon and Cornwall County Council Highways Department...|$|E
