40|$|A major {{challenge}} in today's {{world is the}} Big Data problem, which manifests itself in Web and Mobile domains as rapidly changing and heterogeneous data streams. A data-mining system {{must be able to}} cope with the influx of changing data in a continual manner. This calls for <b>Lifelong</b> Machine <b>Learning,</b> which in contrast to the traditional one-shot learning, should be able to identify the learning tasks at hand and adapt to the learning problems in a sustainable manner. A foundation for <b>lifelong</b> machine <b>learning</b> is transfer learning, whereby knowledge gained in a related but different domain may be transferred to benefit learning for a current task. To make effective transfer learning, it is important to maintain a continual and sustainable channel in the life time of a user in which the data are annotated. In this talk, I outline the <b>lifelong</b> machine <b>learning</b> situations, give several examples of transfer learning and applications for <b>lifelong</b> machine <b>learning,</b> and discuss cases of successful extraction of data annotations to meet the Big Data challenge...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> Society {{operates}} {{programs that}} serve the educational interests {{of more than}} 19,000senior citizens by providing classes focusing on subjects of specific interest, and audit options for regular university classes. Under the university's Commercial Music Program, Hoot/Wisdom Recordings was created in 2002, enabling students to work in all creative and business aspects of the music industry. This program generated music that landed a Top 10spot on the Billboard's Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles Sales Chart during its first week of release. The university's two-story trading room simulator, located in the College of Business, provides hands-on financial education using 25dual-monitor computers and can accommodate 50people at one time. A second lab provides full audio/visual connectivity and 25additional workstations. Florida Atlantic allows local financial businesses to use the Trading Room for training.|$|E

5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) {{launched}} {{a project to}} provide comprehensive support for autistic Singaporeans, which included plans {{to set up the}} first autism-focused special school in Singapore. The ARC collaborated with the Rainbow Centre over a period of five months to renovate the temporary campus, recruit school staff, decide on the school values and develop the school programmes. After opening in 2004 with 10 teachers and 41 students, Pathlight School conducted charity walks, merchandise sales and other events to raise funds for the introduction of more programmes for an expanding intake. In 2007, two teachers from Pathlight School won the inaugural Most Outstanding Special Education Teacher Award and Most Innovative Special Education Teacher Award, given by the Singaporean Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service. In 2009, the Autism Association of Singapore {{launched a}} second autism-focused special school, Eden School, and the two schools formed a partnership. The following year, Pathlight School moved to its permanent campus and announced plans to develop student internship programmes, build an information technology centre, and set up a <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> club for alumni.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Open-ended {{systems and}} unknown {{dynamical}} environments present {{challenges to the}} traditional machine learning systems, {{and in many cases}} traditional methods are not applicable. <b>Lifelong</b> reinforcement <b>learning</b> is a special case of dynamic (process-oriented) reinforcement learning. Multi-task learning is a methodology that exploits similarities and patterns across multiple tasks. Both can be successfully used for open-ended systems and automated learning in unknown environments. Due to its unique characteristics, lifelong reinforcement presents both challenges and potential capabilities that go beyond traditional reinforcement learning methods. In this article, we present the basic notions of <b>lifelong</b> reinforcement <b>learning,</b> introduce the main methodologies, applications and challenges.
