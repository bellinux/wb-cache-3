5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting <b>laser</b> <b>energy.</b> Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E

Laser-induced defects are investigated by UV spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectra and correlated to the structural modifications {{in the glass}} matrix through Raman spectroscopy. Results show that, for laser fluence below laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT), the absorbance and intensity of fluorescence bands increase with <b>laser</b> <b>energies</b> and/or number of laser pulses, which indicates that laser-induced defects are enhanced by <b>laser</b> <b>energies</b> and/or number of laser pulses in vacuum.

25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> applied during vitreolysis treatment does not simply break the floater into smaller pieces. Instead, the <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> converts the floater material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.) The end result is that the floater is removed and/or reduced to a size that no longer impedes vision.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{floaters}} treated during a treatment session {{depends on the}} type of floater(s) and the <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> required to treat the floater(s) (that is, to convert the floater material into a gas). During treatment, the ophthalmologist will monitor the level of <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> used for each shot, as well as the total amount of energy delivered to the eye. In order to ensure safe, effective treatment with minimal patient discomfort, if these energy levels fall outside a predetermined range then any remaining floaters will need to be treated in a subsequent treatment session.|$|E

The spectra were measured using seven different <b>laser</b> excitation <b>energies.</b> For cathodic charging we observed bleaching of the Ag(2) mode independent of <b>laser</b> excitation <b>energy.</b> On the other hand for anodic charging the behavior of the Ag(2) mode was dependent on <b>laser</b> excitation <b>energy.</b> The intensity of the Ag(2) mode decreased only for the 1. 16 eV <b>laser</b> excitation <b>energy.</b> In the case of other <b>laser</b> excitation <b>energies</b> (2. 70, 2. 60, 2. 54, 2. 41, 2. 33, 2. 18 eV) an increase of intensity has been observed. The dependence of the slope of the intensity on the electrode potential has been found to be a function of <b>laser</b> excitation <b>energy.</b> Observation of the upshift of the Ag(2) frequency supported by first principles calculations suggests that only a small amount of charge penetrates the nanotube, resulting in partial charge on the encapsulated fullerenes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{commercial}} butane micron troch {{was used to}} enhance plasma optical emissions in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Fast imaging and spectroscopic analyses were used to observe plasma evolution in the atmospheric pressure for LIBS without and with using a micro torch. Optical emission intensities and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as functions of delay time were studied. Enhanced optical emission and SNRs were obtained by using a micro torch. The effects of <b>laser</b> pulse <b>energy</b> on the emission intensities and SNRs were studied. The same spectral intensity could be obtained using micro torch with much lower <b>laser</b> pulse <b>energy.</b> The investigation of SNR evolution with delay time at different <b>laser</b> pulse <b>energies</b> showed that the SNR enhancement factor is higher for plasmas generated by lower <b>laser</b> pulse <b>energies</b> than those generated by higher <b>laser</b> <b>energies.</b> The calibration curves of emission line intensities with elemental concentrations showed that detection sensitivities of Mn I 404. 136 nm and V I 437. 923 nm were improved by around 3 times. The limits of detection for both Mn I 404. 136 nm and V I 437. 923 nm are reduced from 425 and 42 ppm to 139 and 20 ppm, respectively, after using the micro torch. The LIBS system with micro torch was demonstrated to be cost-effective, compact, and capable of sensitivity improvement, especially for LIBS system operating with low <b>laser</b> pulse <b>energy...</b>|$|R
25|$|Data {{from the}} tests {{suggested}} that about 10MJ of x-ray energy {{would be needed}} to reach ignition. If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> on the order of 100MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.|$|E
25|$|To date most ICF {{experiments}} have used lasers {{to heat the}} target. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles. The <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core.

25|$|It is {{expected}} this will cause about 20MJ of fusion energy to be released, {{resulting in a}} net fusion energy gain of about 15 (G=Fusion energy/UV <b>laser</b> <b>energy).</b> Improvements in both the laser system and hohlraum design are expected to improve the energy absorbed by the capsule to about 420kJ, which, in turn, could generate up to 100-150MJ of fusion energy. However, the baseline design allows for a maximum of about 45MJ of fusion energy release, due {{to the design of}} the target chamber. This is the equivalent of about 11kg of TNT exploding.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} experiment, the laser will {{generate}} 3MJ of infrared <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> {{of a possible}} 4. About 1.5MJ of this is left after conversion to UV, and about 15 percent of this is lost in the x-ray conversion in the hohlraum. About 15 percent of the resulting x-rays, about 150kJ, will be absorbed by the outer layers of the target. The resulting inward directed compression is expected to compress the fuel {{in the center of}} the target to a density of about 1,000g/cm3 (or 1,000,000kg/m3); for comparison, lead has a normal density of about 11g/cm3 (11,340kg/m3). The pressure is the equivalent of 300 billion atmospheres.|$|E
25|$|These output {{energies}} {{are still}} {{less than the}} 422MJ of input energy required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least {{an order of magnitude}} more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.|$|E

25|$|Nd:YAG laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) {{may be used}} {{in patients}} susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.|$|E
25|$|Laser power beaming was {{envisioned by}} some at NASA as a {{stepping}} stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily {{on the development of}} a solar-powered laser. In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991 the SELENE project (SpacE <b>Laser</b> <b>ENErgy)</b> had begun, which included the study of laser power beaming for supplying power to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Prior to firing, the Nd:glass {{amplifiers}} {{are first}} pumped {{with a series}} of Xenon flash lamps surrounding them.

This process is quite inefficient, and only about 1 to 1.5% of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into <b>laser</b> <b>energy.</b> In order to produce the sort of laser power required for Nova, the lamps had to be very large, fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay. The flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass, requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again. This limits Nova to about six firings a day at the maximum.|$|E

25|$|Further {{upgrades}} to {{the simulation}} programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition.

During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of TRW confirmed {{that there was no}} way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency. In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30kJ of UV <b>laser</b> <b>energy,</b> about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics.

25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the <b>laser</b> <b>energy</b> and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E
