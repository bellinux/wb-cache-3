50|$|The {{original}} Nord Electro has two sections. One was a sample-player {{intended for}} electric pianos, although samples of acoustic grand and upright pianos are also available. The sample libraries are exchangeable, and Clavia has made several samples libraries available for free for Nord Electro owners. The second section is a digital emulation of electronic organs. This is not sample based, but instead {{generated by the}} digital modelling of several types of organs. Unlike many other keyboards that feature tonewheel organ emulation, the drawbars of the Nord Electro are represented by <b>LED</b> <b>bar</b> graphs and up/down buttons instead of the traditional mechanical drawbars.

40|$|Abstract. In LEDs Backlight Module, {{reflector}} {{who made}} by metal and contacts to LEDs possesses higher thermal conductivity. The reflector {{was expected to}} dissipate {{the heat from the}} LEDs, however, it is not good enough to decrease the LEDs temperature rise. In this study, a copper-graphite film with thickness of 82. 5 µm was attached to the back of reflector to increase the heat dissipation. The temperatures along the x, y, and z direction were measured to evaluate the thermal spread performance. Results showed that a 19 % temperature rise decrease was found for LEDs and a half temperature increase was also measured along the <b>LEDs</b> <b>bar</b> direction. In addition to that a higher thermal conductivity could spread the heat to the remote end resulting in temperature increasing to enhance the heat dissipation by way of reflector...|$|R
50|$|ISA 430 (1999) The ISA 430 brought {{together}} the circuitry {{of the original}} ISA110, with its transformer-based mic and line inputs, HPF/LPF and parametric EQ section, with the ISA 130 compressor/limiter and expander/gate, designed by Trevor Stride and Rupert Neve, which later appeared in the Red 3. In addition to uniting these two units in the same 2U enclosure, ISA 430 introduced additional features such as an optional 24/96 A/D converter with synch to Pro Tools’ Superclock and other sources. A dedicated insert could be placed in three locations in the signal path (after the preamp, pre-EQ; between EQ and dynamics; and after EQ and dynamics but before the main output). EQ and dynamics sections could be swapped, and the unit could run as a single channel path nor be split into two independent processors with separate EQ and dynamics. An upgraded Class A VCA design {{was used in the}} compressor, though the sidechain was identical to that in the original ISA 130. Both a VU Meter and <b>LED</b> <b>bar</b> metering was included, the latter for use with the A/D. An improved de-esser design was included and a “frequency adaptive” optical limiter.|$|E

40|$|A {{sensorimotor}} {{training system}} that facilitates {{learning to play}} piano was developed and tested. The system consists of three communicating units. The first unit comprises two pianos: an E-piano with a MIDI output for the teacher and an acoustic or an E-piano for the pupil. The pupil’s piano is supplied with an <b>LED</b> <b>bar</b> that illuminates the key to be struck. The second unit is a controller providing the interface between the teacher’s piano and the <b>LED</b> <b>bar.</b> The third unit consists of two pairs of gloves: one for the teacher {{and one for the}} pupil. The teacher gloves have integrated pressure sensors at every fingertip. The pupil’s gloves have vibration motors and LEDs at every finger. The pressure sensed on the teacher’s glove is transmitted to the corresponding finger on the pupil’s glove via the vibration motors and LEDs, such that the pupil knows which finger should strike which key. Additionally, two OLED displays showing the notation of the note played by the teacher can be attached to the left and right pupil’s gloves. Initially developed for people with cerebral palsy the sensorimotor system can support the learning also to all those with sensory, cognitive, and space perception impairments...|$|E

40|$|This project {{demonstrates}} the extensive {{application of the}} Siemens S 5 - 95 U Programmable Logic Controller. It utilises almost all the features of a good programmable controller now available in the market. The PLC's most notable feature, the handling of analog input and output data is actually the main feature of this project. The water tank system is composed of 3 tank systems connected in cascade series. Tank 1 is used for cold water storage, and tank 2 is the one used in the process. An interface module was created that displays the system different parameters. These are the tank's temperature and level. The interface is a stand-alone module which only requires power and the systems inputs. The module displays the system's current reading through an <b>LED</b> <b>bar</b> graph.

40|$|Few {{products}} {{exist that}} offer {{any form of}} feedback on a hitter's baseball swing. Since bat speed is so critical in hitting for power, a low cost device that gives information on bat speed and/or acceleration is needed. By having a visual and auditory response indicating the magnitude of acceleration, a batter can get {{a better idea of}} how much their swing is improving. That hitter could also work on maintaining control of a bat at different speeds. The SmartBat product meets this customer need. Using an accelerometer embedded {{on the side of a}} regular wooden baseball bat, it measures acceleration and outputs the signal to an <b>LED</b> <b>bar</b> display driver. This consists of 10 LEDs in a row. The number of LEDs that light up after a swing is directly proportional to bat acceleration. In addition, whistles at the end of the bat provide auditory feedback by whistling louder at higher speeds. The current prototype would be able to be sold for $ 40, less than half of existing swing speed radars. There is also significant room for future improvements based on customer feedback, including a digital display of speed and acceleration, as well as the ability to record data onto a computer for further analysis. by Ethan Trangle.
