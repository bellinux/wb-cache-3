5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a <b>laundry</b> <b>service,</b> the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E

25|$|A {{decision-maker}} acts in an {{ultra vires}} manner {{when it did}} not have the power that it purported to have, and therefore there was no basis in law for the impugned action.

Hence, a <b>laundry</b> <b>service</b> implemented by the Corporation was ultra vires.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards <b>Laundry</b> <b>Service</b> {{ranged from}} favourable to mixed, with critics expressing different opinions regarding {{the production and}} composition of the album.

He concluded that [...] "Dónde Están los Ladrones? remains Shakira's most essential album, but <b>Laundry</b> <b>Service</b> is an excellent English-language debut for the South American vocalist." [...] A critic from Billboard also favoured the presence of various musical styles on the album and commented that [...] "Laundry Service finds the 24-year-old artist unafraid of merging musical flavors," [...] and complimented Shakira's vocal talent. Similarly, the Entertainment.ie review of the album deemed the lyrical content [...] "surreal" [...] and the production [...] "no less bizarre [...] imposing breakneck tangos, twanging guitar solos and bizarre raps onto a familiar soft rock template." [...] They felt that <b>Laundry</b> <b>Service</b> could not be called a [...] "great album", reasoning that [...] "the line between fascinatingly strange and offputtingly weird is a thin one, and <b>Laundry</b> <b>Service</b> crosses it far too often," [...] but also stated that [...] "Even so, Shakira's star quality can hardly be denied - and in today's increasingly conformist pop industry that deserves at least two cheers." ...|$|E
