40|$|ABSTRACT Air {{temperature}} and relative humidity (RH) in the manure pits of five central Pennsylvania high-rise poultry houses were measured {{for at least}} one year to evaluate the role of the pit environment in the development of manure breeding flies and litter beetles. Pit air temperatures had weekly means ranging between 18. 1 and 22. 2 C. Seasonal temperature trends were similar at all farms, decreasing in winter and rising in summer. Maximum pit temperatures ranged from 31. 7 to 33. 3 C and minimum temperatures from. 6 to 5. 6 C, but these extremes were rare. Three houses had weekly mean RH ca 65 %, one ca 61 %, and one ca 72 %. No seasonal RH trends were evident. Daily temperature fluctuations were lowest at ca 0600 to 0700 h, peaked ca 1700 h, and varied inversely with RH. Pit air temperatures dropped below house fly reproductive thresholds for several weeks during the winter, but were adequate for their survival all year around. Manure temperatures were affected by the shape of the manure pile, depth of the manure, and seasonal air temperature patterns. Manure temperatures differed significantly between houses with either shallow (without scraper boards, x ca 16 to 19 C) or deep (with scraper boards, x ca 30 to 40 C) manure profiles. Shallow manure profile temperatures severely limit fly larvae and litter beetle development.

40|$|A {{new culture}} method for <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), was {{developed}} to provide large numbers of adult <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> of approximately the same age for insecticide resistance testing.

40|$|Factors that {{influence}} the localized abundance and distribution of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), in litter of two compacted earth-floor broiler houses in subtropical Australia were studied using various experimental manipulations. Numbers of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> substantially increased inside caged areas and under uncaged empty feed pans placed in open areas of the houses. These populations {{were found to be}} localized and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and high beetle populations that normally occur under existing feed pans. Substantial horizontal movement of larvae to under feed pans was recorded. Placing metal barriers around these pans significantly restricted this movement. In almost all treatments, <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> typically peaked in numbers {{during the middle of the}} flock time. This temporal pattern of abundance also was observed under pans within barriers, where relatively low insect numbers occurred, but it was not observed in uncaged open areas (where chickens had complete access). It is likely that larvae do not establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers as they either move to refuges away from chickens or suffer high rates of mortality. In these refuges, larvae peak in numbers and then leave the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor before the end of the flock time.

40|$|The {{immunocompetence}} handicap hypothesis postulates that secondary sexual {{traits are}} honest signals of mate quality because the hormones (e. g. testosterone) {{needed to develop}} secondary sexual traits have immunosuppressive effects. The best support for predictions arising from the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis so far comes from studies of insects, although they lack male-specific hormones such as testosterone. In our previous studies, we found that female <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> prefer pheromones of immunocompetent males. Here, we tested how juvenile hormone (JH) affects male investment in secondary sexual characteristics and immune functions in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor. We injected male <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> with JH (type III) and found that injection increased the attractiveness of male pheromones but simultaneously suppressed immune functions (phenoloxidase activity and encapsulation). Our results suggest that JH, which {{is involved in the}} control of reproduction and morphogenesis, also plays {{a central role in the}} regulation of a trade-off between the immune system and sexual advertisement in insects.

40|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a serious, {{cosmopolitan}} pest {{present in}} poultry production facilities, where it slows down weight gain in chicks, carries disease–causing organisms, and causes damage to poultry insulation. The first study {{estimated that the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> densities in poultry litter applied to pastures were 3. 5, 2. 2 and 0. 4 million larvae, adults and pupae, respectively, per hectare in Savoy, Arkansas. The repercussions of these adult beetles are that they often disperse to and reinfest poultry houses {{with the potential to}} vector disease to poultry, and disperse to invade human dwellings resulting in litigation. The second experiment noted an initial increase in beetle trap catches after heat was turned on in the poultry house in preparation for placement of chicks. There was a reduction in sampled densities of beetles shortly after chick placement. These observations will help decision making regarding <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> sampling and timing pesticide use. The third experiment consisted of two behavioral bioassays. In field experiments, significantly higher numbers of beetles were found in pitfall traps treated with the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> aggregation pheromone lure as compared to untreated checks. The laboratory two–choice pitfall trap bioassay found a combination of the aggregation pheromone and chicken droppings (CD) to be attractive to <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae and adults than either odor source alone. Results indicate the potential for combining the synthetic pheromone lure with the potential attractive CD compounds to enhance trap efficacy. The fourth objective determined respective percent mortalities and baseline dose-responses of beetles to three different classes of insect growth regulators (IGRs) including fenoxycarb, diflubenzuron, and 20 –hydroxyecdysone, through topical, residual contact and feeding bioassays. In feeding bioassays, fenoxycarb and diflubenzuron were more toxic to 1 st instars than 7 th instars or adults, whereas ecdysone was equally more toxic to 1 st instars and 7 th instars than to adults. The feeding bioassay was more suitable for the 1 st and 7 th instar stages than adults. The residual contact bioassay exhibited slightly less percent mortality of 7 th instars and adults but this bioassay most closely simulated field application of insecticides.

Larvae were the predominant stage recorded. Significantly low densities occurred in open locations and under drinker cups where chickens had complete access, whereas high densities were found under feed pans and along house edges where chicken access was restricted. For each flock, <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> numbers increased at all locations {{over the first}} 14 d, especially under feed pans and along house edges, peaking at 26 d and then declining over the final 28 d. A life stage profile per flock was devised that consisted of the following: beetles emerge from the earth floor {{at the beginning of}} each flock, and females lay eggs, producing larvae that peak in numbers at 3 wk; after a further 3 to 4 wk, larvae leave litter to pupate in the earth floor, and beetles then emerge by the end of the flock time. Removing old litter from the brooder section at the end of a flock did not greatly reduce mealworm numbers over the subsequent flock, but it seemed to prevent numbers increasing, while an increase in numbers in the grow-out section was recorded after reusing litter. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> in the broiler house occurred in these locations.

Within 20 days after placing the panels into laboratory colonies, large numbers of adults moved from the media into the polystyrene expanding the tunnels. Concurrently, the number of late instar larvae recovered from the insulation declined. No oviposition occurred within the tunnels. Few middle instar larvae were present in the polystyrene. All lifestages of A. diaperinus invaded exposed fiberglass, but invading late instar larvae did not pupate successfully.

In compacted earth floor houses, mean numbers of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> for two under-feed-line spinosad treatments (i. e., 2 -m-wide application at 0. 18 g of active insecticide (g [AI]) in 100 -ml water/m(2), and 1 -m-wide application at 0. 11 g ([AI] in 33 -ml water/m(2)), and an entire floor spinosad treatment (0. 07 g [AI] in 86 -ml water/m 2) were significantly lower (i. e., better control) than those numbers for cyfluthrin, and no treatment (controls). The 1 -m-wide under-feed-line treatment was the most cost-effective dose, providing similar control to the other two most effective spinosad treatments, but using less than half the active component per broiler house. No efficacy was demonstrated when spinosad was applied to the surface of bedding in relatively large volumes of water. All applications of diatomaceous earth, applied with and without spinosad, and cyfluthrin at the label rate of 0. 02 g (AI) / 100 -ml water/m(2) showed no effect, with insect counts not significantly different to untreated controls.

40|$|In Australia, the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is {{a common}} insect pest of earth floor broiler houses, where it often occurs in large numbers in the bedding {{material}} or litter that is used on the floors. <b>Lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> are reservoirs for several avian pathogens, parasites and food borne diseases. In addition, larvae damage broiler house structures by actively tunnelling into insulation and earth floors. Despite being a common and ubiquitous broiler house pest in Australia, until now, little was known of its ecology in earth floor broiler houses or its susceptibility to registered broiler house insecticides. To determine {{the factors that influence}} their localised abundance and distribution in litter, populations of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> in several earth-floor broiler houses in sub-tropical Queensland were intensively sampled, experiments were undertaken and life tables constructed. <b>Lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae were the predominant stage recorded in all litter samples. Life table parameters used stage durations based on a mean broiler house temperature of 31. 3 °C. Within the broiler houses, substantial horizontal movement of larvae in litter to under feed pans was recorded and this behaviour was supported by life table analyses, which showed atypical <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> survivorship, suggesting movement by all larval ages. This movement results in large and significant aggregations of larvae under feed pans and along house edges, where chicken access is restricted. Significantly lower larval densities occurred in open locations and under drinker cups, where chickens had complete access. Small larvae appeared to aggregate predominately {{at the beginning of the}} flock but continued to move during most of the flock time. In addition, the experimental manipulations in open areas of the broiler house showed that <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> substantially increased in number inside caged areas without feed pans and under uncaged empty feed pans. <b>Lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> under similar empty feed pans but enclosed with metal barriers did not increase in the same manner; these barriers significantly restricted their movement. Aggregated populations of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> were found to be localised and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and the normally high adult beetle numbers that occur under permanent existing feed pans. Total broiler bird weight in the brooder section during the flock time was considered a driving factor for larval movement, and together with relatively high litter temperatures, a potential source of mortality across larval stages. At almost all types of locations within a broiler house, including experimental treatment locations, numbers of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> typically increased over the first 14 d of the flock time, especially in more protected areas such as under feed pans and along house edges, peaked at ≈ 26 d, and then declined over the remainder of the flock time. In these protected areas or refuges, larvae peaked in numbers, and then left the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor prior to the end of the flock time. This behaviour seemed unrelated to density as the same temporal pattern of abundance was observed under pans within metal barriers, where much fewer insects occurred. It was not observed in uncaged open areas where chickens had complete access. As larvae move away from chickens to refuges, it is likely that populations fail to establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers and suffer high rates of mortality. Therefore a typical life stage profile in earth floor broiler houses consists of beetles that emerge from the earth floor at the start of each flock time, lay large numbers of eggs that produce larvae that peak in numbers at ≈ 21 d, and after a further 21 - 28 d leave the litter and pupate in the earth floor. These pupae produce adult beetles that begin to emerge prior to the end of the flock time. Removing and replacing litter in the brooder section at the completion of a flock time appeared to inhibit rises in numbers of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> over the subsequent flock in the brooder section. In contrast, reusing litter in the grow-out section caused an increase in <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> numbers in the grow-out over the subsequent flock time. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> in the broiler house occurred in these locations. Because a high proportion of larvae move to under pan locations and aggregate, this behaviour could be exploited to better manage <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> by targeting applications of residual control agents at the commencement of the flock to areas under feed pans, which could maximize the efficiency of these agents, and in doing so, reduce the overall quantity of insecticide required to treat a broiler house. The most common practice used for management of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> is the treatment of broiler house floors or bedding with insecticides. In Australia fenitrothion, cyfluthrin and spinosad are currently registered for broiler house application, and another insecticide, γ-cyhalothrin, is under consideration. Overall, the most commonly used insecticide throughout eastern Australia is the pyrethroid, cyfluthrin. Because of control failures using this chemical, resistance to cyfluthrin was suspected in Australian broiler farm populations of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm.</b> Consequently the responses of several field populations of beetles collected from broiler farms in different Australian states and an insecticide-susceptible reference population to cyfluthrin, spinosad and γ-cyhalothrin were measured in topical application bioassays. In addition, the susceptibility of six Australian broiler house beetle populations and the insecticide susceptible population to several pyrethroids (cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin, γ-cyhalothrin & deltamethrin) was measured to determine patterns of cross resistance. The importance of metabolic mechanisms of resistance in these field populations was investigated using similar assays and the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Beetle populations from eastern Australia were first tested with cyfluthrin and resistance (resistance ratios of up to 22 -fold at the LC 50) was found in almost all of them; with the degree of resistance in a given population directly proportional to the number of cyfluthrin applications it had received. Dose-mortality data showed that 0. 0007 % cyfluthrin (the LC 99. 9 of the susceptible population) could be used as a convenient discriminating dose to identify resistant populations. In addition, comparisons of cyfluthrin LC 50 values of three broiler populations and a susceptible population, collected and then assayed over a four year interval, indicated that values from all three broiler populations had increased over this time. For spinosad, comparisons of dose-response curves showed that all populations, including the insecticide-susceptible population, were equivalent in their response to spinosad, indicating no pre-existing spinosad resistance. Two of these field populations, including a resistant reference population, had confirmed cyfluthrin/fenitrothion-resistance, but showed no cross-resistance to spinosad. A discriminating concentration of 3 % spinosad (just above the highest recorded LC 99. 9 value of 2. 45 %) was set to separate resistant and susceptible individuals. For γ-cyhalothrin, baseline studies of beetle populations from most Australian states indicated that it was roughly twice as toxic as cyfluthrin, with a discriminating concentration of 0. 005 % γ-cyhalothrin chosen to detect any future changes in susceptibility. These same beetle populations were tested with the cyfluthrin discriminating dose to identify possible cross-resistance. Across all populations, there was a significant linear relationship between the γ-cyhalothrin LC 50 value and mortality induced by the cyfluthrin discriminating dose. In addition, repeat testing and regression analysis of specific beetle populations to γ-cyhalothrin showed that topical application was a very reliable and repeatable testing method. The γ-cyhalothrin study suggested that cyfluthrin can confer cross-resistance to γ-cyhalothrin in A. diaperinus, but the magnitude of this resistance is not predictable. The susceptibility of beetle populations to four pyrethroids with and without piperonyl butoxide showed that almost all populations, when compared to the reference susceptible population, demonstrated very low susceptibility to cyfluthrin, with some reduced susceptibility to β-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin and γ-cyhalothrin; cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide had no effect on the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it consistently increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations to cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin and γ-cyhalothrin. The addition of piperonyl butoxide to deltamethrin had inconsistent effects on susceptibility. In general, adding piperonyl butoxide to the four pyrethroids did not completely restore susceptibility to these compounds in resistant populations, indicating the presence of other resistance mechanisms in addition to microsomal-monooxygenase and esterase based metabolic resistance mechanisms. The relative importance of these metabolic resistance mechanisms in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids, and the future addition of piperonyl butoxide to these pyrethroids might not necessarily improve their efficacy in the field. Following the laboratory toxicity testing of cyfluthrin and spinosad, field efficacy assessments of these two insecticides and diatomaceous earth, were made on two farms in south eastern Queensland. Diatomaceous earth is known to have insecticidal properties so it was chosen to assess its potential as a natural litter treatment on one farm. Insecticide treatments|$|R
