The firm keeps a low profile and its client list remains confidential. However {{it is a matter}} of record that Chelgate assisted Shell Oil Company with its Brent Spa and Nigeria (Ken Saro-Wiwa) issues, and Mitsubishi Corporation with environmental issues, including deforestation. The firm also ran a high-profile global campaign against Zimbabwe dictator Robert Mugabe ("Save Zimbabwe") resulting in significant hardening of international opinion against that regime. It was also unusually visible during the negotiations between the Duke of Sutherland and the National Galleries of Scotland over the £100 million sale of two Titians on loan to the Galleries, with Terence Fane-Saunders acting as spokesman for the Duke.

Since the major fire at York Minster in 1984 the many cathedral authorities have undertaken varying amounts of work to prevent a similar tragedy, but there remain unprotected cathedrals and no consensus on further progress. Addresses the complex nature of cathedral buildings in fire safety terms along with the conflict inherent in introducing modern protective measures in structures of enormous historic and aesthetic quality. Examines data held by the <b>leading</b> <b>insurer</b> of cathedrals in England and Wales, the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group, and sets it alongside the authors′ own research to reveal a picture of great variation in methods and measures of fire protection, and a sense of the changes which are underway or can be expected in coming years.

40|$|A closed-claim {{analysis}} of anesthetic-related deaths and permanent {{injuries in the}} dental office setting was conducted in cooperation with a <b>leading</b> <b>insurer</b> of oral and maxillofacial surgeons and dental anesthesiologists. A total of 13 cases occurring between 1974 and 1989 was included. In each case, all available records, reports, depositions, and proceedings were reviewed. The following were determined for each case: preoperative physical status of the patient, anesthetic technique used (classified as either general anesthesia or conscious sedation), probable cause of the morbid event, avoidability of the occurrence, and contributing factors important to the outcome. The majority of patients were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status II or III. Most patients had preexisting conditions, such as gross obesity, cardiac disease, epilepsy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that can significantly affect anesthesia care. Hypoxia arising from airway obstruction and/or respiratory depression {{was the most common}} cause of untoward events, and most of the adverse events were determined to be avoidable. The disproportionate number of patients in this sample who were at the extremes of age and with ASA classifications below I suggests that anesthesia risk may be significantly increased in patients who fall outside the healthy, young adult category typically treated in the oral surgical/dental outpatient setting...|$|E

40|$|Following reform {{waves in}} Central and Eastern European (CEE) {{countries}} and China, Vietnam started its State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform right after {{ending the war}} against American troops to reunite the country in mid- 1975 (Geogre, 1995). Vietnam did gain some remarkable achievements in its reconstruction and development process. However, the latest SOE reform which introduced and applied the shareholding system in the twenty-five largest SOEs faced an initial failure and was postponed until further notice (Quan, 2011). With the intention of exploring and understanding key reform drivers and challenges facing Vietnamese SOEs in their privatisation processes, this study focuses on two questions: (i) “What are the key drivers facing Vietnamese SOEs in the privatisation process”, and (ii) “What are the key challenges facing Vietnamese SOEs in the privatisation process”. To address the research questions, this thesis utilises a case study methodology. Two representative cases were selected. The first case is BVH, the <b>leading</b> <b>insurer</b> in Vietnam and the first pilot privatisation project approved by the Government to follow shareholding system and form a conglomerate in Vietnam. The second case is BIDV, the most recent privatisation initiative of large SOEs before the recent suspension of the shareholding system in Vietnam. In order to collect data from the selected cases, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} three different layers of employees including senior managers, supervisors, and front-line employees. Ethnographic data is also collected to support the interviews. In order to support the data analysis, this research applies institutional theory and isomorphism to build a conceptual framework to better understand Vietnamese privatisation context. This frame will then be used to guide the data collection, investigate and analyse key reform drivers and challenges in the privatisation process of Vietnamese SOEs. In addition, NVIVO and Ms EXCEL were used to analyse the qualitative data. The findings from this study suggest that different sets of factors drive Vietnamese reforms and different challenges prevent it from gaining expected outcomes. These drivers and challenges are different from previous reform programmes around the world. Differences, in turn, signal a specific level of customisation in Vietnamese SOE reform and privatisation programmes. However, the recent postponement and collapses of two of the twenty-five largest SOEs in Vietnam indicate serious problems in this reform process. Findings from this study could partially contribute to explaining the suspension and recent collapses of two recent privatisation initiatives. In addition, this study also reveals the possible relationships between reform drivers and challenges. Based on these findings, further research opportunities are suggested to improve the performance of the privatisation process in Vietnam. Through its findings, this research contributes significantly to the body of knowledge by analysing relationships between drivers and challenges, thus enriching the literatures on public sector reform within Vietnamese context. It also provides important recommendations for future privatisers in Vietnam in terms of reform skills and knowledge, reform planning and execution, and reform monitoring and supervision. In addition, {{the findings of this study}} provide significant insights for policy-makers in Vietnam. Based on these recommendations, privatisation-supported legislation would be strengthened and the educational system in Vietnam would be more practically-oriented in the long-run...|$|E
