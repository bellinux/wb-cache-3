Nusantara Bioscience 8 : 89 - 93. Growth {{and development of}} <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Valerianella locusta L.) have been studied on thin layer soilless systems in plastic greenhouse on the Laboratory field of Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana. The trial lasted from 23 rd of February till 10 th of March 2016. The experiment was included cultivar 'Ljubljanski'. Four different substrates have been used: expanded clay aggregate, perlite, vermiculite and peat. Seedlings were transplanted at distance of 10 x 10 cm. At the harvest the following parameters were measured: leaves fresh and dry yield, plant height, number of leaves per plant and the nitrate-N content in leaves. The overall effect {{of the type of}} substrate on <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> growth and yield in the present experiment suggests that the examined materials are suitable substrates for <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> soilless cultivation production. The outcomes of the research point {{to the fact that the}} <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> in perlite treatments brings greater fresh yields compared the other inert substrates. On the other hand peat produced higher leaf dry mass as compared to other substrates. A quantitative analysis of the nitrate-N content in leaves showed that the peat is the most effective substrate in terms of low plant nitrate concentration...|$|R

For instance, ideal plant density is not known for all species {{as well as their}} tolerance to nutrient solution salinity. The experiment was carried out on radish (Raphanus sativus) and <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Valerianella locusta), species with different edible parts of plant. For both species, three sowing densities (370, 640 and 980 plants m- 2 for radish and 1200, 1800 and 2400 plants m- 2 for <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce)</b> and three nutrient solutions similar for composition but different in salinity by addition of 0, 10 and 20 mmol L- 1 of NaCl were compared. Radish yields were higher at the lower densities and at the minor salinity. <b>Lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> production increased along with density but external quality decreased because of longer leaves. Salinity reduced yield but also resulted in shorter leaves which improved external quality of production at higher densities. Differences occurred also in internal quality: increasing salinity reduced nitrates in dry matter of both species and also increased total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce.</b> In the latter species, high densities negatively affected quality as resulted in greater nitrate content...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Valerianella locusta L.) {{delivered}} at the vegetable auctions is not always fresh. The product could be stored for a certain period depending on the season. The stored samples cannot be distinguished visually from fresh material but their shelf life potential is reduced {{compared to that of}} the latter. Batches with limited shelf life potential lead to losses in distribution and lower consumption quality. The aim of this work was to develop a methodology that can determine the time that <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> has been in storage. <b>Lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> samples, grown at an experimental garden were stored at 4 °C with a relative humidity greater than 90 %. Visible/near infrared (VIS/NIR) spectra of the samples were measured at harvesting day and after 7, 14 and 20 days in storage. Samples of <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> were taken during storage for the analysis of different components to find an explanation for the change in spectral data. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll content were followed during storage. Other samples were set aside for respiration measurements. VIS/NIR reflectance spectra were linked to the time in storage using partial least squares regression (PLS). The resulting PLS-model was able to determine the stored period of <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (RMSEC = 1. 88 days; R² = 0. 94). To validate the model a random cross validation of 4 segments containing 48 samples was performed (RMSEV = 2. 09 days; R² = 0. 92). Other results showed that the content of glucose, sucrose and fructose gradually decreased during storage.

40|$|Because of the {{continuous}} {{increase of the}} fresh-cut market, {{it is crucial to}} identify the best methods to provide high productivity with an adequate global quality of raw material. From this standpoint, the floating system is very interesting. This experiment was meant to enhance the limited knowledge on <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Valerianella locusta L. Latter) and radish (Raphanus sativus L. (Gr. Radicula)). The experiment was performed in a greenhouse during two growing seasons (spring and summer), adopting two plant densities (370 and 640 plants m- 2 for radish, 1800 and 2400 plants m- 2 for <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce)</b> and four nutrient solutions (differing in salinity by addition of 0, 10, 20 and 30 mmol L- 1 of NaCl). For radish, the increase of plant density decreased marketable product. The total biomass and yield were negatively affected by the increase of salinity but average hypocotyl length and diameter were not. Furthermore, almost all the parameters showed higher values in spring cultivation. The growing season interacted mainly with plant density: while in spring the plant density did not affect the fresh weight, in summer this parameter was lower at the higher density. On the contrary, marketable yield was similar in spring while it was reduced at the higher density in summer. Yield of <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> increased along with density while it was negatively affected by salinity. Quality traits such as chlorophyll content, leaf length and dry matter were improved at low density and higher salinity. In spring yield was higher than in summer but quality was poorer.

40|$|Light {{treatments}} during storage at {{low temperature}} might induce {{both positive and}} negative effects on shelf life and quality of produces. For this reason, in this work we examined the effect of low light irradiance on <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> during storage at a low temperature. Partitioned light treatments (4 doses per 1 h per day; 8 doses per 1 h per day; 16 doses per 0. 5 h per day) showed positive effects, while continuous light treatments (8 h per day) were deleterious. The content of photosynthetic pigments, energy-linked metabolites and antioxidants was evaluated at the beginning and after 6 days of storage in comparison with samples stored at 4 °C in the dark. The content of such bioactive compounds was increased or at least similar in samples stored under partitioned light and at a higher temperature (6 °C) when compared to those stored in the dark. We suggest that continuous light treatments could promote photosynthesis but also cause photo-damage during cold storage of <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce.</b> However, the photosynthesis under partitioned low light is only partially activated and so the photo-damage is limited, although the metabolism of green tissues would be still able to provide carbon moieties for the synthesis of bioactive molecules, thus delaying senescence.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of light on}} fresh-cut vegetables during storage is controversial, since {{both positive and negative}} effects on shelf-life and quality of such products have been observed. In this work, the effect of low-intensity light treatments on <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce,</b> a fresh-cut leafy and ready-to-eat vegetable, was investigated during storage at low temperature (6. °C), in comparison with conventional storage (in the dark at 4. °C). Although continuous light treatment (1 cycle of 8. h per day) was deleterious, cycles of light treatments (8 cycles of 1. h per day; 16 cycles of 0. 5. h per day) showed positive effects, assessed by evaluating the content of chlorophylls, carotenoids, ATP, glucose and ascorbate. These analyses were performed at the beginning and after 6 days of storage, in comparison with samples stored in the dark at 4. °C. Under low-intensity light treatments, even if performed at a higher temperature (6. °C), the content of such bioactive compounds increased or was at least similar to that found in samples stored in the dark at the same temperature. We suggest that continuous low-intensity light treatments during cold storage of <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> are able to promote photosynthesis but, at the same time, induce photo-damage. On the contrary, under intermittent low-intensity light cycles, photosynthesis is only partially activated, while the metabolism of the green tissues is still able to provide carbon moieties for the synthesis of bioactive molecules involved in delaying senescence. Therefore, low-intensity light cycles at 6. °C could contribute to maintain quality of <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce,</b> with respect to samples stored in the dark at both 6 and 4. °C.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in the hydroponic floating system to cultivate leafy vegetables for ready-to-eat salads.

RESULTS: The quality and shelf life of ready-to-eat <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> grown in protected environment in soil plot or in soil-less system over hydroponic solution {{with or without the}} addition of 30 μmol L - 1 silicon were evaluated. Minimum effects were observed on colour, firmness and microbial counts. Hydroponic cultivation largely affected plant tissue hydration, leading to weight loss and structural modifications during refrigerated storage. The shelf life of <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> was limited by the development of visually detectable unpleasant sensory properties. Shelf life, calculated by survival analysis of consumer acceptability data, resulted about 7 days for soil-cultivated salad and 2 days for the hydroponically grown ones. The addition of silicon to the hydroponic solution resulted in an interesting strategy to increase plant tissue yield and reduce nitrate accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although hydroponic cultivation may have critical consequences on product quality and shelf life, these disadvantages could be largely counterbalance by increased yield and a reduction of nitrate accumulation when cultivation is performed on nutritive solutions with supplemental addition of silicon. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

The developed method allows the correct quantification of vitamins C, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 5, B 6, B 9, E and provitamin A in ready-to-eat green leafy vegetable products including green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, watercress, swiss chard, <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce,</b> spearmint, spinach, wild rocket, pea leaves, mizuna, garden cress and red mustard. Using this optimized methodology, low LOQs were attained for the analyzed vitamins in less than 100 min, including extraction and vitamin analysis using 2 optimized procedures; good repeatability and linearity was achieved for all vitamins studied, while recoveries ranged from 83 % to 105 %. The most abundant free vitamins found in leafy vegetable products were vitamin C, provitamin A and vitamin E. The richest sample on vitamin C and provitamin A was pea leaves (154 mg/g fresh weight and 14. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight, respectively), whereas <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> was the vegetable with the highest content on vitamin E (3. 1 mg/ 100 g fresh weight).

Questions focussed on intentions to purchase fresh cut <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> from environmental sustainable farms, simulating a fresh cut product with an Eco-label. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM technique is used to develop propositions representing a theoretical approach in the context of the process for purchasing fresh cut products. With regard to distinguishing between the motives, the authors referred to the approach that sets out two different types of motive: health and green. Findings – The resulting managerial implications make it possible to assess how much the different types of motive influence the attitude and affect the choices and the behavior of the consumers. Originality/value – This implies important managerial implications for new marketing strategies for minimally processed food products, with the opportunity to take advantage of the potential adoption of an Eco-label. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|After harvest, fresh leafy {{vegetables}} are stored {{under conditions of}} low temperature in combination with controlled atmosphere (CA) and/or modified atmosphere (MAP) conditions to preserve their quality, while prolonging their postharvest storage life. In reality, these conditions are hardly met since these fresh produce are stored to situations were photosynthetically active radiation is limited or completely absent and the low oxygen conditions in the MAP or CA could result in fermentation. These will lead to sugar starvation and other unwanted physiological disorders, leading to premature economic losses. The main objective of this PhD is to study and understand the effect(s) of sugar starvation on metabolic and biochemical changes on the respiratory metabolism of {{leafy vegetables}} cells through metabolomics and(13 C-) fluxomics analysis. To meet the main objective and the scientific research questions of this thesis, the following sub-objectives were defined: To optimise a protocol for the isolation and characterization of <b>lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> cells. To optimise measurement and experimental setups in the bioreactor. To characterise {{the changes in the}} metabolome and fluxome of the isolated cells in response to sugar starvation at different temperatures and low oxygen stress conditions, respectively, using GC-MS metabolic profiling approach. To construct an integrated compartmentalised dynamic model of the central carbon metabolism to estimate fluxes and to investigate the control of these fluxes in the different pathways as affected by low O 2 stress and temperature, respectively. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} disease-carrying {{pathogens}} found in raw meats, and they differ {{according to the}} source, whether it be mammalian, poultry or seafood. Some disease-carrying pathogens found in beef are Salmonellas, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Different varieties of Salmonellas are often found in contaminated poultry. Seafood itself can also contain {{a wide variety of}} pathogens. The most common pathogen in raw oysters is Vibrio gastroenteritis, while Salmonella, Plesiomonsas shielloides, and staphylococcus are found in contaminated raw shrimp, and Vibrio cholerae has been found in raw crabmeat. Many of the symptoms that result from these diseases involve intestinal damage and can have potentially fatal effects for those at risk. The symptoms of an E. coli infection include bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and possible complications for the immune-compromised, elderly or children. These complications can include Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and neurological problems. The symptoms of Vibrio gastroenteritis include frequent fevers, bloody diarrhea, long duration of illness and hospitalization. While most of these diseases are still most commonly found in raw meat, the instances of detection in other mediums are increasing. For instance, Salmonella is most commonly found in poultry, but has been recently identified in sources such as eggs, dairy, meat, fresh vegetables and fruits. E. coli has also been found in beef, <b>lamb,</b> <b>lettuce,</b> sprouts, fruit juices, vegetables, raw milk, and water. Possible reasons for the increase are the globalization of the food market, improper handling, and leakage.|$|R
2500|$|Human F. hepatica {{infection}} {{is determined by}} the presence of the intermediate snail hosts, domestic herbivorous animals, climatic conditions and the dietary habits of man. [...] Sheep, goats and cattle are considered the predominant animal reservoirs. While other animals can be infected, they are usually not very important for human disease transmission. On the other hand, some authors have observed that donkeys and pigs contribute to disease transmission in Bolivia. Among wild animals, it has been demonstrated that the peridomestic rat (Rattus rattus) may {{play an important role in}} the spread as well as in the transmission of the parasite in Corsica. In France, nutria (Myocastor coypus) was confirmed as a wild reservoir host of F. hepatica. [...] Humans are infected by ingestion of aquatic plants that contain the infectious cercariae. Several species of aquatic vegetables are known as a vehicle of human infection. In Europe, Nasturtium officinale (common watercress), Nasturtium silvestris, Rorippa amphibia (wild watercress), Taraxacum dens leonis (dandelion leaves), Valerianella olitoria (<b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce),</b> and Mentha viridis (spearmint) were reported as a source of human infections. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, some authors suggested that several aquatic plants such as bero-bero (watercress), algas (algae), kjosco and tortora could act as a source of infection for humans. Because F. hepatica cercariae also encyst on water surface, humans can be infected by drinking of fresh untreated water containing cercariae. In addition, an experimental study suggested that humans consuming raw liver dishes from fresh livers infected with juvenile flukes could become infected.|$|R
40|$|A {{pre-packaged}} salad mix including radicchio, frisee <b>lettuce</b> and <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce</b> {{was found}} to contain parts of other plants. The official food analysis of the contaminated salad mix revealed that these were blossoms and leaves of common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.) a wildly growing yellow-flowered plant with a bitter taste spread widely throughout temperate zones. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) {{has been asked to}} assess the consumer health risk associated with the intake of common groundsel. Cases of poisoning have shown that common groundsel can cause life-threatening liver damage in humans and animals. This is caused by substances in groundsel such as se-necionine and riddelline that belong to the group of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and are among the group’s most poisonous substances. In animal experiments, these alkaloids have been carcinogenic and in various in vitro and in vivo tests genotoxic. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies riddeline as probably carcinogenic for humans. A portion size below which unsaturated PAs do not constitute a health risk can-not be determined science-based and therefore a tolerable intake can also not be derived. As a preventive measure, the intake of PAs should be avoided as much as possible. As a result of its exposure assessment, BfR concludes that acute to medium-term liver damage due to the intake of salad mix contaminated with common groundsel cannot be excluded. BfR suggests that special care is taken during harvest and the preparation of salads, leafy vegetables and herbs. Consumers should clean, wash and sort out plant parts that cannot be allotted to edible plants well before eating...|$|R
40|$|Quality has a product- and a consumer-dependent {{dimension}} {{in which the}} relationship between objective and subjective aspects represents {{the core of the}} economic importance of quality. Globe artichoke, strawberry and baby leaf vegetables were selected as the experimental crops due to their high importance on national and international markets. For instance, in Italy 46, 954 and 6, 000 ha are produced annually for globe artichoke and strawberry, respectively. Besides Italy is the European leader in leafy vegetables, with about 3000 ha produced annually under protected cultivation and destined to fresh-cut products such as wild rocket, leaf <b>lettuce,</b> <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce,</b> spinach, and swiss chard. Most aspects of food quality perception by consumers are based on experience or credence characteristics, associating local and traditional produce with high-quality and healthy products. The food quality perception leds to an increasing demand for organic products, partially due to the general thought that organic foods are healthier and more nutritive than conventionally produced products; even if scientific evidence is still insufficient to confirm or reject this assumption. Recently, consumers' and producers' interest is based on the evolution of the life styles and food style. Particularly, the increasing application of products with high content of services is determining a progressive increase of leafy vegetable destined to fresh-cut products. Epidemiological studies support the increasing attention of consumers to the nutritional quality of fruits and vegetables with elevated health-promoting properties due to the presence of an array of secondary metabolites, collectively called phytochemicals. The quantity and quality of phytochemicals may be affected by diverse biotic and abiotic stresses, the development stage of the produce, plant genotype, growing season and harvest time, field location and soil quality, available nutrients, light, temperature, irrigation, chemical fertilizers and conventional/organic management. Within this context, particular attention is given to sustainable agriculture and low environmental impact with elevated crop production rich in phytonutrients. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been shown not only to improve plant nutrition and reduced chemical inputs, but also to induce changes in plant secondary metabolism. Beneficial impact of AM fungi on plant mineral and secondary metabolite contents depends not only by AM fungal species or isolates, but also by plant genotype and fertilization. Farming practices as conventional and organic management are as important as genetic variation in determining various components in a crop. Desirable and undesirable compounds in plants are affected by sunlight integral and other factors such as temperature, light intensity, photoperiod and carbon dioxide concentration. The genetic background, nitrate supply, harvesting time and light intensity during the growing season are predominant factors for nitrate content. Based on this preliminary information, the influence of agronomic, genotypic and environmental factors on nutritional/nutraceutical profile of vegetable crops was performed. The agronomic factor was evaluated showing the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation and field locations on mineral composition, antioxidant activity, phenolic acids and sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) content of globe artichoke. The agronomic and genotypic factors were evaluated showing the effect of farming system and cold storage on quality attributes in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) cultivars Sabrina and Ventana. The genotypic and environmental factors were evaluated showing the nutritional characterization of selected baby leaf vegetables destined to fresh-cut products belonging to the families of Chenopodiaceae (red chard, spinach, swiss chard), Asteraceae (chicory, green and red lettuce), Brassicaceae (mizuna, rocket, tatsoi), Valerianaceae (<b>Lamb's</b> <b>lettuce),</b> and the variation in visual appearance, proteins content, minerals content, antioxidant activity, ascorbic acid and total phenols content of the selected leafy vegetables in relation to the light intensity (low and high Photosynthetically Active Radiation, PAR) at time of harvest. Analysis of the obtained data on artichoke's experiment revealed significant variations among field locations for the agronomic and nutraceutical parameters. Mycorrhizal treatments did not significantly affect the mineral content of the crop. The activation of plant secondary metabolism in response to AM fungi resulted in increases of the content of individual molecules, with a general but not significant positive influence due to the synergistic effect of Glomus spp and mycorrhizal helper bacteria. The portional division of the plant and head parts showed the highest SLs content in the leaves and the highest total phenols content in the edible part, without univocal result if related to inoculation. The data obtained for the strawberry cultivars' experiment showed that the organic 'Sabrina' strawberry had a higher soluble solids content while the organic 'Ventana' had a higher hydrophilic antioxidant activity. An opposite trend was observed on total phenols and ellagic acid for 'Ventana' and 'Sabrina', respectively. Organic farming did not increase the reducing sugars and ascorbic acid contents in both cultivars compared to conventional management farming. The higher nutritional value in terms of hydrophilic and lipophylic antioxidant activities in 'Ventana' and the higher ellagic acid content in 'Sabrina' indicated that the choice of cultivar for a specific farming system is essential since it may affect quality attributes of strawberry fruit. The nutritional/nutraceutical characterization of ten leafy vegetable destined to fresh-cut products rewards the Brassicaceae family and leafy vegetables harvested at low in comparison to high PAR, except for total phenols content in chicory, green <b>lettuce,</b> <b>lamb's</b> <b>lettuce,</b> mizuna, red chard, and red lettuce. All factors considered in this study have influence on nutritional/nutraceutical quality. From the objective point of view, considering also the nutraceutical properties, quality is not determinable in univocal way...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand of}} {{minimally}} processed {{fruits and vegetables}} has increased in the last years. However, their intrinsic characteristics may favor the growth of pathogens and spoilage microbiota. The negative effects on human health reported for some traditional chemical sanitizers have justified the search for substitutes to guarantee food safety and quality. In this work we have evaluate the potential of some essential oils and their components to improve the safety and the shelf life of <b>Lamb’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Valerianella locusta) and apples (Golden delicious). Moreover, the effects of selected lactic acid bacteria alone or in combination with essential oils or their components, on the shelf-life and safety as well as organoleptic properties of minimally processed products, were evaluated. Since the {{lack of knowledge of}} microbial cell targets of essential oils represent {{one of the most important}} limit to the use of these molecules at industrial level, another aim of this thesis was the study of the action mechanisms of essential oils and their components. The results obtained showed the beneficial effects of the natural antimicrobials as well as the selected lactic acid bacteria on minimally processed fruit and vegetable safety and shelf-life, without detrimental effects on the quality parameters. The beneficial effects obtained by the use of the selected biocontrol agents were further increased combining them with selected natural antimicrobials. The natural antimicrobial employed induced noticeable modifications of membrane fatty acid profiles and volatile compounds produced by microbial cells during the growth. The modification of the expression in genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis suggesting that the cytoplasmic membrane of microbial cells is one of the major cellular target of essential oils and their components. The comprehension of microbial stress response mechanisms can contribute to the scaling up of natural antimicrobials and bio-control agents at industrial level...|$|R
