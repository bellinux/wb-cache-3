30|$|When the {{diameter}} of the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> of a wood member was larger than the bolt diameter, the contact conditions between the wood and bolt changed in comparison with the case of no clearance, and the stress distribution along the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> changed as the clearance became larger [41]. The clearance between the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> and bolt had a greater effect on the shear strength of multiple bolted joints than that of single bolted joints, because the clearance prevented uniform loading on all bolts. The results of experiments and analyses showed that the initial stiffness and ultimate load decreased when {{the diameter}} of the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> was larger than the bolt diameter, provided that the ultimate slip increased with an increase in the clearance [38, 42]. The <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> in a wood member produced by a drill had a surface roughness that was dependent on the configuration of the drill and its feed rate. The surface roughness had an effect on the bearing stress, and the maximum load of a specimen with a smooth hole was larger than that with a rough hole [43].|$|E

When a {{bolted joint}} {{with a small}} l/d ratio was subjected to a lateral force {{perpendicular to the grain}}, a significant tensile stress perpendicular to the grain occurred at the <b>lead</b> <b>hole,</b> and that stress was liable to cause splitting failure from the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> {{to the end of the}} wood member [35, 36]. If the end and edge distances were sufficiently large, brittle failure by the splitting of the wood member could be avoided. In addition, if bearing failure rather than splitting failure occurred in a bolted joint, the load would continue to increase with an increase in the slip because of the characteristic behavior of the embedding stress perpendicular to the grain, along with deformation. This tendency was observed in bolted joints with large l/d, e [...]...|$|E

Ten internal bond (IB) specimens of a nominal 50  ×  50  ×  10  mm dimensions were cut from each experimental panel in accordance with EN 319 [35] standard. The average of 10 and 20 measurements were reported for mechanical and physical properties, respectively. A tensile load was applied {{at a rate of}} 1  mm/min and the stress was determined using the load at which the specimen failed. In accordance with ASTM D 1037 [36] guidelines for screw and nail withdrawals, screws and nails were driven into the OSB specimens. The screws were driven through the full thickness of the panel. <b>Lead</b> <b>holes</b> with the diameter of 70 / 100 of screw root diameter and 10  mm depth were opened to the screw points of screw withdrawal specimens. There were no <b>lead</b> <b>holes</b> opened to the nail withdrawal specimens. The nailing set-up was prepared similar to the one used for screws, and a pulling force with a constant speed of 2.5  mm/min was applied until the nails were completely separated from the specimens. Maximum applied force at the point of separation was recorded from the indicator of the test machine. A Universal Testing Machine (Schenk 40  kN) was used to obtain the withdrawal strength of nail and screw fasteners in the specimens with dimension 50  ×  50  ×  10  mm.|$|R

40|$|Monotonic and {{reversed}} {{cyclic loading}} {{tests were conducted}} on dowel-type timber joints {{with varying degrees of}} wood decay due to Fomitopsis palustris (Berk. et Curt.), a brown rot fungus, and the effect of decay on various shear performances of dowel-type joints was investigated. For joints affected by the brown rot fungus, initial stiffness, yield load and maximum load of dowel-type joints were significantly decreased, even with a small mass loss of wood and reductions in shear performance were the largest for initial stiffness, followed by yield load and maximum load, in that order. For a 1 % reduction of the yield load, initial stiffness and maximum load showed reductions of 1. 15 % and 0. 77 %, respectively. When dowel-type joints that had been exposed to the brown rot fungus were subjected to reversed cyclic loading, the gap between the dowel and the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> of the wood was increased and equivalent viscous damping was decreased. These results indicate that decay around the dowel <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> especially affects the load-displacement behavior at small displacement level and dowel-type joints under cyclic loading have very low resistance to forces acting on wooden structure...|$|E

30|$|The {{ultimate}} load of a bolted joint {{parallel to the}} grain with a large l/d ratio was different from its yield load, although the yield embedding strength of wood {{was close to the}} ultimate embedding strength [7, 19, 28]. This occurred because, when the l/d ratio is large, the side members are strongly pressed against the main member by the rope effect {{as a result of the}} increased bending deformation of the bolt. Consequently, the friction between the main and side members is increased, and the {{ultimate load}} of the bolted joint is larger than the yield load. When the bolted joint was forced in a direction perpendicular to the grain, the load increased as the slip progressed because the embedding stress perpendicular to the grain showed a continuous increase after yielding [18 – 20]. When the l/d ratio was large, and the end and edge distances were sufficiently large, the crack failure from the <b>lead</b> <b>hole</b> to the end of the wood specimen was hardly observed in specimens [19, 20]. As a result, although the yield load of a bolted joint perpendicular to the grain was smaller than that parallel to the grain, the ultimate load of the former was sometimes larger than the latter.|$|E
