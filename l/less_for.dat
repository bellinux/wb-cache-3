5|$|Prostitution is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society.

Other public transport operators also offer intermittent discounts for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits on select routes.|$|E

5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the vapor cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion. This value is <b>less</b> <b>for</b> larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
5|$|The tetroxide and {{a related}} {{compound}} potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis, despite being very poisonous. For the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which uses osmate for {{the conversion of}} a double bond into a vicinal diol, Karl Barry Sharpless won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. OsO4 is very expensive for this use, so KMnO4 is often used instead, even though the yields are <b>less</b> <b>for</b> this cheaper chemical reagent.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even <b>less</b> <b>for</b> the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E

30|$|Zeschky et al. (2014) also analyse {{different}} resource-constrained innovation types. They {{distinguish between}} frugal innovation, good-enough innovation, and cost innovation, conceptualising {{the distinctions between}} them. They classify frugal innovation via the criteria technical novelty and market novelty. In their view, frugal innovation has a higher technical novelty and a higher market novelty than good-enough innovation and cost innovation. Also, in their conceptualisation, cost innovation means the same <b>for</b> <b>less,</b> good-enough innovation means tailored <b>for</b> <b>less,</b> and frugal innovation means new <b>for</b> <b>less.</b> Ostraszewska and Tylec (2015) use a similar conceptualisation, with the criteria the same <b>for</b> <b>less,</b> adapted <b>for</b> <b>less,</b> and new <b>for</b> <b>less</b> to distinguish between cost innovation, jugaad innovation, Gandhian innovation, good-enough innovation, and frugal innovation. In their classification, the GE LOGIQ Book Ultrasound Machine {{is an example of}} frugal innovation (new <b>for</b> <b>less),</b> while the city car Tata Nano is an example of Gandhian innovation (adapted for less); elsewhere, the Tata Nano is used as a typical example of frugal innovation (Rao 2013; Tiwari and Herstatt 2014; Wooldridge 2010).|$|R
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road.

5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected <b>less</b> <b>for</b> its cardinal direction than for {{the extent to which it}} was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E
5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or <b>less</b> <b>for</b> this to be possible.|$|E

5|$|In 1798, Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed, <b>less</b> <b>for</b> {{the sake}} of its golden decorations than as a {{political}} gesture to symbolize his victory in conquering the city. French soldiers broke up the carved wooden portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces, carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold. The ship burned for three days, and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold. The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo Civico Correr in Venice, {{and there is a}} detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale. The hull survived and, renamed the Prama Hydra and armed with four cannons, was stationed {{at the mouth of the}} Lido's port where it served as a coastal battery. Subsequently, the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship until it was entirely destroyed in 1824.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps a few thousand feet, so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or <b>less</b> <b>for</b> night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths.

5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} begin the process of {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work <b>less</b> <b>for</b> a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate {{that are used to}} rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level. The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect <b>less</b> <b>for</b> the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending were equally reduced.|$|E
5|$|While Miller was a {{reluctant}} bowler, Bradman used him heavily {{because of his}} desire to have every possible spin option. Miller thus played as a middle-order batsman batting at No. 5 ahead of the wicket-keeper and the other bowlers, and an opening fast bowler, partnering Lindwall. For Victoria, Miller often batted higher at No. 3 or No. 4 and bowled <b>less.</b> <b>For</b> his state, Miller averaged more with the bat, which he felt {{was because he was}} able to concentrate more on his batting, as Hassett gave him a smaller workload with the ball.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and <b>less</b> <b>for</b> electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
5|$|Since Woman of the Year, Hepburn had {{committed}} to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked <b>less</b> <b>for</b> {{the remainder of the}} decade than she had done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter-weekend 1945.|$|E
