5|$|Louche: The <b>louche</b> (耬車) was {{a mobile}} animal-drawn {{agricultural}} seed drill invented by the Chinese agronomist Zhao Guo, a Han official {{in charge of}} agricultural production {{during the reign of}} Han Wudi in the Han dynasty. According to the records of Political Commentator by the Eastern Han dynasty writer Cui Shi, the <b>Louche</b> consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three ditch diggers under it used for sowing. The <b>Louche</b> was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the <b>Louche</b> directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. The machine was known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.|$|E
5|$|The sport enjoyed an {{unprecedented}} surge in popularity during the Regency period {{when it was}} openly patronised by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and his brothers. Championship boxing matches acquired a <b>louche</b> reputation as the places {{to be seen by}} the wealthy upper classes. Thus a match would often be attended by thousands of people, many of whom had wagered money on the outcome. The Duke of Cumberland (an uncle of King George III) was reported to have bet thousands of pounds on Jack Broughton, who was the English champion for 18years.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, changes {{continued}} {{with the building}} of grand houses with grounds. These were bought by merchants and bankers from the City and not infrequently {{by members of the}} Court and their 'associations'.

500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his <b>louche</b> panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his <b>louche</b> panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the weekend}} of 8–9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests of Ward at the Cliveden cottage. That same weekend, at the main house, John and Valerie Profumo were among the large {{gathering}} from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of Ayub Khan, the president of Pakistan. On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Keeler, who had been swimming naked, was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel. She was, Profumo informed his son many years later, [...] "a very pretty girl and very sweet". Keeler did not know, initially, who Profumo was, but was impressed {{that he was the}} husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have [...] "a bit of fun" [...] with him. [...] William Shepherd, a MP trusted by MI5, insisted that over the years he often saw Profumo at <b>louche</b> nightspots, including Murray's Cabaret Club during the time that Keeler had worked there, which made it certain that Profumo knew Keeler before the Clivden party. Shepherd [...] suggested that Profumo was the original owner of the gun used in the shooting incident (see below).|$|E
500|$|The sixth track, [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] {{features}} Robyn rapping, {{which was}} compared to the rapping style of musician Peaches. The song is about Robyn getting arrested for [...] "freaky dancing" [...] to her own song. Ben Norman of About.com called it [...] "a darker version of [...] previous rap songs". Comparisons were also drawn towards [...] "Fembot" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] by Britney Spears. [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album's highlight by several critics. It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering [...] "quotable, ridiculous lines", such as [...] "You know when in Rome I {{sat down with the}} Romans. Said we need a black Pope and she'd better be a woman." [...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features [...] "the teen-pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping <b>louche</b> quips over a relentless, grimy electro stomp." [...] The acoustic [...] "Indestructible" [...] reflects [...] "the downside of needing someone". Norman said that it [...] "is sweeping and symphonic and has so much vulnerability and strength in it that you believe she really will love as if she is indestructible." ...|$|E
500|$|After his {{marriage}} to Tameka Foster, the sexual appeal of his artistry was expected to mature as The New Yorker writer Sasha Frere-Jones writes [...] "The challenge here is to convince us {{that he is a}} married and responsible man—grown and sexy, without sacrificing the <b>louche,</b> frictionless sense of play that made him famous." [...] VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, {{he was one of the}} [...] "Sexiest Men" [...] of 2010, and 2011. Celia Walden criticised Usher for being overly explicit, remarking [...] "the subject of his own sexual prowess, women and lingerie will obliterate any traditional interview technique." [...] In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating [...] "The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon". In 2013, Complex placed him in its [...] "Most Stylish R Singers of the 90's" [...] list. Men's Health magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue with Lou Schuler calling him [...] "the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry". In 2014 and 2015, his Calvin Klein Collection suits saw him listed as [...] "Best Dressed Men" [...] by various outlets at the Golden Globe Awards and Grammy Awards. InStyle magazine rate him both in their [...] "Hottest Celebrity Abs" [...] collection, and their [...] "37 of the Most Stylish Dads" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|Kaleidoscope Dream {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 20 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman hailed it as [...] "2012's most pleasurable pop-R album". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot said Miguel [...] "creates a fluid, dreamscape environment that floats across eras with a connoisseur's discerning {{feel for the}} telling detail." [...] Macpherson wrote in The Guardian of Miguel's occasional [...] "appeal to indie tropes" [...] balanced by [...] "genuinely thoughtful songwriting", while admiring his use of a commercial breakthrough [...] "as a springboard to radically change course". Sean McCarthy from PopMatters wrote that, along with Frank Ocean's Channel Orange, it showed R as the innovative genre in mainstream music during 2012, while Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts said it [...] "offers further evidence of a genre being reborn in 2012." [...] Pitchforks Andrew Ryce hailed Miguel as [...] "the rare vocalist who makes you feel what he's singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent." [...] Alfred Soto of The Quietus was appreciated Miguel's ability to [...] "articulate how a love man can be <b>louche</b> without being a douche." [...] Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe was more critical, finding some of the songs overworked and Miguel [...] "too remote for a true soul singer". New York Times critic Jon Caramanica said Kaleidoscope Dream sounds inconsistent and [...] "a little washed-out, a blend of Prince-isms and slurry grooves", while Kellman complained of the lyrics occasionally veering [...] "too close to 'artsy' teenage erotic poetry".|$|E
2500|$|Wickhambreux via Gore and Sturry to a coal jetty on Plumpudding Island west of Birchington, with spurs {{enabling}} SECR to {{run from}} Canterbury to Birchington and Herne Bay, 1920. This was {{in conjunction with the}} [...] "Birchington Development Co", which proposed to convert that rather <b>louche</b> village resort into a fully fledged town (with no success).|$|E
2500|$|In Turkey, rakı is the [...] {{national}} {{drink and}} is traditionally consumed with chilled {{water on the}} side or partly mixed with chilled water, according to personal preference. Rakı is rarely consumed without the addition of water. Ice cubes are often added. Dilution with water causes rakı to turn a milky-white color, similar to the <b>louche</b> of absinthe. This phenomenon {{has resulted in the}} drink being popularly referred to aslan sütü ("lion's milk"). Since aslan ("lion") is a Turkish colloquial metaphor for a strong, courageous man, this gives the term a meaning close to [...] "the milk for the strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Away from {{court in}} 1666, Mademoiselle regretted not being {{present at the}} {{entertainments}} organised at the Château de Fontainebleau in honour of Queen Marie Thérèse that summer. At the entertainments was a man called Antoine Nompar de Caumont duc de Lauzun, an impoverished nobleman from Guyenne. Close to the king, he was renowned for his wit {{as well as his}} evident [...] "sex appeal", despite being [...] "the smallest man God ever made". He was also a distinguished soldier and was part of the marriage negotiations between Louis XIV and Queen Marie Thérèse. Very opinionated and <b>louche,</b> Lauzun once saw Mademoiselle wearing a red ribbon in her hair and declared it too [...] "youthful" [...] for her, to which the proud Mademoiselle replied [...] "people of my rank are always young".|$|E
2500|$|Bohemian-style absinth is also {{referred}} to as Czech-style absinthe, anise-free absinthe, or just [...] "absinth" [...] (without the [...] "e"), and is best described as a wormwood bitters. It is produced mainly in the Czech Republic, from which it gets its designation as Bohemian or Czech, although not all absinthes from the Czech Republic are Bohemian-style. Bohemian-style absinth typically contains little or none of the anise, fennel, and other herbal flavours associated with traditional absinthe, and thus bears very little resemblance to the absinthes made popular in the 19th century. Typical Bohemian-style absinth has only two similarities with its authentic, traditional counterpart: it contains wormwood and has a high alcohol content. The Czechs are credited with inventing the fire ritual in the 1990s, possibly because Czech absinth does not <b>louche,</b> which renders the traditional French preparation method useless. [...] As such, this type of absinthe and the fire ritual associated with it are entirely modern fabrications, and have little to no relationship with the historical absinthe tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Condomine, a {{successful}} novelist, wishes {{to learn about}} the occult for a novel he is writing, and he arranges for an eccentric medium, Madame Arcati, to hold a séance at his house. [...] At the séance, she inadvertently summons Charles's first wife, Elvira, who has been dead for seven years. [...] Madame Arcati leaves after the séance, unaware that she has summoned Elvira. [...] Only Charles can see or hear Elvira, and his second wife, Ruth, does not believe that Elvira exists until a floating vase is handed to her out of thin air. [...] Elvira is <b>louche</b> and moody, in contrast to the more straight-laced Ruth. [...] The ghostly Elvira makes continued, and increasingly desperate, efforts to disrupt Charles's current marriage. She finally sabotages his car in the hope of killing him so that he will join her in the spirit world, but it is Ruth rather than Charles who drives off and is killed.|$|E
2500|$|For Barbara Brend: Superficially the {{illustrations}} to Jami's stories {{are very similar}} to those of works for Tahmasp; they are complex compositions of a high level of finish, but there are more figures which are slightly grotesque, more youths with a slightly <b>louche,</b> pussycat smile, and a palette which admits more brown and purple tertiary colours. [...] The eye is pulled restlessly over the page from detail to detail. It is as though the painters had lost confidence {{in the power of the}} ostensible narrative subject to interest the viewer, and were searching for other means to hold the attention. [...] Innocence had been lost; the classic works would continue to be illustrated, but only as a vehicle for the painters' skill; they seem no longer to have a mythic hold on the imagination. [...] The future of painting was to lie in more realistic subjects, though their treatment often disguises that realism from us.|$|E
2500|$|When, in August 2007, Sienna and Savannah Miller {{launched}} their own fashion label, Twenty8Twelve (so-called after Sienna's birthday, 28 December), one commentator referred to Sienna's [...] "own brand of Notting Hillbilly chic" [...] (a reference to London W10) and remarked that, [...] "with [...] love {{of all things}} boho, it's unsurprising to see a thread of <b>louche,</b> folksy styling running through the line". However, the same writer observed wryly that [...] "quite how many French peasants hoed fields in printed smocks is undocumented" [...] and felt that one particular shirt-dress was [...] "a little too reminiscent of Nancy in Oliver Twist". The following year, the Sunday Times, noting that one in two Americans and one in five Britons were reportedly sporting tattoos, observed that Miller [...] "complete her luxe-layabout look with a cluster of stars on her silken shoulder"; that she had also a tattoo of a bluebird, the subject of both a poem by Charles Bukowski and a drawing by Edie Sedgwick; and that Kate Moss displayed [...] "two swallows diving into her buttock crack".|$|E
2500|$|Beatlemania did not {{of itself}} create the {{apparent}} iconoclasm of the 1960s; however, as one writer put it, [...] "just as Noël Coward and Cole Porter reflected the <b>louche,</b> carefree {{attitude of the}} [...] Twenties, so did the Beatles' music capture the rhythm of breaking free experienced by {{an entire generation of}} people growing up in the Sixties". By the middle of the decade, British pop music had stimulated the fashion boom of what Time called [...] “swinging London”. Associated initially with such [...] "mod" [...] designs as Quant's mini-skirt, this soon embraced a range of essentially Bohemian styles. These included the military and Victorian fashions popularised by stars who frequented boutiques such as Granny Takes a Trip, the [...] "fusion of fashion, art and lifestyle" [...] opened by Nigel Waymouth in the King's Road, Chelsea in January 1966, and, by 1967, the hippie look largely imported from America (although, as noted, London stores such as Biba had, for some time, displayed dresses that drew on Pre-Raphaelite imagery). The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, whose early girl friend, Linda Keith, had, in her late teens, been a bohemian force in West Hampstead, noted on the Stones' return from an American tour in 1967 how quickly hippiedom had transformed the London scene.|$|E

60|$|Mary {{was full}} of sympathy. Inwardly, too, she was {{relieved}} to find Anne's non-appearance so simply accounted for. She had been vaguely suspicious, {{down there in the}} garden--suspicious of what, she hardly knew; but there had seemed to be something a little <b>louche</b> in the way she had suddenly found herself alone with Ivor. Not that she minded, of course; far from it. But she didn't like the idea that perhaps she was the victim of a put-up job.|$|E
60|$|Sir,--There {{has arrived}} a frightful misunderstanding. The man you have sent {{us is not}} Fosco. Of Fosco he has only the baldness, the air benevolent, and the girth. The brand on his right arm {{is no more than}} the mark of vaccination. Brought before the Commissary of Police, the prisoner, who has not one word of French, was heard through an interpreter. He gives himself the name of Piquouique, rentier, English; and he appeals to his Ambassador. Of papers he had letters bearing the name Samuel Pickwick, and, on his buttons, the letters P.C., which we suspect are the badge of a secret society. But this is not to the point; for it is certain that, {{whatever}} the crimes of this brigand, he is NOT Fosco, but an Englishman. That he should be found in the domicile of Fosco when that droll had evaded is suspicious (<b>louche),</b> and his explanation does not permit itself to be understood. I have fear that we enjoy bad luck, and that M. Palmerston will make himself to be heard on this matter.|$|E
6000|$|He {{sat down}} quickly, and, to avoid further {{recognition}} of his fellows, gazed in front of him. His appearance on Saturdays was always military, by reason of the route march of his Volunteer Corps in the afternoon. Gentleman Fox, who belonged to the corps too, was also looking square; but that commercial traveller on his other side seemed more <b>louche,</b> and as if surprised in immorality, than ever; only the proximity of Gentleman Fox {{on the other side}} kept Mr. Bosengate from shrinking. Then he saw the prisoner being brought in, shadowy and dark behind the brightness of his buttons, and he experienced a sort of shock, this figure was so exactly that which had several times started up in his mind. Somehow he had expected a fresh sight of the fellow to dispel and disprove what had been haunting him, had expected to find him just an outside phenomenon, not, as it were, a part of his own life. And he gazed at the carven immobility of the judge's face, trying to steady himself, as a drunken man will, by looking at a light. The regimental doctor, unabashed by the judge's comment on his absence the day before, gave his evidence like a man who had better things to do, and the case for the prosecution was forthwith rounded in by a little speech from counsel. The matter--he said--was clear as daylight. Those who wore His Majesty's uniform, charged with the responsibility and privilege of defending their country, were no more entitled to desert their regiments by taking their own lives than they were entitled to desert in any other way. He asked for a conviction. Mr. Bosengate felt a sympathetic shuffle passing through all feet; the judge was speaking: ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{has been}} of the {{greatest}} interest, it has been delightful, to me to receive to-night your so generous and informing letter. The poor little pamphlet for which you [...] "thank" [...] me is a helpless and empty thing--for which I should blush were not the condition of its production so legibly stamped upon it. You can't say things unless you {{have been out there}} to learn them, and if you have been out there to learn them you can say them less than ever. With all but utterly nothing to go upon I had to make my remarks practically of nothing, and that the effect of them can only be nil on a subscribing public which wants constant and particular news of the undertakings it has been asked to believe in once for all, I can but too readily believe. The case seems different here--I mean {{on this side of the}} sea--where scores and scores of such like corps are in operation in France--the number of ambulance-cars is many, many thousand, on all the long line--without its becoming necessary for them that their work should be publicly chronicled. I think the greater nearness--here--the strange and sinister nearness--makes much of the difference; various facts are conveyed by personal--unpublished--report, and these sufficiently serve the purpose. What seems clear, at all events, is that there is no devisable means for keeping the enterprise in touch with American sympathy, and I sadly note therefore what you tell me of the inevitable and not distant end. The aid rendered strikes me as having been of the handsomest--as is splendidly the case with all the aid America is rendering, in her own large-handed and full-handed way; of which you tell me such fine interesting things from your own experience. It makes you all seem one vast and prodigious workshop with us--for the resources and the energy of production and creation and devotion here are of course beyond estimation. I imagine indeed that, given your more limited relation to the War, your resources in money are more remarkable--even though here (by which I mean in England, for the whole case is I believe more hampered in France) the way the myriad calls and demands are endlessly met and met is prodigious enough. It does my heart good that you should express yourself as you do--though how could you do anything else?--on behalf of the simply sacred cause, as I feel it, of the Allies; for here at least one needs to feel it so to bear up under the close pressure of all that is so hideous and horrible in what has been let loose upon us. Much of the time one feels that one simply can't--the heart-breaking aspect, the destruction of such masses, on such a scale, of the magnificent young life that was to have been productive and prolific, bears down any faith, any patience, all argument and all hope. I can look at the woe of the bereft, the parents, the mothers and wives, and take it comparatively for granted--that is not care for what they individually suffer (as they seem indifferent themselves, both here and in France, in an extraordinarily noble way.) But the dead loss of such ranks upon ranks of the finest young human material--of life--that is an abyss into which one can simply gaze appalled. And as if that were not enough I find myself sickened to the very soul by the apparent sense of the <b>louche</b> and sinister figure of Mr. Woodrow Wilson, who seems to be aware of nothing but the various ingenious ways in which it is open to him to make difficulties for us. I may not read him right, but most of my correspondents at home appear to, and they minister to my dread of him and the meanness of his note as it breaks into all this heroic air.|$|E
