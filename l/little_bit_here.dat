The episode was met with generally positive reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-, saying [...] "This is Family Guy at its most self-aware—and more importantly, self aware in the right way, taking stock of its place in the world and remaining honest, something it hasn’t done in years. Business-as-usual cutaways add a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>here</b> and there, {{but for the most part}} the standard building blocks of Family Guy humor gets in the way of the introspective main plot." [...] Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five stars, saying [...] "Yet I think because of the fact that the emotions were so complicated, that’s why it was hard to swallow. I certainly had trouble forming coherent thoughts on how to describe my thoughts on this episode, and still am not quite sure how I feel. Still, the fact that this series can pull off this trick of being more than just manatee jokes, I suppose I like being reminded of that fact more than perhaps what I actually watched, which I’m still not completely sure about my feelings on it, to be honest." ...|$|E

[...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away".

Not really a play, {{not really a}} full ‘book’ musical, it is described in the script as ‘A Musical Diversion’, {{and all of the}} music you will hear comes from the period 1894 - 1905. The setting is a very exclusive Gentleman’s Club, which could be in New York, London or even Toronto. The time is 1903, and these are wealthy men, come to pass a little time with ‘the boys’ at their favorite ‘getaway from the fairer sex’ – to paraphrase the gentlemen themselves. Their songs and stories about women show an attitude that would hardly be tolerated in these ‘politically correct’ times.
