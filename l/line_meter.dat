25|$|The {{literary}} tradition of Classical Chinese poetry {{begins with the}} Classic of Poetry, or Shijing, dated to early 1st millennium BC. According to tradition, Confucius (551 BCE – 479 BCE) was the final editor of the collection in its present form, although the individual poems were mostly older than this. Burton Watson dates the anthology's main compilation date to about the 7th century BCE, with the poems having been collected over the previous four to five centuries before. This, among other factors, indicates a sustained cross-class popularity {{for this type of}} poetry, including their characteristic four-character per <b>line</b> <b>meter.</b> The Shijing tends to be associated with northern Chinese vocabulary and culture, and in particular with the great sage and philosopher Confucius: this helped encourage the development of this type of poetry into the classic shi style, the literal meaning of Shijing. Despite their commendation by Confucius, there are no extant samples of any poetry of this style made within the next three hundred years.|$|E
2500|$|The rich {{tradition}} of Chinese poetry began with two influential collections. In northern China, the Shijing or Classic of Poetry (approx. 10th-7th century BC) comprises over 300 poems {{in a variety}} of styles ranging from those with a strong suggestion of folk music to ceremonial hymns. The word shi has the basic meaning of poem or poetry, as well as its use in criticism to describe one of China's lyrical poetic genres. Confucius is traditionally credited with editing the Shijing. Its stately verses are usually composed of couplets with lines of four characters each (or four syllables, as Chinese characters are monosyllabic), and a formal structure of end rhymes. Many of these early poems establish the later {{tradition of}} starting with a description of nature that leads into emotionally expressive statements, known as bi, xing, or sometime bixing. Associated with what was then considered to be southern China, the Chuci is ascribed to Qu Yuan (c. 340-278 BC) and his follower Song Yu (fl. 3rd century BC) and is distinguished by its more emotionally intense affect, often full of despair and descriptions of the fantastic. In some of its sections, the Chu Ci [...] uses a six-character per <b>line</b> <b>meter,</b> dividing these lines into couplets separated in the middle by a strong caesura, producing a driving and dramatic rhythm. Both the Shijing and the Chuci have remained influential throughout Chinese history.|$|E

40|$|Limited {{presence}} of nodal and <b>line</b> <b>meters</b> in distribution grids hinders their optimal operation {{and participation in}} real-time markets. In particular lack of real-time information on the grid topology and infrequently calibrated line parameters (impedances) adversely affect the accuracy of any operational power flow control. This paper suggests a novel algorithm for learning the topology of distribution grid and estimating impedances of the operational lines with minimal observational requirements - it provably reconstructs topology and impedances using voltage and injection measured only at the terminal (end-user) nodes of the distribution grid. All other (intermediate) nodes in the network may be unobserved/hidden. Furthermore no additional input (e. g., number of grid nodes, historical information on injections at hidden nodes) is needed for the learning to succeed. Performance of the algorithm is illustrated in numerical experiments on the IEEE and custom power distribution models...|$|R
