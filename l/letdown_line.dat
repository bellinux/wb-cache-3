50|$|Most paratroopers landed {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of the drop zone and assembled in the South East corner of Luzon Tree Drop Zone. Numerous soldiers who landed in the trees found themselves suspended up to 40 feet above the ground. These soldiers rappelled to the ground by securing a <b>letdown</b> <b>line</b> to the risers of their MC1-1 steerable parachute.|$|E
40|$|This {{proposed}} {{alternative approach}} is to support application of full structural weld overlays (FSWOL) associated with the mitigation of reactor coolant system (RCS) <b>letdown</b> nozzles and <b>lines</b> against Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC). This alternative will provide an {{acceptable level of quality}} and safety. In addition, in this relief request Duke is also asking for NRC pre-approval of the contingent full structural weld overlay for the reactor vessel core flood (CF) and reactor coolant pump (RCP) inlet and outlet (1 /O) nozzles Alloy 82 / 182 butt welds. These nozzles will be volumetrically inspected during the next scheduled refueling outage for each unit. Should indications be identified during the inspection and subsequent qualification is not possible and local repair options are not applicable, full structural weld overlays will be applied to mitigate the potential for PWSCC. This relief request is needed to support the Oconee Unit 1 Fall 2009 refueling outage (1 EOC 25) scheduled to start October 25, 2009. This relief is also intended to apply to Oconee Units 2 and 3, which are scheduled for outages in 2010.
