40|$|Measuring the {{brightness}} of the night sky has become an increasingly important topic in recent years, as artificial lights and their scattering by the Earths atmosphere continue spreading around the globe. Several instruments and techniques have been developed for this task. We give an overview of these, and discuss their strengths and limitations. The different quantities that can and should be derived when measuring the night sky brightness are discussed, as well as the procedures that have been and still need to be defined in this context. We conclude that in many situations, calibrated consumer digital cameras with fisheye lenses provide the best relation between ease-of-use and wealth of obtainable information on the night sky. While they do not obtain full spectral information, they are able to sample the complete sky in a period of minutes, with colour information in three bands. This is important, as given the current global changes in lamp spectra, changes in sky radiance observed only with single band devices may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding long term changes in sky brightness. The acquisition of all-sky information is desirable, as zenith-only information does not provide an adequate characterization of a site. Nevertheless, zenith-only single-band one-channel devices such as the Sky Quality Meter continue to be a viable option for long-term studies of night sky brightness and for studies conducted from a moving platform. Accurate interpretation of such data requires some understanding of the colour composition of the sky light. We recommend supplementing long-term time series derived with such devices with periodic all-sky sampling by a calibrated camera system and calibrated <b>luxmeters</b> or luminance meters.

After years of planting, it is well-known that the duration of grain filling in the two varieties employed for this study is approximaltey 30  days. Based on previous studies, we found that a very strong shading level, corresponding to a 90 % reduction in full natural light (as measured by a <b>Luxmeter,</b> model ZDS- 10, China) resulted in {{a substantial increase in}} pest and diseases damage. Therefore, we employed a shading level equivalent to a 67 % reduction of full natural light (as measured by a, <b>Luxmeter,</b> model ZDS- 10, China) created by one layer of black netting. Four shading treatments were studied: (i) S 0 : the whole phase during grain filling without shading, taken as the control; (ii) S 1 : shading during the whole phase of grain filling (30  days, from October 3 rd to November 2 nd); (iii) S 2 : shading during the early phase of grain filling (15  days, from October 3 rd to October 18 th); (iv) S 3 : shading during the later phase of the grain filling (15  days, from October 18 th to November 2 nd). The whole grain filling stage was from the end of pollination to grain dry-down, that is from R 5 to R 9 in the report Counce et al.

30|$|For the {{subjective}} feeling of comfort, apart from thermal properties, the visual satisfaction is very important. A system {{taking into account}} exterior conditions can reduce the lighting necessities for rooms, thus saving energy. One possibility {{is to improve the}} situation by intelligent blind control. Aligning blinds according to the position of the sun can lead to an improved lighting situation inside a room. This condition can be measured by sensors (e.g., a <b>luxmeter)</b> {{in order to ensure that}} a certain luminosity is provided. The system can, for example, adjust the position of blind lamellae. If this action does not generate a sufficient light intensity, additional artificial lighting can be used to compensate the deficiency. However, it is always important to keep in mind that a user has a need for self-determination. In other words, the user does not like to be patronized by the system. Therefore, actions concerning blind control should preferably be performed when a room is unoccupied. Also in this use case, the weather condition provided by weather forecast services can be taken into account to assure visual comfort. This way reflections can be minimized and a room can be lightened according to its intended usage.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate natural illumination properties of one of the classrooms in the School of Architecture at Izmir Institute of Technology, located in Turkey, which is the northern hemisphere. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the definitions of the basic terms in daylighting, such as daylight factor, illuminance, glazing ratio, are given first. Then, a <b>luxmeter</b> and a lighting simulation software, Velux, are used in order to calculate variable lighting factors during daytime, at different storeys, at different directions, for the classes. Velux is a proprietary software and it enables natural lighting analysis practically. Findings: Chosen classrooms are examined regarding their having sufficient natural illumination. The height of windows from the floor is changed, and the resultant effects on natural lighting in the classrooms are determined by using the lighting simulation program, Velux. The study shows that daylight factor and illumination near the window decreases as the height of the window above the floor increases. However, the illumination increases away from the window, giving greater uniformity to the lighting. At the same time, the usable depth of the classroom increases. The tall and narrow windows bring the daylight near themselves. Social implications: Practical window design decisions can help architects to provide effective and healthy natural lighting for interiors.

40|$|The {{production}} of bright light, with vivid color, {{is the primary}} purpose of signaling, illuminating devices, and fire control purposes. This study, reports on the development of red flame compositions with enhanced performance in terms of luminous intensity, and color quality. The light intensity and the imprint spectra of developed red flame compositions to standard NATO red tracer (R- 284 NATO) were measured using digital <b>luxmeter,</b> and UV–Vis. spectrometer. The main giving {{of this study is that}} the light intensity of standard NATO red tracer was increased by 72 %, the color quality was also improved by 60 % (over the red band from 650 to 780  nm). This enhanced spectral performance was achieved by means of deriving the combustion process to maximize the formation of red color emitting species in the combustion flame. Thanks to the optimum ratio of color source to color intensifier using aluminum metal fuel; this approach offered the highest intensity and color quality. Upon combustion, aluminum was found to maximize the formation SrCL (the main reactive red color emitting species) and to minimize the interfering incandescent emission resulted from MgO and SrO. Quantification of active red color emitting species in the combustion flame was conducted using chemical equilibrium thermodynamic code named ICT. The improvement in red flare performance, established the rule that the color intensifier should be in the range from 10 to 15  Wt % of the total composition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: India has {{carved a}} name for itself as a {{globally}} renowned garment manufacturing center for its durability, quality and beauty. The textile and garment industry contributes about 14 % to industrial production, 5 % to GDP and 11 % to the country’s export earnings. This sector also provides employment to about 45 million people. However, various studies quote that India’s success in the global garments market {{has been at the}} cost of the basic rights of labor force especially the females and migrants. Karnataka is a major apparel sourcing destination for the global market. The garment industries in Karnataka are concentrated mostly in Bengaluru where some of the largest export houses of the country exist. From the systematic review of literature and interactions with the industry experts, it was understood that the work environment in a majority of the garment manufacturing industries is unsafe and unhealthy. The workstations are poorly designed with unsuitable furniture, lack of ventilation, inappropriate lighting, and excessive noise. This poor working environment adversely influences the performance of the workers which in turn reduces the productivity of the manufacturing units. This work deliberates on the environmental audit carried out in several sections of the garment industry to see if the working environment is favorable to the workers. Environmental parameters such as noise level, illumination and temperature were measured using instruments such as sound level meter, <b>luxmeter</b> and hand held thermometer and were compared against OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) standards. The study revealed that the workstations were designed with congeste...|$|E
