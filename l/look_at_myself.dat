500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I be able to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In a way, I've never <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> as a {{woman in}} the business. I've just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> as an editor. I mean, I'm sure I've been turned down because I'm a woman, but then other times I've been used because they wanted a woman editor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I used to cry {{sometimes}} when I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> {{in the glass}} as a child," [...] she confessed. [...] "My hands were {{the only thing that}} consoled me." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in {{the little}} gilt mirror over the mantel-piece. Perhaps because I looked, {{thinking}} of myself as I {{had been in the}} days before these strange happenings had come into my life, I answered his question promptly.|$|R
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
2500|$|Monáe's {{signature}} {{style is}} her tuxedo wardrobe. [...] She said [...] "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could {{be buried in}} it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I {{want to be in}} the Guinness Book of World Records." [...] Monáe's signature look harkens back to dandyism. Citing Grace Jones and Josephine Baker as role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th century look in the classical white and black pattern. Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career when she was employed as a maid as she revealed in her 2012 Black Girls Rock! Young, Gifted, and Black award acceptance speech. Monáe has been known to distribute her Ten Droid Commandments which encourages her fans to be individuals. The Telegraph also commented on her image as an artist saying [...] "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes." [...] She has described her tuxedos as being a uniform for her career. She also featured in the [...] "Style 100" [...] of InStyle magazine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, [...] "The John Ankerberg Show" [...] interviewed Gross in {{reference}} to his continued {{use of the term}} [...] "Mahanta" [...] (the inner spiritual master revered in Eckankar), and he said, [...] "I always <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> as not the Mahanta but a vehicle for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, also, I never confessed," [...] she said, [...] "on {{that same}} occasion, what I must now own to: that I opened the japanned box, {{and took out}} that strange-looking wig inside it, {{and put it on}} and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the glass in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{my mother}} comes," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "Ah! I must be changed.

6000|$|... "Vanity and I have parted company," [...] he explained; [...] "I {{shrink from}} myself when I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> now. The ugliest man living--if {{he has got}} his hearing--is a more {{agreeable}} man in society than I am. Does this wretched place disgust you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I will do so, miladi. [She {{draws the}} blind, {{and the light}} falls brightly on the dressing-table.] But miladi {{will never be able}} to stand it. [She looks at herself in the glass.] Oh, the light of the sun in the morning! I cannot <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's queer," [...] she repeated, [...] "how one {{tries to}} feel {{differently}} from what one really feels, how one tries {{to feel as}} one supposes people expect one to feel. At first I hardly dared <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself....</b> I thought I ought to be sorrowful and helpless.... I am {{not in the least}} sorrowful or helpless....|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese destroyer-commander {{finished}} with, [...] "Yesterday I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in {{a mirror}} for a long time; I was disagreeably surprised to see my face thin, full of wrinkles, and as old as though I were fifty. My clothes (uniform) cover nothing but a skeleton, and my bones are full of rheumatism." ...|$|R
6000|$|I SHALL {{never forget}} the maniacal horror of it all [...] in the end when {{everything}} was me, I knew it all already, I [...] anticipated it all in my soul because I was the author and the result I was the God and the creation at once; creator, I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my creation; created, I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself,</b> the creator: it was a maniacal horror in the end.|$|R
6000|$|Greatly cheered by the idea, I {{seized the}} hair-brushes and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> {{in the glass}} began to use them. Suddenly a hush fell upon the noise outside, and I heard (the ports of my cabin were thrown open)--I heard a deep calm voice, not on board my ship, however, hailing resolutely in English, but with a strong foreign twang, [...] "Go ahead!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "this confessional {{business}} of yours {{has been an}} excellent exercise. It has enabled me to get outside myself, to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> as a Case. Now I can even {{see myself as a}} remote Case. That I needn't bother about further.... So far as that goes, I think we have done all that there is to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{the maiden}} answered: 'My father is feeding me up till I am nice and fat, {{but he does}} not mean to eat me. If I had one of your eyes I would use it for a mirror, and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> before and behind; and your girths should be loosened, and you should be blind--seven days and seven nights.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, to-morrow {{you can go}} to {{the window}} and say, [...] "My father is feeding me up till I am nice and fat, but he does not mean to eat me. If I had one of your eyes I would use it for a mirror, and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> before and behind; and your girths should be loosened, and you should be blind--seven days and seven nights."' ...|$|E
60|$|When I had {{finished}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the shield, I leaned upon the parapet {{staring at the}} sea and wondering how the plains of Aar looked that night beneath this selfsame moon, and whether Freydisa were dead by now, and whom Iduna had married, and if she ever thought of me, or if Steinar came to haunt her sleep.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Feeney was {{inducted}} into the [...] "writers wing" [...] of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. [...] After learning of his Hall of Fame selection, Feeney joked, [...] "I always <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> as a utility infielder in our business. The next thing you know theyre going to be putting Tommy Helms in the Hall of Fame. Im in and Bill Mazeroski isnt. Its unbelievable." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Who {{is talking}} of any fault? I have said nothing as to fault. He was always poor and sickly. The Claverings {{generally}} {{have been so}} strong. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> and Archie, and my sisters. Well, it cannot be helped. Thinking of it will not bring him back again. You had better tell some one to get me something to eat. I came away, of course, without any dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you'd been at Monte Carlo, you'd {{have heard}} them say, God knows how they knew it, {{that it was}} only through me he had his luck at the tables.

I cannot <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> without a shudder of disgust.' ...|$|E
60|$|You see how I grin sometimes. I can't help that. But I {{can put it}} on a lot. I'm not bad, though. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the glass. My {{mouth is}} funny, I know that, and it lops down, and my teeth are bad. You can tell a feeb {{anywhere}} by looking at his mouth and teeth. But that doesn't prove I'm a feeb. It's just because I'm lucky that I look like one.|$|E
6000|$|The Doctor's parting words comforted me as I {{returned}} to the shadeless farmstead {{to share in the}} work of harvesting the grain which was already calling for the reaper, and could not wait either upon sickness or age.

50|$|I made my self-portrait as a {{testimony}} {{so that my}} fellow-countrymen would stay calm.

Well, this is how it was!… It was easy for me to make the portrait of <b>myself</b> … I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror and that's how I painted.|$|R

"I left it behind, in pieces, on the thorns {{and rocks}} along {{a good many}} leagues of trail; but it wasn't extensive--when you travel in this country you have often to choose between food and clothes. It was {{obviously}} impossible to buy any more, but the day before we reached camp I made Crestwick cut my hair.

I expect {{something}} will happen to my nose next." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} I had done on {{returning}} to the Palazzo Orsi was to strip myself of my purple and fine linen, shave my beard and moustache, cut my hair short, put on the clothes of a serving-man, and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> in a mirror. If I had met in the street the image I saw I should have passed on without recognising it. Still I was not dissatisfied with myself, and I smiled as I {{thought that it would}} not be too extraordinary if a lady's wench lost her heart to such a serving-man.|$|E
60|$|All at once I got up {{and rushed}} to Sue's room. I lighted the gas, rummaged, and went to work. I piled my hair {{on top of my}} head, pinned it there, and thrust a long silver dagger through it to hold a couple of pale white roses she had left on her table. Then I put on her last winter's party dress. It was such a pretty pale yellow thing, with touches of black lace, and it didn't matter about its being a little old-fashioned, since it fitted me like a glove. Finally I stepped back and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
