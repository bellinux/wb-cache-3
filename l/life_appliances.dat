40|$|The {{public life}} {{of people in}} most cases are among {{forgotten}} parts of the Persian literature; in other words, most of the poets because of their {{too much attention to}} the kings and their actions and behaviors, followed by their disconnection with the inferior class of the society, have rarely composed poems on the public life of the people. The constitutional revolution to a great extent shifted this balance in favor of the public. In this paper, the anthology of the Kurdish blind poet “Shami” - which deals with the poor class of the society and the issues relating to it from a linguistic and thematic perspective - has been investigated and {{on the basis of the}} issues that embody most in the anthology, the poems relating to the public life have been categorized into four groups: 1. <b>Life</b> <b>appliances</b> and equipment, 2. Number of people, 3. Speech and 4. Customs and etiquette. This investigation showed that Shami is a poet that understands the pains and woes of the people and tries through an eloquent language to express pains and sufferings of his own class in a poetic form, offering it to the public. Hence, he can be called a social poet as suc...|$|E

40|$|<b>Life</b> saving <b>appliances</b> {{are used}} {{throughout}} Canada {{and around the}} world every day by a large number of individuals who work or travel over open water. Personnel rely on these <b>life</b> saving <b>appliances</b> to help provide protection from harsh environments, and reduce the risk of injury or death {{in the event of a}} marine accident. Due to their importance in helping to save lives at sea, <b>life</b> saving <b>appliances</b> are built and tested according to specific standards and regulations to ensure that they provide the level of performance required. Unfortunately, <b>life</b> saving <b>appliances</b> do not always perform as expected which can lead to unexpected injuries or loss of life. Given that <b>life</b> saving <b>appliances</b> must meet specific performance goals as prescribed by standards and regulations, it is often these goals that fall short of what is actually needed during a marine accident. A knowledge gap is created when the testing conditions, as outlined in a standard or regulation, do not accurately reflect those conditions found during a marine accident. As a result, a <b>life</b> saving <b>appliance</b> will often meet performance goals that are below those required to prevent an injury or loss of life during an actual marine accident. The Canadian regulation: 'Life Saving Equipment Regulations' C. R. C., c. 1436 was reviewed and possible knowledge gaps with respect to human factors were identified. The goals and requirements for <b>life</b> saving <b>appliances</b> in the regulation were compared against existing work done in the area of marine safety to determine if what was prescribed adequately reflected what could be found during a marine accident. There were many gaps identified in the regulation, commonly caused by prescriptive wording specifying conditions not commonly found during a marine accident. These knowledge gaps will widen as conditions become more severe than what is prescribed in the regulations possibly leading to even further decrease in <b>life</b> saving <b>appliance</b> performance than what is already measured.

40|$|The term Evacuability (passenger {{evacuation}} performance capability) {{entails a}} wide range of capabilities encompassing evaluation of evacuation time, identification of potential bottlenecks, assessment of accommodation module layout, <b>life</b> saving <b>appliances,</b> passenger familiarisation with a ship’s environment, crew training, effective evacuation procedures/strategies, intelligent decision support systems for crisis management and design/modification for ease of evacuation. From a technical point of view, the mass evacuation of thousands of people from an extremely complex environment with unknown inaccessibility problems exacerbated by (potentially co-existing) incidents such as progressive flooding, cargo shift, foundering, fire/smoke and the inherent uncertainty deriving from unpredictability of human behaviour, is a problem with severe modelling difficulties at system, procedural and behavioural levels. In this respect, Evacuability represents a risk measure of passenger evacuation at sea, expressed as an index.

40|$|ECR International and its {{joint venture}} company, Climate Energy, {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of the effort to deliver residential-scale combined heat and power (Micro-CHP) products to the USA market. Part of this substantial program is focused on the development of a new class of steam expanders that offers the potential for significantly lower costs for small-scale power generation technology. The heart of this technology is the scroll expander, a machine that has revolutionized the HVAC refrigerant compressor industry in the last 15 years. The liquid injected cogeneration (LIC) technology is at the core of the efforts described in this report, and remains an excellent option for low cost Micro-CHP systems. ECR has demonstrated in several prototype appliances that the concept for LIC can be made into a practical product. The continuing challenge is to identify economical scroll machine designs that will meet the performance and endurance requirements needed for a long <b>life</b> <b>appliance</b> application. This report describes the numerous advances made in this endeavor by ECR International. Several important advances are described in this report. Section 4 describes a marketing and economics study that integrates the technical performance of the LIC system with real-world climatic data and economic analysis to assess the practical impact that different factors have on the economic application of Micro-CHP in residential applications. Advances in the development of a working scroll steam expander are discussed in Section 5. A rigorous analytical assessment of the performance of scroll expanders, including the difficult to characterize impact of pocket to pocket flank leakage, is presented in Section 5. 1. This is followed with an FEA study of the thermal and pressure induced deflections that would result from the normal operation of an advanced scroll expander. Section 6 describes the different scroll expanders and test fixtures developed during this effort. Another key technical challenge to the development of a long life LIC system is the development of a reliable and efficient steam generator. The steam generator and support equipment development is described in Section 7. Just one year ago, ECR International announced through its joint venture company, Climate Energy, that it was introducing to the USA market a new class of Micro-CHP product using the state-of-the-art Honda MCHP gas fired internal combustion (IC) engine platform.

This research is going to evaluate the shapes of these waveforms, their harmonics and then to establish a hierarchy among the sources on the basis of characteristics of their resultant output waveforms. For the purpose mentioned above, a very high range digital oscilloscope with ultra zoom capabilities has been used.

There are six items for each aspect of these daily activities which are relevant to Hong Kong society. The Hong Kong Chinese Everyday Competence Scale was completed by 204 people aged 60 years or older who attend the social centers for the elderly in Hong Kong. Firstly, reliability (internal consistency) of the Hong Kong Chinese Everyday Competence Scale was found to be excellent. Concurrent validity was also established by strong correlations between the Hong Kong Chinese Everyday Competence Scale and two global measures of cognitive ability, namely the Mini-Mental State Examination and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Moreover, we have also found significant association between the Hong Kong Chinese Everyday Competence Scale and three tests of Primary Mental Abilities (number skill test, spatial relation test and inductive reasoning test).

This paper aims to evaluate the economic feasibility of purchasing labeled refrigerators instead of inefficient ones, from the consumer's point of view, considering actual market conditions and buying in cash or financing. The evaluation of energy saving was done for 22 different models of refrigerators and the economy was calculated considering the retail price in the Brazilian market and two actual electricity tariffs, taking into account, respectively, high and low household electricity consumption. The effect of ambient temperature on refrigerator performance was evaluated in two conditions: according to the Brazilian standard for performance tests (32 Â Â°C) and using the average temperature of Southern Brazil (18 Â Â°C), the mildest region.

40|$|In {{electronic}} equipments, {{thermal management}} is indispensable for its longevity and hence it is once {{of the important}} topics of current research. These electronic equipments are virtually synonyms with modern <b>life,</b> for instance <b>appliances,</b> instruments and computer specifications. The dissipation of heat is necessary for its proper function. The heat is generated by the resistance encountered by electric current. This has been further hastened by the continued miniaturization of electronic systems which causes increase {{in the amount of}} heat generation per unit volume by many folds. Unless proper cooling arrangement is designed, the operating temperature exceeds permissible limit. As a consequence, chances of failure get increased. A typical electronic system consists of several wire boards, known as printed circuit board (PCB), on which large numbers of components are mounted. These PCBs are housed in an enclosure to protect them from detrimental affect of environment, and also to protect users from electronic hazards. The enclosure has large number of vents on it to facilitate passage of cooling air. The flow of air over the components is maintained either by fan or by free convection generated due to heated components. The rate of the cooling of components strongly depends on the shape and size of the enclosure, and also on the shape, size and location of vents. The objective of the present study is to investigate the influences of these parameters on cooling of the components.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} research {{project was to}} contribute to existing theory on product related consumer socialization, more specifically concerning young upcoming consumers in {{a third world country}} like the Republic of South Africa. Problems that are experienced by inexperienced consumers were discussed within the context of changing socio political conditions in recent years, which have resulted in the adoption of different lifestyles and spending patterns of previously disadvantaged consumers. During the past decade the living conditions of especially black consumers have improved considerably. Better jobs and higher incomes have resulted in access to home ownership and consequently also the acquisition of expensive, durable commodities such as household appliances to support and reflect their new lifestyles. Unfortunately limited product related exposure and experience might contribute to specific problems {{that need to be addressed}} by professionals in Consumer Science in order to contribute to informed, responsible buyer decisions in the market place. The intention was to suggest strategies through which inexperienced consumers could be assisted to cope in a very competitive and materialistic world. The research was positivistic in nature and was conducted within a quantitative paradigm although qualitative methods were included to verify the content and structure of the questionnaire. The geographic area in which the study was conducted, was conveniently located near the University of Pretoria. Unfortunately difficult access to potential participants because of security issues made it difficult to recruit participants. Most of the contacts were made during the evenings. Financial constraints were experienced: participants were unwilling to participate without an incentive and the researcher had to make provision for small gifts as a token of appreciation. Time was another limiting factor: data collection had to be done within a limited period because this study formed part of a larger research project that involved other students and different samples. Field workers were trained to assist with the data collection. The system’s theory was used to direct the content and discussions of the study: product related consumer socialization (i. e. appliance ownership and product experience) was thus considered as an input that affected consumers’ product knowledge and their consequent ability to transform product cues in terms of product decisions which would reflect informed, responsible buyer decisions, or the contrary (outcome). Findings confirmed participants’ limited product related consumer socialization. Limited experience with appliances was evident from limited ownership of most of the appliances over time, except for refrigerators and stoves. Participants’ impression of the usefulness of appliances in households was confirmed by their apparent enthusiasm to acquire almost all of the major appliances that were listed in the future. The product knowledge test confirmed participants’ limited ability to conclude informed buyer decisions and explicated their unrealistic expectations of the service <b>life</b> of <b>appliances</b> as well as their apparent reliance on surrogate indicators to judge the quality of appliances. When participants were confronted with a product complaint scenario, most of the complaints could be ascribed to incorrect use of appliances and/or ignorance, which supported the notion that these consumers would not be able to conclude responsible buyer decisions. A concerted effort by retail to provide augmented customer service in the retail environment so that consumers could be facilitated at point of purchase is recommended. It is also proposed that consumers’ limited product knowledge and the problems that they have indicated concerning the use of appliances should be addressed to enhance informed and responsible buyer and user behaviour.

40|$|A primary {{justification}} {{for the establishment of}} energy efficiency standards for home appliances is the existence of information deficiencies and externalities in the market for appliances. For example, when a long-term homeowner purchases a new gas-fired water heater, she will maximize the value of her purchase by comparing the life-cycle cost of ownership of available units, including both total installed cost - purchase price plus installation costs - and operating cost in the calculus. Choice of the appliance with the lowest life-cycle costs leads to the most economically efficient balance between capital cost and fuel cost. However, if the purchaser's expected period of ownership is shorter than the useful <b>life</b> of the <b>appliance,</b> or the purchaser does not pay for the fuel used by the appliance, {{as is often the case}} with rental property, fuel cost will be external to her costs, biasing her decision toward spending less on fuel efficiency and resulting in the purchase of an appliance with greater than optimal fuel usage. By imposing an efficiency standard on appliances, less efficient appliances are made unavailable, precluding less efficient purchases and reducing fuel usage. The reduction in fuel demanded by residential users affects the total demand for such fuels as natural gas, for example. Reduced demand implies that residential customers are willing to purchase less gas at each price level. That is, the demand curve, labeled D{sub 0 } in Figure 1, shifts to the left to D{sub 1 }. If there is no change in the supply function, the supply curve will intersect the demand curve at a lower price. Residential demand is only one component of the total demand for natural gas. It is possible that total demand will decline very little if demand in other sectors increases substantially in response to a decline in the price. If demand does decrease, modeling studies generally confirm the intuition that reductions in demand for natural gas will result in reductions in its price as seen at the wellhead (Wiser 2007). The magnitude of the effect on price relative to the demand reduction, and the mechanism through which it occurs, is less well established. This report attempts to quantify the potential effects of reduced demand for natural gas in the residential sector, in response to the implementation of an energy efficiency standard for water heaters...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the proceedings and {{findings of the}} project 2 ̆ 01 cEvaluation of Exposure Time until Recovery by Location, 2 ̆ 01 d which was funded by Transport Canada. The study involved the investigation of potential exposure times at eight locations dispersed throughout northern Canada. Exposure time, as defined in this report, relates to the total time from which an alert notification of an emergency event is sent, to when a rescue is affected. The primary goal {{of this study was}} to identify and assess key factors that influence the exposure time by quantifying the effect where possible. In order to evaluate exposure time and the numerous factors that can influence this time, a twopart study was conducted. This approach allowed us to obtain experienced based quantitative and qualitative information relating to the potential exposure times and related factor effects. The first component of the study involved the development of a two-part survey which was distributed to experts in the area of marine-based SAR resources as well as air-based SAR resources. The first part of the survey was a questionnaire which prompted responses relating to the effect of key factors at the different locations considered. The second part of the survey, termed as the factor ranking sheet, listed the key factors that had been identified through a literature review and requested that they be ranked in terms of their potential to increase exposure time. The second part of the study involved hosting a workshop to present the consolidated results of the exposure time survey, the details of the methodology that was applied to the consolidated results in order to determine the range in exposure time at each location and finally, the resulting exposure time range values. The workshop was attended by representatives of JRCC Trenton and JRCC Halifax as well as other representatives with experience in marine or air based northern operations. The workshop allowed for refinement of the survey-based exposure time ranges based on an open discussion of the factors considered as well as identification of other factors that were not captured through the survey. The workshop findings were applied to the survey-based exposure time ranges which resulted in the final survey plus workshop based exposure time range values. These range values are applicable to the conditions under which they were investigated and are subject to change if the actual conditions are vastly different. One such condition relates to the time of year for which the exposure time ranges were defined. The marine-based exposure times may differ greatly for different periods of the year since the strategic positioning of CCG vessels can change dramatically. The conditions and assumptions surrounding the defined exposure time ranges should be considered when contemplating the exposure times indicated. The final exposure times indicated that the minimum of the low-range exposure time values was 13 hours and this related to locations 6 and 8. The maximum of the low-range exposure time values was 27 hours which occurred at location 1, the most northerly of the locations considered. Another interesting point is that when considering marine resources only, the maximum lowrange exposure time jumps to 48 hours and occurs at location 1. Survival in the harsh environmental conditions of northern Canada even at the minimum predicted exposure times would be challenging. Efforts to ensure that operations in these locations are equipped with adequate emergency and survival equipment is essential to help prevent loss of life, given the exposure times that can be expected in these areas. This could be supported by strengthening policy and regulation relating to operational requirements and <b>Life</b> Saving <b>Appliance</b> testing conditions. This partial solution could be complemented by the more costly alternative of enhancing Canada 2 ̆ 019 s search and rescue capabilities in the north. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|When {{consumers}} with limited product related consumer socialization migrate to more affluent communities and adopt new life styles later in life, {{they have to}} deal with a choice explosion that manifests as the paradox of progress and creates fertile ground for exploitation in the market place. Limited evidence could be found of how inexperienced consumers judge the quality of products as an indication of product reliability. This research was part of a larger research project that focused on major household appliances as a desirable commodity in modern households. This part of the project specifically aimed to identify the indicators (extrinsic factors) that are used to discriminate the quality of appliances during pre purchase evaluation. It was hypothesized that limited consumer socialization may result in a dependence on hedonics/ surrogate indicators of quality to compromise for the absence of appropriate product knowledge and personal product experience. A positivistic orientated research project that implemented a combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques was designed to determine the quality judgment of major household appliances of more mature, previously deprived consumers in a specific geographical area. Experience with electricity and ownership of appliances were used to identify and recruit suitable individuals for participation. Supportive theory for this research included the theory of consumer socialization including product related consumer socialization, as well as the basic theory of consumer decision-making as it applies to quality judgment of major household appliances during pre-purchase evaluation. The inexperience of consumers in this part of the project was confirmed by their limited experience with electricity in their own households and limited ownership of appliances over time. A lamentable discrepancy was found between the anticipated and the reported service life figures for a list of 13 appliances. Although replacement purchases may be influenced by socio-economic variables, product characteristics and time factors, an upsetting low average service <b>life</b> for major <b>appliances</b> was calculated. Premature replacements could signify several problems e. g. irresponsible choice behaviour; poor after sales service, ignorance in terms of maintenance and care. Inexperienced consumers may for example also have unrealistic expectations. In terms of the criteria that are used to discriminate quality, BRAND NAME is apparently relied on strongly by all consumers, irrespective of their experience and socio economic status, which confirmed Dawar and Parker’s (1994) view of the existence of criteria of so-called “universal importance”. The inexperienced consumers in this part of the project revealed a significant higher reliance on surrogate indicators of quality such as PRICE, GUARANTEE and ADVERTISING. In terms of the product knowledge test that was included, the mean score for the sample was calculated to give an indication of participants’ potential to conclude informed buyer decisions in terms of knowledge of certain basic functional and performance attributes of appliances. Inexperienced consumers’ score in terms of product knowledge was alarmingly low. This confirms the theory of product related consumer socialization that proposes limited product knowledge with limited product related experience. Findings revealed a remarkable incongruity with respect to participants’ personal rating of the importance of quality in terms of the evaluation of household appliances and their apparent ability to do so. Only 3. 2 % of the older inexperienced consumers indicated quality per se to be of LITTLE or NO IMPORTANCE. The rest regarded it as very IMPORTANT or VERY IMPORTANT. When confronted with specific questions and tasks relating to product evaluation and quality judgment, the participants could not convince that they had the relevant product knowledge to discriminate quality in order to conclude informed, responsible buyer decisions with respect to major household appliances. In terms of the larger project, reliance on surrogate indicators during quality judgment manifested stronger among the inexperienced consumer groups. Findings also support Erdem et al (1999) who reported that materialistic values of aspirational groups generally result in dominance of social factors during product evaluation.
