40|$|Background: Multidrug {{resistance}} {{can be a}} {{major obstacle}} to successful cancer chemotherapy and {{is often associated with}} increased expression of the mdrl (also known as P-glycoprotein) gene. Some of the proteins produced by the body's immune system, i. e., cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) and interleukin 2 (IL- 2), have been shown to modulate multidrug resistance. However, cytokines ad-ministered by the conventional intravenous method can cause severe side effects. Transduction of cytokine genes into tumor cells constitutes an alternative approach for produc-tion and release of the cytokine proteins in the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment,</b> which may reduce problems of toxicity associated with systemic administration.

40|$|CTLs {{have the}} {{potential}} to attack tumors, and adoptive transfer of CTLs can lead to tumor regression in mouse models and human clinical settings. However, the dynamics of tumor cell elimination during efficient T cell therapy is unknown, and it is unclear whether CTLs act directly by destroying tumor cells or indirectly by initiating the recruitment of innate immune cells that mediate tumor damage. To address these questions, we report real-time imaging of tumor cell apoptosis in vivo using intravital 2 -photon microscopy and a Förster resonance energy transfer–based (FRET-based) reporter of caspase 3 activity. In a mouse model of solid tumor, we found that tumor regression after transfer of in vitro–activated CTLs occurred primarily through the direct action of CTLs on each individual tumor cell, with a minimal bystander effect. Surprisingly, the killing of 1 target cell by an individual CTL took an extended period of time, 6 hours on average, which suggested that the slow rate of killing intrinsically limits the efficiency of antitumor T cell responses.

30|$|The rapidly {{advancing}} {{field of}} clinical oncolytic virotherapy is itself coming {{to be understood}} as a unique type of immunotherapy. Oncolytic viruses are naturally occurring or genetically modified viruses that infect, replicate in, and kill cancer cells without harming normal cells [10]. Recent decades have seen dramatic advances in gene manipulation capabilities and thus improvements in vector design [11]. Additionally, the understanding of how an oncolytic adenovirus alters the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> (TME) has led some to think of the field as ‘oncolytic immunotherapy’. Following viral infection, there are increased levels of local cytokine expression as well as an influx of immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells, activated T cells, and antigen presenting cells (APC) [12]. Furthermore, PD-L 1 expression is known to increase on tumor and immune cells following viral infection [13]. Taken together, these changes alter the local TME and change it from ‘cold’ to ‘hot’ with a flood of cytokines and immune effectors.|$|E
40|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} determines development and progression of many cancers. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) {{is fundamental to}} tumor progression and metastasis not only by increasing invasiveness but also by increasing resistance to cell death, senescence, and various cancer therapies; determining inflammation and immune surveillance; and conferring stem cell properties. It does this by enabling polarized epithelial cells to transform into cells with a mesenchymal, and therefore motile, phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key cells of the {{tumor microenvironment}} that orchestrate the connection between inflammation and cancer. Activation of EMT often requires crosstalk between cancer cells and components of the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment,</b> including TAMs. In this review, clinical and experimental evidence is presented for control of TAMs in promoting cancer cell invasion and migration and their interaction with the EMT process in the metastatic cascade.

40|$|Background: Gliomas are {{the most}} common primary brain tumor in both {{children}} and adults. The prognosis for glioblastoma (GBM), {{the most common type of}} malignant glioma, has remained dismal, with median survival a little over one year despite maximal therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Although immunotherapy has become increasingly successful against many systemic tumors, clinical efficacy against brain tumors has been limited. One reason for this is an incomplete understanding of the <b>local</b> immunologic <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment,</b> particularly the function of large numbers of infiltrating myeloid derived cells. Monocytes/microglia are myeloid derived immunomodulatory cells, and they represent the predominant infiltrating immune cell population in gliomas. Our group has previously demonstrated using complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches that GBM tumor cells polarize tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs) and suppress their immunostimulatory function. Methods and Results: To better understand the mechanisms responsible for this immunosuppression, we used gene expression profiling of stimulated monocytes in the presence or absence of GBM tumor cells. Our analysis identified caveolin- 1 (CAV 1), a plasma membrane molecule with pleiotropic functions, as significantly up-regulated in monocytes in the presence of GBMs. We validated these findings ex vivo by confirming up-regulation of CAV 1 in TAMs isolated from GBMs immediately after surgical resection.

Here, we show that intravenous treatment with the same ASMEL VSV-cDNA library was an effective treatment for established intra-cranial (i. c.) melanoma brain tumors. The optimal combination of antigens identified from the ASMEL which treated s. c. B 16 tumors (VSV-N-RAS+VSV-CYTC-C+VSV-TYRP- 1) was ineffective against i. c. B 16 brain tumors. In contrast, combination of VSV-expressed antigens—VSV-HIF- 2 α+VSV-SOX- 10 +VSV-C-MYC+VSV-TYRP 1 —from ASMEL which was highly effective against i. c.

40|$|Glioblastomas (GBM) are {{the most}} {{malignant}} brain tumors, which are thought to originate from neoplastic transformation of glial cells. These tumors are characterized with highly infiltrative growth, neovascularization, and radio- and chemoresistance. In spite of current therapy including surgical resection of the tumor and chemo/radio therapy, patient's prognosis is still poor and median survival is about 15 months. Certain non-tumor cells present in the GBM microenvironment participate in tumor progression using mechanisms contributing to the local and systemic immunosuppression. Critical roles in the immune escape of GBM have the regulatory T-cells (Tregs), the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Immunosuppressive mechanisms in GBM are conducted through direct cell-mediated contacts and soluble mediators secreted by tumor-associated cells into the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> and circulating blood.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that the acidity of solid tumors {{contributes}} to local invasion and metastasis. Oral pH buffers can specifically neutralize the acidic pH of tumors and reduce the incidence of local invasion and metastatic formation in multiple murine models. However, this effect is not universal as we have previously observed that metastasis is not inhibited by buffers in some tumor models, regardless of buffer used. B 16 -F 10 (murine melanoma), LL/ 2 (murine lung) and HCT 116 (human colon) tumors are resistant to treatment with lysine buffer therapy, whereas metastasis is potently inhibited by lysine buffers in MDA-MB- 231 (human breast) and PC 3 M (human prostate) tumors. In the current work, we confirmed that sensitive cells utilized a pH-dependent mechanism for successful metastasis supported by a highly glycolytic phenotype that acidifies the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> resulting in morphological changes. In contrast, buffer-resistant cell lines exhibited a pH-independent metastatic mechanism involving constitutive secretion of matrix degrading proteases without elevated glycolysis.

TIF is formed by transcapillary filtration, and since this fluid is not readily available we discuss available techniques for TIF isolation, results from subsequent characterization and implications of recent findings with respect to fluid filtration and uptake of macromolecular therapeutic agents. There appear to be local gradients in signaling substances from neoplastic tissue to plasma that may provide new understanding of tumor biology.

We report the results from the first clinical trial, to our knowledge, using a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing B 7. 1 (rV-B 7. 1) for monthly intralesional vaccination of accessible melanoma lesions. A standard 2 -dose–escalation phase I clinical trial was conducted with 12 patients. The approach was well tolerated with only low-grade fever, myalgias, and fatigue reported and 2 patients experiencing vitiligo. An objective partial response was observed in 1 patient and disease stabilization in 2 patients, 1 of whom is alive without disease 59 months following vaccination.

40|$|AbstractThe {{endogenous}} mediator of vasodilation, {{nitric oxide}} (NO), {{has been shown}} to be a potent radiosensitizer. However, the underlying mode of action for its role as a radiosensitizer – while not entirely understood – is believed to arise from increased tumor blood flow, effects on cellular respiration, on cell signaling, and on the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), that can act as radiosensitizers in their own right. NO activity is surprisingly long-lived and more potent in comparison to oxygen. Reports of the effects of NO with radiation have often been contradictory leading to confusion about the true radiosensitizing nature of NO. Whether increasing or decreasing tumor blood flow, acting as radiosensitizer or radioprotector, the effects of NO have been controversial. Key to understanding the role of NO as a radiosensitizer is to recognize the importance of biological context. With a very short half-life and potent activity, the local effects of NO need to be carefully considered and understood when using NO as a radiosensitizer. The systemic effects of NO donors can cause extensive side effects, and also affect the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment,</b> both directly and indirectly. To minimize systemic effects and maximize effects on tumors, agents that deliver NO on demand selectively to tumors using hypoxia as a trigger may be of greater interest as radiosensitizers.

30|$|Advances in the {{understanding}} of cancer immunotherapy and the development of multiple checkpoint inhibitors have dramatically changed the current landscape of cancer treatment. Recent large-scale phase III trials (e.g. PHOCUS, OPTiM) are establishing use of oncolytic viruses as another tool in the cancer therapeutics armamentarium. These viruses do not simply lyse cells to achieve their cancer-killing effects, but also cause dramatic changes in the tumor immune microenvironment. This review will highlight the major vector platforms that are currently in development (including adenoviruses, reoviruses, vaccinia viruses, herpesviruses, and coxsackieviruses) and how they are combined with checkpoint inhibitors. These vectors employ a variety of engineered capsid modifications to enhance infectivity, genome deletions or promoter elements to confer selective replication, and encode a variety of transgenes to enhance anti-tumor or immunogenic effects. Pre-clinical and clinical data have shown that oncolytic vectors can induce anti-tumor immunity and markedly increase immune cell infiltration (including cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells) into the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment.</b> This “priming” by the viral infection can change a ‘cold’ tumor microenvironment into a ‘hot’ one with the influx of a multitude of immune cells and cytokines. This alteration sets the stage for subsequent checkpoint inhibitor delivery, as they are most effective in an environment with a large lymphocytic infiltrate. There are multiple ongoing clinical trials that are currently combining oncolytic viruses with checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. CAPTIVE, CAPRA, and Masterkey- 265), and the initial results are encouraging.

This migration of tumor cells begins with a remodeling of the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment,</b> including changes to the extracellular matrix and the recruitment of stromal cells, both of which facilitate invasion of tumor cells into the bloodstream. In breast cancer, it has been proposed that the alignment of collagen fibers surrounding tumor epithelial cells can serve as a quantitative image-based biomarker for survival of invasive ductal carcinoma patients. Specific types of collagen alignment have been identified for their prognostic value and now these tumor associated collagen signatures (TACS) are central to several clinical specimen imaging trials. Here, we implement the semi-automated acquisition and analysis of this TACS candidate biomarker and demonstrate a protocol that will allow consistent scoring to be performed throughout large patient cohorts. Methods: Using large field of view high resolution microscopy techniques, image processing and supervised learning methods, we are able to quantify and score features of collagen fiber alignment with respect to adjacent tumor-stromal boundaries. Results: Our semi-automated technique produced scores that have statistically significant correlation with scores generated by a panel of three human observers. In addition, our system generated classification scores that accurately predicted survival in a cohort of 196 breast cancer patients. Feature rank analysis reveals that TACS positive fibers are more well-aligned with each other, are of generally lower density, and terminate within or near groups of epithelial cells at larger angles of interaction. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the utility of a supervised learning protocol for streamlining the analysis of collagen alignment with respect to tumor stromal boundaries...|$|E

This dissertation interrogates methods to target the tumor microenvironment including two novel studies describing mechanisms of buffer therapy resistance and targeting tumor hypoxia with vasodilators to enhance the efficacy of a hypoxia activated prodrug, TH- 302. In the first study, mechanisms of buffer therapy resistance were identified and detailed. Many {{studies have shown that}} the acidity of solid tumors contributes to local invasion and metastasis. Oral pH buffers can specifically neutralize the acidic pH of tumors and reduce the incidence of local invasion and metastatic formation in multiple murine models. However, this effect is not universal as we have previously observed that metastasis is not inhibited by buffers in some tumor models, regardless of the buffer used. B 16 -F 10 (murine melanoma), LL/ 2 (murine lung) and HCT 116 (human colon) tumors are resistant to treatment with lysine buffer therapy, whereas metastasis is potently inhibited by lysine buffers in MDA-MB- 231 (human breast) and PC 3 M (human prostate) tumors. In the current work, I confirmed that sensitive cells utilized a pH-dependent mechanism for successful metastasis supported by a highly glycolytic phenotype that acidifies the <b>local</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> resulting in morphological changes. In contrast, buffer-resistant cell lines exhibited a pH-independent metastatic mechanism involving constitutive secretion of matrix degrading proteases without elevated glycolysis. These results have identified two distinct mechanisms of experimental metastasis, one of which is pH-dependent (buffer therapy sensitive cells) and one which is pH-independent (buffer therapy resistant cells). Further characterization of these models has potential for therapeutic benefit. In the second study, improving the efficacy of hypoxia activated prodrug, TH- 302, through induction of hypoxia was investigated. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are desmoplastic and hypoxic tumors, both of which are associated with poor prognosis. Hypoxia activated prodrugs, such as TH- 302, are specifically activated in hypoxic environments and are now in a Phase III clinical trial in pancreatic cancer. Using animal models, we show that tumor hypoxia can be exacerbated using a vasodilator, hydralazine, improving TH- 302 efficacy. Hydralazine reduces tumor blood flow through the 2 ̆ 2 Steal 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon, where atonal immature tumor vasculature fails to dilate in coordination with normal vasculature. The current study shows that MiaPaCa- 2 tumors exhibit a 2 ̆ 2 Steal 2 ̆ 2 effect in response to hydralazine, resulting in decreased tumor blood flow and subsequent tumor pH reduction. The effect is not observed in SU. 86. 86 tumors with mature tumor vasculature, as measured by CD 31 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) immunohistochemistry staining. Combination therapy of hydralazine and TH- 302 resulted in a reduction in MiaPaCa- 2 tumor volume growth after 18 days of treatment. Further optimization of hypoxia-inducing agents and dosing regimens may lead to increased TH- 302 activity, potentially improving clinical outcome. The data presented here demonstrate methods to effectively target the tumor microenvironment for therapeutic benefit. Further investigation into mechanisms of action and biomarkers for therapy response may have important implications on clinical treatment regimens for cancer patients...|$|E

Chemoresistance is influenced by genetic and epigenetic alterations which affect drug uptake, metabolism and export of drugs at the cellular levels. While most research has focused on tumor cell autonomous mechanisms of chemoresistance, the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> has emerged as a key player in the development of chemoresistance and in malignant progression, thereby influencing the development of novel therapies in clinical oncology. It {{is not surprising that the}} study of the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> is now considered to be as important as the study of tumor cells. Recent advances in technological and analytical methods, especially ‘omics’ technologies, has made it possible to identify specific targets in tumor cells and within the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> to eradicate cancer. Tumors need constant support from previously ‘unsupportive’ microenvironments. Novel therapeutic strategies that inhibit such microenvironmental support to tumor cells would reduce chemoresistance and tumor relapse. Such strategies can target stromal cells, proteins released by stromal cells and non-cellular components such as the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment.</b> Novel in vitro tumor biology models that recapitulate the in vivo <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> such as multicellular tumor spheroids, biomimetic scaffolds and tumor organoids are being developed and are increasing our understanding of cancer cell-microenvironment interactions. This review offers an analysis of recent developments on the role of the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> in the development of chemoresistance and the strategies to overcome microenvironment-mediated chemoresistance. We propose a systematic analysis of the relationship between tumor cells and their respective <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironments</b> and our data show that, to survive, cancer cells interact closely with <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> components such as mesenchymal stem cells and the extracellular matrix...|$|R

In recent years, people have made advances in understanding characteristics and functions of <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> and its role in different processes of tumor. In this paper, we describe the effects of <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> on glioma proliferation, invasion and treatments.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of tumor cells with the microenvironment {{is like a}} relationship between the “seeds” and “soil,” which is a hotspot in recent cancer research. Targeting at <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> as well as tumor cells has become a new strategy for cancer treatment. Conventional cancer treatments mostly focused on single targets or single mechanism (the seeds or part of the soil); few researches intervened in the whole <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> and achieved ideal therapeutic effect as expected. Traditional Chinese medicine displays a broad range of biological effects, and increasing evidence has shown that it may relate with synergistic effect on regulating <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> and cancer cells. Based on literature review and our previous studies, we summarize the synergistic effect and the molecular mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine on regulating <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> and cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|Colon cancer {{development}} and malignant progression {{are driven by}} genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor cells and by factors from the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment.</b> Cancer cells become reliant on the activity of specific oncogenes and on prosurvival and proliferative signals they receive from the abnormal environment they create and reside in. Accordingly, the response to anticancer therapy is determined by genetic and epigenetic changes that are intrinsic to tumor cells and by the factors present in the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment.</b> Recent advances {{in the understanding of}} the involvement of the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> in <b>tumor</b> progression and therapeutic response are optimizing the application of prognostic and predictive factors in colon cancer. Moreover, new targets in the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> that are amenable to therapeutic intervention have been identified. Because stromal cells are with rare exceptions genetically stable, the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> has emerged as a preferred target for therapeutic drugs. In this review, we discuss the role of stromal fibroblasts and macrophages in colon cancer progression and in the response of colon cancer patients to therapy...|$|R
40|$|Cancers are {{heterogeneous}} tissues {{comprised of}} multiple components, including <b>tumor</b> cells and <b>microenvironment</b> cells. The <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> has {{a critical role}} in tumor progression. The <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> is comprised of various cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages and immune cells, as well as extracellular matrix and various cytokines and growth factors. Fibroblasts are the predominant cell type in the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment.</b> However, neither the derivation of tissue-specific cancer-associated fibroblasts nor markers of tissue-specific cancer-associated fibroblasts are well defined. Despite these uncertainties it is increasingly apparent that cancer-associated fibroblasts have a crucial role in tumor progression. In breast cancer, there is evolving evidence showing that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts are actively involved in breast cancer initiation, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts also play {{a critical role in}} metabolic reprogramming of the <b>tumor</b> <b>microenvironment</b> and therapy resistance.
