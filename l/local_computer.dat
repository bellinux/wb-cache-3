25|$|Conventional PCI, often {{shortened}} to PCI, is a <b>local</b> <b>computer</b> bus for attaching hardware {{devices in}} a computer. PCI is the initialism for Peripheral Component Interconnect and {{is part of}} the PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} are {{individual}} utilities that allow a user {{to take control}} of a remote computer over the network. In case of Remote Assistance, the remote user needs to receive an invitation and the control is cooperative. In case of RDC, however, the remote user opens a new session on the remote computer and has every power granted by its user account's rights and restrictions. Fast User Switching allows users to switch between user accounts on the <b>local</b> <b>computer</b> without quitting software and logging out. Fast User Switching is part of Winlogon and uses RDS to accomplish its switching feature. Third-party developers have also created client software for RDS. For example, rdesktop supports Unix platforms.|$|E

25|$|Currently most {{operating}} systems support {{a variety of}} networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar {{operating systems}} can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the <b>local</b> <b>computer.</b> This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.|$|E
25|$|With version 6.0, if the Desktop Experience {{component}} is {{plugged into the}} remote server, remote application user interface elements (e.g., application windows borders, Maximize, Minimize, and Close buttons etc.) will take on the same appearance of local applications. In this scenario, the remote applications will use the Aero theme if the user connects to the server from a Windows Vista machine running Aero. Later versions of the protocol also support rendering the UI in full 32-bit color, as well as resource redirection for printers, COM ports, disk drives, mice and keyboards. With resource redirection, remote applications can use {{the resources of the}} <b>local</b> <b>computer.</b> Audio is also redirected, so that any sounds generated by a remote application are played back at the client system. Moreover, a remote session can also span multiple monitors at the client system, independent of the multi-monitor settings at the server. RDC {{can also be used to}} connect to Windows Media Center (WMC) remote sessions; however, since WMC does not stream video using RDP, only the applications can be viewed this way, not any media.|$|E
25|$|The suite {{serves as}} a {{collaborative}} tool for cooperative editing of documents, spreadsheets and presentations in real-time. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to. An editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing {{that part of the}} document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's <b>local</b> <b>computer</b> in a variety of formats (ODF, HTML, PDF, RTF, Text, Office Open XML). Files can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes.|$|E
50|$|Clark had a {{small but}} {{key role in the}} {{planning}} for the ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet). In 1967, he suggested to Larry Roberts the idea of using separate small computers (later named Interface Message Processors) as a way of standardizing the network interface and reducing load on the <b>local</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some {{operating}} systems, {{the contents}} of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), but many systems implement name service switches, e.g., nsswitch.conf for Linux and Unix, to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the <b>local</b> <b>computer's</b> administrator.|$|R
50|$|Widgets come in many {{shapes and}} sizes, {{but two of}} the major types today are Web widgets and Desktop widgets. Web widgets are {{intended}} for use on (embedding in) webpages and have major implications in areas such as site performance, SEO and even backlink campaigns. Desktop widgets are embedded on <b>local</b> <b>computers,</b> and do not impact SEO or webpage performance.|$|R
25|$|The {{main feature}} change was support for Microsoft's 64-bit {{operating}} system, however support for Banyan VINES was also dropped from {{this version of}} MDAC. There were several known issues: MDAC 2.7 continued causing connectivity problems on clustered servers running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or SQL Server 7.0, with no workaround provided by Microsoft. When creating or configuring ODBC data source names (DSNs) using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver the network library protocol might unexpectedly switch to TCP/IP, even if the DSN was configured to use named pipes. This issue was found by InfoWorld reporter Randall C. Kennedy, who identified that the change was actually made in MDAC 2.6 but was never documented. It was discovered when testing client/server database workloads on a Windows XP computer; InfoWorld claims that although overall server CPU utilization rose by only 8 percent using TCP/IP, context switches per second dropped by more than 150 percent (which is of course impossible because you would then have a negative context switch rate - the drop is either 33% or 60% depending on which planet the author was on {{at the time of}} writing) for a 10-user workload. They were unimpressed that a fundamental functional change to the default behaviour of Net-Lib occurred without more than a passing mention in an unrelated document. Windows XP users also sometimes experienced problems connecting to SQL Server because SQL Server attempts to use certificates it finds on the <b>local</b> <b>computer,</b> however if {{there is more than one}} certificate available it did not know which one to use. When attempting to use Microsoft Analysis Services 2000 RTM, an error would sometimes appear when trying to browse cubes. Microsoft also discovered a problem in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me's setup program which prevented the MDAC installation program from rolling back when it encountered an installation error.|$|E
500|$|Cortana indexes {{and stores}} user information. It can be disabled; this will cause Windows search {{to search the}} Web {{as well as the}} <b>local</b> <b>computer,</b> but this can be turned off. Turning Cortana off does not in itself delete user data stored on Microsoft's servers, but it can be deleted by user action. Microsoft has further been criticised for {{requests}} to Bing's website for a file called [...] "threshold.appcache" [...] which contains Cortana's information through searches made through the Start Menu even when Cortana is disabled on Windows 10.|$|E
2500|$|Internet Explorer {{is fully}} {{configurable}} using Group Policy. [...] Administrators of Windows Server domains (for domain-joined computers) or the <b>local</b> <b>computer</b> can apply and enforce {{a variety of}} settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behaviour and others. [...] Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports Integrated Windows Authentication.|$|E
50|$|Worksheet {{generators}} {{are often}} used to develop the type of worksheets that contain a collection of similar problems. A worksheet generator is a software program that quickly generates a collection of problems, particularly in mathematics or numeracy. Such software is often used by teachers to make classroom materials and tests. Worksheet generators may be loaded on <b>local</b> <b>computers</b> or accessed via a website.|$|R
5000|$|Child care {{management}} software {{also referred}} to as child care administrative software or daycare accounting software [...] is business software designed specifically for use by child care centers, preschools, and similar child-oriented facilities. They can be either run from <b>local</b> <b>computers</b> or via mobile/hand-held access to other systems running elsewhere. The software is intended to increase staff productivity by recording unique child and family information.|$|R

2500|$|Local Group Policy (LGP, or LocalGPO) is a {{more basic}} version of Group Policy for {{standalone}} and non-domain computers, that has existed at least since Windows XP Home Edition, and {{can be applied to}} domain computers. Prior to Windows Vista, LGP could enforce a Group Policy Object for a single <b>local</b> <b>computer,</b> but could not make policies for individual users or groups. From Windows Vista onward, LGP allow Local Group Policy management for individual users and groups as well, and also allows backup, importing and exporting of policies between standalone machines via [...] "GPO Packs" [...] â€“ group policy containers which include the files needed to import the policy to the destination machine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first public}} dial-up BBS was {{developed}} by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the Great Blizzard of 1978, the two began preliminary work on the Computerized Bulletin Board System, or CBBS. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in Chicago {{where it would be}} a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the cork board his <b>local</b> <b>computer</b> club used to post information like [...] "need a ride". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978. CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{methods of}} Internet access by users include dial-up with a {{computer}} modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, satellite and cellular telephone technology (3G, 4G). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in [...] libraries and Internet cafes. Internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web payphone. Many hotels also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via <b>local</b> <b>computer</b> networks. Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi cafes, where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or PDA. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.|$|E
40|$|Manual {{annotation}} {{of various}} media streams, time series data and also text sequences {{is still a}} very time consuming work that has to be carried out in many areas of linguistics and beyond. Based on many theoretical discussions and practical experiences professional tools have been deployed such as ELAN that support the researcher in his/her work. Most of these annotation tools operate on <b>local</b> <b>computers.</b> However, since more and more language resources are stored in webaccessible archives, researchers want to take profit from the new possibilities. ANNEX was developed to fill this gap, since it allows web-based analysis of complex annotated media streams, i. e., the users donâ€™t have to download resources and donâ€™t have to download and install programs. By simply using a normal web-browser they can start their linguistic work. Yet, due to the architecture of the Internet, ANNEX does not offer the options to create annotations, but this feature will come. However, users have {{to be aware of the}} fact that media streaming does not offer that high accuracy as on <b>local</b> <b>computers.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|Initially, one adds a {{reference}} to CiteULike directly from within a web browser, without needing a separate program. For common online databases like PubMed, author names, title, and other details are imported automatically. One can manually add tags for grouping of references. The web site {{can be used to}} search public references by all users or only one's own references. References can later be exported via BibTeX or EndNote to be used on <b>local</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each time a user {{visits a}} website using Microsoft Internet Explorer, files {{downloaded}} with each web page (including HTML and Javascript code) are saved to the Temporary Internet Files folder, creating a web cache {{of the web}} page on the <b>local</b> <b>computer's</b> hard disk drive, or other form of digital data storage. The next time the user visits the cached website, only changed content needs to be downloaded from the Internet; the unchanged data {{is available in the}} cache.|$|R
