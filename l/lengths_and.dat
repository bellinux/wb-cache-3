40|$|Beak lengths (lower rostral <b>length</b> <b>and</b> upper rostral <b>length)</b> {{were taken}} for a sample of Moroteuthis ingens which were {{captured}} on the Chatham Rise, New Zealand. Beak lengths were plotted against both mantle <b>length</b> <b>and</b> wet weight to determine {{the relationship between these}} parameters for future use in biomass estimates in predator analysis. Although M. ingens is markedly sexually dimorphic, with females reaching 5 times the weight of males, there was no obvious sexual dimorphism in either lower or upper rostral length. This resulted in sex-specific relationships between both LRL <b>and</b> mantle <b>length,</b> LRL <b>and</b> weight; and URL <b>and</b> mantle <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> URL and weight. Males appeared to have a curvilinear relationship between beak <b>length</b> <b>and</b> mantle <b>length</b> <b>and</b> beak <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weight (even for log-transformed data). There was also considerable spread in the data in the plot between beak <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weight for females of similar weight. These characteristics of the data makes biomass estimates based on rostral length measurements for this species difficult. Other beak parameters may prove more useful for estimating biomass of M. ingens...|$|R

5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E

5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following {{the retirement of}} Harry Wainwright due to ill health. Wainwright left a legacy of competent but unspectacular locomotives that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> loadings. Maunsell took control of the short-term situation by improving existing designs, and he introduced new engines to progressively replace obsolete classes. New designs could also cut costs on the SECR, as one capable mixed-traffic locomotive could undertake the work of two separate passenger or freight types. The first new design was to become Maunsell's Nclass 2-6-0.|$|E

40|$|In the {{tropical}} and subtropical {{regions of the}} world, okra pods are consumed fresh. The introduction of pure lines and hybrids with improved <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width into the cropping system, necessitate studies on the combining ability and genetic components for the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods. Seven parents and 21 F 1 generations were planted for evaluation in a randomized complete block design with two replications. The {{results indicated that the}} means squares due to GCA <b>and</b> SCA for <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods were significant. The estimated variance due to SCA was greater than GCA variance for <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods at edible stage and vice versa for <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pod at maturity. The study identified Parents 7, 6, 4 and 5 as best combiners for edible pod <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width, mature pod <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width. Component analysis indicated that the dominant genetic action predominate other genetic effects in the inheritance of <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of pods. The dominance components (H 1 and H 2) were found to be greater than the additive gene effects (D). The ratio VH/D revealed overdominance loci for characters evaluated. The estimate F were positive (edible pod <b>length</b> <b>and</b> mature pod <b>length)</b> <b>and</b> negative (edible pod width and mature pod width). The proportion V 4 (DH 1 +F) / V 4 (DH 1 -F) was unity. While the ratio 4 H 2 / 4 H 1 = 0. 25 for all characters evaluated. The non-additive genetic effects accounted for a low to moderate heritability estimate in narrow sense recorded in the study. Both Oligogenic and polygenic action were found in the study. The study indicated an empirical superiority of the possibilities of evolving pure lines and hybrid okra with improved <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width into the cropping system...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{details the}} {{influence}} of the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> content of polypropylene (PP) fibers on the physical and mechanical properties of gypsum particleboard (GPB). The <b>length</b> <b>and</b> amount of PP fibers added had a significant effect on the internal bond strength (IB) and the modulus of rupture (MOR) of GPB. The highest IB value was shown at 9 mm <b>length</b> <b>and</b> 9 % content of PP fibers. The MOR was highest when the board was made with PP of 12 mm fiber <b>length</b> <b>and</b> 12 % content. Suitable contents of PP fibers were advantageous in that they reinforced the properties of GPB so it achieved high performance. In contrast, a high content of PP fibers reduced the IB, MOR, and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of GPB. The thickness swelling was reduced with an increase in PP <b>length</b> <b>and</b> content. It was concluded that the combination of 12 mm <b>length</b> <b>and</b> 12 % content or 3 mm <b>length</b> <b>and</b> 9 % content was optimum for producing good performance of GPB.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond <b>lengths,</b> <b>and</b> polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} animators studied real-life {{animals for}} reference, {{as was done}} for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions {{with an assortment of}} lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity. The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill. The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish. Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond <b>lengths</b> <b>and</b> angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
