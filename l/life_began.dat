5|$|By 1935, {{unbeknownst to}} the public, Piłsudski had {{for several years}} been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace. The celebration of his <b>life</b> <b>began</b> spontaneously within {{half an hour of}} the {{announcement}} of his death. It was led by military personnel — former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.|$|E
5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of <b>Life,</b> <b>began</b> in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E

Although a heavy smoker (reportedly 150 cigarettes/day), heavy drinker, and consumer of sleeping pills (she was a lifelong insomniac), Bankhead continued to perform in the 1950s and 1960s on Broadway, radio, television, and in the occasional film.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden of}} Munstead Wood became widely {{known as a}} result of Jekyll's {{descriptions}} and photographs, in her books such as Wood and Garden (1899), Home and Garden (1900), and Colour in the Flower Garden (1908), and in her many articles, particularly in Country Life and William Robinson's magazines The Garden and Gardening Illustrated. William Robinson was a frequent visitor. Jekyll's long relationship with Country <b>Life</b> <b>began</b> when proprietor Edward Hudson first visited Munstead Wood in 1899.

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly. Present life forms could not have survived at Earth's surface, because the Archean atmosphere lacked oxygen hence had no ozone layer to block ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, it is believed that primordial <b>life</b> <b>began</b> to evolve by the early Archean, with candidate fossils dated to around 3.5Ga. Some scientists even speculate that life could have begun during the early Hadean, as far back as 4.4Ga, surviving the possible Late Heavy Bombardment period in hydrothermal vents below the Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{searches}} {{for evidence of}} <b>life</b> <b>began</b> in the 19th century, and they continue today via telescopic investigations and landed missions. While early work focused on phenomenology and bordered on fantasy, modern scientific inquiry has emphasized the search for water, chemical biosignatures in the soil and rocks at the planet's surface, and biomarker gases in the atmosphere. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding {{a large amount of}} underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.|$|E

Reel Life released Dice's debut studio album, The Neighborhoodshittalka the following year. Dice left the label following the album's release, claiming that he received no royalties from his album, which he estimated to have sold 200,000 copies. Esham's album Dead Flowerz was the first RLP album to appear on a Billboard chart, peaking at #38 on Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. However, the label went bankrupt that year.|$|E
