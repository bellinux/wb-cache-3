5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the <b>lecture</b> <b>notes</b> of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his <b>lecture</b> <b>notes</b> at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|Like John of Tynemouth, {{a number}} of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are {{ascribed}} to Simon. These take the form of notes from his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum. This combined work is now at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University, catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. Another set of student notes from his lectures, this time entitled Quaestiones, survives as part of British Library MS Royal E.VII. This work includes <b>lecture</b> <b>notes</b> not only from Simon's classes, but from John and Nicholas' as well.|$|E

25|$|This rescued work {{contains}} a great wealth of material, {{in which one}} follows {{in the footsteps of}} a master historian. Yet, perhaps because of its nature as reconstructed student <b>lecture</b> <b>notes,</b> it more often lacks the fine points of literary composition and style, and of course the narrative drive of the original three volumes.
