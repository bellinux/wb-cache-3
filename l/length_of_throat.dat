40|$|Published in : ISH Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, Vol. 21, No. 1, 65 – 84 In this paper, two multi-variable {{regression}} {{models have been}} developed to predict the discharge and approach velocity coefficients from relevant independent variables. The {{regression models}} are developed based on relevant experimental data obtained from testing nine different flow measurement long-throated flumes with symmetrical rectangular compound cross-sections. The long-throated flume was used in the compound cross-section to experimentally estimate the discharge and approach velocity coefficients using mainly head measurements and cross-section dimensions as required by the stage-discharge equations. The independent variables used in predicting the two coefficients represent dimensionless parameters defined using the gauged head at the head measurement section, floodplain depth, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>throat</b> in the direction of flow, and cross-section geometry at the control section. Several statistically-based analyses were performed to verify the reliability of the developed multi-variable regression models. All deployed analyses have indicated that the two regression models are associated with high predictive strength. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is the development of regression-based models to predict the discharge and approach velocity coefficients {{that can be used in}} conjunction with stage-discharge equations to estimate the flow in a symmetric rectangular channel with compound cross-section...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a new passive, large {{particle}} impactor (PLPI) (PM< 10) {{was developed and}} evaluated in a wind tunnel. The PLPI {{is designed to be}} isoaxial and isokinetic to enable large particles sampling without bias. The PLPI can provide representative sampling without requiring a mass flowmeter controller or pump. The PLPI is especially useful for aerosol wind tunnel studies to evaluate particle generation techniques and characterize particle concentrations and spatial uniformity at the test location. The original passive impactor, developed in 1941 by May, was designed to sample particles larger than 30 micrometer at wind speeds greater than 3. 6 m/s. The PLPI improves on this original design. Its cut-off size is reduced to 13. 5 micro-meter at a wind speed of 3. 5 m/s. The PLPI is an open-design, flow-through impactor that enables near isokinetic sampling conditions, when directed towards the wind. Numerical simulations suggest that the PLPI has a sharp collection efficiency curve. In this study, the design of PLPI will be presented. Design parameters such as S/W, W/T, and W/P, where S is jet to plate distance, T is the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>throat,</b> W is throat diameter, and P is plate diameter, were investigated using impaction theory and computation fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Results of the PLPI calibration in a wind tunnel using the Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS, TSI) will be presented. Copyright © 2007 by the American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR).

40|$|Extremal {{black holes}} tend to expel {{magnetic}} and electric fields. Fields {{are unable to}} reach the horizon because the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the black hole throat blows up in the extremal limit.

40|$|We took {{blood samples}} from 100 post-fledging {{juvenile}} Starlings Sturnus vulgaris for DNA sexing in late August, and scored the traits that are commonly thought to predict sex in adults: iris colour, <b>length</b> and shape <b>of</b> the <b>throat</b> feathers, degree <b>of</b> speckling of plumage, body mass and tarsus length. Using logistic regression, the iris colour alone predicted the sex, as determined from the DNA, with 97 % accuracy.

40|$|A general {{approach}} for investigating transport phenomena in porous media is presented. This approach {{has the capacity}} to represent various kinds of irregularity in porous media without the need for excessive detail or computational effort. The overall method combines a generalized effective medium approximation (EMA) with a macroscopic continuum model in order to derive a transport equation with explicit analytical expressions for the transport coefficients. The proposed form of the EMA is an anisotropic and heterogeneous extension of Kirkpatrick 2 ̆ 7 s EMA which allows the overall model to account for microscopic alterations in connectivity (with the locations of the pores and the orientation and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>throat)</b> as well as macroscopic variations in transport properties.

40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{quantify}} the widely-held belief that large hierarchies induced by stronglywarped geometries are common in the string theory landscape. To this end, {{we focus on the}} arguably best-understood subset of vacua – type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds with non-perturbative Kähler stabilization and a SUSY-breaking uplift (the KKLT setup). Within this framework, vacua with a realistically small cosmological constant are expected to come from Calabi-Yaus with a large number of 3 -cycles. For appropriate choices of flux numbers, many of these 3 -cycles can, in general, shrink to produce near-conifold geometries. Thus, a simple statistical analysis in the spirit of Denef and Douglas allows us to estimate the expected number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Klebanov-Strassler <b>throats</b> in the given set of vacua. We find that <b>throats</b> capable <b>of</b> explaining the electroweak hierarchy are expected to be present in a large fraction of the landscape vacua while shorter throats Since the seminal work of Giddings, Kachru and Polchinski [1] following on from the foundational papers of Refs.

40|$|AbstractSteam-jet {{vacuum pump}} {{is widely used}} {{in a range of}} applications. This paper {{evaluated}} the performance of four well-known turbulence models for predicting and understanding the internal flow of a steam-jet vacuum pump first. With the help of a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-Fluent 6. 3, the simulation results obtained from the concerned turbulence models were compared with experimental values, the k-omega-SST model was chosen as a tool model for carrying out numerical simulations. Then, based on the simulation results obtained from specific operating conditions, a method for locating the shock-mixing layer was put forward. The shape of the shock-mixing layer shows that the secondary steam does not mix with the primary steam immediately after being induced into the mixing chamber of the pump; actually, they maintain their independence till the shocking position instead. After the shock happens, the shock-mixing layer disappear, the two fluid in the pump begin to mix with each other and discharge to the next stage with almost the same state. Based on the shape of the shock-mixing layer and the supersonic region of the secondary steam, a detailed analysis for the flow duct of the secondary steam was carried out. It is found that the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> the secondary steam flow duct plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable operating state and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>throat</b> reflects the back pressure endurance for the pump...|$|R
40|$|A genetic-based pore network {{extraction}} method from micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) {{images is}} proposed in this paper. Several {{variables such as}} the number, radius and location of pores, the coordination number, {{as well as the}} radius and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>throats</b> are used herein as the optimization parameters. Two approaches to generate the pore network structure are presented. Unlike previous algorithms, the presented approaches are directly based on minimizing the error between the extracted network and the real porous medium. This leads to the generation of more accurate results while reducing required computational memories. Two different objective functions are used in building the network. In the first approach, only the difference between the real micro-CT images of the porous medium and the sliced images from the generated network is selected as the objective function which is minimized via a genetic algorithm (GA). In order to further improve the structure and behavior of the generated network, making it more representative of the real porous medium, a second optimization has been used in which the contrast between the experimental and the predicted values of the network permeability is minimized via GA. We present two case studies for two different complex geological porous media, Clashach sandstone and Indiana limestone. We compare porosity and permeability predicted by the GA generated networks with experimental values and find an excellent match...|$|R
40|$|MasterFor a micro-thruster {{with short}} {{duration}} of propulsion, thrusts in the unsteady periods, initial ignition and final depletion, {{need to be}} estimated to predict the total thrust with accuracy. In this study flow field in a micro-thruster nozzle was analyzed for unsteady and steady states to estimate the characteristic time for flow development and decay, and to compare it with simple theory. Flow characteristics were obtained using two different source conditions, time-dependent or pressure-dependent mass influx condition, because thrust is sensitively dependent on the chamber pressure. At pressure-dependent mass influx condition, characteristic time for decay was smaller than for development by about 50 %. Also sought were the effects of heat loss and fabrication errors. The effect of heat loss is quite large. When heat loss was considered, total thrust was reduced by 30 %. It was also confirmed that the magnitude of thrust was not sensitive to distortions, mismatch and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the nozzle <b>throat</b> in the nozzle geometry.

Our experimental studies on low-pressure µAWJB showed that conventional nozzles which are used for micro abrasive air jet blasting are subject to clog-ging at the mixing chamber. In this study, the venturi principle is exploited in order to obtain a novel nozzle design which will not lead to the clogging problem.
