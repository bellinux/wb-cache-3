40|$|The {{question}} of whether discernible differences exist between liars and truth tellers has interested professional <b>lie</b> <b>detectors</b> and laypersons for centuries. In this article we discuss whether people can detect lies when observing someone’s nonverbal behavior or analyzing someone’s speech. An article about detecting lies by observing nonverbal and verbal cues is over-due. Scientific journals regularly publish overviews of research articles regarding nonverbal and verbal cues to deception, but they offer no explicit guidance about what <b>lie</b> <b>detectors</b> should do and should avoid doing to catch liars. We will present such guidance in the present article. The article consists of two parts. The first section focuses on pitfalls to avoid and outlines the major factors that lead to failures in catching liars. Sixteen reasons are clustered into three categories: (a) a lack of motivation to detect lies (becaus...|$|R

25|$|However, {{questions}} about Boyer's role were {{beyond the scope}} of the inquest, the purpose of which was only to establish the circumstances of Franklin's role in the shooting. Boyer's leaving the motel room with almost all of Cooke's clothing, and the fact that tests showed Cooke was inebriated at the time, provided a plausible explanation to the inquest jurors for Cooke's bizarre behavior and state of dress. In addition, because Carr's testimony corroborated Franklin's version of events, and because both Boyer and Franklin later passed <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> tests, the coroner's jury ultimately accepted Franklin's explanation and returned a verdict of justifiable homicide. With that verdict, authorities officially closed the case on Cooke's death.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the relation between}} the facial expression of a group of children when they told a lie and the accuracy in detecting the lie by a sample of adults. To evaluate the intensity and type of emotional content of the children’s faces, we applied an automated method capable of analysing the facial information from the video recordings (FaceReader 5. 0 software). The program classified videos as showing a neutral facial expression or an emotional one. There was a significant higher mean of hits for the emotional than for the neutral videos, and a significant negative correlation between the intensity of the neutral expression and the number of hits from the judges. The lies expressed with emotional facial expression were more easily recognized by adults than the lies expressed with a poker face; thus, the less expressive was the child the harder was to guess. The accuracy of the <b>lie</b> <b>detectors</b> was then correlated with their subclinical traits of personality disorders, to find that participants scoring higher in the dependent personality were significantly better <b>lie</b> <b>detectors.</b> A non-significant tendency for women to discriminate better was also found, whereas men tending to be more suspicious than women when judging the children’s veracity. This study is the first to automatically decoding the facial information of the liar child and relating the results with personality characteristics of the <b>lie</b> <b>detectors</b> in the context of deceptive behavior research. Implications for forensic psychology were suggested: to explore whether the induction of an emotion in a child during an interview could be useful to evaluate the testimony during legal trials...|$|R

25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with an earlier and different invention with the same name, a polygraph, popularly referred to as a <b>lie</b> <b>detector,</b> is an instrument that measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, in the belief that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California at Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the polygraph was on its 2003 list of the 325 greatest inventions.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's {{senses of}} sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater {{distances}} than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced {{in a similar}} manner, allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take. He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, {{as a type of}} natural <b>lie</b> <b>detector,</b> such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.|$|E

He is further critical of how the Holmes County sheriff's office handled the investigation, saying they should have treated it as a crime scene from the beginning. In particular, he claims, the <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> test that Taran passed was inadequate, as it had consisted of only three questions (he says he later learned that a properly administered examination with the device should take over an hour), and that Kelly and Cronin should have been asked to take the test as well.|$|E
