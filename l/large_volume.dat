5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding.

Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

Harbour Street leads to the road to Shannon Harbour and Main Street begins at the hill at the southern entrance to the town and leads down to the bridge crossing the Shannon.|$|E

5|$|While {{working as}} photojournalists, the Joneses {{continued}} to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain, and in 1956 they began {{working as a}} freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works.

A small workforce of itinerant archaeologists were employed to excavate these sites in advance of development. Between 1956 and 1965, Margaret Jones directed a number of such excavations in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (including Old Sleaford).|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero and Rock Band (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii), music game franchises {{which used}} {{specially}} designed controllers that mimicked musical instruments and allowed uses {{to play a}} large selection of licensed music, were extremely popular during the seventh generation, with over twenty different title releases across various platforms. Activision's Guitar Hero series sold more than 25 million units with over $2 billion in retail revenue, while Harmonix's Rock Band series has sold over 13 million copies; both series were augmented with a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> of downloadable content.

5|$|No traces {{have yet}} {{been found in}} Scotland of either a Neanderthal {{presence}} or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.|$|E

Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi and Zuari rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, draining into the Arabian Sea and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce and Clarkson had {{collected}} a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> of evidence against {{the slave trade}} over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent {{the latter part of}} 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists' case. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E

40|$|Desktop Grid is {{increasing}} in popularity because of relatively very low cost and good performance in institutions. Data-intensive applications require data management in scientific experiments conducted by researchers and scientists in Desktop Grid-based Distributed Computing Infrastructure (DCI). Some of these data-intensive applications deal with <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data. Several solutions for data-intensive applications {{have been proposed}} for Desktop Grid (DG) {{but they are not}} efficient in handling <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data. Data management in this environment deals with data access and integration, maintaining basic properties of databases, architecture for querying data, etc. Data in data-intensive applications has to be replicated in multiple nodes for improving data availability and reducing response time. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) is a well established technique for handling <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data and is widely used on the internet. Its environment is similar to the environment of DG. The performance of existing P 2 P-based solution dealing with generic architecture for replicating <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data is not efficient in DG-based DCI. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a generic architecture for replicating <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data efficiently by using P 2 P in BOINC based Desktop Grid. Present solutions for data-intensive applications mainly deal with read only data. New type of applications are emerging which deal <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data and Read/Write of data. In emerging scientific experiments, some nodes of DG generate new snapshot of scientific data after regular intervals. This new snapshot of data is generated by updating some of the values of existing data fields. This updated data has to be synchronised in all DG nodes for maintaining data consistency. The performance of data management in DG can be improved by addressing efficient data replication and consistency. Therefore, there is need for algorithms which deal with data Read/Write consistency along with replication for <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data in BOINC based Desktop Grid. The research is to identify efficient solutions for data replication in handling <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data and maintaining Read/Write data consistency using Peer-to-Peer techniques in BOINC based Desktop Grid.
