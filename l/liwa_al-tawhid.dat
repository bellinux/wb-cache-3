Their rule was harsh, as locals were forbidden from listening to music and forced to fast and pray, while dissidents were either imprisoned or beheaded. Food prices increased and fuel became scarce. In response to these policies and the fighting in the area, most of the town's population fled to YPG territories. Eventually, a delegation of 90 leading tribesmen from al-Yaarubiyah asked the YPG to drive the rebels from the town, to which the militia responded positively.|$|E

A group member, Adil Fistok, said the merger planning was {{in the works for}} seven months; Fistok stated that [...] "One of the major obstacles we faced was the lust for power by some leaders. But eventually everyone made concessions in order to make this project happen." [...] According to him, the primary challenge was a lack of money and weapons. It has been estimated by Charles Lister of IHS Jane's that the total number of fighters the Islamic Front has may be up to 45,000.|$|R

One of the targets was the military research facility in the Rashidin area of New Aleppo. Rebel mortars set it ablaze. The rebels claimed that they were moving forward in Rashidin {{with the aim of}} removing military targets including areas used by the army to shell rebel areas.|$|E
50|$|On 25 October 2012, some 200 rebels {{moved into}} Ashrafiyeh {{district}} in the Kurdish-controlled area of Sheikh Maqsud. It {{was the first time}} that substantial government or rebel forces moved into Kurdish areas. The area had been regarded as neutral with Kurdish militia clashing with both rebel and army units. The rebel unit responsible was allegedly the <b>Liwa</b> <b>al-Tawhid</b> brigade who reportedly told the locals that We are here to spend Eid with you. Ashrafiyeh is important as a part of the city heights and controls routes between the north and south of Aleppo. Previous rebel attempts to move into the district had been repelled. Rebels were reported to have taken control of the Syriac quarter.|$|E

There will be {{no such thing as}} Liwa al-Tawhid." [...] The head of the group's Consultative Council, Amad Essa al-Sheikh, said the group sought [...] "a paradigm shift in the armed rebellion by closing ranks and mobilising them to become the real alternative to the dying regime." [...] He added that the group would cooperate with what it called [...] "loyal fighters" [...] in the country, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA). [...] However on 3 December 2013 they withdrew from the command of the FSA and criticized its leadership. On 6 December 2013, fighters from the Islamic Front seized several FSA bases and depots at the Bab al-Hawa crossing. This caused conflict between the two groups that lasted until later in December 2013.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{make use of}} interpretive methods within {{comparative}} political theory for {{a consideration of the}} idea of dignity (karama) in Syria’s revolution, began in 2011. The state and its ruling ideology is, of course, deeply contested in revolutions. But less {{attention has been paid to}} how this happens and to the kinds of new ideas—or established beliefs recovered and recast—which can rapidly emerge from the ideational periphery. The concept of karama acts, along with other adjacent and related ‘ideas in the wild’, to resist. It signifies important ‘belief challenges’ to the dominant order. I show the ways in which dignity is used and understood by recourse to the writing and the vernacular utterances of Syrian revolutionaries. I pursue two distinctive ideational exemplars from within the revolution: the progressive al-jumhuriya (The Republic) website; and, the armed fighters of the <b>liwa</b> <b>al-tawhid</b> (Unity Brigade). My research traces the ways in which divergent Syrian revolutionaries share important beliefs in common; ideas which cohere and are clarified, to an important extent, around the concept of karama—as it is used and acted upon in the revolution. I compare the broadly western and Arab conceptual trajectories for this idea, showing points of commonality and illuminate the particular instances and context for a distinctive dignity in resistance. I explore a historicised idea of and emergence of a deeply political and radical Fanonian dignity in resistance to oppression and tyranny. The centrality of dignity—as a core organising idea in Syrian ‘thought-practices’ of resistance—shows us how such ideas can take on a political bent and how powerful they are when harnessed and acted on in particular contexts. My analysis of revolutionary thinkers and fighters therefore sheds more light on the actions of people often neglected in state-centric and structuralist analyses...|$|E
