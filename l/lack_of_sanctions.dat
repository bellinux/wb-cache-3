It seeks to demonstrate this gap and how bringing in the role of external great powers can be helpful by examining the following question: What determines the use of EU sanctions? The thesis first reviews the {{literature on}} EU foreign policy decision-making and shows the gap that recurs in the variety of explanations. It then modifies these explanations to include the influence of external great powers in explaining why the EU decides to sanction certain states and not others.

Through these case studies, it was demonstrated that EU member states made sanctions based on the effect on relationships with Iran in the MEK and Hezbollah cases and Russia in the Belarus and Ukraine cases. It concluded that this most manifests itself in EU member states reluctance to show any disunity with respect to these external great powers, in spite of consequences that sanctions decisions might have for their relationship with those great powers...|$|E

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) investigation of the prosecutors who handled the trial of US Senator Ted Stevens provides a rare opportunity to observe the operation of such an internal disciplinary process. The investigation generated disagreements about the level of culpability of various members of the prosecution team and about who should be sanctioned. The most recent development in this internal sanctions saga occurred on April 5, 2013, when Administrative Judge Benjamin Gutman reversed 40 - and 15 -day suspensions without pay for the only two Stevens trial prosecutors against whom the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) had sought sanctions...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{three decades}} of gender quota {{policies}} in Germany and assesses policy adoption in parties, public administration, {{as well as on}} corporate and public boards. Germany was an early adopter of quotas for women in political parties and in public administration. Even though both measures were controversial when first enacted in the 1980 s and early 1990 s, they have since become rather low-profile gender equality strategies. A recent initiative to adopt quotas for women on corporate and public boards, by contrast, produced substantial public discussion. The mainstreaming of positive action plans in public institutions that include decision quotas, fixed quotas and goal quotas has given gender advocates formally strong leverage to advance a gender equality agenda. At the same time, a culture of minimalist compliance has pervaded the public sector and parties. Male institutions and organizations tend to exhibit more passive resistance than vocal opposition, thus making it difficult for feminists to engage effectively with non-compliance. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> as well as intricate strategies to circumvent quota decisions add to a sense among German feminist activists that quotas are one, but {{by no means the only}} strategy for gender equality in public life...|$|E

Given Europe’s aging society and its emphasis on social welfare protections, excluding disabled persons from entry to the workforce is at first glance an economic problem. This population alone accounts for one of Europe’s greatest untapped resources. More important, however, especially for the disabled, the problem is as much an economic one {{as it is a}} violation of human rights. This article begins with an examination of the social and medi¬cal models of disability, arguing in favour of the former, and provides a brief historical overview of the disability movement. Much of {{the focus is on the}} Treaty of Amsterdam, which provided the necessary basis for the Framework Employment Directive, to date the only directive that deals with the prohibition of discrimination of disabled persons in the workforce.

This article will then provide some possible solutions to make disability level with other types of discrimination by means of introducing positive duties, mainstreaming, and converging Member States policies...|$|E

40|$|LL. D. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 108 of 1996 {{provides}} in Section 34 {{that everyone}} {{has the right to}} have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before court, or where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum. A fair civil trial that includes a fair judgment can only be achieved if the parties to the action receive fair treatment throughout all the stages of the proceedings. Obviously the concept "trial" cannot be given a narrow interpretation. There can hardly be mention of a "fair trial" if the processes that precede the trial since commencement of the litigation cannot also be construed as fair. In providing the procedures whereby a fair civil trial is facilitated, apart from providing effective mechanisms for the enforcement of substantive rights and obligations, the interrelated concepts of time, effectiveness and costs are pivotal. In an attempt to secure a fair civil trial, the preparation for trial stage plays a very important role. It is, however, a reality of the South African litigation milieu that hundreds of cases are postponed on a daily basis as a result of problems that are related to specific pretrial procedures. The indications that the pre-trial procedures per se need to be revised and where necessary, be reformed, are consequently rife. There is also no comprehensive procedural structure in place in South African law in terms of which the parties can co-operate in order to effectively facilitate pre-trial preparation. An aspect of the pre-trial procedure that often leads to delay and unnecessary escalation of costs is the excessive amount of party control (or lack thereof) during the preparation for trial stage. Pivotal to reform of the pre-trial procedures is thus the question whether it serves any purpose to leave this stage to the "mercy of the parties". It can hardly be argued that retaining the element of surprise as part of a strict adversary litigation character yields any real advantage. Legal reform is not a process that can be undertaken in vacuo and any attempts at reform in the preparation for trial stage must consequently bear the following considerations in mind: costs, delay, the degree of complexity of procedures, formulation, time limits and sanctions, the impact of the principle of fairness, the impact of party control and circumstances peculiar to a particular legal system. It is furthermore important that such reform should be undertaken in accordance with an expressly declared ethos. Where there is no clear congruence between the reform ethos and the needs of a specific legal system it will inevitably lead to reform which, although it may be new, might not necessarily address and improve existing problems. Legal reform, even if it is of limited scope, should always be a logical, purposive process. In this respect comparative study of Anglo- American systems are invaluable. It is of great importance that individual pre-rial procedures should be reformed in order to facilitate cost and time effective preparation for trial. Various problems exist in respect of discovery and attention should urgently be given to the lack of uniformity between the High Courts and the Magistrates Court, the non-compulsory nature of the procedure, the effectiveness of time limits and sanctions, the wording of the rule and the question whether the concept "document" should be elaborated upon. Provision should also be made in the South African Law of Civil Procedure for exchange of witness statements prior to trial. Exchange of expert evidence ought also to be reformed in order to address the problematic time aspect, the obligation to give notice, the contents of the summary, the discussion between experts and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> prior to the trial date. Reform of the pretrial conference should also be undertaken in order to emphasize its legitimate place as a stocktaking procedure prior to trial. It is furthermore necessary to address the problems regarding the pre-trial conference that relate to the lack of uniformity in the High Court and Magistrate's Court, the attitude of the legal profession, the stage at which the conference must be held, the question regarding who should preside at the conference and the lack of effective sanctions. Reform of the individual pre-trial procedures, whether piecemeal or as a comprehensive once-off reform, is, however, per se not sufficient to ensure a level of trial preparation that will eventually lead to a fair civil trial. The individual pre-trial procedures are separate though interrelated links that can only fulfill their purpose if the greater more holistic approach to civil procedure gives structured recognition to orderly, time and cost effective litigation. It is, therefore, essential that the individual pre-trial procedures should function within the framework of a case management system that can {{play a significant role in}} achieving the ideal of a constitutionally fair civil trial in that it establishes a coordinated and procedurally fair preparation for trial stage. The eventual success of such reform will, apart form the provision of effective individual pre-trial procedures and an effective case management model, also depend on the materialization of a sufficient budget to create an infrastructure of computers and trained personnel as well as a mentality shift on the part of lawyers in order to discard their old adversary cloak in exchange for more effective transparant litigation and eventually, a fair civil trial...|$|E
40|$|ResumenLos Atlas de Riesgos municipales constituyen uno de los instrumentos que {{el gobierno}} mexicano ha privilegiado en los últimos años, con la finalidad de apoyar el ordenamiento de los asentamientos humanos en México. Este artículo recupera los principales antecedentes conceptuales, metodológicos, institucionales y legales de estos productos cartográficos, y analiza sus alcances y limitaciones reales en cuanto instrumentos de regulación de usos de suelo y gestión de riesgo en el caso mexicano. Para ello, utiliza los conceptos de juridificación, cumplimiento de marcos normativos (enforcement) y gestión multi-escalar, con el objeto de analizar las condiciones en las que estos atlas surgen como dispositivos jurídicos en el contexto de una descentralización parcial del ordenamiento teritorial y la protección civil, así como la distancia que los separa de los efectos territoriales esperados de ellos. El artículo sustenta las razones para la relativa inoperancia de los atlas en el contexto de los gobiernos municipales; entre estas razones destacan la indefinición en el marco legal sobre su contenido y uso; la falta de claridad sobre las instancias responsables de su implementación, y la carencia de sanciones que conlleva su incumplimiento en la mayoría de las legislaciones estatales. AbstractMunicipal Risk Atlases {{are one of}} the policy {{instruments}} that Mexican government has prioritized {{in the last few years}} in order to consolidate the territorial regulation of human settlements in the country. This paper reviews the legal, institutional conceptual and methodological developments of these documents and analyzes its current scope and limitations within the Program of Risk Prevention in Human Settlements (PRAH), which had been designed and implemented by the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) between 2010 and 2012, and by the Ministry f Urban, Territorial and Agrarian Development (SEDATU) from 2013. The objective of the paper is to understand the conditions under which the Municipal Risk Atlases have been produced to regulate human settlements in risk-prone areas, as one of many juridical instruments that operate in the fields of land use planning and natural hazards provisions. In the first place, we review different approaches that have been used by different agents within the federal government to produce cartographic information to identify and reduce disaster risk. That includes the different concepts and methodologies used to identify different risk components (such as ‘vulnerability’, ‘affected systems’, ‘disturbances’) but also under which institutional context each of them emerge, how they relate to each other and how are they integrated with other policy devices. This legal and institutional review leads to a conceptual framework based on recent contributions of the field of legal geographies and socio-legal studies on disasters. The paper discusses the process of juridification of risk Atlases (that is, how have they become policy instruments), together with a complex set of normative documents, including laws, codes, programs, land use plans and planning acts, among others. The main contributions from theorists of the field of legal geographies of disasters are discussed to understand how Risk Atlases have become important documents for the ‘juridical production of the territory’. These documents are part of a normative universe that is embedded in a complex and decentralized scheme of both natural hazards provisions and urban development planning. Many of the agencies involved in these two fields have superimposed functions and scopes, while others that should be closely related because they complement each other's objectives, are in fact separated and with no legal linkages among them. In particular, the current program under which Risk Atlases are produced is nested in the government office in charge of the land use national policy and used by the urban development offices of municipal governments, to prevent human settlements to consolidate in risk-prone areas. Nevertheless, Risk Atlases are defined in several laws as key tools to prevent risk and manage emergencies. That means that they are increasingly used by many other agents involved in the National System of Civil Protection (an arrangement to co-ordinate different stakeholders, including national, provincial and municipal governments, together with federal agencies, private and social sectors) for objectives that fall far beyond land use regulation. However, despite its undeniable importance, there is still a remarkable inoperative character of many of these Atlases. The paper intends to explain the reasons behind this problem by identifying the distance between the normative content of these documents and their conditions of enforcement. The authors review the laws and programs that define the scope and the actual rules of implementation of the Atlas, and discuss why the expected outcomes on risk reduction and land regulation are not possible under the current normative and organizational structure within which Atlas operate. Some of these reasons are the vagueness about what kind of information should an Atlas contain and how this information should be used; the lack of clarity regarding who should implement that in each government level; and finally, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> if the restrictions derived from the risk analysis contained in the Atlases are unfulfilled. The paper concludes that Atlases have emerged as an informative rather than regulatory document, in a context of weak institutional capacities at the municipal level. With that conclusion the authors urge policymakers to review the position of risk Atlases within the National System of Civil Protection, as well as the legal framework of natural hazard provisions and land use planning in order to strengthen them...|$|E

40|$|Objective This paper {{focuses on}} the role of the Non-Medical Surgical Assistant (NMSA) in Australia. Registered Nurses predominately perform this role. This paper will {{articulate}} a position to: • validate this role as an Advanced Practice Nursing (APN) role in Australia through regulation and governance by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) who sit under the umbrella of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA); • lobby AHPRA to recognise, regulate and protect the title of Advanced Practice Nursing (APN) roles other than the Nurse Practitioner (NP) in Australia; and • as a result <b>of</b> <b>sanctioned</b> regulation, facilitate APN (including NP) to seek appropriate remuneration for undertaking this role in the private sector in Australia. Setting The Australian Healthcare system. Subjects Clinicians performing the role of the NMSA in Australia. Primary Argument The NMSA is well established with clear mechanisms for governance internationally. This role has been practiced in Australia for more than 20 years, and while clinicians function under the guise of advanced practice, the role is not clearly defined, standardised or regulated. This is partially attributed to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctioned</b> governance from AHPRA. Conclusion While the AHPRA via the NMBA are reluctant to formally recognise and regulate this role, the overwhelming majority of clinicians in Australia are nurses. Without regulation it is difficult to quantify the role as APN. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> governance excludes NMSA (including the NP) from access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and private health funds for intraoperative reimbursement thereby rendering a potentially cost-effective role unsustainable to many clinicians...|$|R
