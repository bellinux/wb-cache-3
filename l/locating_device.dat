40|$|The {{degree of}} {{assurance}} of providing reliable connectivity to diversely <b>located</b> <b>devices</b> will define {{the success of}} internet of things as aimed for future generation of wireless networks.

Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) provides a candidate solution to resolve this problem; which may require a trade off with the available data rate to the device. This paper proposes an innovative trade-off frame-work to avoid any of the data rate compromise, while providing enormous flexibility to facilitate energy to the remotely <b>located</b> <b>devices</b> on demand basis.

30|$|We {{report on}} {{thrombolysis}} acceleration of a nanomachine powered by light-driving δ-subunit-free F 0 F 1 -ATPase motor. It {{is composed of}} a mechanical device, <b>locating</b> <b>device,</b> energy storage device, and propeller. The rotory δ-subunit-free F 0 F 1 -ATPase motor acts as a mechanical device, which was obtained by reconstructing an original chromatophore extracted from Rhodospirillum rubrum. We found that the bioactivity of the F 0 F 1 -ATPase motor improved greatly after reconstruction. The zeta potential of the nanomachine is about − 23.4  mV. Cytotoxicity induced by the nanomachine was measured using cell counting kit (CCK)- 8 assay. The A 549 cells incubated with different fractional concentrations of the nanomachine within 48  h did not show obvious cytotoxicity. The <b>locating</b> <b>device</b> helps the nanomachine bind to the thrombi. Energy was easily stored by exposing the nanomachine to 600 -nm-wavelength irradiation, which promoted activity of the motor. The rotation of the long propeller accelerated thrombolysis of a blood clot in vitro {{in the presence of}} urokinase (UK). This result was based on visual inspection and confirmed by a series of tests.|$|E
