50|$|Located at 28°36′36″N latitude, Delhi {{lies in the}} sub-tropical belt of earth's North Temperate {{geographical}} region, a few latitudes {{north of}} the Tropic of Cancer. As such the rotation of earth has {{its effect on the}} city's day-length, which shortens during winters and lengthens during summers. Between the two solstices, Delhi's day-length changes by about 4 <b>hours,</b> <b>offset</b> by some 2 hours each at sunrise and sunset.|$|R

50|$|Next, the {{altitude}} and azimuth of the celestial body are computed for a selected position (assumed position or AP). This involves resolving a spherical triangle. Given the three magnitudes: <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> angle (LHA), observed body's declination (dec), and assumed latitude (lat), {{the altitude}} Hc and azimuth Zn must be computed. The <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> angle, LHA, {{is the difference}} between the AP longitude and the hour angle of the observed object. It is always measured in a westerly direction from the assumed position.|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{objections}} to the proposed change have been answered by its opponents. For example, Dr. Felicitas Arias, who, as Director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)'s Time, Frequency, and Gravimetry Department, is responsible for generating UTC, noted in a press release that the drift of about one minute every 60–90 years could {{be compared to the}} 16-minute annual variation between true solar time and mean solar time, the one <b>hour</b> <b>offset</b> by use of daylight time, and the several-hours offset in certain geographically extra-large time zones.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} which {{part of the day}} is most suited for temporal analysis of the medium, we quantify the repeatability of the coda over time using the techniques of Sens-Schönfelder and Wegler (2006) and Brenguier et al. (2008). We conduct this analysis separately for each hour of the day. We first calculate 24 reference CCFs by averaging the CCFs separately as a function of <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> over the whole acquisition period. Then, for each <b>local</b> <b>hour,</b> we estimate how the coda computed over a 30 -day sliding window resembles its reference CCF. Finally, for each <b>local</b> <b>hour,</b> we obtain a set of stretching coefficients (SCs) and their corresponding correlation coefficients (CCs). Medians and standard deviations of the CCs are used as indicators of coda repeatability (for instance, a value of 100 %[*]±[*] 0 % would correspond to a coda that always matches its reference whatever the position of the 30 -day window). Results obtained in the RITT-BETS case, using the 17 - to 30 -s coda filtered between 0.2 and 0.5  s (2 to 5 Hz), are presented in Figure  9 (right side, black curves). The coda is confirmed to be more stable at nighttime (up to 40 %[*]±[*] 10 % correlation between the coda and its reference). The standard deviation of the SCs obtained before the first drilling (190  days) is also displayed as a function of <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> (Figure  9, right side, red curve). This curve is used as an indicator of the smallest detectable relative speed variation (Δv/v) that could be observed using our data set with a temporal resolution of 30  days. The detectable speed variation is about 0.1 % during the day and 0.05 % at night.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively {{to right}} ascension, hour angle (abbreviated HA or LHA, <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> angle), a left-handed system, {{measures}} the angular distance {{of an object}} westward along the celestial equator from the observer's meridian to the hour circle passing through the object. Unlike right ascension, hour angle is always increasing with the rotation of Earth. Hour angle may be considered a means of measuring the time since upper culmination, the moment when an object contacts the meridian overhead.|$|R
