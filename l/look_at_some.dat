25|$|The Doctor Who Companion – Series One (July 2005, 100 pages): A {{guide to}} the {{production}} of the first series of the revived TV show. This included a detailed look at the production of each of the episodes by Andrew Pixley, articles on aspects of the design work on various episodes, a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the special effects, a profile of the Ninth Doctor and the original series pitch with annotated notes by show runner Russell T Davies.|$|E
25|$|More {{sophisticated}} analog oscilloscopes {{contain a}} second timebase for a delayed sweep. A delayed sweep provides a very detailed <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> small selected {{portion of the}} main timebase. The main timebase serves as a controllable delay, after which the delayed timebase starts. This can start when the delay expires, or can be triggered (only) after the delay expires. Ordinarily, the delayed timebase is set for a faster sweep, sometimes much faster, such as 1000:1. At extreme ratios, jitter in the delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades the display, but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome that.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Colbert portrays in Report originated as an amplification of his self-important Daily Show correspondent. As {{they developed}} {{the character and}} the show Colbert and his staff began to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> more specific models. Bill O'Reilly, whom the character affectionately nicknames [...] "Papa Bear", is the most commonly cited point of reference. In a 2006 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert remarked that, [...] "if it wasn't for , this show wouldn’t exist". In adapting the character for the Report, Colbert has also mentioned Aaron Brown, Anderson Cooper, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs and Joe Scarborough as having an influence over his performance. References to the character's abuse of prescription drugs {{are believed to be}} an allusion to Rush Limbaugh's addiction to painkillers.|$|E
500|$|As {{they worked}} with Steinbeck, Rodgers and Hammerstein, though renowned for such hits as Oklahoma!, Carousel, and South Pacific, {{suffered}} a relative failure with the 1953 musical Me and Juliet, {{a tale of}} romance among the cast and stagehands backstage at a musical. Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not willing to have Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny. Afterwards, Hammerstein stated, [...] "Why the hell did we give up Fanny? What on earth were we trying to prove? My God, that's a great story and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the junk we've done!" ...|$|E

The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule.

500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|In {{the short}} term, the {{introduction}} of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production. Cameras were noisy, so a soundproofed cabinet was used {{in many of the}} earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors, at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera. For a time, multiple-camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots. The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally. Show Girl in Hollywood (1930), from First National Pictures (which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound), gives a behind-the-scenes <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies. Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings, known as [...] "blimps", designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors. In 1931, a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced: three-way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low, medium, and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass [...] "woofer", a midrange driver, and a treble [...] "tweeter." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{touring the}} {{disaster}} area, Florida Governor Reubin Askew noted, [...] "I think we're {{going to have}} to take a long, close <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the construction [...] Some of the structures simply won't be able to be built back in the exact location where they were." [...] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet [...] wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models. In 1995, reports from the aftermath of Hurricane Opal created a more extensive collection of data.|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, Feige {{said that}} [...] "in an ideal world" [...] {{releases}} each year would include one film {{based on an}} existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's [...] "a nice rhythm" [...] in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so I {{think it would be}} fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I think if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E
