This study considers the L 1 and L 2 proficiency of 30 Korean-English late bilinguals who immigrated to New Zealand during their adolescence and how their L 1 and L 2 proficiency {{is influenced by the}} <b>language</b> <b>use</b> of family members. Data were collected through a questionnaire, a vocabulary test and a story-retelling task, and analysed in terms of <b>language</b> <b>use</b> and <b>language</b> proficiency measures. While <b>language</b> <b>use</b> of Korean siblings and fathers is shown to have a dual role in both affecting <b>language</b> <b>use</b> and L 1 proficiency, the <b>language</b> <b>use</b> of Korean mothers is not associated with their children's patterns of <b>language</b> <b>use</b> or their children's L 1 proficiency. We attribute the differences to different types of interaction between Korean mothers and fathers, and their adolescent children. The data also show that parental <b>language</b> <b>use</b> plays a minimal role in the adolescent L 2 acquisition. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This {{two-phase}} project investigated metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>use</b> {{in second}} <b>language</b> learners’ essays from both perspectives {{of products and}} processes. The first phase relied on text analysis to examine the patterns of metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>use</b> in 396 undergraduate essays at four different year levels, focusing on the metaphoricity and the phraseology of their metaphorical language. The study has shown that there were differences in metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>use</b> at different year levels. Metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>use</b> was also found to correlate with writing grades. Conventional metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>use,</b> in particular, significantly explained writing grades. The second phase explored the learners’ thoughts behind their written production of metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>using</b> data from computer-logged keystrokes and stimulated retrospective interviews. It was {{found that there was}} a relationship between the locations and durations of the pauses and the metaphoricity and phraseology of the metaphorical language the participants produced. The study has shown that learners had low awareness of the metaphorical nature of the <b>language</b> they <b>used,</b> and that the underlying thoughts behind their metaphorical <b>language</b> <b>use</b> involved more non-metaphoric than metaphoric thinking. The project has added new knowledge to current scholarship of metaphor in second language learning and has significant implications for the teaching of L 2 vocabulary and writing...|$|R

In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; the inscription at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription {{is not the same}} as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the <b>language</b> <b>used</b> in the inscription (Herodianus being the Greek version), meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E

40|$|The {{creative}} {{aspect of}} <b>language</b> <b>use</b> provides {{a set of}} phenomena that a science of language must explain.

It will be argued that a corollary of the creative aspect of <b>language</b> <b>use</b> is that a science of language can study the mechanisms that make <b>language</b> <b>use</b> possible, but that such a science cannot explain how these mechanisms enter into human action in the form of <b>language</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
5|$|Johnson's works, {{especially}} his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He {{believed that the}} best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic <b>language</b> <b>used</b> by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E
