5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' <b>Law,</b> a <b>law</b> that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's <b>Law</b> was a <b>law</b> that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's <b>Law.</b> The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the <b>law</b> and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the <b>law</b> was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
