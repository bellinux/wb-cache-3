5|$|Board of Trade {{inspections}} {{took place}} in late December 1862 and early January 1863 to approve the railway for opening.

Charles Pearson did not <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> completion of the project; he died in September 1862.|$|E

It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{electrification}} of the DR, Yerkes did not <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{completion of the}} fast-paced construction works that he set in motion; he died in New York on 29 December 1905 and was replaced as UERL chairman by Edgar Speyer. Speyer {{was chairman of the}} UERL's backer Speyer Brothers and a partner in Speyer & Co. Sir George Gibb, general manager of the North Eastern Railway, was appointed managing director. The BS opened to passengers on 10 March 1906. The GNP followed on 15 December 1906, with the CCE on 22 June 1907. The three tube lines quickly {{came to be known as}} the Bakerloo Tube, Piccadilly Tube and Hampstead Tube.|$|E
5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, {{the court did}} not have its own {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began a fight to get the court a building, and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, {{on the south side of}} the Capitol. Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> court move into the new building, but it did not do so until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E
5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E

5|$|Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant. Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability {{action as a}} class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing. Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E
5|$|Yerkes {{also did}} not <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> UERL's {{financial}} struggle during the first years after {{the opening of the}} new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed to generate the income expected and needed to fund the interest payments on the UERL's substantial borrowings. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26million of a predicted 60million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25million of a predicted 50million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55million. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies, and the further spread of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The low price of tickets also depressed income.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry did not <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> film's release, {{dying of}} heart failure on October 24, 1991. Before the film's release he viewed a near-final version of The Undiscovered Country, and {{according}} to the film's producer and Kelley's biographer, approved a final version of the film. In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused, and within 48 hours he was dead. Paramount considered spending close to $240,000 to send Roddenberry's ashes into space—a move that had the backing of fans—but decided against it; his remains would make it into space along with 22 others in 1997. The film's opening included a note to Roddenberry's memory; at early showings, the crowds of Star Trek fans applauded loudly. While the producers had begun work on the film anticipating it as the last film, by the premiere it was obvious the film would make money and that a Star Trek VII would soon be in the works. The cast was split on the possibility of a sequel; Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley said that the film would be their last, while the supporting cast strongly lobbied for another film. The consensus was for the next film to star the cast of The Next Generation. The seventh Star Trek feature, Star Trek Generations (1994), would blend the old and new cast.|$|E
