25|$|A unit <b>load</b> <b>device</b> (ULD) is a pallet or {{container}} used to load luggage, freight, {{and mail}} on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled {{into a single}} unit. Since this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list (or manifest) so that its contents can be tracked.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{there were}} about 20.5million {{intermodal}} containers {{in the world of}} varying types to suit different cargoes. Containers have largely supplanted the traditional break bulk cargo – in 2010 containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo – whether gaseous, liquid or solid – e.g. by bulk carrier or tank ship, tank car or truck. For air freight, the more light-weight IATA-defined unit <b>load</b> <b>device</b> is used.|$|E
2500|$|Stored {{energy in}} the {{magnetic}} or electric field of a <b>load</b> <b>device,</b> such as a motor or capacitor, causes an offset between the current and the voltage waveforms. [...] A capacitor is an AC device that stores {{energy in the}} form of an electric field. As current is driven through the capacitor, charge build-up causes an opposing voltage to develop across the capacitor. This voltage increases until some maximum dictated by the capacitor structure. In an AC network, the voltage across a capacitor is constantly changing. The capacitor opposes this change, causing the current to lead the voltage in phase. Capacitors are said to [...] "source" [...] reactive power, and thus to cause a leading power factor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{brief review of}} true triaxial apparatuses (TTAs) developed in the past and their advantages and limitations. Considering the limitations of previous designs, a new true triaxial <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> that provides mixed boundary conditions for a true triaxial apparatus (TTA) is introduced. This <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> consists of four sliding rigid plates and two flexible loading faces. The setup of the <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> together with the whole true triaxial system is described. Frictions between sliding plates and the soil membrane surfaces in the new <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> are examined. A three-dimensional finite element (FE) modelling study is carried out on the stress and strain distribution of a soil specimen subjected to loading from two different <b>loading</b> <b>devices.</b> It is found that stresses and strains of a soil specimen subjected to loading from the new sliding plates are far more uniform than those subjected to loading from nonsliding plates with preset gaps. Finally, the paper presents the applications of the present TTA with the new <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> for testing studies of a completely decomposed granite soil and a geofoam. Typical results are presented and discussed. It is found that the present mixed boundary <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> is very suitable for true triaxial testing on both soils and geofoam, especially under large strains or compression without corner contact problems.

40|$|In this paper, a new true {{triaxial}} <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> {{with mixed}} rigid and flexible boundaries and its setup are described. The main {{features of the}} new true triaxial <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> are four sliding rigid plates acting on the soil specimen enclosed in a rubber membrane, which solves the corner contact interference problem. Measures for reducing friction on the specimen are also presented. All forces and sources of friction on the soil specimen applied by this <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> and their influence {{on the distribution of}} strains and stresses in the specimen are analysed and discussed. The true triaxial apparatus with this new <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> has been used to study the stress-strain behaviour of a completely decomposed granite (CDG) soil in Hong Kong. Typical test results are presented and discussed. Based on the description, test results, and discussion, it is found that this new true <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> has a number of merits, especially for testing soils under large strains without corner interferences. It is also found that the stress-strain behaviour of the CDG is dependent on the b-value and the Lade-Duncan failure criterion is more suitable for the CDG in a threedimensional stress state.

40|$|Single-molecule {{mechanical}} manipulation {{has enabled}} the quantitative {{understanding of the}} kinetics of bond ruptures as well as protein unfolding mechanism. Single-molecule experiments with theoretical models have allowed one to gain insight into free energy landscape for chemical bond and/or protein folding. For mechanically induced bond rupture, the bond-rupture kinetics may be governed by <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> However, the role of <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> on the kinetics of mechanical rupture has been rarely received much attention until recently. In this work, we have theoretically and/or computationally studied the effect of loading-device stiffness on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding. Specifically, we have considered a one-dimensional model for a bond rupture whose kinetics is depicted by Kramers' theory. It is elucidated that the kinetics of bond rupture is determined by force constant of <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> The Brownian dynamics simulation of a bond rupture is considered in order to validate our theory. It is illustrated that the mean rupture force {{is dependent on the}} force constant of a <b>loading</b> <b>device,</b> such that increase in the loading-device stiffness leads to the higher bond rupture force. Moreover, we have taken into account the computational simulation of mechanical unfolding of a small protein, i. e. β-hairpin. Our simulation shows that unfolding force is highly correlated with the stiffness of a <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> Our numerical and theoretical studies highlight the significance of a <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding of a chemical bond and/or a folded domain in the single-molecule mechanical experiments.
