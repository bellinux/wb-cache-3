25|$|Medical therapy {{of chronic}} aortic {{insufficiency}} that is stable and asymptomatic {{involves the use}} of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nifedipine, and hydralazine in improving <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the afterload so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very strenuous activity.|$|E
25|$|Indications {{for surgery}} for chronic MI include signs of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> {{dysfunction}} with ejection fraction less than 60%, severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 50 mmHg at rest or 60 mmHg during activity, and new onset atrial fibrillation.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model (TriSeg model) of ventricular mechanics incorporating mechanical {{interaction of the}} <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricular</b> free walls and the interventricular septum is presented. Global <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricular</b> pump mechanics were related to representative myofiber mechanics in the three ventricular walls, satisfying the principle of conservation of energy. The walls were mechanically coupled satisfying tensile force equilibrium in the junction. Wall sizes and masses were rendered by adaptation to normalize mechanical myofiber load to physiological standard levels. The TriSeg model was implemented in the previously published lumped closed-loop CircAdapt model of heart and circulation. Simulation results of cardiac mechanics and hemodynamics during normal ventricular loading, acute pulmonary hypertension, and chronic pulmonary hypertension (including load adaptation) agreed with clinical data as obtained in healthy volunteers and pulmonary hypertension patients. In chronic pulmonary hypertension, the model predicted right ventricular free wall hypertrophy, increased systolic pulmonary flow acceleration, and increased right ventricular isovolumic contraction and relaxation times. Furthermore, septal curvature decreased linearly with its transmural pressure difference. In conclusion, the TriSeg model enables realistic simulation of ventricular mechanics including interaction between <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricular</b> pump mechanics, dynamics of septal geometry, and myofiber mechanics in the three ventricular walls...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Although the resting hemodynamic {{effects of}} {{captopril}} in {{congestive heart failure}} are known, little information is available about the hemodynamic response to captopril during exercise or about changes in noninvasive measurements of the size and function of both ventricles. In this study, 14 stable New York Heart Association class III patients were given 25 mg of oral captopril. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measure-ments and blood pool scintigrams were performed simultaneously before and 90 minutes after captopril. The radionuclide studies were analyzed for <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricular</b> end-diastolic volumes, end-systolic volumes, ejection fractions and pulmonary blood volume. The primary beneficial responses at rest were decreases in <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricular</b> end-diastolic volumes from 388 ± 81 to 350 ± 77 ml (p < 0. 01) and from 52 ± 26 to 43 ± 20 volume units (p < 0. 01), respectively, and in their corresponding filling pressures, from 24 ± 10 to 17 ± 9 mm Hg and 10 ± 5 to 6 ± 5 mm Hg (both p < 0. 001). Although stroke volume did not increase significantly, both <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricular</b> ejection frac...|$|R

25|$|Cardiac arrhythmias are {{a common}} {{characteristic}} of the human diving response. As part of the diving reflex, increased activity of the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system not only regulates the bradycardia, but also is associated with ectopic beats which are characteristic of human heart function during breath-hold dives. Arrhythmias may be accentuated by neural responses to face immersion in cold water, distension of the heart due to central blood shift, and the increasing resistance to <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection (afterload) by rising blood pressure. Arrhythmias commonly measured in the electrocardiogram during human breath-hold dives include ST depression, heightened T wave, and a positive U wave following the QRS complex, measurements associated with reduced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> contractility and overall depressed cardiac function during a dive.|$|E

25|$|Until {{recently}} (within {{the last}} 20 years), β-blockers were contraindicated in CHF, owing to their negative inotropic effect {{and ability to}} produce bradycardia – effects which worsen heart failure. However, current guidelines recommend β-blocker therapy for patients with systolic heart failure due to <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic dysfunction after stabilization with diuretic and ACEI therapy, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. As with ACEI therapy, {{the addition of a}} β-blocker can decrease mortality and improve <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> function. Several β-blockers are specifically indicated for CHF including: bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol and extended-release metoprolol. The antagonism of β1 inotropic and chronotropic effects decreases the amount of work the heart must perform. It is also thought that catecholamines and other sympathomimetics have an effect on cardiac remodeling, and blocking their activity can slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
