5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh <b>lemon</b> <b>peel</b> to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved <b>lemon</b> <b>peel</b> and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

There {{were no significant differences in}} the contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in the studied peeled fruits or their peels. The contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in peels were significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0. 05 in all cases).

40|$|This {{research}} effort aim at {{determining the}} effect of drying on the extraction of pectin from <b>lemon</b> <b>peels.</b> Two methods were used to extract pectin from <b>lemon</b> <b>peels</b> namely: the water base extraction method and the microwave extraction method. These methods were carefully carried out on both the fresh and the dry peels samples. First, the samples were washed, partially dried for the fresh peel and completely dried for the dry peel. Sulphuric acid was used in setting the pH of the solutions to 1, 2 and 3 in the water based extraction method while the use of Ethylene DiamineTetraacetic Acid (EDTA) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) were used to set the pH to 1. 5 and 10 respectively for the microwave extraction method. The solvent systems were then treated with the pectin samples at different times and temperatures to obtain varying results. The effect of time, temperature, pH and solvent systems were then studied and the yields obtained were recorded and compared. The results obtained shows that when a peel is completely dried using sun, it losses some amount of pectin probably due to thermal degradation of the pectin in the albedo resulting in pectin yield becoming small. The result also revealed that increase in acidity, extraction time and temperature increases the yield by a range of 0. 01 to 0. 50...|$|R

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of waste biomass to produce electricity, biofuels and chemicals can represent a {{renewable energy source}} and a safeguard for environment. Recently we have studied some wastes as wood sawdust, paper sludge, exhausted <b>lemon</b> <b>peels,</b> tobacco chops, coffee tofferaction wastes, olive tree pruning, which are economically relevant for our country. A new process for the complete and efficient acid-catalyzed {{exploitation of}} the three components (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) of the above wastes has been optimized. This process allows us to convert the aqueous biomass slurry to furfural (yield up to 10 wt % with respect to dry biomass) and levulinic acid (4 -oxopentanoic acid, LA, yield up to 25 wt % with respect to dry biomass) using a very dilute acid and a temperature of 100 - 200 °C. When the acid-catalyzed reaction is carried out in ethanol slurry, ethyl levulinate (EL) is obtained (up to 22 wt % yield). The recovered lignin has been characterized by FT-IR, NMR and DSC: it resulted lignino-similar, with high content of functional groups and low molecular weight.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare two {{extraction}} processes for the production of lemon liqueur (limoncello) —the traditional maceration of <b>lemon</b> <b>peels</b> and a cyclically pressurized extraction process also known as rapid solid-liquid dynamic extraction (RSLDE) that uses a Naviglio extractor. To evaluate the extraction efficiency of the two processes, dry matter obtained by the evaporation of the extracts was used to construct kinetics curves. The dry matter was directly proportional to the amount of the active principle (terpenes) extracted and consequently to the total concentration. Alcoholic extracts were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) to monitor the extraction kinetics for major components of the terpene fraction and for minor components of essential oils. Moreover, alcoholic extracts were analysed by UV spectrophotometry to identify the more abundant chemical species, while the organoleptic tests (i. e., a consumer test) performed on the final product (limoncello) provided an indication of the taste of the final product and revealed features undetectable with instrumental analytical techniques. To better understand the phenomenon considered, a numerical simulation was performed to evaluate and compare the matter flow of extractable compounds during the process...|$|R

30|$|Various studies {{reported}} that {{different kinds of}} waste such as pomegranate <b>peels,</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>peels</b> and green walnut husks {{can be used as}} natural antimicrobials (Adámez et al. 2012; Katalinic et al. 2010). Wastes from the organic compounds although a risk to the atmosphere, but they represent a possible source for making of mushrooms as foodstuffs and other bio-based products like bio-energy and biofertilizers. Some of the agricultural residues are used for animal food. However, such wastes contain variability in composition like high amount of proteins, sugars, and minerals. Due to high nutritional composition, these residues not described as “wastes” but considered as raw materials for other product formation and developments. The availability of these nutrients in raw materials offers appropriate environments for the growth of microorganisms. These microorganisms have got the ability to reuse the raw materials with the use of fermentation processes. The agro-industrial residues are used for solid support in SSF developments for making different beneficial products. It also helps for the production of fermentable sugars by reducing the production cost on the basis of food crops. Various studies were carried out to know the conversion of agricultural waste into sugars by using different microorganisms (Nguyen et al. 2010). Finally, this review described the prospective uses of agro-industrial wastes by SSF processes.|$|R
