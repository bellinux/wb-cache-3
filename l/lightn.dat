40|$|Abs&&: Modeling of {{lightning}} return strokes {{as sources of}} elwc fields is reviewed. Validation of the models using measured fields due to natural and triggered lightning is discussed. 1. InWBduetion All lightning processes, in both cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges, {{are associated with the}} motion of charges an & as a result, produce lectromagnetic fields. Only one (presumably the most important from an EMC point of view) process, the return stroke in cloud-to-ground <b>lightn</b> & is considered in this review. There are basically four levels of sophistication in the mathematical modeling of the lightning return stroke. (1) The first, and most mathematically sophisticated level, typically involves the solution of three gas dynamic equation...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} proposes a simple monodimensional model to {{estimate}} the linear growth rate of photosynthetic microorganisms in flat-plate photobioreactors (FPPBRs) during batch cultivation. As a model microorganism, Chlorella kessleri was cultivated photoautotrophically in FPPBRs using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light sources to provide unidirectional irradiation in the photobioreactors. Various conditions were simulated by adjusting both {{the intensity of the}} light and the height of the culture. The validity of the proposed model was examined by comparing the linear growth rates measured with the predicted ones obtained from the proposed model. Accordingly, the value of was proposed as an approximate index for strategies to obtain the maximal <b>lightn</b> yield under light-limiting conditions for high-density algal cultures and as a control parameter to improve the photosynthetic productivity and efficiency...|$|E
60|$|I confess I had not entertained {{any notion}} of my {{ammunition}} being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it <b>lightned</b> and thundered, as I observed just now.|$|R

40|$|Topic of my diploma {{thesis is}} "Using of malt {{extracts}} for gingerbread doughs". The {{subject of this}} thesis is possibility of use baking malt extract for gingerbread doughs. In this examination, six kind of gingerbread was made. The difference in the compound of the examined gingerbreads was use of various kinds of sweeteners. For this examination were used honey, invert sugar and malt extract. For the other gingerbread doughs were used these combinations of sweeteners (invert sugar + honey, invert sugar + malt extract and honey + malt extract). For this sensory analysis were used eight descriptors [...] shape, colour, surface, smell, porosity, aroma of spices, overall flavour and overall impression. Besides the sensory analysis, also was measured colour of gingerbreads with using spectrophotometer. By the sensory analysis and spectrophotometric determinativ was found, that the darkest gingerbreads were with invert sugar in combination with honey and the <b>lightnest</b> gingerbreads were with malt extract and with honey. From {{the results of this}} sensory analysis was defined that, the sample where invert sugar was used, gave best results. The use of malt extract for gingerbread dough is not suitable, mainly because of the bad colour, smell and flavour of the final product. There is possibility to use malt extract in combination with invert sugar for better characteristics of the final product. In this case, the invert sugar will be the predominate sweetener (malt extract in amount of 2 %) ...|$|R
