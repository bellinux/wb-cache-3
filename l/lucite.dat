5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent <b>lucite,</b> allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard {{was ranked}} as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, {{consisting}} of a Moon rock encased in <b>Lucite,</b> for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.|$|E

500|$|... "Aura" [...] {{triggers}} off {{the next}} act with Gaga and the dancers performing {{on the main}} stage. A red couch is brought out on which [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] is sung. Following this, white chairs are brought out onto the stage by the dancers for [...] "Mary Jane Holland", during which a choreography is shown with the chairs. [...] "Alejandro" [...] takes place on the <b>lucite</b> runways while Gaga declares that she would change costume on stage. [...] "Ratchet" [...] plays as an intro as Gaga strips naked while her stylists help change into the rave inspired outfit and wig. The performance of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] starts with the original choreography from its music video, followed by [...] "Applause", during which a video backdrop shows the singer in various disguises. Next Gaga begins performing [...] "Swine", during which her dancers fire stuffed animals into the crowd using cannons. Gaga leaves {{the stage for a}} final costume change, appearing to perform [...] "Gypsy" [...] for the encore. Gaga performs most of the song at the piano then makes her way along the runway to finish the performance on the main stage and closes the show.|$|E
500|$|For the tour, Gaga told Capital FM {{that she}} wanted {{something}} other than the [...] "Monster Pit" [...] arrangement she previously had in the Born This Way Ball tour, since she was always limited to performing on one portion of the arena. Hence Gaga and her team thought of building two stages, one main stage and an accompanying one on {{the far end of the}} arena. It would be enhanced by the addition of a catwalk which would wind all around the arena floor, enabling the singer to interact with the audience. In March 2014, Gaga tweeted a picture of the stage which showed a runway extending from the main platform up to the general admission seats and then bifurcating into two additional runways, ending in small stages within the audience. At the end of the first runway, another platform was constructed which descended into the crowd directly. Gaga noted that the [...] long runways would be made of <b>lucite</b> rendering them translucent, so that the crowd can dance underneath it while still being able to watch the show. The main stage was described as a white cave, reminiscent of Atlantica from the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid, and featured a digital backdrop showing stars and the moon.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} placed {{inside the white}} dome like {{structures}} on the stage, described by John Jurgenson from The Wall Street Journal as like the planet Tatooine in the Star Wars series. At {{the end of one}} of the <b>Lucite</b> runways, a piano was hidden beneath enormous stalagmite-like structures reminiscent of Superman's Fortress of Solitude in the comics. There was also a bar overlooking the piano area, where the audience could order drinks while watching the show. Carl Williot from Idolator website compared the stage with that of ArtRave, and felt that it looked like an [...] "insect" [...] with the extended runway and smaller stages. Following the reveal of the image, the hashtag #LadyGagaTourStage started trending globally in Twitter. According to Stacy Lambe from Out magazine, the stage took over 21,000 hours to construct, including the catwalks. There are 15 inflatable trees which are air hosed on the stage to re-create a garden during one of the segments. The whole set up took three hours to dismantle and 21 trucks to carry it from one venue to another. Production manager Jason [...] "JD" [...] Danter explained that the whole set up started from 8:00 am in the morning, with lighting and sound checks taking six hours to complete.|$|E

Comic Book Guy, who has styled himself as a villain called [...] "The Collector", kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready. The Collector takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized PET film bag for [...] "safekeeping" [...] and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray {{in an attempt to}} free Xena, but they are soon captured as well. The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of [...] "Lucite". After feigning interest in the villain, Lawless starts clobbering him. The Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from [...] (which was released a few months before the episode) and ignites the blades, but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging, he panics and ends up falling into the <b>Lucite.</b> Lawless then flies the children home (Lisa points out that Xena cannot fly, but Lawless reminds her she's not Xena, she's Lucy Lawless).|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the sale, Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction. Connelly consented and took the card across the country to {{prospective}} buyers. Meanwhile, HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards' struggles with the card. Connelly met a card dealer in New York City, Mike Mangasarian, who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the card out. Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick <b>lucite</b> holder for a closer examination. A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton, NY. After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not. He explained that all T-206's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was in black. Additionally, he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front. Meanwhile, a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card's listing on the website be removed. eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin. As a result, a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day. As Connelly pointed out, the collectors chose not to make bids because [...] "hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised too many questions about its authenticity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{acrylic acid}} {{was created in}} 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark <b>Lucite.</b> In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now <b>Lucite</b> International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass. Civilian applications followed after the war.|$|E

Hambro liked the [...] "Magna" [...] model alto sax for its brilliant sound, and believed the [...] "Magna"-hard reed combination was {{less likely to}} play out of tune. During the 1950s, Hambro was often photographed with a Brilhart [...] "Tonalin" [...] ivory-colored <b>Lucite</b> mouthpiece. On clarinet, he also played a harder reed - a Vandoren #4. Lenny played a Martin [...] "The Martin" [...] tenor saxophone. After 1967, Hambro experimented with the Selmer Varitone electronic pickup and effects unit, which can be heard on Chico O'Farrill's 1968 album, [...] "Married Well", and 1995's [...] "More Than Mambo: Introduction To Afro-Cuban Jazz", both from Verve.|$|E
