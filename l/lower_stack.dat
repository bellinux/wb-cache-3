The stack {{height of a}} frame and fork is the difference between the steerer tube length and the head tube length. Stack height is critical because a headset with a greater stack height than the frame and fork will not fit; the locknut will not thread on sufficiently (threaded) or there will be no room for the stem (threadless).

50|$|A formal grammar that {{contains}} left recursion cannot be parsed by a LL(k)-parser or other naive recursive descent parser {{unless it is}} converted to a weakly equivalent right-recursive form. In contrast, left recursion is preferred for LALR parsers because it results in <b>lower</b> <b>stack</b> usage than right recursion. However, more sophisticated top-down parsers can implement general context-free grammars by use of curtailment. In 2006, Frost and Hafiz described an algorithm which accommodates ambiguous grammars with direct left-recursive production rules. That algorithm was extended to a complete parsing algorithm to accommodate indirect as well as direct left recursion in polynomial time, and to generate compact polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees for highly ambiguous grammars by Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan in 2007. The authors then implemented the algorithm {{as a set of}} parser combinators written in the Haskell programming language.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{expected}} {{that the presence of}} new functional groups from the DES sources contributed to changing the structure such that it differs from that of p-Gr. For example, if the reduction reaction took place and new hydrophobic functional groups were added, the π-π stacking between the layers would be enhanced to a higher level than the stacking in p-Gr. In contrast, the addition of hydrophilic functional groups (which replace the existing oxygen groups) would result in a <b>lower</b> <b>stacking</b> level than that of a fully-cleaned surface. To prove this, dispersibility tests were conducted in aqueous solutions. The improvement or deterioration in graphene dispersibility compared to o-Gr and p-Gr confirmed the roles of the hydrophilic or hydrophobic functional groups that possibly were attached after treatment with DES.|$|R

In the present work, this extrinsic effect happened in TWIP steel has been studied in depth. GDOES (Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometry) analyses have been carried out in order to study quantitatively the C and Mn concentration profiles.

40|$|This article {{reports a}} facile {{synthesis}} of Pd-Cu bimetallic tripods with a purity over 90 %. Two requirements {{must be met}} in order to form tripods: i) formation of triangular, plate-like seeds during the nucleation step and ii) preferential deposition of atoms onto the three corners of a seed during the growth step. In this synthesis, these requirements are fulfilled by adding CuCl 2 and KBr into an aqueous synthesis. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the Cu atoms resulting from underpotential deposition could greatly reduce the energy barrier involved {{in the formation of}} triangular seeds with planar defects because of the much <b>lower</b> <b>stacking</b> fault energy (41 mJ·m- 2 for Cu vs 220 mJ·m- 2 for Pd). The Br- ions could strongly bind to the three { 100 } side faces of a triangular seed, forcing the Pd atoms to grow from the three corners of a seed to generate a tripod. When compared with commercial Pd black, the Pd-Cu tripods exhibited substantially enhanced catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of formic acid.

Riser monitoring systems (RMS) have been introduced {{in order to provide}} a more accurate calculation of this accumulated damage, as well as providing guidance for optimal rig position, so the operation envelope could be extended. This thesis looks into the possibility of calculating section forces and bending moment at two different locations, the lowermost end of the riser and {{at the top of the}} WH, by using different analytical algorithms. The input to the algorithms are assumed to be provided by a set of instrumentation, that measures forces and other important parameters at the lower tapered stress joint (LTSJ) and on top of the <b>lower</b> <b>stack.</b> The algorithms extrapolate loads from the measured positions to any location in the <b>lower</b> <b>stack.</b> The algorithms derived in this project are tested and compared with each other, for various combinations of wave loads, rig offset, current and boundary conditions for the well head.

It is also tested how different configurations for placing the instrumentation at the LTSJ affect the analytical calculated results at the lowermost end of the LTSJ.

The catalysts were characterized by means of N- 2 physisorption, XRD, SEM, TPR, XPS and HRTEM. The characterization results show that, compared with the NiMo/Al 2 O 3 catalysts prepared by impregnation method, the as-prepared NiMo-Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibit smaller nano-sized spherical particles of alumina, higher dispersions of Ni and Mo species, shorter length and <b>lower</b> <b>stacking</b> layer number of MoS 2 slabs.

40|$|Abstract—Unified tracing is {{the process}} of {{collecting}} trace logs across the boundary of kernel and user spaces, and has been used to understand the in-depth correspondence between low level events and application program context for diagnosing system failures and performance problems. Crossing the boundary from the kernel space to a user space to collect trace events from dual spaces imposes challenges compared to crossing the boundary in the other way from a user space to the kernel space due to multiple scheduled programs and diverse code layouts in the user space regarding the tracing target. In this paper, we propose a novel unified tracing system called Uscope to systematically trace kernel and unprecedented user code with low overhead. The key idea is to use an efficient variant of <b>stack</b> walking. Uscope <b>lowers</b> <b>stack</b> walking overhead by adjusting the scope of walking in two ways: (1) a highly configurable focus within the call stack, and (2) a per-application tracing that systematically tracks a dynamic set of new, exiting, or transforming processes and threads of an application software. This system is realized by using a flexible stack walking algorithm and a runtime kernel structure, Trace Map. These key features lead to low run-time overhead under 6 % relative to native execution on a set of widely used benchmarks.

HRTEM revealed much <b>lower</b> <b>stacking</b> fault density in the co-implanted sample than in the As-only and Ga-only samples with comparable doses. After low temp annealing, the nonstoichiometric samples had {{a large number of}} residual defects. For higher dose implants, very high temperatures (700 C) were needed to remove residual defects for all samples. The stoichiometrically balanced layer did not regrow better than the Ga-only and As-only samples. The co-implanted sample exhibited a thinner amorphous layer and a room temperature (RT) annealing effect. The amorphous layer regrew about 5 nm, suggesting that stoichiometrically balanced amorphous layers can regrow even at RT. Mechanisms for solid phase crystallization in (100) GasAs is discussed: nucleation and growth of randomly oriented crystallites and SPE. These two mechanisms compete in compound semiconductors at much lower temperatures than in Si. For the low dose As-only and Ga-only samples with low-temp anneals, both mechanisms are active. For this amorphization threshold dose, crystallites remain in the amorphous layer for all as-implants. 250 C annealing showed recrystallization from the surface and bulk for these samples; for the co-implant, the mechanism is not evident...|$|R
