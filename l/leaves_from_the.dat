5|$|In May 1975, during {{restoration}} work, {{the monks}} of Saint Catherine's Monastery discovered a room beneath the St. George Chapel which contained many parchment fragments. Kurt Aland {{and his team}} from the Institute for New Testament Textual Research were the first scholars who exclusively were invited to analyse, examine and photograph these new fragments of the New Testament in 1982. Among these fragments were twelve complete <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sinaiticus, 11 leaves of the Pentateuch and 1 leaf of the Shepherd of Hermas. Together with these leaves 67 Greek Manuscripts of New Testament have been found (uncials 0278 – 0296 and some minuscules).|$|E

5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E

25|$|The {{contents}} of the seven missing <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end is uncertain. There would be enough space for 2 Thessalonians and possibly Philemon, {{but not for the}} Pastoral epistles. Kenyon calculates that 2 Thessalonians would require two leaves, leaving only five remaining leaves (10 pages) for the remaining canonical Pauline literature — 1 Timothy (estimated 8.25 pages), 2 Timothy (6 pages), Titus (3.5 pages) and Philemon (1.5 pages) — totaling ten required leaves (19.25 pages).|$|E
25|$|Tea may be {{consumed}} {{early in the}} day to heighten calm alertness; it contains L-theanine, theophylline, and bound caffeine (sometimes called theine). Decaffeinated brands are also sold. While herbal teas are also referred to as tea, most of them do not contain <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tea plant. While tea is the second most consumed beverage on Earth after water, in many cultures it is also consumed at elevated social events, such as the tea party.|$|E
25|$|Some teas, {{especially}} green teas {{and delicate}} oolong teas, are steeped for shorter periods, sometimes less than 30 seconds. Using a tea strainer separates the <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{water at the}} end of the brewing time if a tea bag is not being used. However, the black Darjeeling tea, a premium Indian tea, needs a longer than average steeping time. Elevation and time of harvest offer varying taste profiles; proper storage and water quality also have a large impact on taste.|$|E

25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of various trees, {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly double-layered, with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope is thicker when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat might be related to the rain exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tree, incorporated into the envelope, to cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
25|$|If H is an induced {{subgraph}} of a cograph G, then H {{is itself a}} cograph; the cotree for H may be formed by removing some of the <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cotree for G and then suppressing nodes that have only one child. It follows from Kruskal's tree theorem that the relation of being an {{induced subgraph}} is a well-quasi-ordering on the cographs. Thus, if a subfamily of the cographs (such as the planar cographs) is closed under induced subgraph operations then it has {{a finite number of}} forbidden induced subgraphs. Computationally, this means that testing membership in such a subfamily may be performed in linear time, by using a bottom-up computation on the cotree of a given graph to test whether it contains any of these forbidden subgraphs. However, when the sizes of two cographs are both variable, testing whether one of them is an induced subgraph of the other is NP-complete.|$|E
25|$|Several {{contemporary}} manuscripts {{from the}} 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes {{been attributed to}} Roslin. MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at Nor Nakhichevan and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions passant in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are {{much closer to the}} ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s. Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gospel of John have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in Vaspurakan.|$|E
