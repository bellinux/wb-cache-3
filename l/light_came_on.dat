25|$|The Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV) {{started an}} inquiry, {{following}} {{the recovery of}} the cockpit voice recorder a week after the crash. The flight data recorder was also recovered, and results from its decoded ribbon showed that the aircraft was flying at cruising altitude with the autopilot engaged, that it got disengaged twelve seconds after the autopilot failure light lit, and that both directional and longitudinal control was lost moments later, with the aircraft crashing 73 seconds after the <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b> The angle and the speed of the impact were estimated to be between 45° and 50° and in the range of , respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, the {{wrap-around}} {{instrument panel}} was substantially revised and optionally {{available for the}} first time (and seldom ordered) was a driver's side airbag system with an exclusive steering wheel design. 1974 was the final year for the Max Trac traction control option. New options for 1974 included radial tires and a [...] "low fuel" [...] warning <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> when the gas tank was down to only four gallons. A new distinctive [...] "Landau" [...] option was available on the Limited coupe that included the now-popular rear side opera windows and rear-quarter vinyl roof.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Captain Nowroz's {{decision}} to approach Gatwick {{with a view}} to landing there presented [...] "no undue risk" [...] and did not cause the accident. Instead, the cause was found to be a series of changes to speed, power and flap angle settings which were not in accordance with the airline's operating procedures and which took place in the last [...] of the approach. At 0128, the aircraft picked up the ILS localiser beam, and the flaps were lowered in three stages as the aircraft's speed reduced. Soon afterwards, as it approached the ILS glideslope beam, its height and speed were reduced further and the undercarriage was extended. Then the Captain saw a light which he mistook for one {{at the far end of}} the runway—it was actually on a hill beyond the airport—and the [...] "stabiliser out of trim" [...] warning <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b> This had been faulty earlier in the flight, and the Captain disengaged the autopilot and the automatic glideslope tracker. At 0133, the flap angle was increased; the aircraft then began to fall below the approach slope and was travelling faster than the crew thought. Only when it reached a height of [...] was an attempt made to gain height, but this happened too late.|$|E

2500|$|At Monaco, Yoong {{participated in}} the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco before the actual event. He drove a Lotus 72 that was driven by Ronnie Peterson. He led until a safety car {{intervention}} when Yoong discovered his car was stuck in fifth gear {{and was forced to}} drive in this manner {{until the end of the}} race. During the actual Grand Prix weekend, Yoong sustained an accident during Thursday practice followed by a similar incident in qualifying when, on his first flying lap, he slid into the Ste Devote barrier. The race saw Yoong retired after running over debris on the approach to Massanet and sidewalled the armco to sustain damage his right rear trackrod. In Canada, he finished 14th despite a drink bottle button not being able to function and gained a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. At the Nurburging, Yoong declared the track [...] "a bit of a go-kart circuit" [...] as he disliked the layout. A second drive-through penalty was gained after he moved as the fifth red <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> at the start. At Silverstone, he failed to make the 107% cut during qualifying whilst a 10th-place finish followed up at Magny-Cours despite a spin. At the German Grand Prix, Yoong failed to qualify having missed the 107% cut by 0.2s.|$|E

60|$|A long, vague period intervened, {{and people}} {{looking out of}} the windows of upper rooms {{discovered}} the dark hulls of German airships, gliding slowly and noiselessly, quite close at hand.

60|$|I listened, for the {{electric}} light had temporarily gone out, owing, I suppose, to the dynamo having {{stopped for a}} moment. A most unholy and hollow sound was rising from the cabin floor.

Then the <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> again and we saw Bastin lying at full length on the carpet.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the gray}} <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> anxiously we {{scrutinized}} {{the features of}} the craft, as one by one they became more plainly revealed. Every thing seemed stranger now, than when partially visible in the dingy night. The stanchions, or posts of the bulwarks, were of rough stakes, still incased in the bark. The unpainted sides were of a dark-colored, heathenish looking wood. The tiller was a wry-necked, elbowed bough, thrusting itself through the deck, as if the tree itself was fast rooted in the hold. The binnacle, containing the compass, was defended at the sides by yellow matting. The rigging-- shrouds, halyards and all--was of [...] "Kaiar," [...] or cocoa-nut fibres; and here and there the sails were patched with plaited rushes.|$|E
