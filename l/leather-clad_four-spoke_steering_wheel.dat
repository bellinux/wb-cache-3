50|$|In May 2012, {{the plant}} built a restyled {{model of the}} UAZ Patriot with a {{different}} dashboard, which {{no longer had a}} handle for the front passenger. It had a new, safer <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> from the German manufacturer Takata-Petri, 2DIN media player and a USB-connector for flash drives.|$|R
5000|$|Also new was the SL/E version, {{which used}} many {{interior}} options from the TC [...] "Sandpiper" [...] series {{such as the}} radio/cassette, <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> timber dash inserts, velour seat trim, loop pile carpet and timber (Hardboard) door trim inserts. The SL/E also received the five-speed manual as standard.|$|R

5000|$|A more {{conventional}} <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> including an integrated airbag. The driver airbag was standard on most models and countries, regardless of hand-drive configuration. As a result, {{the second generation}} models never had Citroën's distinctive single-spoke wheel. In certain markets (mainly the UK) and for certain models XMs were fitted with a two-spoke wheel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{novelties}} {{are found}} in the interior: the <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> that includes the horn, new buttons and new chrome lines to suggest a new look. There is also a new glossy plastic that covers the dashboard and fits better with the [...] "MediaNav" [...] multimedia system that has received an updated interface with a better resolution.|$|R
50|$|On 19 August 2013, PT Toyota Astra Motor {{launched}} the third facelift of the Innova, {{which is known}} as the New Kijang Innova. Changes consist of a larger grille, redesigned bumpers and a new trunk garnish exclusive to the E, G and V variants. A <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and dual airbags are also standard features on this model.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013: Redesigned {{the front}} bumper, rear bumper and grille (is now larger, similar to Toyota Alphard) and added rear {{ornaments}} (not available for J). G, V and Luxury variants got two-tone wheel color and new aerokit. Interior color changed to black and grey. ABS, <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> rear blower and dual SRS airbags {{is now a}} standard.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, the {{instrument}} panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an [...] "Air Cushion Restraint System" [...] which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.|$|R
50|$|When the Diamante was updated in 1994, sedans {{received}} revised taillamps, and a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with audio controls. All models now {{included a}} {{passenger side airbag}} and cruise control as standard. For the LS, the manual sunroof was deleted from the option list and replaced with a CD player, power sunroof and traction control. Anti-lock brakes were standard on the LS and optional on the ES and wagon.|$|R
2500|$|In 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia {{to design}} a badge for the company; the Count {{submitted}} six watercolour proposal sketches. Vincenzo Lancia chose a round one, composed by a blue lance and flag bearing a Lancia script ("Lancia" [...] means [...] "lance" [...] in Italian) in gold, over a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> with a hand throttle detail on the right spoke. The first car to bear the Lancia logo was the Gamma 20 HP in 1911.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Lancia logo {{was designed}} by Count Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia.In 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia to design a badge for the company; the Count submitted six watercolour proposal sketches. Vincenzo Lancia chose a round one, composed by a blue lance and flag bearing a Lancia script ("Lancia" [...] means [...] "lance" [...] in Italian) in gold, over a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> with a hand throttle detail on the right spoke. The first car to bear the Lancia logo was the Gamma 20 HP in 1911.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{interior}} changes include alloy pedals, new colours, a re-designed <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with remote audio controls, white finish instrument dials and minor gauges now in their own dedicated binnacle in {{the centre of the}} dash. The multi-function read-out has been re-programmed to show the HSV logo and the vehicle build number and identification during start-up. Automatic climate control and a Blaupunkt 6-disc CD stacker are standard and 8 speakers. Carbon-fibre trim is found throughout the cabin as well as light shale leather trim. The starting price for the Senator at the time was $74000.|$|R
5000|$|Mid-way into 1984 Dodge {{introduced}} a sporty new [...] "ES Turbo" [...] package for convertibles. It featured Chrysler's new 2.2 L [...] Turbocharged engine (which also became an option on sedans and coupes) {{and a special}} sport-tuned [...] "ES" [...] suspension. The interior came with standard leather seats, digital dashboard, and <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> (redesigned in 1985). Visual exterior cues differentiate ES models from base convertibles by way of blacked-out trim (replacing much of the chrome), 15-inch [...] "pizza" [...] style aluminum wheels, [...] "ES" [...] decklid badges, Turbo fender badges, and functioning dual hood vents.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Z07 {{had been}} designed with production in mind. As a result, practical and regulatory considerations necessitated very few changes for the production model. Nevertheless, the windshield of the Z8 was extended upward, and a larger front airdam was fitted. Both changes were implemented to provide aerodynamic stability and a reasonably placid cockpit environment. The <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> of the concept car {{was replaced by a}} three spoke design. The hardtop was changed from a double-bubble form with a tapering faring to a single dome with a truncated convex backside. The concept's exotic driver's side helmet fairing was eliminated to allow easy operation of the power soft top.|$|R
5000|$|Changes for 2000 {{were also}} largely {{cosmetic}} in nature. Monterey Maroon Metallic was added as an optional color, {{similar to the}} previously available Medium Patriot Red. The SS, however, was not available in this color. GM also changed {{the name of the}} previous paint color [...] "black" [...] to [...] "ebony". Previously, all V8 cars had side mirrors painted in this black color. A new <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> as found in other GM models of the time, was introduced to replace the two-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> dating back to the 1993 cars. A new 10-spoke 16 in wheel became available, but the older 5-spokes were still optional. The base models came with 15-inch steel wheels, with hubcaps. The 3.8L (231 ci) V6 and 5.7 L (346 ci) LS1 V8s continued with no changes.|$|R
50|$|The {{lightened}} {{and more}} powerful Merak SS (Tipo AM122/A) was introduced at the 41st Geneva Motor Show in March 1975, although it did not enter production until the next year. It featured a 50 kg weight reduction and a 30 PS power increase to , thanks {{to the adoption of}} three larger 44 DCNF 44 carburettors and a higher 9:1 compression ratio. The SS was recognizable from a black grille between the pop-up headlights. A Maserati-designed upper fascia with round instruments and a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> replaced the previous SM-derived interior furniture. Later cars were bestowed with the full driver-oriented dashboard and three-spoke padded <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> of the Maserati Bora. The US-spec version of the Merak SS also saw a return to traditional hydraulics, eliminating the last of the Citroen high pressure system. 1000 units of the SS had been made by 1983, when all Merak production ceased.|$|R
50|$|June 1984 {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of the Lancia Prisma diesel, the marque's first modern diesel-engined passenger car. The diesel was imperative, as {{more than a third of}} Italian sales in the Prisma's class were of diesel-powered cars. Its naturally aspirated 1929 cc SOHC four-cylinder had an iron block, aluminium head and indirect injection; it put out 65 PS. The engine had been developed by Fiat, and was also installed in the Fiat Regata DS—although the Fiat lacked some of Lancia's NVH-improving solutions. The diesel engine was light, only weighing 11 kg more than the 1.6-liter petrol unit. All Diesel Prismas sported a sightly domed hood, needed to clear the taller engine. Some updates were introduced with the diesel, including optional hydraulic power steering, redesigned seats, new striped cloth upholstery and a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
25|$|Also {{produced}} by Star Custom Vehicles, {{based on the}} Chevette L hatchback specification, with black, silver and orchid livery, colour impregnated front air dam, flexi rear spoiler, alloy wheels with locking option, head restraints, black <b>four-spoke</b> sport <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> centre console, burled walnut fascia, hinged glove box and door capping, removable tinted glass sun hatch, and two-wave band radio / stereo cassette player with door speakers.|$|R
5000|$|The $187 Nova SS option group {{included}} a black grille with unique diamond-mesh pattern, Rally <b>wheels,</b> <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> and heavy-duty suspension.1977 model year minor changes included {{a more modern}} round gauge cluster to replace the long sweeping speedometer, and a revised dash panel which changed to a flatter design. Some new colors were offered (as {{with the rest of}} the divisions) and some small trim added. A separate brochure was printed for the Concours while the [...] "1977 Nova" [...] brochure detailed only base and Custom versions.The Nova SS previously offered for 1975 and 1976 was discontinued, the option code for the SS — RPO Z26 — continued as the Nova Rally from 1977 through 1979. A badged-engineered Nova Malibu Rallye (1977 and 1978 model years - not related to the USA market Chevelle-based model and based on the Nova hatchback coupe) was sold in Mexico using the RPO Z26 package but fitted with 'Malibu Rallye' graphics and a front grille emblem.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark X concept model {{features}} a convertible panoramic glass roof. The interior was {{also based on}} a [...] "Lincolnized" [...] version {{of that in the}} standard Thunderbird (which in turn is derived from the Lincoln LS) - which differentiates it from the MK9 interior. The Mark X's interior is, according to Ford Motor Company's press release, [...] "dressed in Lime Sorbet with white Corian accents, polished aluminum, dark chrome, natural grain leather seating surfaces, plush sheepskin flooring and tailored tone-on-tone stitching throughout. Its <b>four-spoke,</b> power-adjustable <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> also is leather wrapped." ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1971 model saw minor styling changes, mostly cosmetic. The {{headlamp}} bezels {{were more}} of a squircle shape with rectangular front parking lamps, the grille had no horizontal divider and the openings were rectangular-shaped, the hood spear included a stand-up ornament with “Chevrolet” script lettering, the trunk lock keyhole had the Monte Carlo Crest surrounding it, and the tail lights now had two horizontal and one vertical chrome strips. Inside, the SS model got new [...] "European symbol knobs", and a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> became optional. Mechanically it was largely unchanged, although the small-block Turbo-Fire 400 two-barrel engine was dropped. Other engines had compression ratios lowered to allow the use of regular leaded, low-lead, or unleaded gasoline, per a GM corporate edict. Engine ratings fell to 245 hp (183 kW) for the base Turbo-Fire 350 CID (5.7 L) two-barrel, 270 hp (201 kW) for the Turbo-Fire 350-4V, and 300 hp (224 kW) for the Turbo-Jet 400. The SS 454 engine was actually raised to a nominal 365 gross hp (272 kW) despite the reduction in compression ratio. This increase in horsepower {{was a result of}} the 454 engine using the more aggressive camshaft from the 390 hp 454 used in the 1970 Chevrolet Corvette and full-sized sedans.|$|R
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers. The fuel filler neck was moved from inside the trunk to the right front quarter panel, just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a <b>four-spoke</b> black <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{intended}} to replace the 850 Spider, another Bertone design, not the more expensive 124 Sport spider whose production continued {{for much of the}} X1/9's life. The car's monocoque body was produced at the Bertone factory in Grugliasco (Turin) and then transported to the Fiat's Lingotto factory for final assembly. As mentioned before, the X1/9's type 128 AS [...] single overhead cam inline-four engine was derived from the Fiat 128, specifically from the 128 Coupé 1300. Changes included a new cast aluminium oil sump, complementing the aluminium cylinder head. With a twin-choke Weber 32 DMTR carburettor and an 8.9:1 compression ratio, the engine produced [...] at 6,000 rpm and [...] Nm of torque at 3,400 rpm.The all-synchronized 4-speed transmission was also carried over from the 128, though with a taller fourth gear ratio to exploit the sports car's better aerodynamics. As a consequence the X1/9 had a top speed of over 170 km/h, 10 km/h higher than the similarly engined but 65 kg lighter 128 Coupé 1300.As standard the X1/9 came with 4.5J×13-inch stamped steel wheels fitted with 145 HR 13 tyres, while cast alloy wheels were an extra-cost option.Suspensions were all-independent, of the MacPherson type on both axles. The split circuit brake system used equally sized 227 mm discs all around. [...] Steering was rack and pinion.The interior, upholstered in leatherette, featured two bucket seats with integrated headrests and a <b>four-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> (resembling the one fitted to the Lamborghini Marzal).|$|R
50|$|For 1974, North American models {{received}} newly required 5 mph impact bumpers {{mounted on}} self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately 25 mm to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment {{point of the}} strut, was redesigned to improve handling {{and stability in the}} event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel 5.5 in wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel 4.5 in-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded <b>four-spoke</b> deluxe <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof.|$|R
5000|$|The Eniak Antique is an {{automobile}} built in Argentina by Eniak beginning in 1983. The Eniak company had hitherto mainly focused on electronics, {{some of which}} {{found their way into}} cars. The Antique was a metal-bodied, fiberglass-bumpers and doors, two-seat roadster that took its styling cues from the classic sports cars of the thirties, with some resemblance to the Alfa Romeo 8C. The cars have rear-wheel drive and a 1.8 liter inline-four with [...] or [...] depending on the state of tune. The engine came from the Volkswagen 1500 (originally a Hillman unit) and were tuned by Balestrini. The round gauges on the dashboard were of Eniak's own manufacture, and a traditional looking large <b>four-spoke</b> wooden <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> finished the job. A few cars were shipped to Japan in 1988, but Eniak still had to shut its doors in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|From 1993 through 1995, Porsche {{offered a}} lighter-weight [...] "Club Sport" [...] {{version of the}} 968 {{designed}} for enthusiasts seeking increased track performance. Much of the 968's luxury-oriented equipment was removed or taken off the options list; less sound deadening material was used, electrical windows were replaced with crank-driven units, upgraded stereo systems, A/C and sunroof were still optional as on the standard Coupe and Convertible models. In addition, Porsche installed manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats rather than the standard power-operated leather buckets (also manufactured by Recaro), a revised suspension system optimized and lowered by 20 mm for possible track use, 17-inch wheels (also slightly wider to accommodate wider tires) rather than the 16-inch as found on the Coupe and wider tires, 225 front and 255 rears rather than 205 and 225 respectively. The <b>four-spoke</b> airbag <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was replaced with a thicker-rimmed three-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with no airbag, heated washer jets were replaced with non heated, vanity covers in the engine bay were deleted, as was the rear wiper. The Club Sport has no rear seats, unlike the 2+2 Coupé.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972 models had an 11% larger {{rear window}} (40 mm taller), and the {{convertible}} engine lid with four rows of louvres was now used on all Beetles. Inside the vehicle, a <b>four-spoke</b> energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was introduced, the windshield wiper/washer knob was replaced {{in favor of}} a steering column stalk, and intermittent wipers were a new option available in selected markets. An engine compartment socket for the proprietary VW Diagnosis system was also introduced. The rear luggage area was fitted with a folding parcel shelf. A limited-edition Commemorative model was launched in celebration of the Beetle's passing the record of the Ford Model T as the world's most-produced automobile. The Commemorative Beetle was a 1302 LS finished in a special Marathon Blue Metallic paint and unique 4.5 x 15 styled steel wheels. In the U.S., it was marketed as the Super Beetle Baja Champion SE.|$|R
2500|$|... 1976 Chevelles {{earned a}} billing as [...] "a size {{whose time has}} come." [...] With square {{headlights}} now legal, the top-shelf Malibu Classic got a crosshatch grille and stacked quad headlights while lower models had a waterfall grille and single headlights. Three V8s were available: a new 305-cubic-inch version rated at , a 165-horsepower 350-cubic-inch, and a 400-cubic-inch engine that developed 175 horses. Options included the Econominder gauge package. In its third and final season, the 1976 Laguna Type S-3 was little changed. It again featured quarter-window louvers and a sloped, body-color urethane front end. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and could be ordered with a <b>four-spoke</b> sport <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> as well as swivel front bucket seats and a center console. Lesser models made do with a more conventional dashboard and a linear-readout speedometer. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars as the base price went to $4,621.|$|R
2500|$|Offered {{in three}} levels of luxury: [...] "G", [...] "G Limited Edition", and [...] "G Dignis Edition", AWD is {{optional}} on the two base trims ("G Four" [...] and [...] "G Four Limited Edition"). The base-line Camry [...] "G" [...] features 16-inch steel wheels, six airbags, keyless entry and start, [...] "Optitron" [...] gauges, speed-sensitive automatic door locks, a <b>four-spoke</b> leather-wrapped <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and shift lever, a wood grain center console, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, and an electric driver's seat (FWD only). The second level [...] "G Limited Edition" [...] gains 16-inch alloy wheels and cruise control, while the top-level [...] "G Dignis Edition" [...] features a metallic-finished grille insert, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), rain-sensing windscreen wipers, wood grain inserts for the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and shift knob, and a [...] widescreen touch LCD (incorporating satellite navigation, television, Bluetooth handsfree support, and G-BOOK telematics). Daihatsu continued with its Altis variant for the Japanese market, also introduced on 30 January 2006. Offered in [...] "G Limited Edition" [...] (FWD) and [...] "G Four Limited Edition" [...] (AWD) specification levels, the Altis roughly correlates with the Camry equivalents. Visually, the Altis {{is identical to the}} Japanese market Camry, with only the badging unique to the Daihatsu.|$|R
5000|$|For 1974, the Laguna {{was renamed}} [...] "Laguna Type S-3" [...] and offered {{only as the}} Colonnade Coupe. It {{retained}} the urethane front end from '73 with a revised grille and new parking lamps, augmented at the rear by new taillights. A federally mandated 5 mi/h km/h chrome rear bumper replaced the body-colored steel 2.5 mi/h km/h version from '73. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs for a few dollars extra; body side striping, Laguna S3 badging, as well as firmer shocks/springs, a front stabilizer bar, and HR70x15 radial tires on Rally wheels. Front occupants rode in swivel bucket seats, and the driver faced a six-dial instrument cluster and a <b>four-spoke,</b> sport <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The '74 Laguna S-3 had replaced the discontinued [...] "SS" [...] as the sporty/performance option on the Chevelle. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - but with plenty of options to send the bottom line past $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard [...] 350 two-barrel V8, with optional powerplants including a [...] 400 two-barrel V8, [...] 400 four-barrel V8 and [...] 454 four-barrel V8, except in California where a [...] 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional. Turbo Hydra-matic transmission was standard with a four-speed manual available only with the 454 engine. Horsepower was seemingly lower due {{to the way it}} was calculated as 'net' starting in 1972 as opposed to 'gross' horsepower ratings of 1971 and prior years.|$|R
