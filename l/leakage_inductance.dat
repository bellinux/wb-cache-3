25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal <b>leakage</b> <b>inductance.</b> A normal (low <b>leakage</b> <b>inductance)</b> high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current.

In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120V or 100V respectively) may {{not be sufficient to}} start lamps over 20W with a series inductor, so an autotransformer winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage.

5000|$|<b>Leakage</b> <b>inductance</b> {{can be an}} {{undesirable}} property, as {{it causes}} the voltage to change with loading. [...] In many cases it is useful. <b>Leakage</b> <b>inductance</b> has the useful effect of limiting the current flows in a transformer (and load) without itself dissipating power (excepting the usual non-ideal transformer losses). Transformers are generally designed to have a specific value of <b>leakage</b> <b>inductance</b> such that the leakage reactance created by this inductance is a specific value at the desired frequency of operation.Commercial transformers are usually designed with a short-circuit leakage reactance impedance of between 3% and 10%. If the load is resistive and the leakage reactance is small (<10%) the output voltage will not drop by more than 0.5% at full load, ignoring other resistances and losses. High leakage reactance transformers are used for some negative resistance applications, such as neon signs, where a voltage amplification (transformer action) is required as well as current limiting. In this case the leakage reactance is usually 100% of full load impedance, so even if the transformer is shorted out {{it will not be}} damaged. Without the <b>leakage</b> <b>inductance,</b> the negative resistance characteristic of these gas discharge lamps would cause them to conduct excessive current and be destroyed. Transformers with variable <b>leakage</b> <b>inductance</b> are used to control the current in arc welding sets. In these cases, the <b>leakage</b> <b>inductance</b> limits the current flow to the desired magnitude.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{transformer}} from influencing {{the operation of the}} PRC, there are two conditions that should be ensured. Firstly, the magnetizing inductance, L_m, of the transformer must be relatively high compared to the resonant inductance, L_r, so that the resonance frequency of L_m and C_r are very low compared to resonance frequency of PRC, w_ 0. In this case, it can be assumed that almost no current is drawn by L_m at the operation frequency of PRC. Secondly, the <b>leakage</b> <b>inductances,</b> L_p and L_s, must be very small compared to L_r.
