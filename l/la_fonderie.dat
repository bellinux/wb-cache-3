50|$|<b>La</b> <b>Fonderie,</b> Brussels Museum of Industry and Labour is {{a museum}} about the Industrial Revolution in Brussels, Belgium. It {{collects}} objects, documents and oral history on the city’s industrial past and visualises the working history of Brussels.|$|E
5000|$|<b>La</b> <b>Fonderie</b> {{supplements}} {{the exhibitions}} {{of the major}} museums in Brussels. The bilingual French and Dutch exhibition addresses those interested in sociology and technology {{as well as local}} history. An English manual is available which includes translations of the captions of the exhibits.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum is}} located in Rue Ransfort 27 in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean along a canal {{on the site of}} the former foundry ‘La Compagnie des Bronzes ’ (1854-1979). It is managed as a nonprofit {{organisation}} focussing on analysing and exhibiting the economic and social history of the Brussels region. It publishes a magazine, organises guided tours and provides educational activities. <b>La</b> <b>Fonderie</b> also houses a documentation centre open to the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{city has}} many bridges, {{including}} the medieval and four-towered Ponts Couverts that, despite their name, {{are no longer}} covered. Next to the Ponts Couverts is the Barrage Vauban, a part of Vauban's 17th-century fortifications, that does include a covered bridge. Other bridges are the ornate 19th-century Pont de <b>la</b> <b>Fonderie</b> (1893, stone) and Pont d'Auvergne (1892, iron), as well as architect Marc Mimram's futuristic Passerelle over the Rhine, opened in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|In 1842, Pierre Leclerc, a craftsman, {{creates a}} fixed spaces foundry (hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing) in Paris. [...] "He can be {{considered}} as the genuine creator of the fixed spaces industry", says the magazine <b>La</b> <b>fonderie</b> typographique in 1899. These fixed spaces between words and lines, margins, etc., require great precision. He invents a new process, instead of cutting fixed spaces, pouring them into molds, which increases accuracy. In 1856, after his death, the company management is entrusted to a friend of his widow, Clémentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (wife Peignot, 1815-1897). She then settles beside her his son, Gustave Peignot (1839-1899), engineer of Arts et Métiers school.|$|E

Measuring over 58, 000 square feet, <b>La</b> <b>Fonderie</b> {{is one of}} the few remaining vestiges of Gatineau’s industrial heritage and is an inspiring place for the creation and elaboration of in situ works and large-scale installations. To encourage a wide-range of proposals demonstrating the multifarious approaches to interventionist and in situ work, AXENÉO 7 sought, from all regions of Canada, visual artists who have experience working in installation. These selected artists have produced new monumental works that bring artists, thinkers, and audiences together to reflect upon the intricate relationship Canadians and First Peoples maintain with the land.

Computer-aided accurate and compu- tationally efficient prostate segmentation in TRUS im- ages is a challenging task, owing to low signal-to-noise ratio, speckle noise, calcifications and heterogeneous in- tensity distribution in the prostate region. Method: A multi-resolution framework using texture features in a parametric deformable statistical model of shape and appearance was developed to segment the prostate. Local phase information of log-Gabor quadra- ture filter extracted texture of the prostate region in TRUS images. Large bandwidth of log-Gabor filter en- sures easy estimation of local orientations and zero re- sponse for a constant signal provides invariance to gray level shift. This aids in enhanced representation of the underlying texture information of the prostate unaf- fected by speckle noise and imaging artifacts. The para- metric model of the propagating contour is derived from principal component analysis of prior shape and texture information of the prostate from the training data.

Results: The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient value of 0. 95 ± 0. 02, and mean ab- solute distance of 1. 26 ± 0. 51 millimeter when validated with 24 TRUS images of 6 datasets in a leave-one- patient-out validation framework. Conclusions: The proposed method for prostate TRUS image segmentation is computationally efficient and pro- vides accurate prostate segmentations in presence of in- tensity heterogeneities and imaging artifacts...|$|E
