50|$|An {{alligator}} shear, historically {{known as}} a <b>lever</b> <b>shear</b> and sometimes as a crocodile shear, is a metal-cutting shear with a hinged jaw, powered by a flywheel or hydraulic cylinder. Alligator shears are generally set up as stand-alone shears; however, there are types for excavators. The jaw size can range from 4 to 36 in long. They are generally used to cut steel members, such as rebar, pipe, angle iron, or I-beams.|$|E
50|$|A bench shear, {{also known}} as a <b>lever</b> <b>shear,</b> is a bench mounted shear with a {{compound}} mechanism to increase the mechanical advantage. It is usually used for cutting rough shapes out of medium-sized pieces of sheet metal, but cannot do delicate work. For the small shear, it mostly designed for a wide field of applications. Light weight and easy efficient operation, yet very sturdy in construction. The cutting blades fitted are carefully and accurately ground to give easy, clean quick cuts, and free of burrs. These special features help the operators save a great deal of their energy. But some shearing machines can cut sheet bar and flat bar up to 10mm. It is electrically welded together to make it a sturdy stable unit capable to withstand highest stresses due to heavy duty usage. The footplates are reinforced with bracing angles so that they give firm stability to the shear. The machine is provided with section knives with sliding blades which can be adjusted by hand to make 90 cuts on angles and T-sections of different sizes as well as with openings for cutting round and square bars.|$|E
40|$|Preparation {{of final}} project aims to : (1) knowing the {{materials}} {{used to make the}} casing,line in and line out; (2) knowing tools and machines used to make; (3) knowing the steps to create; (4) know the functions of the casing, line in and line out; (5) knowing performance test on the machine elephant grass chopper. Methods of the manufacturing process casing, line in and line out machine elephant grass chopper includs: identify a working drawings, identification material, making proses of casing, line in and line out, functional testing and performance testing machine. The results from the manufacture of casing, line in and line out : (1) The materials used are eyser plate with a thickness of 0. 8 mm, the chassis has a long dimension 604 mm, width 402 mm and high 443 mm, line in has a long dimension 500 mm, width 160 mm and high 78 mm, line out has a long dimension 624 mm, width 400 mm and high 144 mm; (2) Tools and machines used includs roll bar, steal ruller, elbow rule, etcher, pointer, hammer, long legs, pincers, anvil, <b>lever</b> <b>shears,</b> plate shears, miserly, welding mask, steel brushes, masks, spray gun, sandpaper, machines guillotine plate, bending machines, manual roller machines, drilling machines and compressors; (3) making-casing process begins of procurement of materials, cutting plan, cutting materials, drilling, bending, finishing. Making process line in begins of procurement of materials, cutting plan, cutting materials, bending, rolling, joint, finishing. Making process line out begins of procurement of materials, cutting plan, cutting materials, joint, finishing; (4) results of functional testing is the casing, inlet and outlet of the safe use and can function well, the casing can protect users during the Chopping, line in can reduce the grass to blades and line out can be chopped off result; (5) the results of a performance test shows that the machine is working quite well, producing results measuring 1 - 3 cm pieces and chopped produce of 134 kg / hr. But there are drawbacks on the leaves of the grass was not cut perfectly. ...|$|R
40|$|Casing {{polishing}} disc on a polishing machine {{consists of four}} parts, there are: (a) upper Casing. (B) outter tube plate. (C) inner tube plate. (C) base tube. Tub’s bulkhead of water circulation serves as a separator between the tub and the water entrance of the first chamber to chamber through the septum into two parts on the deposition system. The modification of Polishing disk and tub’s bulkhead of water circulation is to: (1) Knowing the process of modification of Polishing disk and tub’s bulkhead of water circulation. (2) Knowing the equipment required in the modification of polishing disk and tub’s bulkhead of water circulation. (3) Knowing the modified Polishing disk and tub’s bulkhead of water circulation after the performance test. The method used in the modification of polishing disk and tub’s bulkhead of water circulation include: Identification of working drawings, material identification, machine identification, {{the identification of the}} tools used and Safety matter. The order of the manufacturing process include: material selection, material preparation, perforation of materials, formation, splicing, and surface settlement. Materials used for modified casing and seal plate polishing bath is eyzer plate 1 and 2 mm thick. Based on the achievements of the whole process modification and testing can be summarized as follows: (1) The process of {{polishing disc}} casing modifications include: Identification of working drawings, material identification, machine identification, identification of the tools used and Safety matter. Sequence modification process include: material selection, material preparation, perforation of materials, the formation, continuation, and completion of the surface. (2) Machinery, equipment and tools used are: gullotine hydraulic machines, <b>lever</b> <b>shears,</b> hand shears, drilling machines and accessories, compressor grinding machines, welding set ÖAW, plate bending tool, tool roller plate, roll bar, steel bar, the right angle bar, etcher, rasp hand tool, steel hammer, plastic hammer, strike pad, right angle ruler and pliers. (3) The results of performance testing of polishing disc casing include: all parts of the casing to function properly, causing no noise during operation and gives interesting look at the engine. The results of performance test of tub’s bulkhead, the bulkhead well functioned and capable of producing clean water that is ready to re-use in the polishing process. There is a difference between the size of the working drawings to the finished object. The size difference does not affect test performance. The difference in size results an error percentage, the percentage of errors on the casing polishing by 0. 99...|$|R
