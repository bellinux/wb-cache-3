40|$|Abstract Background: Malaria {{remains a}} {{significant}} threat {{to public health}} in many countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address this preventable health problem, there is need to evaluate the existing and identify new prevention methods. Integrated vector management approaches including microbial <b>larviciding</b> are effective {{in the fight against}} malaria. The need to explore the applicability of microbial <b>larviciding</b> in malaria endemic areas is critical. This study assessed community knowledge, perceptions, attitudes and acceptability of microbial <b>larviciding</b> as a malaria control strategy in Lower Moshi, Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted in Chekereni and Mabogini villages in Lower Moshi Tanzania. The two villages were purposively selected because most of the community members in these villages cultivate rice and researchers had good rapport with the community members. 100 interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted in households. In addition, 4 in-depth interviews with key informers including health workers and agricultural experts, and 2 focus group discussions were conducted in the two villages. Results: 60 % reported they had knowledge or experience with <b>larviciding.</b> Most of them (96 %) mentioned they had knowledge of chemical <b>larviciding,</b> while only 4 % had knowledge of microbial <b>larviciding.</b> Nearly every respondent (97 %) was willing to use fertilizer with <b>larvicides</b> in their rice fields after being informed about <b>larviciding.</b> Almost all (97 %) reported willingness to inform and encourage other community members to use microbial <b>larviciding</b> in their rice fields. Similarly, many of the respondents (56 %) were positive that microbial <b>larviciding</b> would significantly help in reducing malaria cases. Concerns about applicability of microbial <b>larviciding</b> were reported by survey respondents, focus group discussion participants and in-depth interview respondents. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the community in Lower Moshi, despite having little knowledge, is positive about and willing to be engaged in microbial <b>larviciding</b> to reduce the mosquito population in the area and consequently to reduce malaria cases in the community. The future applicability of microbial <b>larviciding</b> with rice farmers in Lower Moshi Tanzania as a component of an integrated vector management strategy lies in the efforts put towards educating and sensitizing the community and creating incentives so that farmers can afford the fertilizers with <b>larvicides.</b> Thesi...|$|R

This study evaluated the efficacy of self-assessment practice as a possible innovative method towards achieving high coverage and excellent quality of <b>larviciding</b> operation in Iran. Methods The research {{was conducted on the}} randomly selected rural health centre of Kanmbel Soliman with 10 staff and 30 villages, in three main steps: (i) assessment of effectiveness of <b>larviciding</b> operations in the study areas before intervention through external assessment by a research team; (ii) self-assessment of <b>larviciding</b> operations (intervention) by staff every quarter for three rounds; and, (iii) determining the effectiveness of applying self-assessment of <b>larviciding</b> operations in the study areas. Two toolkits were used for self-assessment and external evaluation. The impact of self-assessment of <b>larviciding</b> operations was measured by two indicators: percentage of missed breeding habitats and cleaned breeding habitats among randomly selected breeding sites. Moreover, the correlation coefficients were measured between self-assessment measures and scores from external evaluation. The correlation coefficient and Mann Whitney test were used to analyse data. Results Following the utilization of self-assessment, the percentage of missed breeding habitats decreased significantly from 14. 23 % to 1. 91 % (P Before intervention, the results of self-assessment practice were compatible with external evaluation in 76. 3 % of 139 reviewed reports of self-assessment.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{witnessed}} the important scaled-up of malaria control interventions in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There is now renewed impetus {{to achieve the}} long-term goal of malaria elimination and reducing vectorial capacity of the Anopheles mosquito is a necessary first step towards this objective. Relying solely on the two pillars of malaria vector control (i. e., insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying) will be insufficient to achieve elimination in much of SSA, however. Larval Source Management, and <b>larviciding</b> in particular, could {{play an important role}} in areas where breeding habitats are ‘few, fixed, and findable’ or where malaria vectors exhibit exophagic and exophilic behaviors, and in settings where insecticide resistance has emerged. Yet, only few contemporary studies have investigated the effectiveness of <b>larviciding</b> for malaria control despite historical success. Using the wealth of data from Dar es Salaam’s Urban Malaria Control Program (2004 - 2008), this dissertation will first assess the impact of a community-based <b>larviciding</b> program on prevalence of malaria infection in 15 urban wards of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). The cost-effectiveness of this intervention will then be estimated from both a provider and a societal perspective. Finally, in a context of accelerated malaria control, the effect of reducing malaria transmission on disease-related behavior and knowledge will be examined. Results suggest that the <b>larviciding</b> intervention had a significant protective effect, decreasing by 21 % the odds of being infected with malaria. <b>Larviciding</b> was found to be costeffective for incidences as low as 40 infections per 1, 000 individuals per year but the costeffectiveness ratios were highly dependent on the assumed baseline malaria incidence rates. Such a successful intervention could also bring about further challenges to sustaining gains in reducing malaria transmission as the <b>larviciding</b> intervention was found to negatively affect bednet usage and knowledge of disease symptoms. Collectively, these results imply that <b>larviciding</b> should be considered as part of an Integrated Vector Management approach in SSA, if local ecoepidemiological conditions are suitable, and that there is a need to sustain behavioral change communication following successful vector control interventions...|$|R
