5000|$|In Paris, he had as antagonists, fellow lithotritists Jean Civiale (1792-1867) and Jean-Jacques-Joseph Leroy d'Etiolles (1798-1860). In 1829, he {{traveled}} to England, where he performed the country's first <b>lithotrity.</b> While in London, he published [...] "Principles of lithotrity" [...] (1831).|$|E
50|$|In 1829 Costello set up {{himself in}} London as a surgeon, specialising {{in the stone}} and <b>lithotrity.</b> He wrote journal articles, and lectured in the {{transient}} Brewer Street medical school, with John Epps and Michael Ryan. Subsequently, he became medical superintendent of Wyke House Asylum, near Isleworth.|$|E
5000|$|He studied {{medicine}} in Berlin, Würzburg, Paris and London, obtaining his doctorate in 1861 with a thesis titled [...] "De ratione, quae inter hypochondriam et hysteriam". As a student, his instructors included surgeon Bernhard von Langenbeck and Jean Civiale, {{a pioneer of}} <b>lithotrity.</b> In 1863 he established a medical practice in Berlin, of which he specialized in diseases of the urinary tract.|$|E
5000|$|... "Berners Street {{forms the}} head-quarters of several foreign and {{charitable}} institutions, {{some of which}} have been established ever since the last century. In 1788 was founded the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. The Medical and Chirurgical Society was established in 1805, and incorporated in 1834, for the cultivation and promotion of medicine and surgery. The society possesses a good library, numbering some 25,000 volumes. Here, too, are the Obstetrical Society of London, instituted in 1858; and the Pathological Society, founded in 1846. The lastnamed society was instituted for the exhibition and examination of specimens, drawings, microscopic preparations, casts or models of morbid parts, with accompanying written or oral descriptions, illustrative of pathological science. All the above-mentioned medical societies, together with another styled the Clinical Society of London, are accommodated in the same house (No. 53). Adjoining this building (No. 54) is St. Peters Hospital for Stone. This charitable institution was established in 1860, and its object is to benefit as large a number as possible of suffering poor by affording them, without a letter of recommendation, the advantages of hospital accommodation; to improve medical and surgical knowledge on the subjects specially treated of here, by bringing together a large number of patients suffering from those diseases, and thus affording opportunities for observation and classification; and, in the cases of patients suffering from stone, to investigate the best means of accomplishing its removal with the least possible danger {{to the life of the}} patient, and, whenever practicable, to substitute <b>lithotrity</b> for lithotomy. The practice of the hospital is open to all students and members of the profession. At No. 22 are the offices of the Ladies Sanitary Association, and also the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women. At No. 9 is the Berners Womens Club—one of the first experiments in this direction. In the same house are the offices of the Central Committee of the National Society for Womens Suffrage. The London Association for the Protection of Trade has its office at No. 16." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fergusson's {{reputation}} {{is that of}} a brilliant operator and a great [...] "conservative" [...] surgeon. The term conservative surgery, first applied by Fergusson in 1852 to operations for the preservation of parts of the body which would otherwise have been sacrificed, does not denote merely operations which he originated or improved, for James Syme had already been very successful in this line of procedure. But Fergusson extended the principle from the operation of excision of the elbow joint to many others. No portion of the body which could be usefully preserved was too small for him to make efforts to save. Among operations with which his name is specially identified are those for harelip and cleft palate, and operations on the jaws, the excision of joints, notably the hip, knee, and elbow, lithotomy and <b>lithotrity,</b> and amputations of limbs. His skill in dissection, and his careful study of the actions of the muscles which he had to cut through, were of essential importance to his success. In his lectures at the College of Surgeons he was able to speak of three hundred successful operations of his own for harelip. The operation for cleft palate had been largely abandoned till he took it up anew. His manipulative and mechanical skill was shown both in his modes of operating, and in the new instruments he devised. The bulldog forceps, the mouth-gag for cleft palate, and various bent knives attest his ingenuity. A still higher mark of his ability consisted in his perfect planning of every detail of an operation beforehand; no emergency was unprovided for. Thus, when an operation had begun, he proceeded with remarkable speed and silence till the end, himself applying every bandage and plaster, and leaving, as far as possible, no traces of his operation. So silently were most of his operations conducted, that he was often imagined to be on bad terms with his assistants. His punctuality and his hatred of unnecessary waste of time were very marked.|$|E

The routine therapy is open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the {{previous}} study, we designed a minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy based on percutaneous cholecystostomy combined with a choledochoscope (PCCLC) under local anesthesia. Methods: To investigate the effect of PCCLC on the gallbladder contractility function, PCCLC and laparoscope combined with a choledochoscope were compared in this study. Results: The preoperational age and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, as well as postoperational <b>lithotrity</b> rate and common biliary duct stone rate in the PCCLC group, {{were significantly higher than}} the choledochoscope group. However, the pre- and postoperational gallbladder ejection fraction was not significantly different. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the preoperational thickness of gallbladder wall (odds ratio [OR]: 0. 540; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 317 – 0. 920; P= 0. 023) and <b>lithotrity</b> (OR: 0. 150; 95 % CI: 0. 023 – 0. 965; P= 0. 046) were risk factors for postoperational gallbladder ejection fraction. The area under receiver operating characteristics curve was 0. 714 (P= 0. 016; 95 % CI: 0. 553 – 0. 854). Conclusion: PCCLC strategy should be carried out cautiously. First, restricted by the diameter of the drainage tube, the PCCLC should be used only for small gallstones in high-risk surgical patients. Second, the usage of <b>lithotrity</b> should be strictly limited to avoid undermining the gallbladder contractility and increasing the risk of secondary common bile duct stones.

40|$|AbstractHaemophilus {{species are}} known to colonize the upper {{respiratory}} tract and can cause infections. However Haemophilus influenzae has been rarely described {{as a cause of}} genitourinary tract infection. We report a 44 -year-old nonimmunocompromised Japanese man with bacteremic pyelonephritis caused by a nontypable H. influenzae associated with a left ureteral calculus. The organism was isolated from both blood and urine cultures. Treatment consisted of 14 days of intravenous ceftriaxone and oral amoxicillin one after than other and insertion of a left ureteral stent. After discharge, he underwent extracorporeal shock wave <b>lithotrity</b> for the left ureteral calculus. He had no recrudescence of the symptoms. H. influenzae should be considered as a genitourinary pathogen among patients with certain risk factors such as anatomical or functional abnormality of genitourinary tract. Collaboration between clinicians and microbiology laboratory personnel is essential for correct identification of the organism and appropriate therapy for genitourinary tract infections due to this organism...|$|E
40|$|Big Data” {{in health}} and {{medicine}} in the 21 st century differs from “Big Data” used {{in health and}} medicine in the 1700 s and 1800 s. However, the old data sets share one key component: large numbers. The term “Big Data” is not synonymous with large numbers. Large numbers are {{a key component of}} Big Data in health and medicine, both for understanding the full range of how a disease presents in a human for diagnosis, and for understanding if one treatment of a disease is better than another treatment or better than just leaving the patient on his or her own without therapy. In this paper, we examine the first considerations of Big Data in medicine in Paris in the early 1800 s when urologic surgeon Jean Civiale collected the first large numbers. Civiale collected the large numbers to defend the efficacy of his urologic instrument, the lithotrite, and the surgical procedure he developed, <b>lithotrity,</b> for the removal of bladder stones compared with earlier, more invasive surgical approaches. We examine how large numbers were adjudicated in social decision-making in the Académie des sciences, Paris, when a dispute arose among French urologic surgeons about the importance of large numbers in surgical science. After Civiale’s successful defense of his instrument and procedure in Paris, we examine how his approach to Big Data (large numbers) impacted data collection by George Buchanan in his use of the procedure at the Royal Hospital Infirmary in Glasgow...|$|E
