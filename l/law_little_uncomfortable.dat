60|$|Honora, {{during this}} colloquy, was silent. She was a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> and {{pretended not to}} see Mr. Brent's wink.|$|R
60|$|LUCILLA (a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> at the {{substitution}} of the monosyllable for the dissyllable, nevertheless persisting in her orthodoxy). Yes, sir.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> {{under the}} older man's keen gaze. Neither did he {{altogether}} like having his thoughts read so accurately.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You looked {{with so much}} {{expression}} at myself, my dear girl,' said Mr Sparkler, 'that I felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> Thank you, my love.' ...|$|R
60|$|Harry {{explained}} {{with some}} diffidence {{that they were}} afraid of being laughed at, and Frank felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> under the rancher's steady gaze.|$|R
60|$|Later, we {{went for}} our walk, each a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> as each began to wonder why she had chosen the other for her friend.|$|R
60|$|Surprised, and a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> at this {{evidence}} of intuition, I started to protest. It {{seemed to me}} then as though I had always wanted her.|$|R
60|$|I said nothing. I was feeling--I don't know why--a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> a <b>little</b> at a disadvantage, as {{one feels}} in the {{presence}} of some one bigger than oneself.|$|R
6000|$|There was a silence; Mary felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> [...] "May I {{have a look}} at what you've been painting?" [...] she had {{the courage}} to say at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, sir?" [...] {{said the}} man, taking the pipe {{out of his}} mouth, with rough, embarrassed civility. The two young startled faces made him a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I {{paused to}} watch the effect of my words. Captain Good looked a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> but Sir Henry's face did not change. [...] "We must take our chance," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|Bland {{looked a}} <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> [...] "As {{a matter of}} fact, I'd find it {{difficult}} to make any provision. I get along fairly well, as it is, but I've only about four hundred a year besides my pay." ...|$|R
60|$|No one spoke. The silence {{began to}} be even a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> It was broken by my friend Rapley, who is in {{wholesale}} hardware and who has all the intellectual bravery that goes with it. He asked the Authority straight out the question that we all wanted to put.|$|R
30|$|If these humorous web {{articles}} do {{not make}} you a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> then you are either an exceptionally disciplined radiologist of consistent clarity and certainty or you are in denial. Almost all of us step back from commitment in our reports on occasion. Some of us do it much more frequently.|$|R
60|$|Thorne laid a {{very slight}} stress upon the hired. It seemed to {{indicate}} that he recognized his station {{in relation to a}} guest of the house, and Alison felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> For one thing, though that did not quite account for her uneasiness, she remembered that she had not paid him.|$|R
60|$|Now the Afghans {{began to}} look a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> but Moti seemed so {{determined}} to keep the horse that they resolved {{to appeal to the}} law, so they went off and laid a complaint before the king that Moti had stolen one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it.|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{starts with}} the <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> things- visions of apocalypse, Raptures full of dragon wings. And then the dragons become all too real. It is an unexplained mutation, the Long gene, dragons come down to warp the basic recipe of humanity. Babies die, born with {{mutations}} that could not support life. No known cause. No treatment.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had begun}} to be a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> and to wish myself well out of the visit, when a figure coming down the street passed the door--it stood open to air the room, which was warm, the weather being close for the time of year--came back again, looked in, and walked in, exclaiming loudly, 'Copperfield! Is it possible?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{thought of}} that {{convenient}} hidden room, the North Library, in which is the bust of Croker. There often one can be quite alone.... It was empty, and he went across to the window that looks out upon Pall Mall {{and sat down in}} the <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> easy chair by the desk with its back to the Benvenuto Cellini.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was a <b>little</b> bit <b>uncomfortable</b> to {{see what}} was going to happen." ...|$|R
3000|$|For our girls, {{the ones}} at (name of clubhouse), I think they {{actually}} were a <b>little</b> bit <b>uncomfortable</b> {{with the idea}} that there were new girls coming to the centre that they didn’t know and that was kind of like—you know, girls that age, they kind of have their friends and it’s a <b>little</b> bit <b>uncomfortable</b> to meet new people. (L- 4) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Becoming a solo {{performer}} Steve {{recorded his}} solo album with Paul Field of Nutshell at the helm. The lyrics {{were described as}} [...] "refreshingly honest", if a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> to hear. His criticism of the established Church was said to come from [...] "a standpoint of deep commitment to Christ" [...] (sleeve notes from the LP, by an anonymous writer).|$|R
60|$|For {{an hour or}} two he felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> His {{attitude}} was obviously the right one, but he could not help a feeling of dissatisfaction with the whole business. Miss Wilkinson, however, did not write again; nor did she, as he absurdly feared, suddenly appear in Paris to make him ridiculous before his friends. In a little while he clean forgot her.|$|R
60|$|He felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> at her {{approach}} for {{here in the}} big square hall the light was very clear, {{and he could see}} Madame's keen, searching eyes looking him up and down and through and through. She even put up her lorgnon and though she was not very tall, she contrived to look Hector through them straight between the eyes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Western Sky" [...] {{is about}} a man afraid to fly because {{of the death of}} his father in a crash. Johnston doesn't {{typically}} use events in the lives of friends as inspiration for his songs, but this is an exception. He was a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with the notion of having [...] "exploited" [...] a friend, although he noted that the friend had no problem with the song.|$|R
50|$|Manny (Rico Rodriguez) invites a cute girl, Kelly (Callie Thompson), {{over for}} a study date who {{eventually}} starts to change Manny, making Gloria (Sofía Vergara) a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> and jealous. Eventually, Gloria decides {{to let him go}} with his girlfriend to the movies, but he soon comes back after breaking up with her making Gloria even happier, before Manny makes another date with another girl.|$|R
50|$|A vox pop in Maidstone Kent, found {{a former}} {{president}} of Farleigh's Women's Institute (WI) who confirmed he was correct: To start with I was a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> - I always thought it was cheap and cheerful, and up until then I had always shopped in Waitrose and Sainsbury’s, but I found I would keep bumping into people I knew, I started thinking… everyone I know shops here..|$|R
5000|$|Upon the film's February 2010 {{theatrical}} {{release in}} the United Kingdom, film critic Mark Kermode, appearing on The Culture Show, asked the BBC's business editor Robert Peston whether Moore's [...] "crusading" [...] had {{been based on}} a misrepresentation of American capitalism. Canada's Centre for Research on Globalisation characterized the response: [...] "Peston cannot fault {{the facts of the}} movie, though he appears a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> having to say so." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Flora {{got into}} the vehicle; and during {{the next week or}} two George took precautions. Indeed, he now and then felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> when he had {{occasion}} to pass a shadowy bluff. He carried a pistol when he went around the outbuildings at night, and fell into a habit of stopping to listen, ready to strike or shoot, each time he opened the door of one in the dark.|$|R
5000|$|... "We were a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> {{at first}} about using {{slightly}} older material, and I think if we'd done the album as a 4 piece, we wouldn't have used them. Having Dan join the band really revived those songs though, the arrangements have been bettered. We can now obviously do the songs justice with Dan's voice, they now sound {{the way we}} wanted them to sound before, and we definitely want more people to hear them!" ...|$|R
40|$|I {{must confess}} to finding myself a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with your {{proposed}} per curiam. I am {{not convinced that}} the passages from the Department of Justice advice letter have the same import in context {{as they do in}} the order in which they appear on page four of your opinion. In addition, I am inclined to think that the opinion pushes the Government 2 ̆ 7 s concession, before us further than they were intended to reach...|$|R
50|$|Corporate <b>Law</b> (<b>Little,</b> Brown 1986).|$|R
6000|$|I felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> {{about the}} cripplings and arsons this person had been {{entertaining}} himself with, for I {{could not help}} feeling remotely accessory to them. But these thoughts were quickly banished, for the regular editor walked in! [I thought to myself, Now if you had gone to Egypt as I recommended you to, I {{might have had a}} chance to get my hand in; but you wouldn't do it, and here you are. I sort of expected you.] ...|$|R
60|$|The party {{reached the}} Mole before the boat came in; for after {{rounding}} the Point {{she had been}} becalmed, and the fishermen had lowered the sail and betaken themselves to their oars again. Bob felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> when, as the boat rowed up to the landing stairs, he saw General Eliott, {{with a group of}} officers, standing at the top. He was relieved when, on ascending the steps, the governor stepped forward and shook him warmly by the hand.|$|R
60|$|There was a subdued {{murmur of}} thrilled voices. One or two {{looked at each}} other uneasily. Even the Duchess began to feel a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> Saton was {{suddenly}} facing Pauline. He was standing a little nearer, with the fingers of his right hand resting upon the round oak table which stood in the centre of the hall. His figure had become absolutely rigid, and the color had left his cheeks. His voice seemed to them to come from some other person.|$|R
50|$|For this week’s {{photo shoot}} {{the girls had}} to pose in swimsuits and {{into the arms of}} Greek actor Dimitris Vlachos. And while {{everyone}} thought that it would be more difficult for Nancy to do the photo shoot, Georgia struggled perhaps more on the set with Dimitris Vlachos, since he is her favorite actor. All the girls felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> in the beginning but Vicky stimulated them by posing herself with Dimitris to show them how to do it right.|$|R
