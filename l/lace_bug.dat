50|$|The adult {{sycamore}} <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> is milky {{white in}} colour and between 3.2 and 3.7 mm in length. It {{is similar in}} appearance to the cotton <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha gossypii) and the Florida oak <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Corythucha floridana), but lacks the brown crescent-shaped band on the carina (ridge on the body-wall) of the former and {{is larger than the}} latter. The only brown colour is a small spot on the protuberance on each elytron (wing-case). The nymphs are oval in shape, dorso-ventrally flattened, black and prickly. This <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> can most easily be distinguished from other species by its presence on sycamore.|$|E
50|$|Corythucha arcuata, the oak <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> is {{a species}} of <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> Tingidae that is a pest of oaks in the Old World. It is native to the New world, and was first {{observed}} in Europe in 2000.|$|E

50|$|The tree {{is fairly}} disease-resistant, though {{a common problem}} is leaf scorch where planted on dry soils, however leaf scorch is not a {{long-term}} problem as the leaves are lost in the autumn. Pests include Japanese beetles, aphids, <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> and various species of moths.|$|R
50|$|They {{are called}} <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> because the pronotum and fore {{wings of the}} adult have a {{delicate}} and intricate network of divided areas that resemble lace.

50|$|<b>Lace</b> <b>bugs</b> {{are usually}} host-specific {{and can be}} very {{destructive}} to plants. Most feed on the undersides of leaves by piercing the epidermis and sucking the sap. The then empty cells give the leaves a bronzed or silvery appearance. Each individual usually completes its entire lifecycle on the same plant, if not the same part of the plant.|$|R
40|$|Information is {{presented}} on 2 cassava var., ICA-Catumare and ICA-Cebucan, {{released by the}} Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario and CIAT, for the Colombian Llanos Orientales. ICA-Catumare originates from the cross between regional var. Guajiba and CMC- 86. ICA- Cebucan originates from the cross between 2 hybrid clones, Chiroza Yema de Huevo and MVEN 218. Yields were 24. 0 and 22. 2 t/ha for ICA- Catumare and ICA-Cebucan, resp., in the piedmont region whereas yields of these var. were 14. 7 and 20. 4 t/ha for the high tablelands. ICA-Catumare is resistant to bacterioses and superelongation, intermediately resistant to blight leaf spot, and susceptible to root and stem rot; it also shows intermediate resistance to mites, thrips, and <b>lace</b> <b>bugs.</b> ICA-Cebucan is resistant to bacterioses, blight leaf spot, root and stem rot, and superelongation; it is also resistant to mites, thrips, and <b>lace</b> <b>bugs.</b> Recommendations are also given for the cultivation of both var.

50|$|The {{land was}} hilly, rocky and infertile. None of Ford's {{managers}} had the requisite knowledge of tropical agriculture. In the wild, the rubber trees grow apart {{from each other}} as a protection mechanism against plagues and diseases, often growing close to bigger trees of other species for added support. In Fordlândia, however, the trees were closely together in plantations, easy prey for tree blight, sauva ants, <b>lace</b> <b>bugs,</b> red spiders, and leaf caterpillars,.|$|R
50|$|Most {{species have}} {{one to two}} generations per year, but some species have {{multiple}} generations. Most overwinter as adults, but some species overwinter as eggs or nymphs. This group has incomplete metamorphosis in that the immature stages resemble the adults, except that the immatures are smaller {{and do not have}} wings. However, wing pads appear {{in the second and third}} instars and increase in size as the nymph matures. Depending on the species, <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> have four or five instars.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo new genera {{and species}} of fossil <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> are {{reported}} from Albian and Cenomanian amber of France as Ambarcader eugenei and Ebboa areolata, these being the earliest fossil {{record of the}} family Tingidae and the type species of the new family Ebboidae, respectively. Ambarcader gen. nov. belongs to the tribe Phatnomatini within the subfamily Cantacaderinae. Ebboa gen. nov. differs from all the Recent and fossil taxa hitherto described in Tingoidea, suggesting an important past diversity and an earlier Mesozoic origin of this clade...|$|R

40|$|Approx 20 {{insects and}} mites were found attacking cassava in several regions of Colombia at {{different}} growth stagcs and seasons. Thrips (Frankliniella williamsi), gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) and whiteflies (Bemisia sp. and Trialeurodes sp.) were present in greater than 50 percent of the plantations visited. Pests found at all stages of plant growth were the cassava fruitfly (Anastrepha sp.), leafhoppers (Empoasca sp.), <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> (Vatiga manihotae) and mites (oligonychus peruvianus). Pests limited to different regions were cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon and Spodoptera,frugiperda) found in the states of Valle and Quindio and stemborers (Acanthoderes nigricans) {{in the state of}} Cauca. High parasitism of hornworm (Erinnyis ello) eggs was observed. Yield losses due to thrips were estimated. (AS...|$|R
40|$|The bug Gyaclavator kohlsi Wappler, Guilbert, Wedmann et Labandeira, gen. et sp. nov., {{represents}} a new extinct genus of <b>lace</b> <b>bugs</b> (Insecta: Heteroptera: Tingidae) occurring in latest early Eocene deposits of the Green River Formation, {{from the southern}} Piceance Basin of Northwestern Colorado, in North America. Gyaclavator can be placed within the Tingidae with certainty, perhaps it is sistergroup to Cantacaderinae. If it belongs to Cantacaderinae, {{it is the first}} fossil record of this group for North America. Gyaclavator has unique, conspicuous antennae bearing a specialized, highly dilated distiflagellomere, likely important for intra- or intersex reproductive competition and attraction. This character parallels similar antennae in leaf-footed bugs (Coreidae), and probably is associated with a behavioral convergence as well...|$|R
50|$|In southeastern New Mexico, staples (comprising {{at least}} 5% of scaled quail diet in both summer and winter) were {{mesquite}} and croton (Croton spp.) seeds, green vegetation, and snout beetles. Nonpreferred foods eaten {{in winter and}} available but not consumed in summer included broom snakeweed (the main winter food), crown-beard (Verbesina encelioides), cycloloma (Cycloloma atriplicifolium), and <b>lace</b> <b>bugs.</b> Mesquite seeds and broom snakeweed seeds together made up 75% of the winter diet. Grasshoppers were a summer staple. Insect galls, cicadas, scarab beetles, spurge (Euphorbia spp.), plains bristlegrass (Setaria macrostachya) seeds, and white ratany (Krameria grayi) were consumed in a less pronounced seasonal pattern. Another study reported substantial amounts of prairie sunflower seeds (Helianthus petiolaris) and pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) seeds in the diet of scaled quail.|$|R
