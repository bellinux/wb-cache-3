Another approach to increasing the biocompatibility of the membrane biomaterial is through surface modification of the capsules using peptide and protein molecules which in turn controls the proliferation and rate of differentiation of the encapsulated cells. One group that has been working extensively on coupling the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to alginate hydrogels demonstrated that the cell behavior can be controlled by the RGD density coupled on the alginate gels. Alginate microparticles loaded with myoblast cells and functionalized with RGD allowed control over the growth and differentiation of the loaded cells. Another vital factor that controls the use of cell microcapsules in clinical applications {{is the development of}} a suitable immune-compatible polycation to coat the otherwise highly porous alginate beads and thus impart stability and immune protection to the system. Poly-L-lysine is the most commonly used polycation but its low biocompatibility restricts the successful clinical use of these PLL formulated microcapsules which attract inflammatory cells thus inducing necrosis of the loaded cells. Studies have also shown that alginate-PLL-alginate (APA) microcapsules demonstrate <b>low</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> and short term durability. Thus several research groups have been looking for alternatives to PLL and have demonstrated promising results with poly-L-ornithine and poly(methylene-co-guanidine) hydrochloride by fabricating durable microcapsules with high and controlled mechanical strength for cell encapsulation.|$|E

In the present study, we investigated the long-term regeneration of DBM in a critical size bone defect model and investigated the remineralization after 6 months. Bone defects were created in the cranium of male Wistar rats which were filled with DBM or left empty as negative control. In vivo bone formation was monitored with computed tomography after 11, 19, and 26 weeks postoperatively. After 6 months, parietal bones were subjected to micro-CT. Mineral content was determined with spectrophotometric analysis. After 11 weeks the DBM-filled bone defects were completely closed, while empty defects were still open. Density of the DBM-treated group increased significantly while the controls remained unchanged. Quantitative analysis by micro-CT confirmed the in vivo results, bone volume/tissue volume was significantly lower in the controls than in the DBM group. The demineralization procedure depleted the key minerals of the bone to a very low level. Six months after implantation Ca, P, Na, Mg, Zn, and Cr contents were completely restored to the normal level, while K, Sr, and Mn were only partially restored. The remineralization process of DBM is largely complete by the 6 th month after implantation in terms of bone density, structure, and key mineral levels.

40|$|Steered {{molecular}} dynamics simulations have previously {{been used to}} investigate the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. The simulations suggest that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of the tenth type III domain from fibronectin (FNfn 10) is largely determined {{by a number of}} critical hydrogen bonds in the peripheral strands. Interestingly, the simulations predict that lowering the pH from 7 to ∼ 4. 7 will increase the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of FNfn 10 significantly (by ∼ 33 %) due to the protonation of a few key acidic residues in the A and B strands. To test this simulation prediction, we used single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of FNfn 10 at neutral pH and at lower pH where these key residues {{have been shown to be}} protonated. Our AFM experimental results show no difference in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of FNfn 10 at these different pH values. These results suggest that some simulations may overestimate the role played by electrostatic interactions in determining the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of proteins.

40|$|This {{study showed}} that several {{mechanisms}} of the basal resistance of winter triticale to Microdochium nivale are cultivar-dependent and can be induced specifically during plant hardening. Experiments and microscopic observations were conducted on triticale cvs Hewo (able to develop resistance after cold treatment) and Magnat (susceptible to infection despite hardening). In cv. Hewo, cold hardening altered the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the leaf surface and prevented both adhesion of M. nivale hyphae to the leaves and direct penetration of the epidermis. Cold-induced submicron- and micron-scale roughness on the leaf epidermis resulted in superhydrophobicity, restricting fungal adhesion and growth, while the lower permeability and altered chemical composition of the host cell wall protected against tissue digestion by the fungus. The fungal strategy to access the nutrient resources of resistant hosts is the penetration of leaf tissues through stomata, followed by biotrophic intercellular growth of individual hyphae and the formation of haustoria-like structures within mesophyll cells. In contrast, a destructive necrotrophic fungal lifestyle occurs in susceptible seedlings, despite cold hardening of the plants, with the host epidermis, mesophyll and vascular tissues being digested and becoming disorganized {{as a result of the}} <b>low</b> chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of the cell wall matrix. This work indicates that specific genetically encoded physical and mechanical properties of the cell wall and leaf tissues that depend on cold hardening are factors that can determine plant resistance against fungal diseases...|$|R
