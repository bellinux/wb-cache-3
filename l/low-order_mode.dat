40|$|We {{consider}} {{a method to}} reduce the kinetic energy in a <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> of a miniature cantilever. If the cantilever contributes to the capacitance of a driven RF circuit, a force on the cantilever exists due to the electric field energy stored in the capacitance. If this force acts with an appropriate phase shift relative to {{the motion of the}} cantilever, it can oppose the velocity of the cantilever, leading to cooling. Such cooling may enable reaching the quantum regime of cantilever motion. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|The normal modes in an overmoded {{waveguide}} {{coated with}} a lossy material are analyzed, particularly for their attenuation properties {{as a function of}} coating material, layer thickness, and frequency.

This coated guide serves as a mode suppressor of the <b>low-order</b> <b>modes,</b> which can be particularly useful for reducing the radar cross section (RCS) of a cavity structure such as a jet inlet. When the coating material is very lossy, <b>low-order</b> <b>modes</b> fall into two distinct groups: highly and lowly attenuated modes.

In actual fact, some models suppress the quadrupole while others elevate it, {{according to whether}} their <b>low-order</b> <b>modes</b> are weak or strong relative to their high-order modes. Elementary geometrical reasoning shows that the <b>low-order</b> <b>modes</b> tend to be relatively weak in well-proportioned spaces (spaces whose dimensions are approximately equal in all directions) but relatively strong in oddlyproportioned spaces (spaces that are significantly longer in some directions and shorter in others). We illustrate this principle in detail for the special cases of rectangular 3 -tori and spherical spaces. We conclude that well-proportioned spaces make the best candidates for a topological explanation of the low CMB quadrupole observed by COBE and WMAP. ...|$|R

Four different numerical models with 3 -D finite element method were established in the present investigation. The wave propagation technique was employed and the modal analysis of the blade disc was performed. The modal and vibration characteristics of different models in the same rotational speeds were compared in consideration of non-linear coupling / interactions between blade and disc. The results indicate that in the modal analysis of symmetric-acyclic blade-disc system, the openings structure has low impact on the <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> frequency.

The challenge in producing such sound fields is the avoidance of interference between sound zones, which is dependent on the geometry of the zone and the direction of arrival of the desired sound fields. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the generation of two zones based on the creation of sound fields with nulls and the positioning of those nulls at arbitrary positions. The nulls are created by suppressing <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> terms in the sound field expansion.

A shell element model, a beam element model, and two solid element models were established to investigate the effects of bolted joints and element types on <b>low-order</b> vibration <b>modes</b> of the compressor. Three typical cases were compared to check the effect of locations of moving parts on the vibration modes of the compressor. A forced modal test with the MRIT (Multiple References Impact Test) technique was conducted to validate the simulation results.

The shell element model is recommended to predict the <b>low-order</b> vibration <b>modes</b> of the compressor with regard to effectiveness and usefulness.

A thinner layer of coating is required for large attenuation of the <b>low-order</b> <b>modes</b> if the coating material is magnetic rather than dielectric. The Radar Cross Section (RCS) from an uncoated circular guide terminated by a perfect electric conductor was calculated and compared with available experimental data.

40|$|Modal {{identification}} of civil engineering structures based on ambient vibration measurement {{has been widely}} investigated in the past decades, {{and a variety of}} output-only operational modal identification methods have been proposed. However, vibration <b>modes,</b> even fundamental <b>low-order</b> <b>modes,</b> are not always identifiable for large-scale structures under ambient vibration excitation. The identifiability of vibration modes, deficiency in modal identification, and criteria to evaluate robustness of the identifiedmodes when applying output-only modal identification techniques to ambient vibration responses were scarcely studied. In this study, the mode identifiability of the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge using ambient vibration measurements and the influence of theexcitation intensity on the deficiency and robustness in modal identification are investigated with long-term monitoring data of acceleration responses acquired from the bridge under different excitation conditions. It is observed that a few <b>low-order</b> <b>modes,</b> including the second global mode, are not identifiable by common output-only modal identification algorithms under normal ambient excitations due to traffic and monsoon. The deficient modes can be activated and identified only when the excitation intensity attains a certain level (e. g., during strong typhoons). The reason why a few <b>low-order</b> <b>modes</b> fail to be reliably identified under weak ambient vibration excitations and the relation between the mode identifiability and the excitation intensity are addressed through comparing the frequency-domain responses under normal ambient vibration excitations and under typhoon excitations and analyzing the wind speeds corresponding to different response data samples used in modal identification. The threshold value of wind speed (generalized excitation intensity) that makes the deficient modes identifiable is determined. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

Numerical study has been carried out for low and high-order mode shapes of cantilever steel beam models. This is done using modal analysis in Ansys, a FEA commercial software, by introducing a single damage in the form of localised cross section reduction.

40|$|The {{inclination}} {{of galaxies}} induces both reddening and extinction to their observed spectral energy distribution, {{which in turn}} impact the derived properties of the galaxies. Here we report a significant dependence of the error in photometric redshift (photo-z) on the inclination of disk galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The bias in the photo-z based on the template-fitting approach increases from - 0. 015 in face-on to 0. 021 in edge-on galaxies. A Principal Component Analysis on the full sample of photometry reveals the inclination of the galaxies to be represented by the 2 nd mode. The corresponding eigenspectrum resembles an extinction curve. The isolation of the inclination effect in a <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> demonstrates the significant reddening induced on the observed colors, leading to the over-estimated photo-z in galaxies of high inclinations.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of inertial confinement fusion implosions {{of the type}} performed on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to low-mode flux asymmetries has been investigated numerically. It is shown that large-amplitude, <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> shapes (Legendre polynomial P 4), resulting from associated low order flux asymmetries, cause spatial variations in capsule and fuel momentum that prevent the DT ice layer from being decelerated uniformly by the hot spot pressure. This reduces the transfer of kinetic to internal energy of the central hot spot, thus reducing neutron yield. Furthermore, synthetic gated x-ray images of the hot spot self-emission indicate that P 4 shapes may be unquantifiable for DT layered capsules. Instead the positive P 4 asymmetry aliases itself as an oblate P 4 in the x-ray self emission images. Correction of this apparent P 2 distortion can further distort the implosion while creating a round x-ray image. Long wavelength asymmetries may be playing {{a significant role in}} the observed yield reduction of NIF DT implosions relative to detailed post-shot 2 D simulations.

40|$|The {{stability}} of cylindrical liquid bridges in reduced gravity {{is affected by}} ambient vibrations of the spacecraft. Such vibrations are expected to excite capillary modes of the bridge. The lowest-order unstable mode is particularly susceptible to vibration as {{the length of the}} bridge approaches the stability limit. This <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> is known as the (2, 0) mode and is an axisymmetric varicose mode of one wavelength in the axial direction. In this work, an optical system is used to detect the (2, 0) -mode amplitude. The derivative of the error signal produced by this detector is used to produce the appropriate voltages on a pair of ring electrodes which are concentric with the bridge. A mode-coupled Maxwell stress profile is thus generated in proportional to the modal velocity. Depending on the sign of the gain, the damping of the capillary oscillation can be either increased or decreased. This effect has been demonstrated in Plateau-tank experiments. Increasing the damping of the capillary modes on free liquid surfaces in space could be beneficial for containerless processing and other novel technologies. [work supported by NASA...|$|E

Simulation results showing the effect of non-linearities on the LLRF loops, and studies {{of the effectiveness of}} technical component upgrades are reported, as well as a comparison of these results with PEP-II measurements.

In particular, the feasibility of the PEP-II plans to achieve the final goal in luminosity, which required an increase of the beam currents to 4 A for LER and 2. 2 A for HER, is studied. These currents are challenging in part because they would push the longitudinal low-order beam mode stability to the limit, and the klystron forward power past a level of satisfactory margin.

The smaller 1. 5 GeV ring is presently under construction, while the larger 3 GeV ring is being commissioned. Both rings will be operating with top-up injections from a full-energy injector. During injection, the electron beam is first delivered to the main injector from a thermionic pre-injector which consists of a thermionic RF gun, a chopper system, and an energy filter. In order to reduce losses of high-energy electrons along the injector and in the rings, the electron beam provided by the thermionic pre-injector should have the correct time structure and energy distribution. In this paper, {{the design of the}} MAX IV thermionic pre-injector with all its sub components is presented. The electron beam delivered by the pre-injector and its dependence on parameters such as optics, cathode temperature, and RF power are studied. Measurements are here compared with simulation results obtained by particle tracking and electromagnetic codes.

40|$|White dwarfs (WDs) are {{believed}} to detonate via explosive Carbon-fusion in a Type Ia Supernova when their temperature and/or density reach the point where Carbon is ignited in a runaway reaction. Observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate imply all WD binaries that merge through the emission of gravitational radiation within a Hubble time should result in SNe, regardless of total mass. Here we investigate {{the conditions under which}} a single WD in a binary system might extract energy from its orbit, depositing enough energy into a resonant mode such that it detonates before merger. We show that, ignoring non-linear effects, in a WD binary in tidal lock at small binary separations, the sustained tidal forcing of a low-order quadrupolar g-mode or a harmonic of a low-order quadrupolar p-mode could in principle drive the average temperature of Carbon nuclei in the mode over the runaway fusion threshold. If growing mode energy is thermalized at a core/atmosphere boundary, rapid Helium burning and inward-travelling p-waves may result in core detonation. Thermalization at a boundary in the core can also result in detonation. If energy can be efficiently transferred from the orbit to modes as the WD binary passes through resonances, the WD merger timescale will be shortened by Myr-Gyr compared to expected timescales from GW-emission alone and GW detectors will observe deviations from predicted chirp profiles in resolved WD binaries. Future work in this area should focus on whether tidal locking in WD binaries is naturally driven towards <b>low-order</b> <b>mode</b> frequencies. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure. MNRAS (accepted...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of {{migration}} in gravitationally unstable disks {{is necessary to}} understand the fate of protoplanets formed by disk instability. As {{part of a larger}} study, we are using a 3 D radiative hydrodynamics code to investigate how an embedded gas giant planet interacts with a gas disk that undergoes gravitational instabilities (GIs). This Letter presents results from simulations with a Jupiter-mass planet placed in orbit at 25 AU within a 0. 14 M_ disk. The disk spans 5 to 40 AU around a 1 M_ star and is initially marginally unstable. In one simulation, the planet is inserted prior to the eruption of GIs; in another, it is inserted only after the disk has settled into a quasi-steady GI-active state, where heating by GIs roughly balances radiative cooling. When the planet is present from the beginning, its own wake stimulates growth of a particular global mode with which it strongly interacts, and the planet plunges inward six AU in about 10 ^ 3 years. In both cases with embedded planets, there are times when the planet's radial motion is slow and varies in direction. At other times, when the planet appears to be interacting with strong spiral modes, migration both inward and outward can be relatively rapid, covering several AUs over hundreds of years. Migration in both cases appears to stall near the inner Lindblad resonance of a dominant <b>low-order</b> <b>mode.</b> Planet orbit eccentricities fluctuate rapidly between about 0. 02 to 0. 1 throughout the GI-active phases of the simulations.

Comparison of published formulas for the four relevant equivalent bending stiffnesses D 11 eq, D 22 eq, D 66 eq, andD 12 eq revealed ambiguities: Three different formulas were found for D 22 eq, which describes the bending of the ridges and troughs; for D 66 eq two âcompetingâ formulas emerged. Expressions not converging to the flat-plate values {{in the limit of}} vanishing corrugation height were discarded. All discussed formulas are written in a uniform notation for general one-dimensionally periodic shapes. Formulas derived for isotropic panel materials were generalized to the orthotropic case. In order to resolve the ambiguities and assess the EPM with regard to its range of applicability, vibration modes of six rectangular corrugated panels were measured. While agreement with numerical results obtained with COMSOL was fair, the EPM predictions of natural frequencies were satisfactory only for <b>low-order</b> <b>modes.</b> Finally, equivalent bending stiffnesses were determined numerically from COMSOL results for a few <b>low-order</b> <b>modes</b> by inverse methods.

The National Research Council of Canada - Herzberg (NRC-H), in conjunction with TMT, has developed a preliminary design for the NFIRAOS RTC. The preliminary architecture for the RTC is comprised of several Linux-based servers.

A. et al., 2002) offer a {{complementary}} {{approach to the}} cryogenic baseline design (Lindl, J. et al., 2004) for achieving ignition on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Among the expected benefits are the ease of room temperature preparation and fielding, the potential for lower laser backscatter and the reduced need for careful shock timing. These benefits are offset, however, by demanding fabrication tolerances, e. g., shell concentricity and shell surface smoothness. In particular, the latter {{is of paramount importance}} since DS targets are susceptible to the growth of interface perturbations from impulsive and time-dependent accelerations. Previous work (Milovich, J. L. et al., 2004) has indicated that the growth of perturbations on the outer surface of the inner shell is potentially disruptive. To control this instability new designs have been proposed requiring bimetallic inner shells and material-matching mid-Z nanoporous foam. The challenges in manufacturing such exotic foams have led to a further evaluation of the densities and pore sizes needed to reduce the seeding of perturbations on the outer surface of the inner shell, thereby guiding the ongoing material science research efforts. Highly-resolved 2 D simulations of porous foams have been performed to establish an upper limit on the allowable pore sizes for instability growth. Simulations indicate that foams with higher densities than previously thought are now possible. Moreover, while at the present time we are only able to simulate foams with average pore sizes larger than 1 micron (due to computational limitations), we can conclude that these pore sizes are potentially problematic. Furthermore, the effect of low-order hohlraum radiation asymmetries on the growth of intrinsic surface perturbations is also addressed.
