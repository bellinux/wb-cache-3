The highway continues north and northwest through valleys and over hills and through a part of the Modoc National Forest, through the community of Avila Place, and then enters the east end of the Big Valley, where it begins to overlap SR 299 through Adin. The combined routes continue northerly through another part of the forest and over Adin Pass into the Warm Springs Valley, where SR 139 splits to the northwest near Canby.|$|E
5|$|With that, the Yuan dynasty, {{established}} by Genghis Khan's grandson Khublai Khan, {{became the first}} foreign dynasty to rule all of China. Despite being {{the head of the}} Mongol Empire, Khublai Khan's rule over China was not free from the threat of the steppe nomads. The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north. Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions. Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan <b>Lake</b> <b>Basin</b> in the far west to Yingchang in the east, Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did not add to the Great Wall (except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass). When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan, he did not mention a Great Wall.|$|E

25|$|However, {{with recent}} {{advances}} in ecological understanding {{it has become clear}} that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory and its neighbourhood. The draining of the lake completely also caused the watertable in the entire area to go down and the area becoming arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former <b>lake</b> <b>basin</b> into housing complexes as has already been happening with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or <b>lake</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jellyfish Lake {{is around}} 12,000 years old.

About 12,000 years ago, the sea level had risen to the point that sea water began to fill the Jellyfish <b>Lake</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Scientists hypothesise that {{sufficient}} volcanic {{interaction with}} the lake's bottom water that has high gas concentrations would heat water, force the methane out of the water, spark a methane explosion, and trigger a nearly simultaneous release of carbon dioxide.

It is also possible that the lake could spawn lake tsunamis as gas explodes out of it.|$|E

Newman had spent $600,000 on the construction by that date and expected to spend another $400,000 to build the resort.
