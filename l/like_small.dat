5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons look <b>like</b> <b>small</b> dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners <b>like</b> <b>small</b> New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds <b>like</b> <b>small</b> roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E

5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look <b>like</b> <b>small</b> segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Fairbanks also grew during this time. The Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra {{was founded in}} 1959, and the Fairbanks Drama Association was created in 1963. The Alaska Goldpanners {{baseball}} team was founded in 1959 as the city's first professional sports team. The next year, the Goldpanners hosted their first annual Midnight Sun Baseball Game, a tradition that had been conducted since 1905 and continues under the Goldpanners' auspices today. Through the 1960s, Fairbanks became much more <b>like</b> <b>small</b> towns in the Lower 48 as communications, transportation, and utilities improved.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are hemimetabolous, metamorphosing {{gradually}} to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are <b>like</b> <b>small</b> wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, {{the third and}} fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth instar, are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body's organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; in the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus, for example, the winged form makes up 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form makes up 98% of the population late in the summer. Thrips can survive the winter as adults or through egg or pupal diapause.|$|E
50|$|Males are {{slightly}} smaller than females, otherwise {{there is no}} discernible {{difference between the two}} sexes. Females are ovoviviparous and probably breed between early spring and July, with 1 to 4 young born September-November. Young lizards resemble their parents except look <b>like</b> <b>smaller</b> versions of them.|$|R

5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving <b>like</b> <b>small</b> planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} solver for {{quadratic}} programming problems, which is tuned for applications in computational geometry. The solver implements a generalization of the simplex method to quadratic programs. Unlike existing solvers, it is efficient {{if the problem}} is dense and has few variables or few constraints. The range of applications covers well-known problems <b>like</b> <b>smallest</b> enclosing ball, or polytope distance, but also linear programming problems <b>like</b> <b>smallest</b> enclosing annulus. We provide an exact implementation with only little overhead compared to pure floating-point code. Moreover, unlike all methods for these problems that were suggested (and implemented) before in computational geometry, the runtime in practice is not exponential in the dimension of the problem, which for example allows to compute smallest enclosing balls in dimensions up to 300 (beyond that, the exact arithmetic becomes the limiting factor). The solver follows the generic programming paradigm, and it will become [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Many brain {{areas are}} not {{suitable}} for fMRS studies because they are too small (<b>like</b> <b>small</b> nuclei in brainstem) or too close to bone tissue, CSF or extracranial lipids, which could cause inhomogeneity in the voxel and contaminate the spectra.

25|$|The pedipalps {{have the}} typical {{arachnid}} structure with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia and tarsus.

There is no evidence for a special sperm transfer device as in the modified palpal organ of male spiders. Interestingly, in at least the palaeocharinids and anthracomartids {{the tip of the}} pedipalp is modified into a small claw formed from the tarsal claw (or apotele) and a projection from the tarsus.
