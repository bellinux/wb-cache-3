40|$|The {{object of}} the {{presentation}} {{is the development of}} a topology optimization tool for designing fibre-plastic composite structures which is appropriate for each material involved. The main goal of this algorithm is maximum rigidity with as even a distribution of tension as possible throughout the component, which is achieved by distributing the load from high-load to lower <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>areas,</b> thereby optimizing material distribution. The weight optimization of specific components is possible in this way. As continues to be shown, the developed adaptive topology and fibre angle optimization is beneficial from a technological, materialmechanical and economical point of view, and can be applied in everyday practice without any problems. The comparison of theoretical and practical experiments with carbon fibre reinforced plastic prototypes is followed by the display of the weight, stability and rigidity characteristics of the optimization method by means of numerical examinations of FE models. On the basis of these numerical examinations, it has proven possible to develop a method which optimizes the topology and orientation of every single fibre layer of an entire laminate in a simple manner. The result produced is a structural recommendation which complies with the performance capacity of the FPC. The structural optimization of FPC is already done automatically on relatively large components. It has been used several times in practical applications and has produced convincing results through significant improvements to the structural properties of the optimized components...|$|R

This study gives {{a detailed description}} of TN expression in areas of articular cartilage from femoral heads with mild OA showing structural lesions and in structurally normal areas of the same femoral heads compared with normal cartilage and cartilage with severe OA. Methods: Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed on cryosections stained with antibodies against TN. Sections were selected as follows: from each macroscopically normal femoral head (n= 6) a normal central and peripheral biopsy; from each femoral head with macroscopically mild OA (n= 8) a central biopsy that showed structural lesions and a peripheral normal biopsy; from each femoral head with severe OA (n= 9) a central and a peripheral biopsy with structural lesions. Central biopsies represent <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>areas,</b> whereas peripheral biopsies are non-load bearing. Results: Central cartilage with mild OA contains significantly higher levels of TN in the superficial zone than structurally normal, peripheral cartilage from the same femoral heads. Normal cartilage and cartilage with severe OA do not display this topographic variation. Central cartilage with mild OA shows significantly higher levels of TN than normal, central cartilage. Peripheral, normal cartilage with mild OA shows significantly less TN than peripheral cartilage with severe OA. Conclusions: In femoral heads with mild OA, TN is accumulated in areas displaying structural damage. This proposes mild OA to be a localized disorder.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of a prosthetic socket for a below-the-knee amputee requires {{knowledge of the}} underlying bone structure {{in order to provide}} pressure relief for sensitive areas and support for <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>areas.</b> The goal is to enable the residual limb to bear pressure with greater ease and utility. Conventional methods of prosthesis fabrication are based on limited knowledge about the patient`s underlying bone structure. A 3 D ultrasound imaging system was developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The imaging system provides information about the location of the bones in the residual limb along with the shape of the skin surface. Computer assisted design (CAD) software can use this data to design prosthetic sockets for amputees. Ultrasound was selected as the imaging modality. A computer model was developed to analyze the effect of the various scanning parameters and to assist {{in the design of the}} overall system. The 3 D ultrasound imaging system combines off-the-shelf technology for image capturing, custom hardware, and control and image processing software to generate two types of image data [...] volumetric and planar. Both volumetric and planar images reveal definition of skin and bone geometry with planar images providing details on muscle fascial planes, muscle/fat interfaces, and blood vessel definition. The 3 D ultrasound imaging system was tested on 9 unilateral below-the- knee amputees. Image data was acquired from both the sound limb and the residual limb. The imaging system was operated in both volumetric and planar formats. An x-ray CT (Computed Tomography) scan was performed on each amputee for comparison.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the {{weight-bearing}} during healing in a series of patients with tibial fractures, and to examine how this changed with time post-fracture. Weight-bearing indicates the force through the leg as a percentage of the total body weight. An ambulatory monitoring system was developed, comprising of the monitor and analysis software for a PC. The ambulatory monitor measures the force via pressure transducers attached to the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>areas</b> on the underside of the foot to obtain the weight-bearing through the fractured leg. The software was developed in the C programming language by using a PC host executing a cross-compiler, the program then being down-loaded via the serial line to the monitor hardware for execution and testing. Once a basic monitor was operational, the clinical trials commenced, these being conducted at fracture clinic sessions at Middlesbrough General Hospital. Further development work occurred throughout the patient trials which led to increases in the accuracy and consistency of the results obtained. Results were obtained from 37 patients with tibial fractures, and these all demonstrated that there was a non-linear increase in weight-bearing with time post-fracture. An increase in step duration relative to the step duration of the normal leg also occurred, indicating a gradual change in the gait pattern adopted, tending towards a normal gait pattern with time. A similar pattern was found with the stride length, this indicating a gradual change towards a more normal gait pattern with time. An increase in velocity of gait was also observed over the healing period, suggesting greater confidence in walking as healing progressed. Such results lead to the hypothesis that a feedback mechanism operates which controls the weight-bearing applied to the fracture depending on the stiffness of the fracture. The clinical relevance of this work is to aid the clinician in fracture healing assessment enabling the prescription of more applicable treatment method...|$|R

40|$|As {{the twentieth}} century closes, retrospectives cite the Apollo moon {{missions}} {{as one of the}} important events of the past 100 years. A trip to Mars, however, would be even more challenging and significant. A round-trip Mars journey would require nearly three years away from Earth, a significant leap in complexity compared to the two week long Moon trips or the record-breaking fourteen-month flight on Mir. What would be the physiologic and medical challenges of a Mars flight? Two key areas of physiology present the greatest potential problems [...] calcium metabolism and radiation exposure. Data from Mir missions show that bone loss continues in space despite an aggressive countermeasure program. Average losses were 0. 35 % per month, but some <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>areas</b> lost > 1 % per month. A 1 % loss rate, if it continued unabated for 30 months, could produce osteoporosis. Smaller losses could still increase fracture risk. Some bone loss can be well tolerated, particularly if the bone can be regained after the mission. But the effectiveness of post-flight rehabilitation to restore the density and quality of bone after spaceflight is not well known. Bone loss estimates are based on continuous weightlessness exposure, {{but this is not a}} requirement for a Mars trip. Most of the time on a Mars trip will be spent in the 1 / 3 Earth's gravity environment on Mars, and either intermittent or continuous artificial gravity can be provided for the transit between planets (although at an engineering cost). The dosing of the gravity exposure (e. g. the level and duration), however, has not been established. Radiation protection also requires a balance between engineering cost and human health. Excessive shielding could add billions of dollars to the cost of a mission. Trips in interplanetary space, however, expose the crew to heavy high-energy particles from cosmic rays (HZE particles), which have a high linear energy transfer. This high energy leads to significant biological damage (e. g. chromosomal aberrations, cancer induction). A recent report from the Committee on Space Biology and Medicine notes that only one systematic study of cancer induction from high-energy particles has been conducted (using the mouse Harderian gland). Predictions of cancer risk and acceptable radiation exposure in space are extrapolated from minimal data. Other areas of physiology also present problems, such as muscle loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, and vestibular adaptation.

An aluminium based powder (AlMgSiCuFe) was used as investigated material. After applying dierent pressing pressures (400 and 600 MPa), specimens were dewaxed in a ventilated furnace at 400 ◦C for 60 min. Sintering was carried out in a vacuum furnace at 610 ◦C for 30 min. The specimens were processed by single equal channel angular pressure pass. A signicant disadvantage of powder metallurgy processing methods is the presence of porosity. Pores act as crack initiators and, due to their presence, the distribution of stress is inhomogeneous across the cross-section and leads to reduction of the effective <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>area.</b> The equal channel angular pressure process, causing stress distribution in deformed specimens, made the powder particles to squeeze together to such an extent that the initially interconnected pores transform to small isolated pores.

40|$|AbstractFor {{adhesive}} tapes, {{the strain}} before fracture often exceeds 500 %. Although the maximum stresses are quite modest the high strains to fracture result in impressive fracture energy. Due to hydrostatic stress the fracture process often starts by nucleation of microscopic cracks inside the layer. The final crack path is usually {{close to one}} of the adherends. Repeated experiments are performed both with DCB-specimens and butt-joints. The used adhesive tape is an acrylic foam tape with a thickness of 1. 1 mm and a width of 19 mm. The geometry of the specimen is adapted to the properties of the soft layer. For the DCB-specimen this implies that the length of the specimen is about 1 m. The evaluated cohesive laws from the DCB- specimens give a fracture energy of 2 kN/m and a maximum stress about 0. 5 MPa. For the butt-joints, the evaluated cohesive law corresponds well to the results from the DCB-experiments. However, the strain to fracture is slightly smaller. The stress in these specimens is distributed over a larger area and a nucleated crack rapidly crosses the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>area</b> and fails the joint prematurely. For both kinds of experiments the evaluated cohesive laws show a small linear part. After this part there is an almost linear strain-hardening phase until fracture...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} compressive failure in masonry made of soft clay bricks is presented. Masonry assemblages are tested {{to evaluate the}} influence of the relative strength of mortar on the observed damage evolution and compressive failure. Damage evolution associated with the formation and propagation of vertical splitting cracks during the compressive load response of masonry assemblages in the stack bonded arrangement are studied using a fullfield optical technique based on digital image correlation. Using image correlation, clear evidence of the crack forming in the mortar and propagating into the brick is established. Damage is associated with cracking in the mortar due to lateral tension produced by the confined expansion of brick. Failure depends upon the tensile strength of the mortar. In mortar with lower strength than the brick unit, failure is produced by spalling associated with multiple cracks, which results in a loss of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>area.</b> For mortar with a higher strength than the brick, cracking occurs when the level of compression is a significant proportion of the compressive strength of the brick material.

In order to induce rapid formation of low friction oxide layers without a severe ‘running-in’ period, nano particles of Fe in the range 5 - 10 nm were deposited on ground flat ended pin and plate 080 M 40 substrates using a terminated gas condensation PVD process, to a thickness of 600 nm. Coatings were tested in a reciprocating geometry at a fixed stroke length of 0. 4 mm, frequency of 31 Hz and 40 N normal load (1 MPa contact stress) and at ambient, 300 °C and 540 °C. At ambient temperature the coated surfaces exhibited higher friction but lower wear compared to the uncoated substrates, whereas at elevated temperatures, the coated surfaces exhibited slightly lower steady state dynamic friction coefficients, and minimal changes in wear depth after a short incubation period. SEM of the worn surfaces indicated that hard oxide plateaus {{were responsible for the}} <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> contact <b>area</b> at elevated temperatures. Cross sectional FIB, TEM and SIMS confirmed that at elevated temperatures, the nano-particle coating induced rapid formation of a nano-crystalline porous surface oxide film of mixed composition which protected the substrate from severe wear during the running-in period...|$|R

At present, the cabin <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> is 0. 04 MPa, to improve work efficiency, increasing to 0. 055 MPa and replacing alloy by composite, the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> increases 37. 5 %, while the weight reduces 26. 1 %, then the contradiction between work efficiency and mass is coordinated...|$|R
40|$|Instrumented impact {{strength}} tests {{have been carried}} out on KV sub-size Charpy samples drawn from A 356 aluminium alloy 17 -in. wheels, produced by a low-pressure die casting. The wheels show different geometry and thermal treatment. In this paper, the effects of microstructure and defects on the impact properties are studied. The results indicate that the impact energy is lower in as-cast wheel than in T 6 heat-treated wheels. A finer microstructure always corresponds to higher {{impact strength}}, while a direct correlation between the resistance to crack propagation values and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) exists. Casting defects, revealed by means of X-ray and density measurements techniques, become critical when concentrated around the V-notch, where they reduce the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>area</b> of Charpy specimens. The fracture profile and surface of Charpy specimens have been investigated revealing how the crack crosses the interdendritic eutectic region where a significant fraction of cracked eutectic silicon and intermetallic particles is found. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behaviour of the alloy of the wheels analysed, in order to predict the final microstructure and shrinkage formation. Solidification times, estimated by means of SDAS measurements and calculated with a numerical simulation approach, showa good correspondence. Critical areas, as concern hot spots and shrinkage porosities, are generally revealed in the zone of the wheels between the spoke and the rim, {{as well as in the}} rim area...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} the bearing strength of concrete is increased by the confinement effect provided by the enveloping concrete. Various empirical formulas {{have been used in}} international codes relating the bearing strength of concrete to the compressive strength and the ratio of the total surface area to <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>area</b> (A/Ab) (known as bearing ratio). This study presents a new approach developed for the bearing strength of concrete loaded through rigid steel plate by way of analyzing the final failure pattern of concrete prism and cube specimen under axial compression considering slip planes direction, mechanical properties of normal weight concrete, relative element height and the effect of the bearing ratio. The main objective of the present paper is thus an attempt to put forward an analytical approach which conservatively predicts the bearing strength of normal weight concrete and accounts for all of the parameters mentioned above. The method depends on the final failure pattern mechanism of concrete prism and cube under axial compression load and considers the possible failure mode of diagonal shear failure, direction of shear failure planes, characteristic compressive strength of normal weight concrete, relative element height and the effect of the A/Ab ratio. The results of the proposed approach herein are compared with test data existing in the literature and the output values of standard design procedure available in some international codes.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} normal {{topographical}} variation of T 2 relaxation time of articular cartilage in different compartments {{of the knee}} joint and at different tissue depths in young healthy adults. MethodsTwenty asymptomatic young adult volunteers (age range, 21 – 27 years; mean age, 22. 5 years), were studied at 1. 5 T. Both axial and sagittal multi-slice multi-echo spin echo measurements were performed to determine the T 2 relaxation time of cartilage in the femoral, tibial and patellar compartments. The cartilage surfaces were divided into 24 segments and each segment was divided into deep and superficial regions-of-interest (ROIs) of equal thickness. The reproducibility for ROI analysis was assessed for five patients by determining the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the root-mean-square coefficient of variation (CVRMS). ResultsCartilage T 2 was significantly dependent on joint topography, compartment and tissue depth. For all joint surfaces, superficial T 2 values were systematically higher as compared to deep tissue. The data showed a trend toward higher T 2 values at the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>area</b> of the femoral condyles. The interobserver error varied significantly among different locations and showed mostly good reproducibility with mean ICC of 0. 70 and a CVRMS of 5. 0 %. ConclusionThe normal variation in cartilage T 2 within a joint is significant and should be acknowledged when pathology-related T 2 changes are investigated. The knowledge on normal variation {{can be used for}} power and sample size calculations in further studies, and the T 2 values as control data in future patient studies...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the in vitro <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of four-unit posterior frameworks made of glass ceramic with lithium-disilicate crystals (E 2), of zirconia-reinforced glass-infiltrated alumina (ICZ) and of zirconia stabilized with 3 mol% yttria (CEZ). METHODS: All frameworks mimicked a four-unit posterior situation with 7. 3 mm 2 interdental cross-sections and possessed exactly the same dimensions. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was measured on a special bridge test setup with 15 specimens for each of the materials. The data were analyzed with Weibull statistics giving the characteristic <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity F 0 at 63 % failure probability and the Weibull modulus m as indicator for the reliability and reproducibility. RESULTS: For the E 2 frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and the SD was 260 (+/- 53) N, the characteristic load F 0 282 N and the reliability m = 5. 7. For the ICZ frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was 470 (+/- 101) N, F 0 518 N and m = 4. 5. CEZ frameworks revealed the highest average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of 706 (+/- 123) N, the highest characteristic <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity F 0 = 755 N and the best reliability m = 7. 0. SIGNIFICANCE: CEZ frameworks showed the best mechanical properties as demonstrated by the high values of average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity, reliability and characteristic <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity with respect to the other ceramics studied. However, for four-unit posterior CEZ frameworks the connector size of 7. 3 mm 2 is insufficient to withstand occlusal forces reported in the literature. Four-unit posterior frameworks require a connector size larger than 7. 3 mm 2...|$|R

Reinforced concrete approach has been the predominant method of construction. Masonry construction in Malaysia was found more than 350 years ago during the settlement of Portuguese in Melaka. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> masonry approach is widely used in developed countries because it is cheaper and forms part of one of the earliest construction techniques. The aim of this research is to investigate the level of exposure of this technique among contractors. The objective is to justify the economic viability of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction. The method of analysis that is used is qualitative- based involving data collection and analysis. Data collection will be carried out using face to face interviews. The masonry <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> is cheaper than reinforced concrete. Masonry <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> provides many advantages to the construction industry but its exposure and utilization by contractors and developers does not tally to its advantages where its economic viability is one of them.
