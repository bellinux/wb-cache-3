5000|$|Quin prompts Satterthwaite {{to assess}} the news events of the time from a long view. Satterthwaite says crossword puzzles and cat burglars. In France, there were many unsolved thefts, {{including}} one {{of a collection of}} jewels from a French château. The chief suspects are the Clondinis, a family of three acrobats. They talk of Harwell's disappearance as being like a conjuring trick to divert public attention from what is really happening. In the case of Harwell, could the sale for cash of the Grange and all its contents have been the real trick played, and Harwell's disappearance the diversion? Quin points out that Miss <b>Le</b> <b>Couteau's</b> past is as little known as that of Harwell, and she, her husband, and Mrs Mathias could easily be the Clondinis in disguise, staging this elaborate laundering of the proceeds of their crime. Mathias and Harwell were never seen together. An examination of the fine items in the house could provide proof, if they matched those stolen in France. Satterthwaite agrees to set the wheels in motion. Mary Jones, serving at the [...] "Bells and Motley", in love with Stephen Grant, has a good surprise coming to her.|$|R

Ketchup’s timeslips has him interacting with Moses, Attila the Hun, Napoleon and the emperor Montezuma, and repeatedly upsetting the very course of history.|$|E
50|$|Claude Mulot (1942-1986) was a French screenwriter {{and film}} {{director}} who mainly specialized in adult films but also made various attempts in other genres like horror films (The Blood Rose), comedies (Le jour se lève et les conneries commencent) or thrillers (<b>Le</b> <b>Couteau</b> sous la gorge). He accidentally drowned {{at the early}} age of 44 while his screenplay On se calme et on boit frais à Saint-Tropez was being shot by Max Pécas in Saint-Tropez in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, {{the company}} {{produced}} a double bill of Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1689) and Darius Milhaud's Les malheurs d'Orphée (1924). Two more American premieres followed in November 2002 with Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů's 1928 Dada opera, <b>Les</b> larmes du <b>couteau</b> (Tears of the Knife), and his 1935 Hlas lesa (The Voice of the Forest).|$|R
5000|$|Les Reines Prochaines {{were founded}} in 1987 as <b>Les</b> Reines des <b>Couteaux</b> (in French, [...] "The Queens of the Knives") by Teresa Alonso, Regina Florida Schmid, and Muda Mathis; in the {{following}} year, {{they were joined by}} Fränzi Madörin and Pipilotti Rist. Years later, Gabi Streiff, Sus Zwick, Sibylle Hauert, Michèle Fuchs, and Barbara Naegelin joined as well.|$|R
50|$|Martinů finally {{departed}} for Paris in 1923, having received a small scholarship from the Ministry of Education. He sought out Albert Roussel, whose individualistic style he respected, {{and began a}} series of informal lessons with him. Roussel would teach Martinů until his death in 1937 by helping him focus and bring order to his compositions, rather than instructing him in a specific style. During his first years in Paris, Martinů incorporated many of the trends at the time, including jazz, neoclassicism, and surrealism. He was particularly attracted to Stravinsky whose novel, angular, propulsive rhythms and sonorities reflected the industrial revolution, sports events and motorised transportation. Ballets were his favorite medium for experimentation, including The Revolt (1925), The Butterfly That Stamped (1926), Le raid merveilleux (1927), La revue de cuisine (1927), and <b>Les</b> larmes du <b>couteau</b> (1928). Martinů found friends in the Czechoslovak artistic community and would always retain close ties to his homeland, frequently returning during the summer. He continued to look to his Bohemian and Moravian roots for musical ideas. The best known during this time is the ballet Špalíček (1932-33), which incorporates Czech folk tunes and nursery rhymes.|$|R
50|$|Just {{over a year}} earlier, {{the large}} local house, Ashley Grange, was bought by Miss Eleanor <b>Le</b> <b>Couteau,</b> a rich young French Canadian, {{with a taste for}} {{collecting}} and for the hunt. Captain Richard Harwell stayed at the inn {{to take part in a}} fox hunt. Miss <b>Le</b> <b>Couteau</b> fell for him; two months later they were engaged, and after three months they married. After a two-week honeymoon they returned to Ashley Grange on that stormy night. Early the next morning, the Captain disappeared, seen only by their gardener, John Mathias. Suspicion fell on Stephen Grant, a young lad in Harwell's employ, but recently discharged. Nothing could be proved against him. Captain Harwell has no family, no past life that police could find. His heartbroken wife sold the Grange and all its fine contents, jewellery included, to an American millionaire to settle on the continent. The rheumatic gardener John Mathias was also suspected. His wife was the cook for the couple. He returned to their cottage twenty-five minutes after the Captain left the house, which was time enough to dispose of the body, but there is no body found. The couple left the area.|$|E

After the French Federation dismantled Prof. Change and placed Michel Laroux {{in charge of}} the formations. It is based on La Boxe Française Savate, La Savate of the late 19th century, La Lutte Parisienne and the discipline* of La canne de Combat (stick) *includes also Le Bâton Français (staff), <b>Le</b> <b>Couteau</b> (knife), Le Poignard (dagger), La Chaise (chair) and Le Manteau (overcoat).|$|E
50|$|Marc {{graduated}} from Fryeburg Academy in 1988 and then attended school at The Institute of Culinary Education {{and he started}} as a line cook at Prix Fixe in New York. By the mid-1990s, he was a sous-chef at Layla in New York and in 1996 became the executive chef at Cellar in the Sky, also in New York. From 1997 to 2000, he was the co-owner and executive chef of La Fourchette. In 2000, he also became the executive chef at Chinoiserie {{as well as the}} partner and co-owner of <b>Le</b> <b>Couteau,</b> both of which are in New York.|$|E
5000|$|The Russian Revolution had {{significant}} influence on Barbusse's life and work. He joined the French Communist Party in 1923 and later traveled back to the Soviet Union. His later works, Manifeste aux Intellectuels (Elevations) (1930) and others, show a more revolutionary standpoint. Of these, the 1921 <b>Le</b> <b>Couteau</b> entre les dents (The Knife Between My Teeth) marks Barbusse's siding with Bolshevism and the October Revolution. Barbusse characterized the birth of Soviet Russia as [...] "the greatest and most beautiful phenomenon in world history." [...] The book Light from the Abyss (1919) and the collection of articles Words of a Fighting Man (1920) contain calls for the overthrow of capitalism. In 1925, Barbusse published Chains, showing history as the unbroken chain of suffering of people and their struggle for freedom and justice. In the publicistic book The Butchers, he exposes the White Terror in the Balkan countries.|$|E
