5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe <b>light</b> <b>patterns</b> to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygonsâ€”any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

These signs could be physically removed and changed when a train was assigned to a different service pattern.

This walkway, known as the Light Tunnel, features an elaborate multi-colored light show behind sculpted glass panels extending {{the entire length of the}} walkway, as well several moving walkways. The <b>light</b> <b>patterns</b> are synchronized with an original musical score composed by Victor Alexeeff, which runs for nearly 30 minutes before repeating. This installation, one of the first large-scale uses of color changing LED lighting in the United States, was produced by Mills James Productions with glasswork by Foxfire Glass Works of Pontiac, Michigan. The display won multiple lighting design awards including the prestigious Guth Award of Merit. For passengers who are prone to medical conditions such as seizures, there are buttons at each end of the tunnel that will suspend the light show for five minutes so they can pass through with no adverse effects.|$|E
5000|$|When run {{on certain}} PDP-11 processors, each DEC {{operating}} system displayed a characteristic <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> {{on the front}} of the processor in the [...] "Data" [...] lights when the system was idle.

The <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> was produced when the processor displayed the contents CPU register R0 when the [...] "WAIT" [...] instruction was executed. The RSX-11M <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> was two sets of lights that swept outwards to the left and right from the center of the light display (or inwards if the IND indirect command file processor program was currently running). By contrast, the IAS <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> was a single bar of lights that swept leftwards. Correspondingly, a jumbled <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> (reflecting memory fetches) was a visible indication that the computer was under load as this meant that the system idle task was not being run. Other PDP-11 operating systems such as RSTS/E had their own distinctive patterns in the console lights.|$|R

40|$|Image-based relighting (IBL) {{has become}} a popular {{research}} topic in both computer graphics and signal processing. IBL is the technique that renders images of a scene under different lighting conditions without prior knowledge of the object geometry and surface properties in the scene. Simply put, IBL collects images of the scene under all possible lighting conditions and process these images to render {{an image of the}} scene under a new lighting condition. To be practical, IBL strives {{to reduce the number of}} images that need to be captured, and most IBL algorithms do so by estimating the surface reflectance function (SRF) of the scene, which represents the response of each pixel in the scene to lighting from various directions. IBL hence becomes the problem of estimating the SRF using a number of <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> to illuminate the scene. To minimize the number of <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> needed, we propose to use a statistical approach, principal component analysis (PCA), and show that the most efficient <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> should be the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the SRFs, corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. In addition, we show that discrete cosine transform (DCT) -based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> perform as well as the optimal PCA-based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> for typical SRFs, especially for scenes with Lambertian surfaces. Both the PCA-based and the DCT-based methods outperform existing IBL algorithms with fewer <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns.</b> 1...|$|R

The <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> is detected by an imaging and/or spatial sensor unit and is evaluated in a way of image evaluation.

40|$|With {{image-based}} relighting (IBL), one can render realistic relit {{images of}} a scene without prior knowledge of object geometry in the scene. However, traditional IBL methods require {{a large number of}} basis images, each corresponding to a <b>lighting</b> <b>pattern,</b> to estimate the surface reflectance function (SRF) of the scene. In this paper, we present a statistical approach to estimating the SRF which requires fewer basis images. We formulate the SRF estimation problem in a signal reconstruction framework. We use the principal component analysis (PCA, [1]) to show that the most effective <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> for the data acquisition process are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the SRFs, corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. In addition, we show that for typical SRFs, especially when the objects have Lambertian surfaces, DCT-based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> perform as well as the optimal PCA-based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns.</b> We compare SRF estimation performance of the statistical approach with traditional IBL techniques. Experimental results show that the statistical approach can achieve better performance with fewer basis images. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{multichannel}} array projection is generalized {{in order to}} realize an ultraslim, highly efficient optical system for structured illumination with high lumen output, where additionally the Kohler illumination principle is utilized and source light homogenization occurs. The optical system consists of a multitude of neighboring optical channels. In each channel two optical freeforms generate a real or a virtual spatial <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> and furthermore, the ray directions are modified to enable Kohler illumination of a subsequent projection lens. The internal <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> may be additionally influenced by absorbing apertures or slides. The projection lens transfers the resulting <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> to a target, where the total target distribution is produced by superposition of all individual channel output pattern. The optical system without absorbing apertures {{can be regarded as}} a generalization of a fly's eye condenser for structured illumination. In this case <b>light</b> <b>pattern</b> is exclusively generated by freeform light redistribution. The commonly occurring blurring effect for freeform beamshaping is reduced due {{to the creation of a}} virtual object light structure by means of the two freeform surfaces and its imaging towards the target. But, the remaining blurring inhibits very high spatial frequencies at the target. In order to create target features with very high spatial resolution the absorbing apertures can be utilized. In this case the freeform beamshaping can be used for an enhanced light transmission through the absorbing apertures. The freeform surfaces are designed by a generalized approach of Cartesian oval representation...|$|R
