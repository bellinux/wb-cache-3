The liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method used for levamisole quantification was validated according to the criteria set by Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The following validation parameters were determined: <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> (CCα) 0. 55 μg kg- 1, detection of capability (CCβ) 0. 59 μg kg- 1, limit of detection (LOD) 0. 06 μg kg- 1, limit of quantification (LOQ) 0. 22 μg kg- 1, precision and accuracy (expressed as recovery) 97. 3 - 100 %, intra-laboratory reproducibility (RSD) 4. 2 - 5. 6 %. Levamisole levels for 45 of the total of 85 samples were below the LOD value (0. 06 µg kg- 1). In the remaining 40 milk samples, levamisole was measured in the range from 0. 061 to 0. 142 µg kg- 1 and the mean value was 0. 092 µg kg- 1.

40|$|Preliminary and incomplete] This paper {{provides}} a rationalization for using classical one-sided hypothesis tests for approving innovations, {{such as new}} drugs or treatment programs. I consider statistical testing as a strategy of the regulator {{in a game against}} informed proponents who can profit from the regulator’s acceptance decision even for ineffective innovations. Lower test size deters proponents from attempting costly clinical trials to gain approval of innovations they know ex ante to be ineffective. I show that test size equal to the ratio of the proponents’ cost of collecting data to their benefit from approval of a null innovation achieves minimax optimality for a regulator who prefers not to place any prior on the quality of potential innovations. It is also the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> rules for Bayesian regulators as the assumed share of potential proponents with bad innovations converges to one. ...|$|E

An antiserum was raised in rabbits against the diazo‐conjugate of clenbuterol and the human serum albumin. In the assay, the anticlenbuterol antibody was incubated with the salbutamol‐enzyme conjugate and unlabelled standard or samples in microtitre wells precoated with affinity‐purified antirabbit IgG. The absolute detection limit for clenbuterol and mabuterol was 0. 3 ng/ml (15 pg/well) and 50 % relative binding at 1. 0 ng/ml (50 pg/well). The absolute detection limits for salbutamol and terbutaline were 0. 9 and 1. 3 ng/ml, respectively. The cross‐reactivity of iso‐propylic parent compounds was quite low (< 1 %). Urine and sera were tested without any extraction step. Sample blanks (96 urine and 76 sera from five different sources) showed low matrix effect, suggesting a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> for bovine urine of 0. 6 ng/ml clenbuterol equivalent. Mean recoveries of clenbuterol in spiked urine and serum samples ranged from 90 to 120 % (mean recovery 96 %).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rapid method for confirming residues of thyreostats in meat-based baby foods by using liquid chromatography–dual polarity electrospray–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ES(±) -MS/MS). Six thioureylenes, {{belonging to the}} group of thiouracil and imidazole, were selected for this work: thiouracil (TU), methylthiouracil (MTU), propylthiouracil (PTU), phenylthiouracil (PhTU), mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) and tapazole (TAP). The amphoteric nature of these compounds allows their electrospray detection in both positive and negative ionisation. Nevertheless, MS detection is not favoured by their low molecular weights, while their chromatographic retention is also thwarted by their high polarity. A pentafluorophenyl (PFP) core-shell phase column was selected to avoid peak asymmetry or peak splitting, and a dual-polarity ionisation method was optimised to obtain a sensitivity as high as possible. The method was validated according to the Commission Decision 657 / 2002 /EC. A simple and fast procedure based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) was optimised to extract analytes from baby foods with recoveries exceeding 82 %. <b>Limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) were lower than the permissible maximum concentration (10  ng g− 1).

40|$|A team of {{learning}} machines is a multiset {{of learning}} machines. A team {{is said to}} successfully learn a concept just in case each member of some nonempty subset, of predetermined size, of the team learns the concept. Team learning of languages {{may be viewed as}} a suitable theoretical model for studying computational limits on the use of multiple heuristics in learning from examples. Team learning of recursively enumerable languages has been studied extensively. However, it may be argued that from a practical point of view all languages of interest are computable. This paper gives theoretical results about team learnability of computable (recursive) languages. These results are mainly about two issues: redundancy and aggregation. The issue of redundancy deals with the impact of increasing the size of a team and increasing the number of machines required to be successful. The issue of aggregation deals with conditions under which a team may be replaced by a single machine without any loss in learning ability. The learning scenarios considered are: (a) Identification in the limit of grammars for computable languages. (b) Identification in the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> procedures for computable languages. (c) Identification in the limit of grammars for indexed families of computable languages. (d) Identification in the limit of grammars for indexed families with a recursively enumerable class of grammars for the family as the hypothesis space. Scenarios that can be modeled by team learning are also presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Artificial oxygen {{carriers}} (AOCs) can be abused by the athletes {{to improve their}} aerobic capacity. The AOCs produce a performance enhancing effect, especially in endurance sports. This article presents a method for the rapid screening of hemoglobin-based {{oxygen carriers}} (HBOCs) in blood samples. Common screening tests to reveal HBOC misuse by athletes are based on colorimetric detection since HBOC use causes discoloration of the plasma. In this communication we are presenting a different approach for HBOC detection using an hematological analyzer capable of measuring hemoglobin by two methods: a standard cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric method to calculate the amount of total hemoglobin (HGBtot) and a flow cytometric optical method to calculate the amount of hemoglobin within the red blood cells (HGBcell). Thanks to this dual contemporary hemoglobin measurement, the HGBdelta value (corresponding to free HGB) is automatically calculated by subtraction of HGBcell from HGBtot {{and can be used}} as a fast screening index of HBOC abuse. We tested the effectiveness of this approach using 68 normal blood samples with different basal HGB values fortified with three different HBOCs at varying concentrations. We evaluated the performance of the method by calculating the correlation between HGBcell and HGBtot values in normal samples. Finally we used a simple statistical approach to calculate a reliable HGBdelta cut-off value (0. 35 g/dL) as a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> to discriminate between a clear negative sample and a suspect sample to submit to a confirmation analysis.

Correlation with a commercially available immunoluminometric assay (Berilux — Behringwerke) was excellent (r = 0. 92, n = 201 data pairs, range covered 0 — 10 mU/l). The regression line using a double logarithmic transformation was: (log y) = 0. 91 (log x) — 0. 08. The assay precision at the clinical <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> — i. e. between hyper- and euthyroidism (0. 2 mU/ 1) and eu- and hypothyroidism (4 mU/l) — was acceptable. The median coefficient of variation was 1. 93 % in the range 0. 02 — 1 mU/ 1 and 2. 11 % in the range 1. 0 — 3. 5 mU/ 1, with both values being determined from precision profiles using 214 and 188 data pairs respectively.
