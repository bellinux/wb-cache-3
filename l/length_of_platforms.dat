50|$|There were {{plans to}} improve station {{facilities}} and rail services at Worcester Park during 2012-13. Network Rail notified Kingston council of {{its intention to}} extend the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> at Worcester Park Station. This will allow extra passenger capacity as trains can be increased from 8 carriages to 10 in length.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} {{passenger}} trains generally has {{to match the}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms,</b> especially high-level platforms. These platforms cannot always be extended to suit extended train lengths due to bridges, tunnels, pointwork, narrowing track centers and stabling yards, though [...] "selective door opening" [...] can help long trains stop at short platforms.|$|E
50|$|For passengers, {{it has an}} {{enormous}} covered waiting area between the main complex and the platforms. The main complex has waiting rooms for passengers awaiting connecting trains. In addition, there is a Yatri Niwas with dormitory/ single room/ double room accommodation. The vehicular carriageways along the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> allow passengers to be dropped near rail compartments — a facility unique among most major stations of the country.|$|E
50|$|Although only a halt, {{it had a}} {{considerable}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> and modest wooden buildings, plus an old NSR carriage used as a waiting room.|$|R
5000|$|A short <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> {{has been}} rebuilt {{on the site}} of the second {{passenger}} station (of 1893) at West Bridge in Leicester, and has track alongside it and a semaphore signal, [...] From here the trackbed is now a public footpath for about a mile towards Glenfield tunnel, to [...]|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, {{as part of}} a {{national}} initiative to eliminate ballast tracks at major stations, washable aprons—ballastless tracks or tracks on a concrete bed—were laid along the entire <b>length</b> <b>of</b> track <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 2 at the terminus.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{to three}} local trains per hour, with most trains serving the Tokushima [...] - [...] Awa-Ikeda, Tokushima [...] - [...] Anabuki, and Tokushima [...] - [...] Awa-Kawashima sections. Some trains {{continue}} through to the Mugi Line via Tokushima. Local trains are generally driver-only operated, but some daytime and late-night trains between Tokushima and Anabuki, as well as three trains between Anabuki and Awa-Ikeda, often have a conductor on board. Due to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms,</b> train lengths are limited {{to a maximum of}} four cars.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the station}} has six {{platform}} tracks. Track 1 (a dock platform) and track 2 are {{next to the}} main station building. The other four tracks are located on the island platform, a through platform and a terminating platform {{on each side of}} the platform. Platforms are 38 cm high and the maximum usable <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> varies from 118 to 344 m. The station is not wheelchair accessible and has no lifts or escalators. It is planned to modernise the station at a cost of €11.4 million, with work due to be carried out between 2013 and 2017.|$|E
50|$|Karlovo náměstí is a pylon {{station with}} 3 supports. The {{depth of the}} station is 40 metres and it is 165 metres long, {{including}} service rooms. The length of the middle tunnel {{is the same as}} the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms.</b> The interior design consists of metal tubing (station tunnels leading to other stations feature concrete design). The facing consists of glass blocks, designed by František Vízner, placed over a beige colour film. Similar designs are used in other stations of the B line. The same blocks, despite their size, were in use on Jinonice station. The transfer corridor walls are faced by CONNEX glass (as in most of the B line stations).|$|E
25|$|As {{built the}} site covered three acres and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> faces was 830 yards.|$|R

50|$|Loughborough {{railway station}} is the {{mainline}} national station serving the town. In 2012, Network Rail redeveloped the station, increasing the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> and improving access. The local council has made concurrent {{improvements to the}} surrounding area. The station has services from London St. Pancras International, to which its twice-hourly London service goes, giving {{a link to the}} continent via the Eurostar. East Midlands Trains is the primary long-distance operator, running services between London and northern England, and provides local services throughout the East Midlands. These rail routes run north-south through Loughborough along the Midland Main Line, going south to Bedford, Luton and London; and north to Lincoln, Sheffield, Leeds and York. Junctions at Leicester and Derby stations link with CrossCountry trains route, serving the far north-east of Scotland and the south-west of England.|$|E
50|$|In November 1907 Line 5 was {{extended}} from Gare d'Orléans (now known as Gare d'Austerlitz) to Gare du Nord where {{the station was}} built on a reversing loop. On 21 April 1908 Line 4 was opened from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt through Gare du Nord. In 1942, the old Line 5 station was closed and replaced with a through station, {{in preparation for the}} extension to Église de Pantin. The part of the old loop that was not destroyed during the building of RER Line B in the 1970s together with connecting lines to Lines 2 and 4 under the Boulevard de Magenta and the Rue de Dunkerque are now used for driver training (USFRT). The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> on Line 4 were extended from 75m to 90m in the 1960s during the upgrading of the line for rubber-tyre operations.|$|E
50|$|The IND {{was built}} with longer {{platforms}} {{than those of}} the IRT or BMT. Initial plans called for stations to be built with 660 ft long platforms to accommodate trains of eleven 60 ft cars. However, these lengths were shortened, as stations on the IND Eighth Avenue Line between 72nd Street and 163rd Street - Amsterdam Avenue have lengths of exactly 600 ft. There were two exceptions: 96th Street was 615 ft on both levels, as that was the standard <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> built for the IND after the 1940s. The 81st Street-Museum of Natural History station had an uptown platform that was 630 ft long, and a downtown platform that was 615 ft. Platforms of exactly 600 ft length can also be found on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between Elmhurst Avenue and 67th Avenue.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{crossunder}} about midway {{along the}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platforms,</b> and a lesser-used {{one at the}} north end.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform,</b> {{the railway}} {{are unable to}} {{accommodate}} wheelchair passengers, for health & safety reasons.|$|R
50|$|The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> is 280 m. The station {{premises}} also {{consists of}} 12,250 sq m of open parking area.|$|R
50|$|Kolkata metro has 24 stations, 15 {{of which}} are underground, 7 are {{elevated}} and 2 stations are at grade. All the underground stations have island platforms except Park Street which has side platforms. While all the elevated stations have side platforms, Noapara has island platforms and since {{it will be the}} hub station for Line 1 and Line 4 it has 4 platforms having a length of 182m. The standard <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> in Kolkata Metro is 170m. The metro stations of Gitanjali & Netaji have the shortest platforms of 163m. The average length between any two stations is 1.14 km. The shortest distance is 0.597 km between Central and Chandni Chowk, whereas the longest distance is 2.15 km between Dum Dum and Belgachia. Since the electrification of Kolkata metro is of the 3rd Rail, 750 V DC, electricity substations were built in Jatin Das Park, Central, Shyambazar. The type of tracks are ballast-less with M1A track fittings.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{the nature}} of the line changed {{fundamentally}} with the establishment of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. A preliminary step was {{the construction of a new}} Mosbach station. The old station had been unsatisfactory for a long time. The station was some distance from the inner city and a level crossing at the station often caused congestion on the B 27. After disagreements between the city of Mosbach and Deutsche Bahn over the transfer of the site of the old station for the upgrading of the B 27, an agreement was reached in 1994 over the use of unused infrastructure. The new station, which is about 300 m north of the old station, was opened on 24 March 1997 at the same time as the horticultural show, which was about 100 m away. Its bidirectional platforms are accessible via ramps. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> allows use by trains with a maximum length of five cars. The platform height of 76 cm allowed for the operation of the S-Bahn’s electric multiple units from the beginning. The costs of the construction of the station and relocation of the surrounding streets, amounting to 53.1 million Deutsche Marks, were shared between Deutsche Bahn and the town of Mosbach. The old station was subsequently closed and demolished in 2002.|$|E
30|$|Microscopic rail models, by contrast, {{portray the}} {{networks}} in great detail. They {{take into account}} information concerning tracks (e.g. the number, length and alignment of the block sections, speed, gradient), features of the signalling system (e.g. signal position, release points, permissive occupancy), layout of stations (e.g. number of tracks, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms,</b> shunting yards, points, vehicle depots), characteristics of the rolling stock (e.g. acceleration/deceleration features, tractive/effort diagram, total and adherence load), operational information (e.g. departure/arrival times, routes, alternative platforms, timing points, dwell times, connections between runs) as well as safety conditions. The variation of each attribute leads {{to the creation of}} a new node and hence necessarily of a new link. Such modelling of the infrastructure can be used for operational needs such as calculating travel times, drawing up timetables, detecting probable train conflicts, addressing disruption conditions and testing rescheduling strategies. Hence, they provide very accurate results, albeit requiring the collection of a large amount of data and considerable computational effort.|$|E

5000|$|On 26 April 2014, Scruton station reopened to {{coincide}} with the 60th anniversary of the line's closure to passenger services. A special reopening service was run with Leyland railbus LEV1. By November 2014, although restoration of the building was virtually complete a short <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> was required for construction to bring it into compliance with modern regulations which require platforms to be at least 60 m. The station did not operate until the Wensleydale's eastern terminus at [...] was completed and opened to the public on 22 November 2014.|$|R
