25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E
500|$|In 1992 Megadeth {{released}} Countdown to Extinction, {{which contained}} songs with compact, accessible structures that resulted with strong sales and significant radio airplay. 1994's Youthanasia and 1997's Cryptic Writings followed a similar route, receiving platinum and gold certification respectively, {{with the latter}} spawning three rock-radio hits. Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: [...] "I {{think a lot of}} our success now {{has to do with the}} fact that we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't get the opportunity to go into the market with educated strategy. Fortunately, for us, our management educated us on how to study what's current without <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> integrity and to keep on edge while staying at the forefront of what's important right now." ...|$|E
500|$|After the group's breakup, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford {{decided to}} stay {{together}} and find a new vocalist. [...] "There was talk for a while of us becoming Ozzy Osbourne's backing band, and even Macy Gray's", said Morello. [...] "We informed them that <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> singer was actually a blessing in disguise, and that we had bigger ambitions than being somebody's hired musicians." [...] They eventually teamed up with then-former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell to form Audioslave. The first Audioslave single, [...] "Cochise", was released in early November 2002, and a self-titled debut album followed to mainly positive reviews. Compared to Rage Against the Machine, most of Audioslave's music was apolitical, although some songs touched on political issues. Their second album Out of Exile debuted at the number one position on the Billboard charts in 2005. Audioslave released its third album Revelations on September 5, 2006, but an accompanying tour did not occur as Cornell and Morello were working on solo albums. After months of inactivity and rumors of a breakup, Audioslave disbanded on February 15, 2007, after Cornell announced he was leaving the band.|$|E

500|$|Other {{curriculum}} topics chosen {{during the}} seminar included Arabic culture and heritage, school readiness, health and wellness, and female education. The seminar participants {{decided to use}} MSA, like the producers had done for the original show, citing an even greater need to expose children to the Arabic language. The National, for example, stated, [...] " [...] At a time when Arab children are increasingly deviating from their language and culture because of programming from nations like the United States and India, initiatives like this will help to reverse the trend". Abdulla Al Sharhan, the new show's creative director, agreed: [...] "We are <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> language, and so through Iftah Ya Simsim, we can revive the language {{in such a way}} that a child learns proper Arabic in a fun way". As with the original, outreach was an important part of the new show. Even before the show aired, four characters from the original toured the region, educating young children and their families about road and car safety. The cast and crew took a break from filming for a few months for [...] "constant live events" [...] to interact with their young viewers. Books, DVDs, CDs, online material and outreach programs for children, parents, and teachers were produced.|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them... {{but a lot of people}} just don't like it." [...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done." ...|$|E
500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{begins with}} [...] "Misery". An electropop song with [...] "future-disco beats", the album's third single [...] "captures the {{highs and lows}} of being [...] in love". According to Nicki Gostin, writing for the New York Daily News, the song's lyrics are unclear and either detail Stefani's former {{relationship}} with Rossdale, or her current relationship with Shelton. The track makes several references to love and drugs {{through the use of}} hyperbole and cliches. [...] "You're My Favorite" [...] has [...] "Super Mario 64 cave synths and [...] tinny, trap-adjacent percussion". The song was dubbed [...] "the most 'Stefani-esque'" [...] by Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter magazine, while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media found it comparable to Top 40 music. It was compared to her earlier songs, [...] "Simple Kind of Life", [...] "Underneath It All" [...] and [...] "Serious" [...] by Theon Weber of Spin magazine. The third track, [...] "Where Would I Be?", [...] produced by Kurstin, is a reggae-flavored ska song. Its bridge has a [...] "cheerleader taunt" [...] and, according to Leonie Cooper of NME, it [...] "sounds like she doesn't give a shit". Lyrically it mentions the possibilities of finding love, particularly in the line [...] "Fill up my Solo Cup when I’m feeling so lonely." [...] Weber found similarities between [...] "Where Would I Be?" [...] and Kurstin's earlier work with Lily Allen. The album's second single, [...] "Make Me Like You", is a pop and disco song, written by Stefani, Tranter, Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Fredikkson. After the group completed the track, Stefani commented: [...] "We were <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> minds." [...] Its lyrics detail the [...] "complicated feeling of falling hard when [...] least expect", as well as reflecting Stefani's personal life.|$|E

After being put into bat by Yorkshire, the visitors' fast bowler Matthew Hoggard took two wickets to help reduce them to 33 for 3 when rain put an end to proceedings for the day after 12.3 overs. After the play that was possible, Irish vice-captain Kyle McCallan said, [...] "It was disappointing <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> top three batsmen so early on. But our strength is in our depth of batting. It's {{not the end of the}} world at the moment and we're still hoping to post a total of around 200." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Polish {{unwillingness to}} accept the Soviet {{dangerous}} offer of free entry {{is illustrated by the}} quote of Marshall Edward Rydz-Śmigły, commander-in-chief of the Polish armed forces, who said: [...] "With the Germans we run the risk of <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> liberty. With the Russians we will lose our soul". The attitude of the Polish leadership was also reflected by Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who, apparently confident in the French and British declarations of support, asserted that the security of Poland {{was not going to be}} guaranteed by a [...] "Soviet or any other Russia". The Soviets then turned to concluding the German offer of a treaty and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed. The Soviet-Nazi cooperation had been making progress since May 1939, when Vyacheslav Molotov became the Soviet minister of foreign affairs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{position}} of the Republic of Macedonia regarding the tripartite confederation was widely supported by politicians and intellectuals. Immediately following Milošević's renewed call for a loose confederation between Greece, Serbia, and the Republic of Macedonia, Socialist Party of Macedonia president Kiro Popovski deemed the longstanding proposal as a [...] "present utopia but a feasible future prospect." [...] In 2001, {{former president of the}} Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov noted the wide support for the proposal amongst ethnic Macedonian intellectuals: [...] "This begun when Yugoslavia was beginning to fall apart, when intellectuals and politicians gathered in order to examine the perspectives that we had for our country. Our common position was that a confederation with Greece was the best solution." [...] Macedonian novelist Ante Popovski {{in an interview with the}} French newspaper Libération on 27 March 2001 stated, [...] "I am supporting the idea of a confederation with Greece. We shall not be in danger of <b>losing</b> <b>our</b> identity, because our language is entirely different from the Greek one, while it resembles with the languages of the two other large neighbors, the Serbs and the Bulgarians." ...|$|E

Did we have to <b>lose</b> <b>our</b> independence for 50 years? The answer to these questions is politically incorrect, because Poland was not doomed to fail.
