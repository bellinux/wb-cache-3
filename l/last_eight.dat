5|$|During Grand Duke Gian Gastone's rule, the Governor was {{responsible}} for formal court audiences.

Gian Gastone, however, was immune to these approaches and spent the <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> years of his reign confined to bed, entertained by the myriad Ruspanti.|$|E

5|$|Since {{retiring}} as {{a player}} in 2006, Shearer {{has worked as a}} television pundit for the BBC. In 2009, he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United's manager in the <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> games of their 2008–09 season, in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation. Shearer is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, a Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law of Northumbria and Newcastle Universities.|$|E
5|$|With a {{strengthening}} of the defence, City's form improved further the next season, in 1913–14, coming fourth, two points outside the promotion places. Despite having failed on his promise to get the team promoted within two years, City's rising attendances and resulting better profits for the club kept the directors happy, and the club were confident of promotion in 1914–15. However, the declaration of World War I disrupted Leeds City's season, with attendances down as men signed up to fight. Chapman by now had amassed a very large squad {{and was unable to}} pick a consistent side, continually changing his first-choice lineup. Leeds City lost six of their <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> games of the season to finish just fifteenth.|$|E
5|$|E. J. Mather {{coached the}} team to three Big Ten titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10–13 overall (3–9, Big Ten) record during the 1919–20 season, he led {{the team to}} an 18–4 overall (8–4, Big Ten) record during the 1920–21 season. This 1921 team won its first eight and <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title. The team won {{back-to-back}} championships in 1925–26 and 1926–27. The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14–3 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record. Mather died after a lengthy battle with cancer in August 1928.|$|E

5|$|In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for {{the first}} time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, {{all of which were}} won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing {{regulation}} which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began {{the final day of the}} match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.|$|E
5|$|Linfield's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} in European competition is reaching the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. After beating Aris of Luxembourg and Vålerengen of Norway they faced CSKA Red Flag in the <b>last</b> <b>eight.</b> This {{resulted in a}} 2–2 draw at home and 1–0 defeat away. In the 1984–85 season, after overcoming Shamrock Rovers on away goals (the first and so far only series of meetings between the two Irish superpowers outside all-Ireland tournaments), Linfield faced eventual semi-finalists Panathinaikos in the second round. After a 2–1 defeat in Greece, Linfield raced into a 3–0 lead at half-time in the second leg at Windsor Park. Panathinaikos staged a remarkable comeback {{in the second half}} to level the match at 3-3 and eliminate Linfield 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed {{the chance to go}} top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E

5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47, {{with the}} same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. York endured a midseason run of 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> matches saw them finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of the table by mid September 1947, before a run of two wins from 13 matches saw them drop to 18th place. York finished 1947–48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 {{at the peak of}} the post-war attendance boom. The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures to finish 1948–49 in 14th place.|$|E
5|$|The club {{appointed}} Ian Holloway {{as their}} new manager on 6 January 2014, {{with the club}} sitting 21st in the table. He was given the priority of maintaining their Football League Championship status, which he achieved. Millwall went unbeaten in the <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> games of the 2013–14 season and finished in 19th place, four points above the relegation zone. The following season, Holloway was sacked on 10 March 2015 with the team second from bottom in the Championship, and Neil Harris was reinstated as caretaker manager {{until the end of}} the season. He was unable to ensure survival, however, as Millwall's relegation to League One was confirmed on 28 April with one game of the 2014–15 season still to play. Harris was confirmed as Millwall's permanent manager the next day. In his first full season in charge, Harris led Millwall to a fourth-place finish in League One and a play-off final at Wembley, which the Lions lost 3–1 to Barnsley.|$|E
5|$|The first-ever AAFC {{championship}} {{took place}} on December 22, 1946, at Cleveland Stadium before a crowd of 41,181. Temperatures were in the 30s, which contributed to the low attendance numbers compared to other Browns home games, but the championship game drew more people than all but three NFL championship games up to that point. The Yankees were in close competition with the Browns as the AAFC's leading team, and finished the season by winning seven of their <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> games. The Browns and Yankees had different styles of play: while the Browns used a T formation offense, the Yankees had a single-wing formation. New York's roster included Spec Sanders, who led the AAFC with 709 yards of rushing and 12 touchdowns.|$|E
