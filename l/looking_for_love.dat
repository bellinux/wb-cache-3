5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love</b> and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

Lemke did not notice that instead of sending her trunks to Iowa, where Powers claimed to be living, he sent them to the address of Cornelius O. Pierson of Fairmont, West Virginia. Asta Eicher, her children, and Dorothy Lemke had disappeared with no explanation.|$|E
25|$|Allegations {{of working}} with the Japanese do not seem to have harmed Na's {{reputation}} as one of the founders of Korean cinema either in his own time or in the following decades. Na's funeral procession was led by a band playing Arirang, and was attended by mourning crowds in spite of the rain. The newspaper Chosun Ilbo's November 1938 audience poll for the best silent Korean films put Arirang in the number one spot. Two other films by Na Woon-gyu were also on the top ten list: Sarangul Chajaso (<b>Looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>Love),</b> and Punguna (The Man with Great Ambition) (1926). Na's last film, Omongnyo (1937) was second on the list of best sound films made in Korea.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{returned}} to comedy {{for his next}} project. Setting his standards high, he told himself: [...] "This next film must be an epic! The Greatest!" [...] Inspired by {{a photograph of the}} 1898 Klondike Gold Rush, and later the story of the Donner Party of 1846–47, he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls [...] "an epic comedy out of grim subject matter." [...] In The Gold Rush, the Tramp is a lonely prospector fighting adversity and <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love.</b> With Georgia Hale as his new leading lady, Chaplin began filming the picture in February 1924. Its elaborate production, costing almost $1 million, included location shooting in the Truckee mountains with 600 extras, extravagant sets, and special effects. The last scene was not shot until May 1925, after 15 months of filming.|$|E
500|$|Steve Leftridge from PopMatters {{considered}} the track {{to have a}} [...] "ho-hum" [...] melody. Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2003) and Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). During the chorus, Perry sings about holding out for a love that is [...] "cinematic and dramatic/With the perfect ending" [...] and later asks {{if she is a}} [...] "stupid girl", according to Elysa Gardner from USA Today and an anonymous reviewer for Portrait Magazine. A reviewer for Portrait Magazine, considering it to be the slowest-paced song on Teenage Dream, said it juxtaposed well with the other tracks. [...] "It takes all the energy {{from the rest of the}} album, all the fast beating hearts and overwhelming feelings of love, and slows it all down to a song about <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love</b> instead," [...] they wrote.|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{has said}} that she is {{interested}} in parts of [...] "angst-ridden women" [...] with strong dispositions masking flaws and insecurities. She connects with [...] "women who are either finding {{their way out of}} a situation, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love,</b> having some struggle within love, or questioning the big things in life". She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront your true feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. Then you have to go home and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E

500|$|Stanton {{originally}} {{wanted to}} juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, {{but he saw}} The Triplets of Belleville (2003) {{and did not want}} to appear as if he were copying it. Stanton then thought about the song [...] "Put On Your Sunday Clothes" [...] from Hello, Dolly!, since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love,</b> which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included [...] "It Only Takes a Moment" [...] and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. Hello Dolly! composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story [...] "genius". Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel worked on Hello, Dolly! ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Kapoor starred as {{a runaway}} bride in Dolly Ki Doli, a comedy co-starring Pulkit Samrat, Rajkummar Rao and Varun Sharma. Mints Udita Jhunjhunwala criticised Kapoor's {{performance}} in the film, writing that her [...] "range is too limited to bring alive a character that may have had heaps of potential on paper". Shubhra Gupta wrote: [...] "Kapoor is in almost every frame, and should have filled them all. But {{the treatment of the}} character shows up her limitations." [...] Despite the negative reviews for her performance, she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. While filming SoorajR. Barjatya's Prem Ratan Dhan Payo with Salman Khan in Gondal, Gujarat in February 2015, Kapoor was diagnosed with swine influenza, from which she recovered the following month. Kapoor portrayed Rajkumari Maithili Devi, a princess <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love.</b> The film became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time. She was praised by Rachit Gupta for her credibility as a royal, and Komal Nahta thought that the role was significant enough to be a turning point in her career. However, she won a Golden Kela Award for Worst Actress.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, it was {{confirmed}} by Daniel Kilkelly, a reporter for Digital Spy, that a new storyline would see Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Fatboy spend the night together after he rescues her when she gets unwanted attention from a man. Norwood, who plays Fatboy, told Inside Soap, [...] "Right now, I don't think Fatboy is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love</b> - but he's happy to be swept off his feet by Denise, who's this hot older woman he never imagined he could be with."Denise is a scorching woman - she's got a dynamite body and a beautiful smile. She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age thing, I think she might worry that people were saying things about her. Right now, she's just enjoying herself." [...] Norwood added that while the pair's relationship was sexual, a serious future for them could be possible.|$|E

Longoria, an unknown soap opera actress at the time, stated that prior to her audition, she had not read the entire script. She recounted, [...] "Marc Cherry asks, 'So {{what did you think}} of the script?' like the whole thing. And I said, 'Well I didn’t read the script. I only read my part.'

500|$|Mitchell {{revealed}} that Romeo's relationship with Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) would drift {{apart in the}} event of the [...] "love triangle" [...] storyline. Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would play {{a big part of the}} serial in 2011. He also stated: [...] "Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions." [...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never really had a father figure. There's a lot of looking to belong and <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love</b> because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family. Romeo has some issues of his own. He is struggling with his relationship with Indi. The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding." [...] After Romeo sleeps with Ruby, Mitchell said Romeo immediately regrets it. Ruby then decides to reveals the truth to Indigo. This ruins their friendship and Weaving said: [...] "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!".|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2013, host Ellen DeGeneres asked Cyrus if Bangerz was inspired by her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, to which she replied [...] "the whole album {{is a story of}} that and I think it says that starting with 'Adore You' and ending with 'Someone Else' ..... I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually thought I did at the time." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today thought of [...] "Someone Else" [...] as a more [...] "reflective" [...] lyrical offering from its parent record, while Lipshutz interpreted the track to detail the departure of Cyrus' [...] "past baggage" [...] and the introduction of [...] "her new self". Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer assumed that the song was designed to address her transition from her innocent Hannah Montana image and then-recent breakup with fiance Liam Hemsworth; from a production standpoint, he jokingly referenced Cyrus' earlier single [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] when mentioning that [...] " [...] her party and she can do what she wants", in regards to the increasingly diverse genres she had begun experimenting with. Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood opined that it spoke of the [...] "psychic damage" [...] that comes with prosperity in the entertainment industry. Based on the line [...] "if you're <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>love</b> know that love don't live here anymore" [...] from the refrain, David Drake and David Bry from Complex opined that Cyrus' track was [...] "thematically" [...] similar to [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] by Rose Royce.|$|E
