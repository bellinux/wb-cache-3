50|$|Kerala {{has been}} {{experiencing}} increasing incidents of drought {{in the recent}} past due to the weather anomalies and developmental pressures resulting from the changes in land use, traditional practices, and life style of the people. The increase in population and subsequent expansion in irrigated agriculture, and industrial growth necessitated the exploitation of more water resources. The changes in the land and water management practices affected the fresh water availability during summer months. Although the deviation in the annual rainfall received in Kerala, in any year from the long term average is very small, there is considerable variation in the rainfall availability during the different seasons. About 95 percent of annual rainfall is confined to a six-month monsoon period between June and November, leaving the remaining six months as practically dry. Soman (1988) reported that over major part of the Kerala State, extreme as well as these where the rainfall is more compared to other areas. The changes in rainfall pattern may have association with the environmental modifications due to human interventions on the natural ecosystems. The State of Kerala experiences seasonal drought conditions every year during the summer months. Even in the years of normal rainfall, summer water scarcity problems are severe in the midland and highland regions. Severe drought conditions often result from the anomalies in monsoon rainfall combined with the various anthropogenic pressures. A study on the incidence of droughts based on the aridity index shows that during the period 1871- 2000, the State of Kerala experienced 66 drought years, out of which, twelve each were moderate and severe droughts. The droughts have a large dimension of economic, environmental and social impacts. With the implementation of a number of irrigation projects, the idea of drought in Kerala slowly shifted to unirrigated paddy, and upland crops. The water scarcity in summer is mainly reflected in dry rivers and <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table.</b> This adversely affects the rural and urban drinking water supply. As seen in the majority of drought incidents, even a 20% fall in the northeast monsoon, can make the water scarcity situation worse during the summer. Since the State has more of perennial plantation crops compared to other places of India, the effect of a drought year in Kerala continues to be felt for several more years after it has occurred. Thus, for better planning of the drought management measures, the term drought with reference to plantation crops should be redefined based on rainfall received or available soil moisture during summer months instead of total monsoon rainfall.|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} drought occurrences in {{the study}} area, therefore, have great implications for the household livelihoods. The occurrence of mild drought results in a reduction in crop yield and cattle weight loss, whereas the occurrence of severe drought results in total crop loss, in increased mortality rates of livestock (Abaje et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2015 a, 2015 b). The reduction in crop yield and livestock loss affects revenue generation and household income. Consequently, about 65 % of the total respondents depends primarily on farming, thus increasing drought occurrences affects household revenue generation and food availability {{in the study}} area. Eze et al. (2018) argue that households whose livelihood depends on farming suffer losses during drought because the crop yield and livestock production are reduced and also, the weight and strength of cattle {{for the purpose of}} draught power is drastically reduced. Moreover, the frequent incidences of droughts resulted to the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> and sustenance of few rivers. Thus, developmental projects that depend on water from rivers and groundwater sources suffer a great setback during and after drought. The <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> has a negative effect on the construction of wells and boreholes. This is because the depth of the water table increases, and may not be reached depending on a place, thus reducing water availability for the household uses, particularly those that depend on surface and groundwater sources. Therefore, dependency on agriculture increases the vulnerability of the households to drought. Moreover, persistent and substantial reduction in the provision of ecosystem services {{as a result of the}} incidence of droughts possesses great threats to agricultural productivity.|$|E

The proposed methodology interplays between the major parameters of the system to control saltwater intrusion. These parameters include the soil/aquifer properties, the well locations, the well depths, the rates and the relation between the abstraction and recharge rates which depends on the recovery rate and the salinity degree.

40|$|Introduction of {{the large}} gravity {{irrigation}} system in the Indus Basin {{in the late nineteenth}} century without a drainage system resulted in a rising water table, which resulted in water logging and salinity problems over large areas. In order to cope with the salinity and water logging problem, the Pakistan government initiated installation of 10, 000 tube wells in different areas. This not only resulted in the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> but also supplemented irrigation. Resulting benefits from the irrigation opportunities motivated framers to install private tube wells. The Punjab area meets 40 % of its irrigation needs from groundwater abstraction. Today, farmers apply both surface water flows and groundwater from tube wells, creating a pattern of private and public water control. Sustainable use of groundwater needs proper quantification of the resource and information on processes involved in its recharge and discharge. The field work in the Lagar irrigated area, discussed in this paper, show that within the general picture of conjunctive use of canal water and groundwater, there is a clear spatial pattern between upstream and downstream areas, with upstream areas depending much less on groundwater than downstream areas. The irrigation context in the study area proves to be highly complex, with water users having differential access to canal and tube well water, resulting in different responses of farmers with their irrigation strategies, which in turn affect the salinity and water balances on the fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} impact of large-scale groundwater abstraction on the shallow groundwater and crop production within the Keta Strip was examined. The assessment was based on geophysical data, data on groundwater quality, soils, irrigation water requirement and hydrogeology of the Strip. The {{results indicate that the}} shallow groundwater can support only medium to high salt tolerant crops. This is consistent with the medium salt tolerant crops especially shallot and onion currently grown in the area. Large-scale irrigation of the Strip will require at least 2 x 107 m 3 of water during the dry season. Abstraction of such large volume of water from the shallow aquifer will result in the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> by approximately 1. 0 m per year. The consequence of this will be the up coning of the fresh/saline water interface probably by as much as 4. 7 m, resulting in salinisation of the fresh water lenses particularly around the lagoon end where most of the shallot farms are situated. Apart from up conning, salinisation may result from ingress of brackish/saline water from the lagoon and sea into the fresh water lenses. Though post irrigation rainfall will be adequate to nullify the water table depression, once the fresh water is contaminated, it is extremely difficult to decontaminate. Consequently, the shallow groundwater will evolve from medium through high to very high salinity hazard to crops. Specific ions toxicity will also increase due to increment in the concentrations of individual ions. Thus, the previously freshwater will become unsuitable for the production of even high salt tolerance crops. This will effectively halt the lucrative shallot and other vegetable farming in the Keta Strip and thus signify socio-economic disaster for the Keta Strip in particular and Ghana in general...|$|E
40|$|Hard rock {{aquifers}} for {{the purpose}} of this Paper mean the non-carbonate, fractured rock aquifers in the terrain covered by crystalline basement complex, metamorphic rocks and also by extensive effusive volcanic rocks like the basalts of western India (Deccan traps. Ground water development in hard rock aquifer areas has always played a secondary role compared to that in the areas having high-yielding unconsolidated or semi-consolidated sediments and carbonate rocks. This has been due to the relatively poor ground water resources in hard rocks, low specific capacity of wells, erratic variations and discontinuities in the aquifer properties, and difficulties in exploration and assessment of the resource. It should, however, be remembered that for the millions of farmers in developing countries, having their small farms in the barren landscape of fractured hard rock terrain, whatever small supply available from these poor aquifers is the only hope for upgrading their standard of living by growing irrigated crops or by protecting their rain-fed crops from the vagaries of rainfall. It is also their only source for drinking water for the family and cattle. In many developing countries, hard rock hydrogeologists have therefore, an important role to play. In the developed countries, the interest in hard rock hydrogeology, apart from drinking water supplies to small communities, is recently promoted by the prospects of using these low permeability rocks for the storage of hazardous nuclear and chemical wastes. The study of ground water flow through faults, fissures and fractures is also of interest to scientists studying the migration of contaminants. Hard rock hydrogeologists, the world over, are therefore divided into two main groups: Those interested in obtaining ground water for domestic, irrigational or industrial use by exploring fractured and permeable zones in a relatively less permeable matrix of hard rock and those interested in locating impermeable or the least permeable zones for storage of hazardous nuclear waste. Ironically, for the first group even the most permeable zones are often not good enough to yield adequate water supply, while for the second group even the least permeable zones are often not good enough for safe storage of hazardous nuclear waste over a prolonged period of a few hundred years. This Paper discusses the occurrence of ground water and the precautions for sustainable development of ground water in arid and semi-arid regions, in view of the forthcoming climatic changes. It emphasizes the need for recharge augmentation hand-in-hand with development of new wells, so that the new development does not harm the traditional practices. In India, the neglect of recharge augmentation has caused <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> and drying-up of old dug-wells of 12 m to 15 m depth, which used to provide irrigational and drinking water supply for last several centuries. In Iran, many Qanats have dried up because of <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> due to heavy pumping of ground water from newly developed deep tube-wells in their vicinity. The goal in many countries has, therefore, shifted from ground water development to ground water management which includes management of the quantity on Supply side and Demand side and also the management of ground water quality, especially with respect to pollution and salt water intrusion. Pollution of ground water in urban environment is becoming a cause of worry because in many developing countries there is a heavy migration of population from rural areas to urban centers and providing safe quality of drinking water to this population and managing the waste water generated in the cities and towns, is a major problem.

Eastern and Northern part of CRB is dominantly occupied by Hornblende gneiss, Quartz mica gneiss and Charnockite and is characterised by {{high degree of}} slope. Central part of the basin which is occupied by Pink granitic gneiss, Pyroxene granulite and Hornblende gneiss shows gentler slope. The Dd of Chalakudy drainage basin, {{as well as those}} of the five sub basins, reveals that the sub surface strata are highly resistant and permeable. This is a characteristic feature of coarse drainage as the density values are < 5.0. The study reveals that {{the drainage}} area of the basin is passing through an early mature stage of the fluvial geomorphic cycle. Lower-order streams mostly dominate the basin. The development of stream segments in the basin area is more or less affected by rain fall. High values of elongation ratio indicated that the denudational process plays an important role in controlling the shape of the basin. The mean Rb value (4.69) indicates that the drainage pattern is not much influenced by geological structures. The low values of bifurcation ratios and very low value of drainage densities indicate that the drainage has not been affected by structural disturbances and also that the area is covered under dense vegetation cover. Relief ratio indicates that the discharge capability of the watersheds is very high and ground water potential is meagre. These studies are very useful for rainwater harvesting and watershed management plans. First- and second-order streams are not useful for constructing check dams in the study area because the streams are situated on high elevated area with steep slope. The state of Kerala is densely populated and the unscientific landuse practices in the drainage basin enhance the runoff rate and hinder the rate of infiltration. This causes <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> level particularly during extreme summer seasons. This is posing a threat to water security in the region and the state in general. At this context more check dams and water conservation practices are very relevant in a state like Kerala.

Unscientific sand mining must be restricted to day time and prohibited during peak monsoon months. Violations of rules and regulations pertaining to river sand mining must be dealt with meticulously and severe punishment be imposed to the offenders.

Soil samples used in this study were collected from Kojima 7 Polder B Section, A Section and Kojima 3 ・ 5 Polder. 7 Polder B Section is located in a recently empoldered virgin region. Ages of 7 Polder A Section and 3 ・ 5 Polder under paddy cultivation are 5 years and about 10 years, respectively. The results obtained are to be summarized as follows: (1) Ground water contains a large amount of soluble salts and its table is very high in a recently empoldered region. As paddy cultivation proceeds, a continuous decrease in salinity and <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> are observed in well drained fields. On the contrary, salinity and water table remain unchanged in poorly drained fields along the dike. (2) The content of soluble salt in recently empoldered soils is also very high in all the horizons. A considerable part of soluble salt has been washed cut from the upper layer during 5 year cultivation by rain or irrigation water, and most of surface soils show the electric conductivity of less than 7 millimhos/cm, but salinity of subsoils remains unchanged, having 7 millimhos/cm or more. After about 10 year cultivation, all of the first horizon and most of the second horizon show a marked reduction of salinity, having the electric conductivity of less than 4 millimhos/cm and 7 millimhos/cm, respectively. (3) The reaction of all the horizons of just empoldered soils lies within the range pH 7. 0 to 8. 1 but that of most surface soils becomes slightly acid, after 5 year cultivation, and considerably acid after about 10 year cultivation, showing the pH of 6. 0 - 6. 9 and below 5. 9, respectively. (4) Of exchangeable bases, mono-valent cations and Mg are more prominent than others, and the base-exchange complex is nearly saturated with bases in just empoldered soils. It is shown that the V values and exchangeable mono-valent cations are decreased slightly in surface soils but remain unchanged in subsoils during 5 year cultivation. After about 10 year cultivation, mono-valent cations and Mg are replaced by hydrogen, and V values decrease greatly in surface soils and the composition of the exchangeable bases gradually approaches to that of normal acid soil. (5) A large amount of oxidizable sulfur is found in all the horizons of just empoldered soils and a considerable decrease of oxidizable sulfur in surface soils is found after 5 year cultivation, but a marked decrease of oxidizable sulfure in all the horizons is found after about ten year cultivation. It is shown that oxidizable sulfur is rapidly oxidized in a field condition and its product is easily leached out. A relatively close correlation is also found to exist between the degree of desalting and the decrease of oxidizable sulfur...|$|E
