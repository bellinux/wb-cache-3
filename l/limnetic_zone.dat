They were not seen in many of the Great Lakes until the late 1800s and early 1900s, although they are suspected to be endemic to Lake Erie, reaching it after the last ice age. Gizzard shad typically live in lakes and reservoirs, although they can live in rivers and streams, and brackish waters. They reside in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone,</b> and can comprise up to 80% of fish biomass in certain lake systems. They prefer shallow lakes with muddy bottoms and relatively high turbidity. This may be due in part to their breeding preferences, but it probably arises from {{the fact that they have}} lower survival rates in clear waters and waters with high vegetative cover.|$|E
50|$|Lake {{ecosystems}} can {{be divided}} into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure). The first, the littoral zone, is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur. The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone. In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them. In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones. Some systems use other names. The off shore areas may be called the pelagic zone, the photic zone may be called the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> and the aphotic zone may be called the profundal zone. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a riparian zone which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.|$|E

It has an {{extension}} of 541 ha. and a depth of 65 m and its tributaries are the Chavarría, Las Moras, El Chorro and Singuil rivers. The climate is mild with dry winters and rainy summers. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize physicochemical parameters in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> of the dam and the mouths of the tributaries to determine the water quality. METHODS: Seasonal sampling was carried out between August 2010 and May 2012. Temperature, transparency, pH and electrical conductivity were field measured, whereas dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), major ion constituents and nitrogen and phosphate compounds were analyzed at the laboratory. RESULTS: The water was classified as sodium-calcium-bicarbonate with neutral to alkaline pH, and thermal stratification during spring and summer. The water assayed was well oxygenated except for the bottom of the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> during the summer months. Lowest transparency was measured in the El Chorro River in November 2011 (0. 12 m) and highest degree of transparency in the Singuil River during the winter of 2010 (4. 1 m). The waters assayed showed weak mineralization with conductivities between 83 and 218 &# 181;S. cm- 1. Maximum BOD 5 value (183 mg. L- 1) was measured in the Singuil River in spring 2010. Highest values for the different nitrogen compounds were as follows: 7 mg NO 3 -. L- 1 at the bottom of the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> in August 2010, 0. 07 mg NO 2 -. L- 1 in the Las Moras River in May 2011 and 1. 8 mg NH 4 +. L- 1 in the Chavarría River in March 2011. During the summer of 2012 orthophosphate reached a value of 0. 22 mg.

40|$|Abstract Environmental {{complexity}} {{is considered}} a key factor for diversity enhancement in aquatic ecosystems. Macrophyte stands are a major contributor for this complexity due to their differential architectures. Nevertheless, the influence of distinct aquatic habitat architectures (with different types of macrophytes or without them) on microcrustaceans&# 8217; taxa composition, usually found in macrophyte colonized water bodies, is underexplored in limnological studies. The main objective {{of this study was}} to analyze this influence by comparing the Cladocera composition among four habitat architectures: (1) fluctuant macrophytes, (2) rooted emergent macrophytes, (3) submerged macrophytes and (4) the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> of oxbow lakes associated to a large subtropical reservoir. Wide compositional variation was observed. Fluctuant macrophytes exhibited the richest Cladocera assemblage, dominated by Chydoridae.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{study of}} the distribution, {{relative}} abundance and diet of fishes sympatric with juvenile sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum), within the freshwater nursery areas of the Naknek River system was undertaken from 1961 to 1963. The study {{was part of an}} extensive investigation to determine what factors in the freshwater environment were limiting the size of the populations of sockeye salmon returning to the rivers of Bristol Bay, Alaska. The speties found associated with juvenile salmon in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zones</b> of the Naknek system were the pond smelt, Hypomesus olidus (Pallas); the least cisco, Coregonus sardinella Valenciennes; the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus; and the ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (Linnaeus). Life history information was collected for these sympatric species. Tow nets were used to capture samples of fish from the limnetic portions of the nursery areas. Some samples were collected by beach seines, lake traps and otter trawls. Plankton samples were collected and compared to the diets of the limnetic fishes. Although some confusion has existed in the literature, I concluded that pond smelt of the Naknek system belong to Hypomesus olidus (Pallas). The populations of smelt were comprised of six age-groups in the late summer, but most specimens belonged to three age-groups. Most members of the species spawn in the spring of the fourth year of life. The estimated fecundity ranged from 900 to 4, 300 eggs per female. Seven age-groups of least ciscoes were present in the populations of the Naknek system. The species in the Naknek system probably spawned {{for the first time in}} the fall of their fourth year. The estimated fecundity of two specimens was 4, 006 and 14, 380 eggs. Populations of three spine stickleback were comprised of three age-groups of fish. I was unable to assign ages to ninespine stickleback. Estimates of the fecundity of the species ranged from 116 to 456 eggs per female. All species studied were distributed throughout the Naknek system. The relative abundance of the fishes studied was variable between and within nursery areas and from year to year. The population densities of pond smelt and threespine stickleback were larger in the surface waters compared to the deep waters. The relative abundance of sockeye fry, yearlings and ninespine stickleback was greater in the surface stratum rather than the deep stratum in most nursery areas. The five main food items utilized by these limnetic species were cladocerans (Bosmina sp. and Daphnia sp.); copepods (cyclopoid copepods and Diaptomus sp.); and Dipteran insects. Analysis of the similarity of diets indicated that the diets of sockeye fry and pond smelt were more similar than were the diets of sockeye fry or yearlings and any other sympatric species. The diet of sockeye fry was more similar to that of either species of stickleback than was the diet of sockeye yearlings. An analysis of the food of various sizes of each species of fish indicated the diets of three age-groups of smelt were more similar than the diets of various age-groups of any other fish. The food composition of three age-groups of ciscoes and two size groups of both species of stickleback showed a strong positive correlation. The diets of sockeye fry and yearlings showed the weakest positive correlation of the species studied. All species of fish studied selectively fed on one or more components of the zooplankton. Daphnia sp. and cyclopoid copepods were strongly selected in Lake Coville. Cyclopoids were selected in South Bay. Bosmina sp. was selected from the waters of West End. In Lake Coville, the greatest potential competition for food probably existed between the large populations of pond smelt and sockeye fry. In the West End nursery area, potential competition between juvenile salmon and both species of stickleback may not be severe, depending on the age composition of the salmon population present in the nursery area. The possibility exists that the relatively low numbers of adult sockeye salmon returning to the comparatively rich lakes of the Naknek River system is due to the presence of large populations of sympatric species of fish. Each of these sympatric species feed on the same general types of food organisms as do the juvenile salmon and may affect the numbers of young salmon that leave the lake, and subsequently return from the ocean...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate whether the distribution of structural attributes of rotifers in reservoirs in the semiarid region is more strongly influenced by abiotic or biotic environmental factors (density of cyanobacteria). MethodSampling occurred in two reservoirs in the Paraíba Basin, northeastern Brazil (Poções and Camalaú) during April and June 2012. Eight sampling points were distributed at two stations in each reservoir: the region near the entrance of the main tributary and region of the dam and collections were made in the <b>limnetic</b> and littoral <b>zone</b> in every season. To assess the abiotic influence and density of cyanobacteria in the distribution of the structural attributes of rotifers, environmental variables bivariate correlation was conducted in series. ResultsIn Poções reservoir, the distribution of rotifer biomass was negatively related to the density of cyanobacteria; among the environmental variables, chlorophyll-a and total nitrogen were negatively related to all of the tested structural attributes, while the concentrations of total phosphorus were strongly related to the abundance of rotifers. In the Camalaú reservoir, the biomass was a structural attribute with a stronger correlation to the density of cyanobacteria; between the environmental variables and Egeria densa, nitrate was negatively related to all of the attributes tested, while transparency was moderately related to the abundance, biomass and richness as well as Chara sp. with abundance. ConclusionsAssemblages of rotifers are more clearly related to environmental conditions, especially those indicative of trophic conditions, despite the density of cyanobacteria having been a factor that was positively related to the structural characteristics of rotifers and thus indicative of such structural assemblies.

40|$|Microfaunal {{communities}} were studied in littoral (inshore) and limnetic (offshore) {{areas of the}} lower basin in Lake Mead to compare species composition and abundance between the two zones. Planktonic forms (zooplankton) dominated inshore and offshore habitats and the occurrence of littoral species was low. Therefore, high similarity in zooplankton species composition was found among all sampling stations. This was perhaps due to two main factors: (i) the physical and chemical environment among the stations were very similar and (ii) the lack of aquatic vegetation in the littoral zone reduced the occurrence of littoral species. Although species composition did not vary a great deal, there were large differences in average zooplankton densities between sampling stations. This was most likely {{due to differences in}} the amount of algal biomass and fish predation. The more productive station in inner Las Vegas Bay showed a higher relative algal biomass and a higher average density of zooplankton (about 118. 1 - 1) than other sampling stations. In middle Las Vegas Bay, average zooplankton densities (44. 1 - 1 in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> and 80. 1 - 1 in the littoral zone) and relative algal biomass were less than inner Las Vegas Bay. Boulder Basin had the lowest relative algal biomass and, therefore, lowest average zooplankton densities (about 23. 1 - 1 in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> and 37. 1 - 1 in the littoral zone) of any location. Relative abundance of fish increased at sampling areas in late spring and summer when fishes migrated from deeper areas of the reservoir to the surface waters to spawn. Adult planktivorous fishes and newly hatched young then decimated zooplankton populations causing low summer zooplankton densities.

The fish species that included microcrustaceans in their diets were juveniles caught in the littoral. Aquatic insects, plant fragments, and detritus were their major dietary items, microcrustaceans representing a minor item. Planktonic copepods contributed more to the diet of chaoborid larvae than planktonic cladocerans. Fish preyed on planktonic microcrustaceans, as well as on benthic and macrophyte-associated species.

40|$|In the limnetic {{zones of}} small, highly {{productive}} reservoirs, young-of-year (YOY) gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) or threadfin shad (D. petenense) (henceforth, shad) often attain high densities during spring. Environmental factors facilitating early {{growth and survival}} of shad plus potential interspecific competition for zooplankton may reduce growth and survival of YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), another common species in reservoirs. We hypothesized that fewer YOY bluegill moving from the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> to the littoral zone in late spring probably slows or prevents the ontogenetic switch to piscivory by YOY largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), reducing their oversummer growth, overwinter survival, and hence recruitment to their second year. To determine whether shad and bluegill abundances indeed vary inversely in reservoirs, we quantified densities of YOY shad and bluegill in four reservoirs across several years (1987 – 1994; N = 22 reservoir-years). To assess how YOY bluegill abundance influenced the ontogenetic dietary switch to fish by largemouth bass, we conducted experiments with differing levels of realism and control (4 -m 2 littoral cages, 4. 5 -m 2 outdoor pools, and 0. 33 -m 2 laboratory aquaria). In reservoirs, peak YOY bluegill density declined weakly in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> but strongly in the littoral zone when peak limnetic YOY Dorosoma spp. exceeded 10 individuals/m 3. In pools and aquaria, largemouth bass grew more rapidly at ≥ 3 than at zero bluegill per largemouth bass. Using known temperatures and largemouth bass growth in a bioenergetics model, we discovered that YOY largemouth bass in pools and aquaria ate ≤ 65 % of their maximum daily consumption potential (in grams of wet mass) at ≥ 6 bluegill per largemouth bass. In cages, largemouth bass consumed only 40 % of their maximum and grew less at bluegill abundances {{similar to those in}} pools and aquaria, probably because dense vegetation and depletion of bluegill inhibited predatory success. In reservoirs with abundant shad, reduced littoral bluegill density likely compromises first-year growth and recruitment of largemouth bass. However, variable abiotic and biotic factors may modify YOY bluegill abundance and hence invalidate our predictions for largemouth bass recruitment success. To better predict fish community structure and develop management actions for reservoir ecosystems, multi-scale experimentation should be combined with whole-system manipulations (e. g., via adaptive management) to bound these variable interactions...|$|E

The Caeté River Estuary was characterized by high spatial {{and temporal}} variations in salinity (0. 8 - 37. 2 ‰).

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{investigate}} if microcrustaceans undergo diel horizontal migration (DHM) in a tropical shallow lake on a yearly basis and analyse the adaptive value regarding predation. Abundance of invertebrate predators, chaoborid larvae and water mites, and microcrustaceans (cladocerans and copepods) were evaluated on a monthly basis in three stations located on a transect during the day and at night. Both invertebrate predators were predominantly pelagic. Cladocerans did not undergo significant DHM, distributing indistinctly onshore and offshore or being mostly pelagic. Nauplii, copepodites of two copepod species and adults of Tropocyclops prasinus meridionalis Kiefer were mostly distributed offshore, and did not perform DHM. The limnological features (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and conductivity) were suitable for the organisms in both zones of the lake. Algal food concentration was a little lower in the littoral than in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> during the day, but it seems to be suitable for the organisms. However, as the algae quality was not evaluated, it is not possible to be conclusive concerning its influence.

40|$|O presente estudo tem por objetivo {{investigar}} a importância relativa do fitoplâncton como recurso alimentar para o zooplâncton em um reservatório hipereutrófico tropical. Para atingir esta meta, dois enfoques foram adotados. O primeiro deles consistiu num monitoramento regular (mensal) dos teores de biomassa do zooplâncton e das suas fontes de alimento expressas em termos de biomassa de carbono de partículas sestônicas. O segundo enfoque consistiu numa abordagem experimental com o objetivo de determinar o balanço entre a produção primária e o consumo de carbono orgânico na comunidade planctônica do reservatório. Tal avaliação deu-se através da mensuração simultânea das taxas de produção primária líquida potencial do fitoplâncton e das taxas de assimilação da comunidade mesozooplanctônica, derivadas a partir das taxas de respiração. A produção primária foi estimada em duas frações distintas: a) 50 - 160 µm e b) The basic aim of {{the present}} investigation {{was related to the}} question: How important is the phytoplankton as a food resource for zooplankton in a tropical hypereutrophic reservoir? For answering this question, two different approaches were adopted. The first one included a regular monitoring program aimed to follow the composition and biomass of zooplankton as well as the major food resources, expressed in terms of C-biomass of sestonic particles. A second approach included the experimental determination of the balance between production and consumption of organic carbon in the planktonic community of Pampulha Reservoir. This was done through simultaneous determination of maximum potential primary production and assimilation rates of mesozooplankton estimated from respiration rates. The algal production was evaluated considering two different size fractions: a) nanno- (< 50 µm) and b) net phytoplankton (50 - 160 µm). The respiration of zooplankton community was restricted to larger organisms (mesozooplankton). These rates were determined at the laboratory under optimal conditions of illumination and temperature. Field data from the monitoring program showed that the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> of the reservoir supported a relatively low algal biomass for most parts of the seasonal cycle (< 30 µg. L- 1). Except the short term algal (Microcystis spp.) blooming periods, chlorophyll-a concentrations in the water column remained at relatively low levels. The annual range of chlorophyll-a was 0 - 126 µg. L- 1. Furthermore, field data also indicated that the bulk of the sestonic carbon was concentrated on non-pigmented particles. Evidences from laboratory suggested that the carbon demand of zooplankton could not be supplied by primary producers from the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> alone. The potential primary production ranged from low to moderate values (2. 0 - 37. 3 mgC. m- 3 h- 1) and, as a consequence, assimilation rates of zooplankton remained higher than algal production (< 50 µm) for most parts of the year. Considering these evidences from field and laboratory, this study concludes that the energetic demand of (meso) zooplankton was, to a large extent, supplied by the detrital food chain...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The present {{contribution}} aims at {{the description}} of a new species of the genus Schizopera. Materials and methods. Water samples were collected in littoral areas with mangrove and macrophytes, and in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone.</b> Twenty five liters of water were taken. Water samples were filtered with a zooplankton net (45 µm) and preserved in 70 % ethanol. The filtered samples were concentrated to 100 ml and examined in a Bogorov camera. Copepods were separated. Observations and drawings of S. evelynae sp. nov. were made at a magnification of 1000 X. Results. Schizopera evelynae sp. nov. seems to be closely related to S. giselae Jiménez-Álvarez 1988 and to S. pratensis Noodt 1958 based on the armature formula of P 1 -P 4, but can be separated from these two species based on the relative length of P 1 ENP, length/width ratio of P 1 ENP 2, relative length of the outer proximal and distal spines on P 4 EXP 3, shape of the exopod and relative length of the exopodal setae of the female P 5, shape and length/width ratio of the male P 2 ENP 2, and male P 5 baseoendopodal lobe:exopod length ratio. A key to the species of Schizopera from America is given. Conclusion. A new species of the genus Schizopera is described.

Because relative timing of appearance of shad and bluegills probably influences their relative success, we quantified densities of fish larvae and zooplankton during spring through summer in three reservoirs across 8 years (1987 – 1994), and we conducted three hatchery experiments with varying larval appearance times and gizzard shad densities {{in plastic bags}} (1 m 3). When shad were abundant in reservoirs, bluegill abundance often peaked either {{at the same time}} (36 % of reservoirs and years combined) or after (40 % of reservoirs and years combined) shad peaks. When gizzard shad were placed in bags 2 weeks before bluegills (N � 1 experiment), they depleted zooplankton, reducing growth (� 0. 075 g·g � 1 ·d � 1) but not survival of bluegills. In experiments (N � 2) in which both species were added simultaneously, zooplankton declined only slightly with gizzard shad, and there was little effect on bluegill growth (� 0. 21 g·g � 1 ·d � 1) and survival; in general, gizzard shad growth declined with time and increasing gizzard shad density.

40|$|Juvenile sculpin (Cottus extensus) {{less than}} 30 mm long exhibit a diel {{vertical}} migration in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> of Bear Lake (Utah-Idaho). Using mid-water and bottom trawls {{we found that}} these fish inhabit {{the bottom of the}} lake (5 ° C) during the day but migrate 30 – 40 m into the water column at night where they reside in the metalimnion or epilimnion at temperatures near 13 – 16 °C. Larger fish do not migrate into the water column. Stomach analyses demonstrated that the young-of-the-year fish do not migrate into the water column to feed: from July to October their diet is 70 – 93 % benthic ostracods and copepods, and pelagic prey are rarely consumed. Furthermore, gut fullness of the sculpin increases through the daylight period and decreases through the night, reaching minimum levels just before the dawn descent. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the diel migration would increase digestion rate from 3 %/h at profundal temperatures, to 22 %/h in the warmer surface water, thus allowing the fish to empty their guts overnight and permit feeding the following day. Additionally, sculpin held in a temperature and feeding regime that mimicked that experienced by migrating fish grew 300 % faster than those reared at 5 ° C. Given the overwhelming importance of fast growth for juvenile fishes, a post-feeding thermotaxs that increases digestion may be a common phenomenon increasing growth, and affecting the distribution and bioenergetic relationships of fish...|$|E

Daily samplings were performed in <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> of both lakes {{during the rainy season}} immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake‐river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied.

40|$|Abstract Predator-prey {{interactions}} {{involving an}} aquatic insect and zooplanktonic prey {{of different sizes}} were investigated to quantify prey mortality exposed to predators. Laboratory experiments were undertaken with the young and adult gerrid Rheumatobates crassifemur to test predation and size selectivity on the cladocerans Daphnia gessneri, Ceriodaphnia richardi, and Bosmina tubicen. Population fluctuations and spatial distribution of the gerrid were also evaluated in a small and shallow Brazilian lake throughout 12 months in fortnightly samples. The insects were more abundant in the littoral (mean density 7. 0 ± 1. 2 ind. m– 2) compared to the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone.</b> The period with the highest densities was late January to June, in both zones. Predation by young instars on Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia was significant (mean ingestion rate of 1. 3 ± 0. 1 D. gessneri and 0. 7 ± 0. 1 C. richardi per predator per hour). Adult insect fed only the large-sized prey (mean ingestion rate of 1. 0 ± 0. 1 D. gessneri per predator per hour). Young gerrids have greater potential to prey on cladocerans than adults, and size selectivity occurred for both predators. Preference of adults by the larger prey is probably related to difficulties in manipulating smaller planktonic prey, such as Ceriodaphnia. Due to higher densities of insects in the littoral, higher predation on zooplankton in this zone is expected. This study does contribute {{to a better understanding}} of trophic interactions in tropical shallow lakes and is the first to investigate predation of a gerrid on cladocerans in laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of {{water quality and}} fish assemblages has been poorly documented in European reservoirs, despite being important for water management and ecological monitoring. We sampled the fish assemblages of 14 Spanish reservoirs by boat electrofishing in the littoral and multi-mesh gillnets in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone.</b> Simultaneously, we assembled eight physical descriptors and we measured 20 water quality features of the reservoirs. Multivariate analysis (ordination methods and generalised additive models) showed that altitude and trophic state (indicated by chlorophyll or nutrient concentrations) independently explained most of the variation of fish assemblages in these reservoirs. The most eutrophic reservoirs were dominated by common carp (Cyprinus carpio) whereas oligotrophic reservoirs presented other fish species intolerant to pollution rather native (such as brown trout, Salmo trutta). The absolute and relative abundance of common carp was strongly related to the trophic state of the reservoir and 40 % of its variation was explained by total phosphorous concentration. Despite clear changes in species composition, {{there was no significant}} effect of water quality on overall fish richness or Shannon's diversity, suggesting that for such low richness assemblages species composition is a better indicator of cultural eutrophication of reservoirs than fish diversityThis study was financed by the Catalan Water Agency (ACA), Government of Catalonia (CT 02003134).

40|$|Seasonal {{shifts in}} calcium {{carbonate}} solution equilibria in the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> of Lake Constance were documented between 1981 and 1983. Except during mixing times, lake water was supersaturated {{with respect to}} calcite; epilimnetic supersaturation maxima were closely related to changes in pH. Sedimentation of calcium from the lower boundary of the euphotic zone to the lake bottom was also assessed. The daily sedimentation flux for calcium during the season varied over three orders of magnitude. Differences in the calcium content of sediments trapped at various depths were insignificant. Sedimentation rates of titanium were used as tracers for the fluxes of calcium bound on allochthonous elastic material. Lacustrine calcite precipitation (39 - 49 % of the total sedimentation rate) was obtained by subtracting fluxes of allochthonous Ca from the rates of total Ca sedimentation. Calcium supersaturation maxima were not in phase seasonally with maximum fluxes of autochthonous Ca. Instead, calcite precipitation {{was associated with the}} occurrence of Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Fragilaria crotonensis, Asterionella formosa, Chlorella sp., Pandorina morum, and Mougeotia thylespora, indicating that calcite formation was triggered by heterogeneous nucleation induced by certain algal species: Autochthonous formation and subsequent precipitation of calcium carbonate is an important process in the carbon and calcium cycling in many hard waters. Through coprecipitation calcium carbonates affect nutrient budgets (Rossmann 1980; Rossknecht 1980; Murphy et al. 1983) and by adsorption they remove dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the water (Suess 1970; Chave and Suess 1970; Otsuki and Wetzel 1972).

Abundance of O. nerka varied among the four lakes containing this species (12, 500 – 257, 000) and varied between years in Redfish Lake (86, 400 in 1994 and 241, 000 in 1992) and Alturas Lake (230, 000 in 1991 and 257, 000 in 1992). In Alturas Lake, where piscivore densities were high and zooplankton densities were low, small acoustic targets (≤ 18 cm long) were nearly absent from the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone</b> during daylight, and high densities remained in colder intermediate depths (15 – 30 m) during crepuscular and nocturnal periods. In Redfish Lake, where predator density was much lower and zooplankton density was higher, targets concentrated in schools at 25 – 30 m during daylight, dispersed into the upper 10 m at dusk, then were broadly distributed over the upper 30 m at night. In Pettit and Stanley lakes, nocturnal distributions of smaller (3 – 7 cm) and intermediate (7 – 18 cm) target sizes were skewed toward the epilimnion, and larger targets remained in the metalimnion or upper hypolimnion. The different diel vertical distribution patterns suggested that juvenile O. nerka exposed to limited food and high predation risk consumed smaller rations and maximized bioenergetic efficiency. Populations with higher food supplies and exposed to lower piscivore densities exploited the higher epilimnetic prey densities and temperatures at night and crepuscular periods to maximize growth but deviated further from bioenergetic efficiency. Populations responded differently to the unique combination of constraints that limit potential sockeye salmon smolt production at each lake.

40|$|A {{study of}} the feeding and {{movement}} patterns of largemouth bass in Alamo Lake, Arizona, using stomach analysis, ultra-sonic telemetry and echo-location revealed that feeding is an important determinant {{of the behavior of}} individuals and of their composition. The diurnal foraging activity showed a circadian rhythm associated with dawn, dusk, and mobility of prey. The size and type of prey consumed was largely influenced by the size and hunger state of the predator and by the prevailing environmental conditions. All sizes of bass fed mostly on shad, but the quantities consumed were influenced by the avail- ability of alternate prey and location of shad. Foraging mode and habitat selection were influenced by size and shape of bass and their metabolic requirements, whereby, the juveniles (≤ 25. 0 cm) and adults (≥ 40. 7 cm) haunted the littoral zone, but the medium size bass (25. 1 - 40. 6 cm) occupied the <b>limnetic</b> <b>zone.</b> The diel movements of feeding caused segregation of sizes which in turn enhanced their utilization of the more abundant resources at the most opportune times. For example, during floods, bass moved en masse into the littoral zone to feed on the abundant food caused by allochthonous enrichment, but during draw-down, only the medium size bass migrated into the deeper waters to seek out the limnetic shad leaving the juveniles and larger adults in the littoral zone. Although the movements and feeding of largemouth bass in Alamo Lake may not be thoroughly explained by any single environmental factor, of the variables measured, water temperature, oxygen and turbidity seem to be the most important. Likewise, the high perennial production of bass in the lake may not be attributed solely to (1) the enormous addition of allochthonous nutrients during floods, (2) the concentration of prey during the draw-down, or (3) a high primary production that, in turn, sustains a high secondary production, but to a combination of all these variables interacting in different ways during different seasons...|$|E
