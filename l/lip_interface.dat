40|$|Fracture {{experiments}} in a high-strength ductile steel (2. 3 Ni- 1. 3 Cr- 0. 17 C) were conducted under static and dynamic loading conditions in a three-point bend and a one-point bend configurations. A qualitative {{description of the}} influence of loading rate on the microscopic features of the fracture surfaces and their role in the fracture initiation process was considered. The fracture surfaces consist of tunneled region and shear lips. The size of the shear lips increases wit increasing loading rate and is characterized by microvoids and cell structures. The tunneled region consists of large voids and micro-voids that coalesce by impingement. At high loading rates, localized molten zones are observed at the tunnel-shear <b>lip</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] For assisting visually impaired to effectively perceive critical spatial information through the sense of touch, we proposed a wearable lip-based electrotactile display. The miniaturized display is most effective with <b>lip</b> <b>interface</b> due to the excellent sensory characteristics of lips. Since lips have never been utilized for tactile display applications, two human- subject experiments (6 M/ 2 F) including threshold measurement and two-line separation rating, have been designed to investigate the electrotactile sensitivity and spatial discriminating abilities of lips. Experimental results indicate excellent sensory characteristics suitable for electrotactile applications. Finite Element Modeling is applied to study the Activating Function (AF) and the Current Density (CD) distribution within superficial lip tissue. This computational method could help reveal the working principles behind electro stimulation. Furthermore, simulation results of 5 proposed geometrical electrode designs demonstrate the optimization of the AF and the CD for more uniform distribution. Finally, LTSPICE is used to simulate the performance of a designed on-chip waveform generator at the schematic level. This functional building block will be integrated with a wireless communication module in the near future, which will extend the living space of the blind by offering promising features of high portability and wearability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Friction welding is a welding {{technique}} {{that has been}} studied and developed continuously. This is due to its advantages, such as it provides high quality of joint, high strength of joint. It can make welded zone through the whole section without bubble. However, there is heat generated in the welding process that can change the phase of materials. Hence, the hardness and strength of joint are affected. This paper is aimed to investigate the microstructure at the joint, which is called heat affected zone. The experiment was conducted {{with a number of}} steel rods of 10 mm. diameter. The welded specimens were tested for strength, hardness and microstructure. The temperature gradient of specimen under welding process was also recorded. It was revealed that the strength of welded element is higher but the hardness is lower. The photo of thermo scan revealed that heat is generated around the <b>lip</b> of <b>interface,</b> resulting high temperature in heat affected zone. This causes some change in microstructure composition as well as joint property...|$|R
40|$|Natural human {{interfaces}} {{are a key}} to {{realizing the}} dream of ubiquitous computing. This implies that embedded systems must be capable of sophisticated perception tasks. This paper analyzes {{the nature of a}} visual feature recognition workload. Visual feature recognition is a key component of a number of important applications, e. g. gesture based <b>interfaces,</b> <b>lip</b> tracking to augment speech recognition, smart cameras, automated surveillance systems, robotic vision, etc. Given the power sensitive nature of the embedded space and the natural conflict between low-power and high-performance implementations, a precise understanding of these algorithms is an important step developing efficient visual feature recognition applications for the embedded space. In particular, this work analyzes the performance characteristics of flesh toning, face detection and face recognition codes based on well known algorithms. We also show how the problem can be decomposed into a pipeline of filters that have efficient implementations as stream processors...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{structure}} of nuclei and topological defects in the first-order phase transition between the nematic (N) and isotropic (I) phases in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs). The LCLCs are formed by self-assembled molecular aggregates of various lengths and show a broad biphasic region. The defects emerge {{as a result of}} two mechanisms. 1) Surface anisotropy mechanism that endows each N nucleus (tactoid) with topological defects thanks to preferential (tangential) orientation of the director at the closed I-N interface, and 2) Kibble mechanism with defects forming when differently oriented N tactoids merge with each other. Different scenarios of phase transition involve positive (N-in-I) and negative (I-in-N) tactoids with non-trivial topology of the director field and also multiply connected tactoids-in-tactoids configurations. The closed I-N interface limiting a tactoid shows a certain number of cusps; the <b>lips</b> of the <b>interface</b> on the opposite sides of the cusp make an angle different from pi. The N side of each cusp contains a point defect-boojum. The number of cusps shows how many times the director becomes perpendicular to the I-N interface when one circumnavigates the closed boundary of the tactoid. We derive conservation laws that connect the number of cusps c to the topological strength m of defects in the N part of the simply-connected and multiply-connected tactoids. We demonstrate how the elastic anisotropy of the N phase results in non-circular shape of the disclination cores. A generalized Wulff construction is used to derive the shape of I and N tactoids as the function of I-N interfacial tension anisotropy in the frozen director field of various topological charges m. The complex shapes and structures of tactoids and topological defects demonstrate an important role of surface anisotropy in morphogenesis of phase transitions in liquid crystals.
