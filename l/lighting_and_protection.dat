The western section contains sanctuary area of the mosque and a sahn which {{is surrounded by a}} four-sided hallway covered by small domes built on marble pillars. Each dome is decorated with multicolored oil paintings with floral and geometric patterns and Qur'anic inscriptions. The sahn is covered by wooden roof with a center opening for ventilation, <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> of the mosque from rain. The eastern section contains a prayer room and {{consists of}} two pillars, each of which contains two marble columns. The two sections divide the place of prayer into three corridors parallel to the qibla wall. The place of prayer is covered by a wooden ceiling decorated with multicolored oil paintings. The qibla wall is in the prayer room and marble mihrab {{can be found on the}} center of it.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{measures}} have fallen short of the intended goals, including the prohibition of drinking in the street. Therefore, {{there has been a}} recent movement to open designated botellón areas called botellódromo ("bottle track") to contain the activity. The area is far from residential homes, usually in distant industrial parks, and monitored by local authorities. An example is Alicante, a southern province. The province was the first to propose the idea of botellódromo and established a 4,000 sq. m. outdoor area located on a pier in the city of Alicante. The idea was to please both residents and participants by preventing the youth from occupying other parts of the city while also providing an area for botellón. The area is surveyed by police, but they do not interfere unless it is absolutely necessary. The area is equipped with trash bins, <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> from the seafront.|$|E
50|$|A fernery is a {{specialized}} garden for the cultivation and display of ferns.In many countries, ferneries are indoors {{or at least}} sheltered or kept in a shadehouse to provide a moist environment, filtered <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> from frost <b>and</b> other extremes; on the other hand, some ferns native to arid regions require <b>protection</b> from rain <b>and</b> humid conditions, and grow best in full sun. In mild climates, ferneries are often outside and have an array of different species that grow under similar conditions.|$|R

40|$|The retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is an specialized epithelium lying in the interface between the neural retina and the choriocapillaris where it forms the outer blood-retinal barrier (BRB). The main functions of the RPE are the following: (1) transport of nutrients, ions, and water, (2) absorption of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> against photooxidation, (3) reisomerization of all-trans-retinal into 11 -cis-retinal, which is crucial for the visual cycle, (4) phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor membranes, and (5) secretion of essential factors for the structural integrity of the retina. An overview of these functions will be given. Most {{of the research on}} the physiopathology of diabetic retinopathy has been focused on the impairment of the neuroretina and the breakdown of the inner BRB. By contrast, the effects of diabetes on the RPE and in particular on its secretory activity have received less attention. In this regard, new therapeutic strategies addressed to modulating RPE impairment are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Some years ago, I read an {{interesting}} article in a textbook on community medicine. The author argued for applying the "but why? " method {{when trying to}} solve a medical problem. An example was given: An African village was haunted by repeated gut and stomach infections. Consequently, medicines had to be brought in, frequently in large quantities. A doctor finally asked "but why " are there so many infections? It {{was found that the}} latrines were very close to the drinking water wells. "But why " was it so? The reason was that, during the night, people did not dare to go too far away from the village. But why? The people feared darkness and lions. So, it was concluded that for the gut infections to be treated, or rather prevented, better <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> against the lions were needed, so that the latrines could be moved further away from the water wells...|$|R
