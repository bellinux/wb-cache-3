The {{ferryboat}} was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd {{have a chance to}} see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.

Given n {{fragments}} from k> 2 genomes, we {{will show}} how to find an optimal chain of colinear non-overlapping fragments in time O(n log k− 2 n log log n) and space O(n log k− 2 n). Our result solves an open problem posed by Myers and Miller because it reduces the time complex-log ity of their algorithm by a factor 2 n and the space complexity by log log n a factor <b>log</b> n. <b>Fork</b> = 2 genomes, our algorithm takes O(n log n) time and O(n) space. ...|$|R

40|$|The Caspar Creek Experimental Watersheds were {{established}} in 1962 to {{study the effects of}} forest management on streamflow, sedimentation, and erosion in the rainfall-dominated, forested watersheds of north coastal California. Currently, 21 stream sites are gaged in the North Fork (473 ha) and South Fork (424 ha) of Caspar Creek. From 1971 to 1973, 65 % of the timber volume in the South Fork was selectively cut and tractor yarded, and from 1985 to 1991, 50 % of the North Fork basin was harvested, mostly as cableyarded clearcut. The South <b>Fork</b> <b>logging</b> resulted in annual suspended sediment load increases exceeding 300 %. Mass-wasting has been predominantly associated with roads, landings, and tractor skid trails in the South Fork. Accelerated mass-wasting and renewed sediment mobilization in the South Fork have occurred since 1998. Peak flow increases detected following North <b>Fork</b> <b>logging</b> are attributable to reduced canopy interception and transpiration. These recovered to pretreatment levels about 10 years after logging, followed by renewed increases from pre-commercial thinning. Annual sediment loads increased 89 % in the partially clearcut North Fork and 123 % to 238 % in 4 of 5 clearcut sub-basins. Twelve years after logging, elevated storm-event sediment yields persist in some clearcut tributaries...|$|R
40|$|Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{is one of}} the {{important}} catch for the fishing industry in Indonesia. Length-weight relationship study is one of important tools to support fisheries management. However it could not be done to yellowfin tuna landed in Benoa port since they are in the form of gilled-gutted condition. The objectives of this study are to determine the relationship between gilled-gutted weight (GW) and whole weight (WW), to calculate length weight relationship between fork length (FL) and estimated whole weight (WW) and to assess the relative condition factor (Kn) of yellowfin tuna in Eastern Indian Ocean. Data were collected from three landing sites i. e. Malang, East Java; Benoa, Bali and Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara from January 2013 to February 2014. Linear regression analysis applied to test the significance baseline between weight-weight relationships and log transformed length weight relationship. Relative condition factor (Kn) used to identify fish condition among length groups and months. The results showed a significant positive linear relationships between whole weight (WW) and gilled-gutted weight (GW) of T. albacares (p< 0. 001). There was a significant positive linier relationships between <b>log</b> transformed <b>fork</b> length and <b>log</b> transformed whole weight of T. albacares (p< 0. 001). Relative condition factor (Kn) showed declining pattern along with length increase and varied among months. The findings from this study provide data for management of yellowfin tuna stock and population...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{increases}} in dry-season flow after selective logging of second-growth coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in the 424 ha South Fork Caspar Creek watershed disappeared by 7 years after logging ended, and low flows then dropped to below expected {{values for the}} next 20 years. During the 16 years after clearcut logging in the 473 ha North Fork watershed, latesummer flows increased to nearly twice those expected and then declined to pre-treatment levels on a trajectory that suggests further decline is likely. This contrast in dry-season flow responses is consistent with expected differences in post-logging recovery rates for transpiration after selective and clearcut <b>logging.</b> The South <b>Fork</b> showed a delayed peakflow response relative {{to that in the}} North Fork, and a maximum 3 year increase (per unit area of clearcut equivalent) about 40 percent lower. South Fork peaks remained slightly elevated for more than 20 years after logging ended, and North Fork peaks remained elevated for at least 12 years after logging...|$|R
40|$|Caspar Creek Experimental Watersheds were {{established}} in 1962 to research the effects of forest management on streamflow, sedimentation, and erosion in the rainfall-dominated, forested watersheds of north coastal California. Currently, 21 stream sites are gaged in the North Fork (473 ha) and South Fork (424 ha) of Caspar Creek. From 1971 to 1973, 65 % of the timber volume in the South Fork was selectively cut and tractor yarded, and from 1985 to 1991, 50 % of the North Fork basin was harvested, mostly as cableyarded clearcuts. Three unlogged tributaries serve as controls. Annual suspended sediment loads changed 331 % after <b>logging</b> the South <b>Fork</b> compared to 89 % for the North Fork and- 40 % to 269 % for North Fork subwatersheds. In clearcut units, storm peaks increased as much as 300 %, but as basin wetness increased, percentage peak flow increases declined. Flow increases are explained by reduced transpiration and interception. Ongoing measurements show a return of peak flows to pretreatment conditions approximately 10 years postharvest, but sediment yields have yet to recover. Landslides are predominantly associated with roads, landings, and tractor skid trails in the South Fork watershed and windthrow in the North Fork watershed...|$|R
40|$|Two Acacia mangium Willd. progeny {{tests were}} evaluated, {{pursuing}} an increment in {{the profitability of}} commercial plantations. The 25 open-pollinated families were established in Los Chiles and San Carlos, northern region of Costa Rica, in year 2006, and evaluated in 2007 and in 2010. Genetic material came from plus tree selections obtained by GENFORES, a costarican tree-improvement and gene-conservation cooperative. In each trial, families were represented by 48 progenies, planted in 4 pairs randomly distributed {{within each of the}} 6 blocks. In 2010, DBH, survival rate, commercial number of <b>logs</b> per tree, <b>forking,</b> <b>forking</b> height and <b>log</b> quality in the first 4 logs, were evaluated. Based on these measurements, wood commercial volume per tree and per hectare were estimated. Data was analyzed with SELEGEN software from EMBRAPA, Brasil, in order to determine all genetic parameters of the breeding population. All traits evaluated showed family mean heritability values over 0. 46. Genetic gain in commercial volume per hectare was estimated as 55. 8 %, when selecting as parents the 2 best individuals from the top 12 families, which would correspond to an expected commercial volume. ha - 1, at 4 years age, of 78. 93 m 3. ha - 1 (around 20 m 3. ha - 1. year - 1). The 2 Colombian provenances were significantly superior in growth {{to the rest of the}} evaluated materials. No significant gene-environment interaction was observed between both sites. Genetic correlations among evaluated traits showed that diameter growth rate is expressed early in this tree species, thus could be used in shortening future selections. </span...|$|R
60|$|Hare {{followed}} August's example, {{sitting down}} and speaking no word. His eyes, however, roved discreetly to and fro. Eschtah's three wives presented great differences in age and appearance. The eldest was a wrinkled, parchment-skinned old hag who sat sightless before the fire; the next was a solid square squaw, employed in the task of combing a naked boy's hair with a comb made of stiff thin roots tied tightly in a round bunch. Judging from the youngster's actions and grimaces, this combing process was not a pleasant one. The third wife, much younger, had a comely face, and long braids of black hair, of which, evidently, she was proud. She leaned on her knees over a flat slab of rock, and holding in her hands a long oval stone, she rolled and mashed corn into meal. There were young braves, handsome in their bronze-skinned way, with bands binding their straight thick hair, silver rings in their ears, silver bracelets on their wrists, silver buttons on their moccasins. There were girls who looked up from their blanket-weaving with shy curiosity, {{and then turned to}} their frames strung with long threads. Under their nimble fingers the wool-carrying needles slipped in and out, and the colored stripes grew apace. Then there were younger boys and girls, all bright-eyed and curious; and babies sleeping on blankets. Where the walls and ceiling were not covered with buckskin garments, weapons and blankets, Hare saw the white wood-ribs of the hogan structure. It was a work of art, this circular house of <b>forked</b> <b>logs</b> and branches, interwoven into a dome, arched and strong, and all covered and cemented with clay.|$|R
