50|$|The Legislature meets at the South Dakota State Capitol in Pierre. It {{begins its}} annual {{session of the}} second Tuesday of January each year.

Generally, the legislature meets for four {{out of every five}} business days each week until the session ends, excepting on last day which is delayed to allow for consideration of gubernatorial vetoes. This schedule enables legislators to have one <b>working</b> <b>day</b> each week at home in their districts to meet with constituents as well as to tend to other personal matters. In addition, the legislature occasionally meets on Saturdays to make-up for recesses on holidays such as Presidents' Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.|$|R
5000|$|The Governor General must issue writs for an {{election}} within {{seven days of}} the expiration or dissolution of Parliament. Under section 17 of the Constitution Act 1986, Parliament expires three years [...] "from the day fixed {{for the return of}} the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer." [...] The writs for the previous general election were returnable on 27 November 2008. As a result, the 49th Parliament would have expired, if not dissolved earlier, on 27 November 2011. As that day was a Sunday, the <b>last</b> available <b>working</b> <b>day</b> was 25 November 2011. Consequently, the last day for issuance of writs of election was 2 December 2011. Except in some circumstances (such a recount or the death/incapacitation of an electorate candidate), the writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance with the <b>last</b> possible <b>working</b> <b>day</b> being 20 January 2012. Because polling day must be a Saturday, the last possible polling date for the election was 7 January 2012, allowing time for the counting of special votes. The Christmas/New Year holiday period made the last realistic date for the election Saturday 10 December 2011. The Rugby World Cup 2011 was hosted by New Zealand between 9 September and 23 October 2011, and ruled out all the possible election dates in this period. This left two possible windows for the general election: on or before 2 September and 29 October to 10 December.|$|R
