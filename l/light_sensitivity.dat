30|$|The {{results of}} the {{multiple}} CI analysis over different dbh classes correspond well with the perceived light responsiveness of these species. The four most light responsive/demanding canopy species according to the crown position response index, Podocarpus falcatus, Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus, Olea capensis macrocarpa and Psydrax obovata subsp. obovata (Seydack et al. [2011]) show competitive responses for light even in canopy positions (Table  5). An edaphic competitive response at the canopy level was absent in Podocarpus falcatus and Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus, the two species with greater water stress tolerance than the other canopy species (Mitlöhner ([1998])). The pattern of changing competitive responsiveness indicating a need for light at the juvenile stage and moisture stress sensitivity in canopy positions as adults was observed in six canopy species (Table  5). These six canopy species (Curtisia dentata, Podocarpus latifolius, Maytenus peduncularis, Nuxia floribunda, Apodytes dimidiata, Olea capensis macrocarpa) with their characteristic pattern of changing competitive <b>sensitivity</b> pattern from <b>light</b> to edaphic with increasing stem diameter {{make up more than}} 90 % of canopy-level (trees > 30  cm dbh) tree numbers. In canopy species, the effectiveness of the KKL-t index in capturing the <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of species is confirmed by congruence of their relative <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities</b> as indicated by the crown position response index (Seydack et al. [2011]). Podocarpus falcatus, Olea capensis subsp. macrocarpa, Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus, and Psydrax obovata subsp. obovata have relatively high crown response indices, whereas Podocarpus latifolius, Apodytes dimidiata and Ocotea bullata have low index values (Seydack et al. [2011]). These ratings concur with those of the KKL-t (Figure  4).|$|R

40|$|The {{absolute}} <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> temporal properties, and spectral sensitivities of {{the visual}} systems of three mid-Atlantic temperate reef fishes (Atlantic spadefish [Ephippidae: Chaetodipterus faber], tautog [Labridae: Tautoga onitis], and black sea bass [Serranidae: Centropristis striata]) were studied via electroretinography (ERG). Pelagic Atlantic spadefish exhibited higher temporal resolution but a narrower dynamic range than the two more demersal foragers. The higher luminous sensitivities of tautog and black sea bass were similar to other benthic and demersal coastal mid-Atlantic fishes. Flicker fusion frequency experiments revealed significant interspecific differences at maximum intensities that correlated with lifestyle and habitat.

Living at a depth of about 200 m, the Comoran coelacanth receives only a narrow range of light, at about 480 nm. To detect the entire range of “color” at this depth, the coelacanth appears to use only two closely related paralogous RH 1 and RH 2 visual pigments with the optimum <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities</b> (λmax) at 478 nm and 485 nm, respectively. The λmax values are shifted about 20 nm toward blue compared with those of the corresponding orthologous pigments.

25|$|Long-term or {{permanent}} damage includes solar retinopathy, which {{occurs when the}} sun burns {{a hole in the}} retina, usually at the fovea (the focus of the retina).

25|$|The {{absolute}} {{value for the}} exposure time required depends on how sensitive to light the medium being used is (measured by the film speed, or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency).

40|$|Experiments {{described}} in this report quantiate the black <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells containing BrdUrd-DNA of defined composition. Cesium chloride equilibrium gradient centrifugation provides estimates both of the percent thymidine replacement by BrdUrd and of the symmetry (unifilar versus bifilar) of BrdUrd incorporation into the chromosomal DNA duplexes. Radiation damage to BrdUrd-substituted CHL cell DNA and its repair in situ also have been assessed by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation. We observe that animal cell <b>sensitivities</b> to visible <b>light</b> (300 - 400 nm wavelength) depend markedly upon the symmetries of BrdUrd-substitution within the cells Dna. Cells that contain only unifilar BrdUrd-DNA are resistant to black light, whereas cells that contain bifilar BrdUrd-DNA are extremely photosensitive. The former cell populations repair single-stranded nicks (breaks in phosphodiester bonds) in their DNA within 24 hr of irradiation; the latter cell populations, however, {{are not able to}} repair light-induced, double-stranded breaks in their DNA...|$|R

25|$|Fuji films also {{integrate}} tabular grains {{in their}} SUFG (Super Unified Fine Grain) films. In their case, the SUFG grain {{is not only}} tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for the same <b>light</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, {{the first in a}} new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.|$|E
40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Neurospora crassa {{is a model}} organism for the genetic dissection of blue light photoreception and circadian rhythms. WHITE COLLAR- 1 (WC- 1) and WC- 2 are considered necessary for all light responses, while FREQUENCY (FRQ) is required for light-regulated asexual development (conidia formation); {{without any of the}} three, self-sustained (circadian) rhythmicity in constant conditions fails. Here we show that light-regulated and self-sustained development occur in the individual or mutant white collar strains. These strains resemble wild type in their organization of the daily bout of light-regulated conidiation. Molecular profiles of light- induced genes indicate that the individual white collar- 1 and white collar- 2 mutants utilize distinct pathways, despite their similar appearance in all aspects. Titration of fluence rate also demonstrates different <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities</b> between the two strains. The data require the existence of an as-yet-unidentified photoreceptor. Furthermore, the extant circadian clock machinery in these mutant strains supports the notion that the circadian system in Neurospora involves components outside the WC–FRQ loop...|$|R

40|$|A long-day duckweed, Lemna gibba G 3, {{was found}} to be {{controlled}} by two light-perceiving systems; a system perceiving a prolonged, high-intensity white light and the phytochrome system, with respect to the incorporation of radioactive uridine into RNA. When the duckweed was exposed to short or long days, the uridine incorpo-rating activity into RNA changed diurnally reaching its highest level at 18 hr and its lowest one at 6 hr after the beginning of a light period. The level of maximum activity rose in proportion to an increase in the length of the light period up to 12 hr or in light intensity up to 3000 ergs/cm 2 sec. The far-red light termination of the light period resulted in a decrease in uridine incorporation, the extent of which was constant irrespective of the length of the light period. The uridine incorporating activity changed diurnally when the duckweed was exposed to continuous light. The period length of the rhythm was circadian and was constant over a temperature range of 16 ° to 30 °C. Bunning suggested that two phases, the photophile and photophobe phases, alter diurnally and have different <b>light</b> <b>sensitivities</b> (2). To examine the differenc...|$|R

Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland. Dr. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains <b>light</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> is responsible for the production and release of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), an entheogen which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Kodak {{introduced}} the T-Grain emulsion, a technological advancement {{in the shape}} and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater <b>light</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks. This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.|$|E
25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), eating food or {{drinking}} water contaminated {{with high levels}} of coal tar creosote may cause a burning in the mouth and throat, and stomach pains.
