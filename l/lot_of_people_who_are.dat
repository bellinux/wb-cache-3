500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E
500|$|Corey Taylor {{explained}} that the phrase [...] "All Hope Is Gone" [...] is aimed at the fans' expectations of the band, further elaborating, [...] "Just when you thought you had us figured out, give up all hope because you're never, ever going to." [...] Throughout the album, Taylor incorporates a focus on politics in his lyrics, compared to Slipknot's previous albums. The opening track, [...] ".execute.", features Taylor's response to former United States Vice President Spiro Agnew's speech targeted at Vietnam War protesters. and the second track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] follows in the same vein. During an interview with Kerrang!, Taylor discussed the song's lyrical content, explaining, [...] "There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy. And that hurts me." [...] Reviewing for IGN, Jim Kaz said that lyrically, [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] gives the listener a [...] "heaping dose of Corey Taylor's caustic bravado". On the track [...] "Wherein Lies Continue", Taylor offers a [...] "dressing down {{of the world as}} we know it", explaining, [...] "It kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves way too seriously and where the 'leaders' are so pretentious that they think they are deemed to speak for the people." [...] He also proclaimed, [...] "It wouldn't be a Slipknot album if I didn't rag on the recording industry." [...] On [...] "Butcher's Hook", Taylor specifically targets [...] "all those little emo boys", commenting, [...] "People give us shit for wearing outfits, but all of those guys look exactly the same." ...|$|E
500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "Is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We {{take it for granted}} that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?", referring to the fact that [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> really smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars.
