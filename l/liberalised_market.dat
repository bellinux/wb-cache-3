Later, Torsten Husén and Stewart Ranson emphasise that learning has a certain ‘fluidity’ (with no start or end points) that exists outside of formal systems and this seems to reflect a <b>liberalised</b> <b>market</b> model of free movements of knowledge as required by organisations and systems.|$|E

From the 90's through the early 2000s, BT Group, then known as British Telecom, struggled. The company failed to secure a strong partner, struggled to expand internationally, and had significant debt. In 2002 the attempt at an alliance (Concert 2 with R&R was disbanded. Thereafter the company brought together a number of joint ventures, partly owned assets and wholly owned subsidiaries into the single entity that exists today. On April 1, 2002, BT’s contracts with former Concert customers were transferred to BT Global Services and BT Retail. BT Ignite was renamed BT Global Services in April 2003. By late 2003, around 50% of BT Global Services’ about 5,000 staff were employed outside the UK.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} the reponses to capacity requirements in the <b>liberalised</b> electricity <b>markets</b> {{as a result}} of the insufficient number of incentives they include, taking account of the highly unusual volatility of these new markets. We begin by looking at the crisis seen in the Norwegian and Nordic markets in winter 2002 / 2003 and the responses provided to deal with the temporary scarcity of capacity, before looking at the range of solutions that are usually considered, focused on the need to encourage supply-side investments only. There is no single solution to deal with the challenge of electrical investments in <b>liberalised</b> <b>markets.</b> We show that the need for direct public co-ordination via tenders is significantly attenuated by various solutions. The question is considered in two ways : firstly by combining an economic approach with an institutional approach which includes the acceptability conditions for liberalisation reforms and environmental policies, and secondly by getting out of the assumption that a single technological model based on large sized units would be feasible...|$|R

Secondarily, a consumer defined level of security might improve welfare. Finally, different willingness to pay among customers and construction of advanced markets might increase welfare further. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} the E 3 (economy-energy-environment) {{impacts of}} a domestic emissions trading regime in Austria for 8 manufacturing industries and the electricity generation sector by 2010. The trading regime leads to compliance with the Austrian Kyoto target of minus 13 % until 2010 for these sectors. Due to inter-fuel substitution, fossil energy is crowded out by electricity in manufacturing with a carbon leakage to electricity generation. In <b>liberalised</b> <b>markets,</b> domestic thermal electricity generation is substituted by imports due to higher electricity prices, i. e., carbon leaks abroad. These carbon leakages can be overcome by accompanying measures to stimulate renewable electricity generation. The macroeconomic and sectoral effects of the emissions trading mainly depend on the allocation mechanism applied...|$|R

Investments in new wind-power installations on land, however, have declined dramatically after the Danish electricity market was liberalised in 1999.

Finally, we assess whether the new tariffs make an incentive to invest in wind power. The paper concludes that the new tariffs not by itself make evidence for the actual Danish recession in new wind-power installations after the electricity reform.

40|$|Using county-level {{employment}} data, we analyse how {{the spatial}} concentration of jobs {{has changed in}} China’s Pearl River Delta (PRD) between 1990 and 2005. Despite unique Chinese policies that exhibit strong influence on the economic landscape, we detect key parallels with the patterns found in classic theories and empirical studies in Western contexts. Total employment has become increasingly concentrated. This aggregate picture hides important sectoral variations though: manufacturing employment has spread out to suburban areas; producer service jobs have increasingly concentrated in metropolitan centres; and consumer and public services have clustered in areas with high aggregate population. We argue that the major forces that are shaping the economic landscape in PRD are the market institutions and development path-dependency. Under the circumstances of an increasingly <b>liberalised</b> <b>market</b> and decentralised government, policy now may function as a dynamic tool to magnify local spatial-economic and historical advantages and to balance uneven regional development...|$|E
