50|$|In {{computer}} programming, an {{arithmetic shift}} is a shift operator, sometimes termed a signed shift (though {{it is not}} restricted to signed operands). The two basic types are the arithmetic left shift and the arithmetic right shift. For binary numbers it is a bitwise operation that shifts all of the bits of its operand; every bit in the operand is simply moved a given number of bit positions, and the vacant bit-positions are filled in. Instead of being filled with all 0s, as in <b>logical</b> <b>shift,</b> when shifting to the right, the leftmost bit (usually the sign bit in signed integer representations) is replicated to fill in all the vacant positions (this {{is a kind of}} sign extension).|$|E
50|$|The naturalistic {{conception}} of humans, which {{has so far}} been unable to make the strictly <b>logical</b> <b>shift</b> from animals to humans themselves, and which sometimes argues that the problem lies {{in the absence of a}} “missing link” that is yet to be found, is mistaken. In fact, there is a “decisive link”, which this conception does not in any way seek. This conception does not take account of the presence of the human capacity for a priori thought, the presence of which was proved by German classical philosophy in the person of Kant, who proceeded from the premise that it is humans that can think a priori, because they possess mind. Kant had no knowledge of Darwin’s ideas and therefore did not deal with the problem of animal, a posteriori thought transforming into actual human, a priori thought. Plato raised the issue of apriorism with his concept of “anamnesis”, and so, later on, did Leibniz, with his concept of “innate ideas”. But Darwin himself, as a 19th-century Englishman, took the sensualist view, seeing sensation in absolute terms and viewing the capacity for abstraction as something of which for human mind was sufficient.|$|E

Most of the AES algorithms, especially symmetric block ciphers, are based on the principle of substitution and transposition to encrypt a plain-text message and to produce a cipher-message.
