25|$|Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to study barrier {{properties}} of natural, modified or coated nanocellulose.

Furthermore, he has made significant advances on medical applications of <b>label-free</b> optical imaging and single-cell genomics. In particular, his inventions in single-cell genomics have been used in in vitro fertilization to benefit hundreds of couples in China by avoiding the transmission of monogenic diseases to their newborns.|$|E
25|$|DHM {{can operate}} both in {{reflection}} and transmission mode. In reflection mode, the phase shift image provides a relative distance measurement and thus represents a topography {{map of the}} reflecting surface. In transmission mode, the phase shift image provides a <b>label-free</b> quantitative measurement of the optical thickness of the specimen. Phase shift images of biological cells {{are very similar to}} images of stained cells and have successfully been analyzed by high content analysis software.|$|E
25|$|Real-time based methods, {{which are}} often <b>label-free,</b> such as surface plasmon resonance, dual {{polarization}} interferometry and Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance (MP-SPR) can not only quantify the affinity from concentration based assays; {{but also from the}} kinetics of association and dissociation, and in the later cases, the conformational change induced upon binding. MP-SPR also enables measurements in high saline dissociation buffers thanks to a unique optical setup. Microscale Thermophoresis (MST), an immobilization-free method was developed. This method allows the determination of the binding affinity without any limitation to the ligand's molecular weight.|$|E

500|$|Optical interferometry, {{applied to}} biology and medicine, {{provides}} sensitive metrology capabilities for {{the measurement of}} biomolecules, subcellular components, cells and tissues. [...] Many forms of <b>label-free</b> biosensors rely on interferometry because the direct interaction of electromagnetic fields with local molecular polarizability {{eliminates the need for}} fluorescent tags or nanoparticle markers. [...] At a larger scale, cellular interferometry shares aspects with phase-contrast microscopy, but comprises a much larger class of phase-sensitive optical configurations that rely on optical interference among cellular constituents through refraction and diffraction. [...] At the tissue scale, partially-coherent forward-scattered light propagation through the micro aberrations and heterogeneity of tissue structure provides opportunities to use phase-sensitive gating (optical coherence tomography) as well as phase-sensitive fluctuation spectroscopy to image subtle structural and dynamical properties.|$|E

2500|$|Impedance-based {{single cell}} {{analysis}} systems are {{commonly known as}} Coulter counters. They represent a well-established method for counting and sizing virtually any kind of cells and particles. The <b>label-free</b> technology has recently been enhanced by a [...] "lab-on-a-chip" [...] based approach and by applying high frequency alternating current (AC) in the radio frequency range (from 100kHz to 30MHz) instead of a static direct current (DC) or low frequency AC field. This patented technology allows a highly accurate cell analysis and provides additional information like membrane capacitance and viability.

2500|$|The first impedance-based {{flow cytometry}} device, using the Coulter principle, was {{disclosed}} in U.S. Patent 2,656,508, issued in 1953, to Wallace H. Coulter. Mack Fulwyler was {{the inventor of}} the forerunner to today's flow cytometers - particularly the cell sorter. Fulwyler developed this in 1965 with his publication in Science. [...] The first fluorescence-based flow cytometry device (ICP 11) was developed in 1968 by Wolfgang Göhde from the University of Münster, filed for patent on 18 December 1968 and first commercialized in 1968/69 by German developer and manufacturer Partec through Phywe AG in Göttingen. At that time, absorption methods were still widely favored by other scientists over fluorescence methods. Soon after, flow cytometry instruments were developed, including the Cytofluorograph (1971) from Bio/Physics Systems Inc. (later: Ortho Diagnostics), the PAS 8000 (1973) from Partec, the first FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) instrument from Becton Dickinson (1974), the ICP 22 (1975) from Partec/Phywe and the Epics from Coulter (1977/78). The first <b>label-free</b> high-frequency impedance flow cytometer based on a patented microfluidic [...] "lab-on-chip", Ampha Z30, was introduced by Amphasys (2012).|$|E
