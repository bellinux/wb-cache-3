5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the <b>lead</b> <b>solder</b> used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have <b>lead</b> <b>solder.</b> Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{contains}} {{strength tests}} results of joints soldered {{by use of}} <b>lead</b> and leadless <b>solders.</b> For tests <b>lead</b> <b>solders</b> of types Sn 20 Pb 80, Sn 40 Pb 60, Sn 60 Pb 40 and type Sn 63 Pb 37 and the leadless solders of types Sn 95. 5 Ag 3. 8 Cu 0. 7, Sn 96 Ag 4 and type Sn 99 Cu 1 and as jointed material the sheet iron of 1. 0 mm thickness were used. Dimensions of test samples were of 20 x 100 x 1 mm. For heating the propane-butane and air flame was used. The tested assemblies were loaded using the universal tensile strength testing machine up to their failure. The force needed for failure and failure type (in the joint, in the basic material) were noted. From carried out tests it follows that practically the same results were obtained at <b>lead</b> <b>solders</b> of types Sn 60 Pb 40 and Sn 63 Pb 37 and at leadless solders of types Sn 95. 5 Ag 3. 8 Cu 0. 7 and Sn 96 Ag 4.

2500|$|In the United States, lead is {{prohibited}} in solder and flux in plumbing applications for drinking water use, per the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Historically, {{a higher proportion}} of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be wiped over the joint to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of lead poisoning began to be fully appreciated, <b>lead</b> <b>solder</b> was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The electrochemical couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin. [...] Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health, lead in plumbing solder was replaced by silver (food-grade applications) or antimony, with copper often added, and the proportion of tin was increased (see Lead-free solder.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from <b>lead</b> <b>solder</b> in pipe fittings. [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water. [...] The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increased}} awareness of the <b>lead</b> free <b>solder</b> in the electronic packaging industry, {{the development of the}} <b>lead</b> free <b>solder</b> on the low-cost FR- 4 substrate is a necessary for the flip-chip applications. However, it is found that the high reflow temperature of the <b>lead</b> free <b>solders</b> (normally > 250 °C) caused substrate burnt related defects in the FR- 4 substrates (T g < 200 °C) during bonding process in the traditional reflow oven. In order to solve this problem, bonding was performed on the flip-chip bonder. Using this approach, no substrate burned was observed. Using the flip chip bonder instead of the reflow oven, it is a possible to solve the low T g of the FR- 4 substrate for the <b>lead</b> free <b>solders</b> flip chip applications. However, the draw back is that solder reflow data provided by solder paste suppliers must be adjusted for the flip chip bonder. In this paper, the main factors (stage temperature, bonding pressure, head temperature, bonding time and moving distance) affecting the bonding process by flip chip bonder in the Sn 0. 7 Cu <b>lead</b> free <b>solder</b> were evaluated. Sn 0. 7 Cu solder is chosen due to its high melting temperature of up to 227 °C. If we can demonstrate the solution for this high reflow temperature solder, we can apply the same approach to the others lower melting temperature solders such as SnAgCu, SnAg and SnBi on the FR- 4 substrates. The experiments were designed based on the Taguchi method. Die shear test of the bonded samples is selected as the tool to verify the die shear strength of the samples under different experiments.
