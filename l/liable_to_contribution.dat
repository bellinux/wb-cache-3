We show that these puzzles disappear in a Vector Autoregressive model that properly accounts for domestic and global factors. Such a model reveals, among others, that domestic factors explain much of the inflation dynamics in the 2012 - 2014 euro area missing inflation episode. Consequently, economists and models that excessively focused on the global nature of inflation were <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> miss the <b>contribution</b> of deflationary domestic shocks during this episode...|$|R
50|$|Deimberg {{lay in the}} Nahegau, but {{was founded}} {{relatively}} late, likely in the 11th or 12th century. Theoretically, {{there is the possibility}} that there had formerly been another village at this same spot called Steinbäch(e)l, even before Deimberg’s founding. This has since vanished. In 1336, Deimberg had its first documentary mention in a listing of those who were <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> Saint Valentine’s Church (Valentinskirche) in Niedereisenbach (today a constituent community of Glanbrücken). The actual Latin text states: “Item Petrus dictus Geyst de Dimberg et Jutta sua legitima dimidiam libram cerae super agrum dictum Hezzilsbirchen” (“Petrus, called Geyst from Dimberg and his wife Jutta had to deliver half a pound of grain harvested on the field called Hezzilsbirchen”), thus mentioning the village as Dimberg. By “pound”, used here to translate libram (an accusative case form; the nominative case would be libra), the reader is to understand “amount that could be weighed on a big scale”, for this is apparently how the word was understood in the 14th century.|$|R
40|$|Employees are compulsorily insured for {{employee}} insurance schemes, {{employers are}} <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>contributions.</b> Self-employed are excluded. In {{order to reduce}} their labor costs, it may be attractive for workers to shape their employment relationship in such a way, that {{it seems that the}} relationship is between an independent and a client. It also happens that in connection with a possible benefit, workers name there relationship an employment relationship, while essentially there is entrepreneurship. Lucy van den Berg examines how individuals through the involvement of a legal person can reach that they are insured for the employee workers schemes in connection with a possible benefit, or conform precisely the opposite to avoid the compulsory insurance in because of the premiums. Her research shows that the legal structures aimed at achieving or avoiding insurance, can be pierced. For example, when formally contracted with a limited as agent, but the person who actually performs the work is treated as an employee, this person is considered as an employee. Although the government wants to encourage entrepreneurship, the current system offers limited opportunities extending the role of the legal personality...|$|R

While the two cases appear to be concerned with opposite sides of the same coin, in fact each one standing alone represents the whole coin itself.
