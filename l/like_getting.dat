25|$|Round 5 was the Spanish Grand Prix and Montoya {{needed a}} good result {{but did not}} look <b>like</b> <b>getting</b> it, so, after another poor qualifying, Montoya found himself down in 12th place. He made up for it by making a quick start by gaining five places and was up to sixth in the first corner (David Coulthard was {{starting}} {{from the back of}} the grid after stalling on the formation lap). He got ahead of Jacques Villeneuve in the second round of pit stops. He stayed on the track and climbed up to second due to a high attrition rate.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death case <b>like</b> <b>getting</b> into the box with Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure your death. So it seems that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you to get in the box with the cat, since it is certain that your only successor will emerge unharmed.

25|$|England were {{expected}} to lose the seven match ODI series against India, as they were regarded as the dominant team in that format of the game. However, England cruised to victory in the first match at The Rose Bowl, with a convincing victory of 104 runs. The result was largely down to a majestic innings of 126 from Ian Bell, which helped England {{on their way to}} 288/2, a total India never looked <b>like</b> <b>getting.</b> In the second match, India levelled the series,winning the match by 9 runs after posting 329. Although Bell again impressed, hitting 64, England fell just short. England retook the lead following the third match at Edgbaston. Bell again batted well, scoring 79 as England posted 281/8. Although India started well, they were bowled out for 239. England made it back to back wins after winning the fourth ODI, beating India by 3 wickets in a closely fought encounter. The victory gave England a 3-1 series lead and put them on course for a series victory.|$|E

[...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one.

Still, when it's funny, it's really funny." [...] A review in Variety by Todd McCarthy was critical: [...] "Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film a negative review, calling it [...] "...an assault {{in the guise of}} a comedy—watching it is <b>like</b> <b>getting</b> mugged by a clown." [...] J.R. Jones of Chicago Reader stated [...] "The rest of the movie never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 3.5/4 and wrote, [...] "The movie is, may I say, considerably better than Stiller’s previous film, Zoolander (2001).

500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is <b>like</b> <b>getting</b> undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
