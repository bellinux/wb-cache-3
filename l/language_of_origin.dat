25|$|Because many {{different}} Hanja—and thus, {{many different}} words written using Hanja—often {{share the same}} sounds, two distinct Hanja words (Hanjaeo) may be spelled identically in the phonetic Hangul alphabet. Since Hanja's <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> Chinese, has many homophones, Hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into Korean since Korean lacks a tonal system, which is how Chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise make them homophonic to each other. For example, while 道, 刀, and 島 are all phonetically distinct in Mandarin, which are pronounced dào, dāo, and dǎo respectively, they are all pronounced do (도) in Korean. Thus, Hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent Hangul spelling, or in parentheses after the Hangul spelling {{as a kind of}} gloss. Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs, for example the banner at the funeral for the sailors lost in the sinking of ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772).|$|E
