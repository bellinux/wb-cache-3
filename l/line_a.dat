5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on <b>Line</b> <b>A</b> and two on Line E. The <b>Line</b> <b>A</b> stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations {{in that part}} of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E
5|$|Adelaide's first {{experiment}} with electric powered trams was a demonstration {{run on the}} Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's <b>line.</b> <b>A</b> battery powered tram fitted with Julien's Patent Electric Traction ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.|$|E
