5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex and his {{assistant}} Doctor Nitrus Brio create the Evolvo-Ray, a device they use to mutate the various animals living on the islands into beasts with superhuman strength. They experiment on Crash, a peaceful bandicoot who Cortex intends {{to be the leader}} of his growing military of animal soldiers. Despite Brio's warnings, Cortex subjects Crash to the untested Cortex Vortex in an attempt to control him. The Vortex rejects Crash, allowing him to escape. After Crash <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> a window and falls to the ocean below, Cortex prepares a female bandicoot named Tawna for experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E

25|$|The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who {{are dressed}} as monks and are begging for alms, and their {{companion}} Grigoriy, {{who is in}} secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess returns with a bottle, he drinks and launches into a ferocious song ("So {{it was in the}} city of Kazan") of Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police are watching the ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known way to get to the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam's suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman thinks he has found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam's description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the window. The men set off in pursuit.|$|E
500|$|Swift, {{energetic}} piscivores, blacktip {{sharks are}} known to make spinning <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the water while attacking schools of small fish. Their demeanor {{has been described as}} [...] "timid" [...] compared to other large requiem sharks. Both juveniles and adults form groups of varying size. Like other members of its family, the blacktip shark is viviparous; females bear one to 10 pups every other year. Young blacktip sharks spend the first months of their lives in shallow nurseries, and grown females return to the nurseries where they were born to give birth themselves. In the absence of males, females are also capable of asexual reproduction.|$|E

500|$|The meat of the {{spinner shark}} is {{of high quality}} and sold fresh or dried and salted. In addition, the fins are used for shark fin soup in East Asia, the liver oil is {{processed}} for vitamins, and the skin is made into leather products. Spinner sharks are an important catch of the US commercial shark fisheries operating in the northwestern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The meat is marketed under the name [...] "blacktip shark" [...] in the United States, due to that species being considered superior in quality by consumers. It is likely also caught by other fisheries across its range, going unreported owing to confusion with the blacktip shark. The spinner shark is also highly regarded by recreational fishers, being described as a [...] "spectacular fighter" [...] that often <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the water.|$|E
500|$|An oft-repeated myth {{about the}} common {{thresher}} {{is that they}} cooperate with swordfish to attack whales. In one version of events, the thresher shark circles the whale and distracts it by beating the sea to a froth with its tail, thereby allowing the swordfish to impale it in a vulnerable spot with its rostrum. In an alternate account, the swordfish positions itself beneath the whale, while the thresher <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> {{of the water and}} lands on top of the whale, hammering it onto the swordfish's rostrum. Yet other authors describe the thresher [...] "cutting huge gashes" [...] {{in the side of the}} whale with its tail. Neither threshers nor swordfish however are known to feed on whales or indeed possess the dentition to do so. The story may have arisen from mariners mistaking the tall dorsal fins of killer whales, which do attack large cetaceans, for thresher shark tails. Swordfish bills have also been found embedded in blue and fin whales (likely accidents due to the fast-moving fish's inertia), and thresher sharks do exhibit some of the aforementioned behaviors independent of whales.|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{critically}} acclaimed and remains popular among the show's fanbase. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly published {{a list of}} its 25 favorite episodes and placed [...] "Homer at the Bat", [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] and [...] "Radio Bart" [...] at 15th, 16th and 20th positions, respectively. IGN.com {{made a list of}} the best guest appearances in the show's history, and placed Aerosmith at 24, Spinal Tap at 18, the [...] "Homer at the Bat" [...] baseball players at 17, Jon Lovitz at eight, and Michael Jackson at number five. IGN would later name [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] the best episode of the third season. Chris Turner, {{the author of the book}} Planet Simpson, believes that the third season marks the beginning of [...] "the Golden Age" [...] of The Simpsons and pinpoints [...] "Homer at the Bat" [...] as the first episode of the era. Bill Oakley has described the season as [...] "the best season of any TV show of all time", pinpointing its success to the fact that [...] "a lot of the stories were pretty grounded, but they took a couple of crazy <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> into space with like, ‘Homer at the Bat’", stating that he and Josh Weinstein used the season as a model when they were The Simpsons showrunners for seasons 7 and 8.|$|E

2500|$|The {{trapdoor}} is [...] {{difficult to}} see when it is closed because the plant and soil materials effectively camouflage it. The trapdoor is hinged on one side with silk. The spiders, which are usually nocturnal, typically wait for prey while {{holding on to the}} underside of the door with the claws on their tarsi. Prey is captured when insects, other arthropods, or small vertebrates disturb the 'trip' lines the spider lays out around its trapdoor, alerting the spider to a meal within reach. The spider detects the prey by vibrations and, when it comes close enough, <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of its burrow to make the capture.|$|E

2500|$|Blodwen Davies was {{the first}} biographer of Thomson, and a Theosophist. Emphasizing the [...] "spirit" [...] of the painting, she wrote in 1935, [...] "the spirit of the canvas <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> to meet the spectator in a way no {{reproduction}} can fully convey. There is no fumbling, no hesitancy here... brush was sure. Heavily laden with paint it swept over the canvas in broad, exultant strokes in which the very spirit of Tom Thomson still speaks aloud." [...] Another Theosophist, Fred Housser, described the painting in 1926 as [...] "a devotional meditative study. A single tree stands spreading the tracery of its limbs and branches like the pulsating veins of Mother Nature... could believe that this tree was to the nature-worshipper Thomson what {{the symbol of the}} cross was to a mediaeval mystic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s Flipper series, in {{the episode}} [...] "Waterworld", Courtney is saved by a diver (Luke) looking for Atlantis (which is {{revealed}} to be {{off the coast of}} the Florida Keys). Luke reveals to Courtney that his grandparents died while searching for Atlantis and he wants to continue their legacy. Courtney's cousin Jackie suspects that Luke is an Atlantean himself due to the fact he can stay underwater for a long time without scuba gear, can communicate with dolphins and seemingly [...] "morphs" [...] into them while swimming. Later Luke and Courtney go diving and find Atlantis during a massive undersea quake. Courtney is rescued but not before she sees Luke (and Flipper) swim into a cave filled with light. At the end of the episode, everybody gives up hope of finding Luke when suddenly Flipper <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the water with another dolphin (who has designs on his side similar to Luke's amulet). Courtney suddenly feels peace that Luke is all right.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{remainder}} of her career, Merman worked as frequently as offers were made. In 1979, she recorded The Ethel Merman Disco Album, with many of her signature songs are set to a disco beat.

[...] In the cameo appearance, Merman <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of bed singing [...] "Everything's Coming Up Roses" [...] as orderlies restrain her. She also appeared in several episodes of The Love Boat (playing Gopher's mother), guested on a CBS tribute to George Gershwin, did a summer comedy/concert tour with Carroll O'Connor, played a two-week engagement at the London Palladium, performed with Mary Martin in a concert benefiting the theatre and museum collection of the Museum of the City of New York, and frequently appeared as a soloist with symphony orchestras. She also volunteered at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center working in the gift shop or visiting patients.|$|E

2500|$|Some fish use {{multiple}} {{modes of}} locomotion. [...] Walking fish may swim freely or {{at other times}} [...] "walk" [...] along the ocean or river floor, but not on land (e.g., the flying gurnard —which does not actually fly—and batfishes of the Ogcocephalidae family). [...] Amphibious fish, are fish {{that are able to}} leave water for extended periods of time. [...] These fish use a range of terrestrial locomotory modes, such as lateral undulation, tripod-like walking (using paired fins and tail), and jumping. Many of these locomotory modes incorporate multiple combinations of pectoral, pelvic and tail fin movement. Examples include eels, mudskippers and the walking catfish. [...] Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators. [...] The flights of flying fish are typically around 50meters, though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to [...] They can travel at speeds of more than [...] Maximum altitude is [...] above the surface of the sea. [...] Some accounts have them landing on ships' decks.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Imperial Eagle" [...] (Kenzo Suzuki) and the [...] "Italian Eagle" [...] (Marco Corleone) were {{accompanied}} by CMLL Luchadora Mima Shimoda to the right for the main event match. During the early parts of the match the crowd would actually cheer for the rudo team at times, especially Marco Corleone, choosing to side with him instead of the recently turned Universo 2000 and Shocker who had not done a lot to earn the crowd's respect {{leading up to the}} match. Shocker pinned Corleone after just over four minutes of wrestling, putting his team up by a point. The second fall is about the length of the first one, approximately four minutes and saw the rudo team of Corleone and Suzuki win after Corleone executed a [...] "Superman Flight", one of his signature high flying moves off the top rope, and pinned Unverso 2000. With the match tied the third fall, both teams took more chances, including Corleone getting caught up on the ropes during one of his <b>leaps</b> <b>out</b> of the ring. The match saw Universo 2000 pin Kenzo Suzuki, followed by Marco Corleone pinning Universo 2000, leaving only himself and Shocker as the legal men in the match. When the referee turned his back Universo 2000 landed a low-blow on Marco Corleone, making it easy for Shocker to pin him for the third and deciding fall. After the match both Corleone and Suzuki {{stood in the middle of}} the ring while the designated barber cut their hair off and then shaved them completely bald to fulfill the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E
