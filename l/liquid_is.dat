5|$|The {{surface of}} any <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E

Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> pumped out of the tank.|$|E

5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation.

That {{is to say that}} when a <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater.

A central issue in the understanding of <b>liquids</b> <b>is</b> to estimate the energy state of liquids. Here, on the basis of our recent studies on crystal melting, we show that the energy sate of <b>liquids</b> may <b>be</b> reasonably approximated by the energy and volume of a vacancy. Consequently, estimation of the <b>liquid</b> state energy <b>is</b> significantly simplified comparing with previous methods that inevitably invoke many-body interactions.

5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E

Ionic <b>liquids</b> <b>are</b> regarded as “novel solvents” and have been gaining attention as alternatives to volatile molecular organic solvents. Ionic liquids have outstanding properties, such as negligible vapor pressure (no or limited evaporation or volatilization), low melting point, thermal stability, and ionic conductivity.

The synthesis of the low-cost and performance-effective ionic liquids using inexpensive raw materials is presented and characterized. Characterization was done using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning Differential Thermometry (DSC-TGA). Cost effective ionic <b>liquids</b> <b>were</b> synthesized and characterized and then compared to commercially available ionic liquids. Results for newly synthesized ionic liquids suggest that these cost effective ionic <b>liquids</b> <b>were</b> electroconductive and thermally stable when compared to the raw materials used for synthesis of ionic liquids.
