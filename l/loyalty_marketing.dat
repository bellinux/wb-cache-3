40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} <b>loyalty</b> <b>market</b> in the UK, to give IKANO Financial Services an understanding of their current position compared to competitors and to enhance IKANO‟s loyalty program services to gain a competitive edge in the market. Based upon literature review, new versions of competitor analysis and service analysis have been developed. The competitor analysis model helps in understanding what type of loyalty services are offered by Loyalty providers in the UK and gives a snapshot of IKANO‟s current position in the market. The service analysis model gives a snapshot of all the services that IKANO offers at present. It breaks down the services into different levels which can be further analysed to define a Unique Selling Point and gain a competitive edge in the market. Competitor analysis showed that IKANO lags behind the <b>loyalty</b> <b>market</b> and the {{major players in the}} UK majorly because the company does not provide key services like Real Time services and Mobile Apps services. Service Analysis model effectively points out the services that are automated/standardized by IKANO at present and what are the areas which can be automated/standardized upto a certain extent to effectively use resources available. Analysis of both the models collectively gives a picture of loyalty services in the UK and gives an idea of how IKANO can enhance their service offerings...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Retailer <b>loyalty</b> card <b>marketing</b> {{intelligence}} presents actual customer purchasing preferences, competitor {{activities and}} performance. Typically, extant literature implies that larger firms with formal marketing planning approaches {{will be more}} able to leverage it, structured as it is within a formalized statistical format. Small business literature {{on the other hand}} emphasizes their more informal approach to marketing planning. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to consider, for the first time, the potential relationship between retailer <b>loyalty</b> card <b>marketing</b> intelligence and small business market orientation. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual model is developed which diagrammatically interprets how retailer <b>loyalty</b> card <b>marketing</b> intelligence can relate to small business market orientation. Propositions provide a basis for further discussion with applied and research implications. Findings – A pertinent aspect of the conceptualization is the role of small business owner-manager insight and intuition within an experiential learning context. A complementary relationship is posited in the leveraging of retailer <b>loyalty</b> card <b>marketing</b> intelligence to enhance small business market orientation, which with higher levels of entrepreneurship orientation can lead to positive organizational outcomes, such as facilitating more successful and informed engagement with larger suppliers. Originality/value – The paper addresses the increasing pressure small businesses face in dealing with retailer <b>loyalty</b> card <b>marketing</b> intelligence. Generally, literature has yet to adequately address marketing planning implications for firms. The informal/formal tension when considering small businesses presents a particularly interesting area of conceptual development, integrating market orientation literature and also recent developments which point to interaction between market and entrepreneurship orientations. This paper therefore provides a basis for a new small business research agenda in an area which is highly topical and important, with a synthesis of the extant literature in developing a conceptualization and propositions. The conceptualization and propositions can facilitate the development of new research and thinking in this potentially fruitful area of future enquiry...|$|R
