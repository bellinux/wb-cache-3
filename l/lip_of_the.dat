The antenna was mounted on the forward <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors.

5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached the <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergency spillway (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{displacement field}} along <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> an internal crack in an infinite elastic plate, submitted to pure shear, was undertaken, {{based on the}} exact solution. It was shown that <b>the</b> in-plane components <b>of</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack consist of: (i) a linear term, normal to <b>the</b> initial axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack, which brings this axis to its effective position. The angle λ formed by this axis and <b>the</b> initial axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack has a tangent given by tan λ = 2 σ∞ E, where σ∞ is the normal stress applied to the plate at infinity and E <b>the</b> elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material, and (ii) a parallel to the initial axis component of displacement, which is proportional to <b>the</b> square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance from <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack. This component for pure shear is always negative, making <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack overlap each other. If to these in-plane displacements the out-of-plane component is added, <b>the</b> topography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack in pure shear is presenting a ravine with negative slopes, which terminates to two hills around the crack tips, which are sliced in halves along the crack-axis. Either half of each hill is replaced by its mirror surface, relative to the undeformed lateral faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate. It was shown that <b>the</b> overlapping <b>of</b> <b>lips</b> starts with <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> any shearing load and develops up to an eventual creation of plastic enclaves at <b>the</b> tips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack. Conditions for zero relative displacement between the respective lips were established, which consist in adding a complementary lateral tensile load, whose magnitude depends on the applied load to the plate. © 1986...|$|R

25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E
