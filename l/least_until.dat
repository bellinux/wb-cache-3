5|$|As Christianity {{became the}} {{dominant}} religion, Attic {{began to be}} used in Christian writings in addition to and often interspersed with koine Greek. Nonetheless, from the 6th at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the 12th century, Attic remained entrenched in the educational system; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods.|$|E
5|$|Brampton Manor {{probably}} {{stood on}} the site of the New Road Industrial Estate. After the manor was destroyed the site was known as Brampton Field, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the 18th Century, and indeed one of the streets of the housing estate which covers the site today is named Brampton Field.|$|E
5|$|Democratic {{committee}} member John Conyers questioned {{whether it was}} appropriate for the comedian to appear before Congress {{and asked him to}} leave the hearing. Though Colbert offered to depart at the direction of the committee chairwoman, Lofgren requested that he stay at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> all opening testimony had been completed, whereupon Conyers withdrew his request.|$|E

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance {{in terms of}} both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{a new law}} {{was passed}} (the Education and Skills Act 2008).

5|$|By the 4th {{century the}} Roman {{province}} of Britannia was converted to Christianity {{and had even}} produced its own heretic in Pelagius. Britain sent three bishops to the Synod of Arles in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters. Lead baptismal basins and other artefacts bearing Christian symbols testify to a growing Christian presence at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> about 360.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|It {{is such a}} dirty trick {{that even}} Falco wants no part of it, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> Hunsecker {{promises}} {{to take a long}} vacation from his powerful column and turn it over to Falco in his absence.

5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E
5|$|The British thus {{gained a}} respite, and peace lasted at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the time Gildas was writing: that is, for perhaps forty or fifty years, {{from around the}} end of the 5th century until midway through the sixth. Shortly after Gildas's time the Anglo-Saxon advance was resumed, and by the late 6th century nearly all of {{southern}} England was {{under the control of the}} continental invaders.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL although the results have been intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
5000|$|Ca. 1919, Cushman sold See W. See to T. K. Morris, who renamed her Pequest. She {{had many}} name changes in succeedung decades, being known {{successively}} as Rosalie IV, Jonbob II (she {{is known to}} have borne this name from at <b>least</b> 1950 <b>until</b> at <b>least</b> 1955), Mar-Sue II (from at <b>least</b> 1960 <b>until</b> at <b>least</b> 1975), and Misty Isle (at least in 1977).

5|$|The {{stakes were}} raised in the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|The vice {{activities}} {{on the island and}} in the county were not unique in Texas. San Antonio had perhaps the second most infamous red-light district in the early 20th century and most major cities in the state had significant vice activities at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> mid-century, though most went into decline before Galveston's did. During the Open Era Galveston's vice industries dominated, while most other areas of the state were at times forced to crack down on vice due to public pressure.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|A racecourse lay in Crookesmoor from at <b>least</b> 1711 <b>until</b> 1781, {{when the}} land was enclosed. The racecourse had a {{sizeable}} grandstand, lying near Fulwood Road.|$|R
