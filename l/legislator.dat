40|$|Using {{a survey}} of state <b>legislators</b> in Iowa, Georgia, and California, this article {{examines}} how often leg-islators use the Internet {{as a source for}} policy information, and which <b>legislators</b> tend to make more fre-quent use of the Internet to gather information. The author finds that there is tremendous variation as to how often state <b>legislators</b> use the Internet to gather policy information. The author did not find evi-dence of a digital divide as it pertains to urbanism, or gender. It appears that a digital divide remains, however, between young and old legislators—with younger <b>legislators</b> using the Internet more often— and <b>legislators</b> in California versus <b>legislators</b> in Georgia and Iowa. In the end, it appears that the digi-tal divide in the state legislature is shrinking. As the older generation of <b>legislators</b> retires, the author expects that the Internet will become a more institutionalized part of the information environment of state <b>legislators...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{are large}} inequities {{in the amount}} of {{campaign}} money raised by state <b>legislators,</b> as <b>legislators</b> in the top 10 % raise over six times more than <b>legislators</b> in the bottom 10 %. Do these inequities affect bill outcomes in state legislatures? Are resource rich <b>legislators</b> more or less successful policy-makers? This paper considers two possible effects. First, contributions could provide a mandate for a <b>legislator’s</b> policy agenda such that campaign money increases legislative success. Alternatively, maintaining a large network of donors might divert a <b>legislator’s</b> time and energy away from the chamber such that contributions inhibit legislative success. An analysis of a large data set of over 55, 000 bills in four lower chambers supports the mandate hypothesis. Top fundraisers sponsor more bills, longer bills, {{and are more likely to}} have those bills become law than <b>legislators</b> with less campaign money...|$|R
40|$|As the {{capacity}} for rural communities -to provide education services decreases, educators are looking towards notate <b>legislators</b> for support. Jailed (1984) reported that <b>legislators</b> must become more familiar with vocational education as they address {{the economic and social}} needs of the future. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the perceptions held by Iowa and Nebraska <b>Legislators</b> regarding secondary and adult agricultural education programs conducted within the public school system. The population for this study consisted of state <b>legislators</b> in Iowa and Nebraska. Seventy <b>legislators,</b> thirty-five from each state, were randomly selected for the study. <b>Legislators</b> were mailed a survey containing twenty-two attitudinal statements relating to agricultural education. <b>Legislators</b> were asked to rate -the importance of the current situation and future direction of each statement. Comparisons were made between the different demographic groups of <b>legislators.</b> Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s Power Analysis was used to determine meaningful difference at a large effect size. Based on the data gathered, the following results were found. A meaningful difference was not observed between <b>legislators</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the current situation and future direction of agricultural education. While agriculture and general education issues were perceived as being of relatively high importance in Iowa and Nebraska, agricultural education was perceived as being of lower importance. <b>Legislators</b> who had ties with agriculture were more supportive of issues relating to agricultural education. The role of the secondary vocational agriculture program was seen as being limited to rural high schools. <b>Legislators</b> seemed not to be familiar with the other aspects of agricultural education programs. <b>Legislators</b> were not supportive of any changes in the source of funding for educational programs. While they were supportive of the general funding of education, they did not support funding for agricultural education. The above findings indicated that changes in the amount of support from state <b>legislators</b> will not come from within. The agricultural education profession must initiate programs to increase <b>legislator’s</b> awareness of the needs and benefits of agricultural education...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Do state <b>legislators</b> {{believe there}} is a proper balance of power between the {{governor}} and the legislature? The research uses both individual and institutional factors to explain the variation in <b>legislators</b> 2 ̆ 7 opinions. Methods. The results of a mail survey sent to all <b>legislators</b> in nine states were used as the basic data source for the study. The dependent variable required the <b>legislators</b> to indicate if a proper balance of power existed. Hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) was performed. Results. A sizeable majority of <b>legislators</b> (66 percent) thought there was a proper balance of power between the governor and the legislature. HGLM found no discernible role for a number of state-level characteristics. The analysis did uncover a negative relationship between perceived balance of power and whether the governor had previously served in the legislature. Female <b>legislators</b> were more likely to express a lower level of satisfaction with the balance of power than their male counterparts. The partisan relationship between <b>legislators</b> and governors as well as the majority/minority status of the <b>legislators</b> proved to be most important in explaining <b>legislators</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. Conclusions. Contrary to popular opinion, the relationships between the two branches of government are not inherently contentious. <b>Legislators</b> from the governor 2 ̆ 7 s party were most likely to assess the relationship as proper...|$|R
