40|$|Background Occupational {{allergen}} {{exposure assessment}} usually requires airborne dust sampling at the worksite followed by dust extraction and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis at the laboratory. Use of semiquantitative <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> (LFIAs) may allow a more rapid detection procedure with direct on-site demonstration of a bioallergen exposure hazard. Objective In a field study, we evaluated a recently developed LFIA for fungal alpha-amylase, an important bakery allergen. Methods Airborne and surface dust (wipe) samples and samples from flours and baking additives {{used at the}} workplace were collected in 5 industrial bakeries and tested in the LFIA for fungal amylase. For comparison, amylase was measured in sample eluates with the reference EIA method. Results Sensitivity of the LFIA was 1 to 10 ng/mL, and of EIA, 25 pg/mL. In LFIA, most flour samples, 84 % of wipe samples, 26 % of personal airborne dust, {{and none of the}} 26 ambient air dust samples produced a visible reaction. Wipe samples from dough-making areas and flour samples gave the strongest reactions. All extracts with > 5 ng allergen per milliliter showed a positive LFIA reaction. Conclusion The LFIA for fungal amylase is an easy and rapid method to demonstrate the allergen directly at the worksite in less than 10 to 20 minutes. Similar LFIA methods may be used for other occupational allergens in other work environments. Clinical implications <b>Lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> for occupational allergens may be of great value in occupational hygiene surveys to demonstrate directly to workers and supervisors the hazards of work-related bioallergen exposure...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePaper-based {{detection}} {{devices such}} as <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> (LFIAs) are inexpensive, rapid, user-friendly and therefore highly promising for providing resource-limited settings with point-of-care diagnostics. Recently, this biosensing field has trended towards three-dimensional microfluidic devices and multiplexed assay platforms. However, many multiplexed paper-based biosensors implement methods incompatible with the conventional LFIA carrier material: nitrocellulose. It thus tends {{to be replaced by}} cellulose. This major material change implies to undertake a covalent immobilization of biomolecules onto cellulose which preserves their biological activity. In this perspective, the immobilization process elaborated in this study is entirely biocompatible. While antibody immobilization onto cellulose usually requires chemical modifications of either the biomolecule and/or the membrane, the light-based procedure presented here was performed without any chemical photolinker. Native biomolecules have been successfully immobilized onto paper sheets which therefore enable to perform LFIAs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{demonstrate}} device functionality of 3 -D paper-based, multiplex platforms, µPADs, {{without the use of}} coupling agents between layers. Previously, these platforms were fabricated with double-sided tape and cellulose powder to try to augment proper fluid routing, but difficulties with this method occurred. An acrylic housing unit with strategically placed pressure tabs was designed to aid horizontal and vertical fluid routing through the platform, thus eliminating the inconsistencies associated with coupling agents. Channel characterization studies, a COMSOLTM simulation, and development time studies were performed to aid device design and demonstrate device functionality. The implementation of this µPAD platform as a diagnostic instrument was validated via <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> utilizing both biotinylated antibodies and biotinylated aptamers as capture reagents.

Effective {{antibiotic}} treatment of inhalational anthrax requires early diagnosis; the further the disease has progressed, the less the likelihood for cure. Current means for diagnosis such as blood culture require several days to a result and require advanced laboratory infrastructure. An alternative approach to diagnosis is detection of a Bacillus anthracis antigen that is shed into blood and can be detected by rapid immunoassay. The goal {{of the study was}} to evaluate detection of poly-γ-D-glutamic acid (PGA), the capsular antigen of B. anthracis, as a biomarker surrogate for blood culture in a rabbit model of inhalational anthrax. The mean time to a positive blood culture was 26 ± 5. 7 h (mean ± standard deviation), whereas the mean time to a positive ELISA was 22 ± 4. 2 h; P = 0. 005 in comparison with blood culture.

40|$|The {{amalgamation}} of nanotechnology {{and biology}} {{has led to}} the development ofnew types of hybrid materials that are expected to produce major advances in areas such as materials science, therapeutics and diagnostics. One of the most promising developments is the use ofnanoparticles (NPs) as labels for the detection of analytes in biological assays. The aim of this research project was to prepare gold nanoparticle (GNP) labels for use in such assays. In chapter 1, the optical properties and the use of GNPs in homogeneous and heterogeneous colorimetric assays are reviewed. In chapter 2 a simple conjugation method is introduced that not only allows almost any biological molecule or hapten to be attached to GNPs but also allows the user to control or vary the mean number of molecules per particle. In this method a high molecular weight aminodextran polymer is functionalized with the molecule of choice and chemical attachment groups that are used to covalently anchor the polymer to the GNPs. This method was used to conjugate biotin and 1125 functionalized dextrans to GNPs. These functionalized dextrans were then used to investigate the conjugation procedure in more_detail. Results from GNP titrations and microbead assays demonstrate that the minimum amount of functionalized dextran required to prevent salt-induced flocculation ofthe GNPs (equivalence point) is the amount required to coat all of the GNPs and at this point there is no free functionalized dextran in solution. In chapter 3 the described method was used to conjugate different numbers DNP haptens to GNPs and then these labels were used in non-traditional reagent-limited <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays.</b> The number of molecules per GNP is varied by simply adjusting the stoichiometry of reagents in the dextran functionalization reaction. Controlling the number of molecules per particle can have important consequences on the sensitivity of a biological assay. Results showed that when the number of DNP molecules per particle decreased, there was an increase in the sensitivity of the assay. Furthermore when the results from these immunoassays were compared to those obtained from traditional reagent-limited <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays,</b> the nontraditional format proved to be over 50 % more sensitive. In chapter 4 the conjugation method was used to attach oligonucleotides to GNPs for use in a nucleic acids <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> (NALF) device. Although NALF devices are available commercially, detection is usually achieved with the use of antibodies or haptens which can be both problematic and expensive. In addition, many of these devices have issues with sensitivity and are often interfaced with complicated target amplification / purification protocols. In chapter 4 an antibody / hapten independent NALF device is described {{that can be used to}} detect the un-purified products from a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification protocol.

Bone turnover markers need to be measured more easily for general use. Lateral flow-based immunoassay would be an appropriate method for this context. This study was performed to investigate the precision of a newly developed lateral flow-based immunoassay for measuring the urinary NTx and serum CTx, and their correlations with ELISA measurements. Urine NTx and serum CTx concentrations were determined by photoscan of newly developed strips, using a lateral flow-based immunoassay for 36 subjects (mean age 66. 2 years, SD 7. 5 years; four males and 32 females). Repeated measurement of urinary NTx and serum CTx were performed three times, using this technology for a precision test. The correlation of the lateral flow-based immunoassay with the ELISA measurements was analyzed. Precision of the newly developed <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> based <b>immunoassay</b> was 0. 974 (ICC, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 955 to 0. 986) and 0. 995 (ICC, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 991 to 0. 997) for urinary NTx and serum CTx, respectively.

40|$|Paper-based <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> (LFIAs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely used point-of-care (PoC) devices; however, their {{application}} in early disease diagnostics is often limited due to insufficient sensitivity for the requisite sample sizes and the short time frames of PoC testing. To address this, we developed a serum-stable, nanoparticle catalyst-labeled LFIA with a sensitivity surpassing that of both current commercial and published sensitivities for paper-based detection of p 24, one of the earliest and most conserved biomarkers of HIV. We report the synthesis and characterization of porous platinum core–shell nanocatalysts (PtNCs), which show high catalytic activity when exposed to complex human blood serum samples. We explored the application of antibody-functionalized PtNCs with strategically and orthogonally modified nanobodies with high affinity and specificity toward p 24 and established the key larger nanoparticle size regimes needed for efficient amplification and performance in LFIA. Harnessing the catalytic amplification of PtNCs enabled naked-eye detection of p 24 spiked into sera in the low femtomolar range (ca. 0. 8 pg·mL– 1) and the detection of acute-phase HIV in clinical human plasma samples in under 20 min. This provides a versatile absorbance-based and rapid LFIA with sensitivity capable of significantly reducing the HIV acute phase detection window. This diagnostic may be readily adapted for detection of other biomolecules as an ultrasensitive screening tool for infectious and noncommunicable diseases and can be capitalized upon in PoC settings for early disease detection...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite their ease of use, <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> (LFIAs) often {{suffer from}} poor {{quantitative}} discrimination and low analytical sensitivity. We explored {{the use of}} a novel class of europium chelate-loaded silica nanoparticles as labels to overcome these limitations. METHODS: Antibodies were covalently conjugated onto europium chelate-loaded silica nanoparticles with dextran as a linker. The resulting conjugates were used as labels in LFIA for detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We performed quantification with a digital camera and Adobe Photoshop software. We also used 286 clinical samples to compare the proposed method with a quantitative ELISA. RESULTS: A detection limit of 0. 03 mu g/L was achieved, which was 100 times lower than the colloidal gold-based LFIAs and lower than ELISA. A precise quantitative dose-response curve was obtained, and the linear measurement range was 0. 05 - 3. 13 mu g/L, within which the CVs were 2. 3 %- 10. 4 %. Regression analysis of LFIA on ELISA results gave: log (LFIA) = - 0. 14 log (ELISA) + 1. 03 mu g/L with r = 0. 99 for the quantification of HBsAg in 35 positive serum samples. Complete agreement was observed for the qualitative comparison of 286 clinical samples assayed with LFIA and ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Europium chelate-loaded silica nano-particle labels have great potential to improve LFIAs, making them useful not only for simple screening applications but also for more sensitive and quantitative immunoassays.

40|$|Fungal {{alpha-amylase}} is a flour supplement {{which is}} added {{to improve the quality}} of bakery products. Various studies have shown that exposure to this enzyme is an important risk factor for the development of bakers allergy and this allergy is reported to be one of the most frequent causes of occupational asthma. A rapid assay was developed to monitor exposure to occupational allergens directly at the workplace. The sensitivity of the developed assay is 0. 32 ng amylase mL¿ 1 in a buffer system with the commercially available alpha-amylase preparation Fungamyl 1600 S as the standard. Initial validation tests (n = 33) were performed with airborne and settled dust from an industrial bakery. The new <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassay</b> detected amylase in 22 of the 26 samples regarded as positive in an enzyme immunoassay, and was negative for all seven enzyme immunoassay-negative samples, while the four lateral flow immunoassay-negative/enzyme immunoassay-positive samples all had levels below 2 ng mL¿ 1. The sensitivity of 2 ng mL¿ 1 of the amylase <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassay</b> is sufficient for first screening purposes and, therefore, this simple and rapid assay may allow direct on-site demonstration of work-related hazards of bio-allergen exposure. This would be particularly useful in occupational hygiene practice, especially in traditional or small-scale bakeries which lack the technological skills for testing the exposure to respiratory allergen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (STEC) cause food-borne {{illness that}} may be fatal. STEC strains enumerate two types of potent Shiga toxins (Stx 1 and Stx 2) that are {{responsible}} for causing diseases. It is important to detect the E. coli O 157 and Shiga toxins in food to prevent outbreak of diseases. We describe the development of two multi-analyte antibody-based <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> (LFIA); one for the detection of Stx 1 and Stx 2 and one for the detection of E. coli O 157 {{that may be}} used simultaneously to detect pathogenic E. coli O 157 :H 7. The LFIA strips were developed by conjugating nano colloidal gold particles with monoclonal antibodies against Stx 1 and Stx 2 and anti-lipid A antibodies to capture Shiga toxins and O 157 antigen, respectively. Our results indicate that the LFIA for Stx is highly specific and detected Stx 1 and Stx 2 within three hours of induction of STEC with ciprofloxacin at 37 ˝C. The limit of detection for E. coli O 157 LFIA was found to be 105 CFU/mL in ground beef spiked with the pathogen. The LFIAs are rapid, accurate and easy to use and do not require sophisticated equipment or trained personnel. Following the assay, colored bands on the membrane develop for end-point detection. The LFIAs may be used for screening STEC in food and the environment...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 <b>Lateral</b> <b>flow</b> {{diagnostics}} are {{the most}} common and most commercially successful form of point-of-care diagnostic. The first and most prevalent <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay is the pregnancy test. <b>Lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assays are low cost, rapid, and simple to operate. However, <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>immunoassays</b> have been limited in their success due to poor performance related to an inability to detect low analyte concentrations. In this thesis, we aim to create a high-performance point-of-care immunoassay by integrating sample concentration into a sandwich immunoassay. We use a method called isotachophoresis (ITP) to enhance the detection of low analyte concentrations in the <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> format. We present the performance characteristics for a <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> enhanced with ITP diagnostic (LID) assay for the detection of strep throat and the detection of chlamydia. We additionally put forth a method for investigating parameters that are important for the performance of LID assays. Lastly, we validate the LID format in clinically relevant samples. We show a limit-of-detection of strep throat cells in clean buffer to be 2000 CFU/mL, an improvement of more than 100 -fold over a commercial <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay. This assay also demonstrates an improvement in the analytical sensitivity when compared to the commercial assay. We also present the detection of chlamydia in the LID format demonstrating a 3 -fold improvement over a commercial <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay. The dramatic difference in improvement when comparing the streptococcus assay to chlamydia motivated an investigation into the parameters that are important when using isotachophoresis to enhance the performance of a <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay. For designing the chemistry of a LID assay, it is important to investigate the ionic strength (IS), pH and lysis chemistry. Each of these parameters affect the binding of antibody to antigen, as well as the performance of the ITP. Designing with both the binding and ITP performance in mind can be difficult. We present guidelines for obtaining and utilizing these parameter effects in the chemistry design. We develop a model to calculate the limit-of-detection for <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> and LID assays from antibody and assay parameters. This model shows that the benefit of a LID assay can be limited by non-specific binding between label and capture antibodies. The model finds that ITP is the most beneficial to antibody pairs with low non-specific affinities. Finally, we test the strep throat LID assay in contrived clinical samples to validate the compatibility of the format with clinical samples. Our assay is able to successfully differentiate positive from negative samples in these clinically relevant samples. Our assay identifies all positive samples in the expected clinical range...|$|R
