50|$|Countercurrent {{chromatography}} (CCC) {{is a type}} of <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography,</b> {{where both}} the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. The operating principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting of an open tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field to act on the column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.|$|E
50|$|Countercurrent {{chromatography}} (CCC, also counter-current chromatography) {{is a form}} of <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography</b> {{that uses}} a liquid stationary phase that is held in place by centrifugal force and is used to separate, identify, and quantify the chemical components of a mixture. In its broadest sense, countercurrent chromatography encompasses a collection of related liquid chromatography techniques that employ two immiscible liquid phases without a solid support. The two liquid phases come in contact with each other as at least one phase is pumped through a column, a hollow tube or a series of chambers connected with channels, which contains both phases. The resulting dynamic mixing and settling action allows the components to be separated by their respective solubilities in the two phases. A wide variety of two phase solvent systems consisting of at least two immiscible liquids may be employed to provide the proper selectivity for the desired separation.|$|E

This review looks at the recent developments in centrifugal <b>liquid-liquid</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> using aqueous two-phase solvent (ATPS) systems, a gentle host medium for biologics, and the prospect for scale-up and eventual manufacture of high value pharmaceutical products...|$|R
50|$|Chemical {{potentials}} {{are important}} in many aspects of equilibrium chemistry, including melting, boiling, evaporation, solubility, osmosis, partition coefficient, <b>liquid-liquid</b> extraction and <b>chromatography.</b> In each case there is a characteristic constant which {{is a function of}} the chemical potentials of the species at equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|Ginkolides A - C were {{isolated}} {{from a large}} scale methanolic extraction followed by <b>liquid-liquid</b> partitions, column <b>chromatography</b> and repeated crystallizations. The molecular formulas were determined by high resolution mass spectrometry, and the overall structures by IR and NMR spectroscopic analysis and extensive derivitization techniques.|$|R
50|$|Standard column {{chromatography}} {{consists of a}} solid stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase, while gas chromatography (GC) uses a solid or liquid stationary phase on a solid support and a gaseous mobile phase. By contrast, in <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography,</b> both the mobile and stationary phases are liquid. The contrast is, however not as stark as it first appears. In reversed-phase chromatography, for example, the stationary phase {{can be regarded as}} a liquid which is immobilized by chemical bonding to a micro-porous silica solid support. In countercurrent chromatography centrifugal or gravitational forces immobilize the stationary liquid layer. By eliminating solid supports, permanent adsorption of the analyte onto the column is avoided, and a high recovery of the analyte can be achieved. The countercurrent chromatography instrument is easily switched between normal phase chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography simply by changing the mobile and stationary phases. With {{column chromatography}}, the separation potential is limited by the commercially available stationary phase media and its particular characteristics. Nearly any pair of immiscible solutions can be used in countercurrent chromatography provided that the stationary phase can be successfully retained.|$|E
5000|$|Chromatography methods {{changed little}} after Tsvet's work until the {{explosion}} of mid-20th century research in new techniques, particularly thanks {{to the work of}} Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge. By [...] "the marrying of two techniques, that of chromatography and that of countercurrent solvent extraction", Martin and Synge developed partition chromatography to separate chemicals with only slight differences in partition coefficients between two liquid solvents. [...] Martin, who had previously been working in vitamin chemistry (including attempts to purify vitamin E), began collaborating with Synge in 1938, brought his experience with equipment design to Synge's project of separating amino acids. After unsuccessful experiments with complex countercurrent extraction machines and <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography</b> methods where the liquids move in opposite directions, Martin hit on the idea of using silica gel in columns to hold water stationary while an organic solvent flows through the column. Martin and Synge demonstrated the potential of the methods by separating amino acids marked in the column by the addition of methyl red. [...] In a series of publications beginning in 1941, they described increasingly powerful methods of separating amino acids and other organic chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|The CCC {{separation}} {{process can be}} thought of as occurring in three stages: mixing, settling, and separation of the two phases (although they often occur continuously). Vigorous mixing of the phases is critical in order to maximize the interfacial area between them and enhance mass transfer. The analyte will distribute between the phases according to its partition coefficient which is also called the distribution coefficient, distribution constant, or partition ratio and is represented by P, K, D, Kc, or KD. The partition coefficient for an analyte in a particular biphasic solvent system is independent of the volume of the instrument, flow rate, stationary phase retention volume ratio and the g-force required to immobilize the stationary phase. The degree of stationary phase retention is a crucial parameter. Common factors that influence stationary phase retention are flow rate, solvent composition of the biphasic solvent system, and the g-force. The stationary phase retention is represented by the stationary phase volume retention ratio (Sf) which is the volume of the stationary phase divided by the total volume of the instrument. The settling time is a property of the solvent system and the sample matrix, both of which greatly influence stationary phase retention. [...] To most process chemists, the term [...] "countercurrent" [...] implies two immiscible liquids moving in opposing directions, as typically occurs in large centrifugal extractor units. With the exception of dual flow (see below) CCC, most countercurrent chromatography modes of operation have a stationary phase and a mobile phase. Even in this situation, countercurrent flows occur within the instrument column. Several researchers have proposed renaming both CCC & CPC to <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography,</b> but others feel the term [...] "countercurrent" [...] itself is a misnomer.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrophilic {{interaction}} chromatography (or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, HILIC) is {{a variant}} of normal phase liquid chromatography that partly overlaps with other chromatographic applications such as ion chromatography and reversed phase liquid chromatography. HILIC uses hydrophilic stationary phases with reversed-phase type [...] eluents. The name was suggested by Dr. Andrew Alpert in his 1990 paper on the subject. [...] He described the chromatographic mechanism for it as <b>liquid-liquid</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> where analytes elute in order of increasing polarity, a conclusion supported by a review and re-evaluation of published data.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCountercurrent {{chromatography}} (CCC) is a support-free <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography</b> using centrifugal {{fields to}} hold the liquid stationary phase. CCC has been widely applied in the separation of various natural and synthetic components {{using a variety of}} biphasic liquid systems. The related hexane or heptane/ethyl acetate/methanol or ethanol/water biphasic liquid systems demonstrated their significance in CCC. Gradient is difficult in CCC since any composition change in one phase induces a composition change of the other phase to maintain phase equilibrium. This work provides a new insight into linear gradient elution in CCC that is feasible with some biphasic liquid systems such as selected compositions of the hexane/ethyl acetate/ethanol/water systems. The equations modeling solute motion inside the CCC column are proposed. Particular compositions of the liquid system, namely the hexane/ethyl acetate/ethanol/water 8 : 2 :E:W compositions with E + W = 10, were studied from W = 1 to 9. They showed moderate changes in the upper organic phase compositions. The model is tested with the separation of tanshinones from the rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. Different linear solvent gradient profiles were experimentally performed between 8 : 2 : 5 : 5 and 8 : 2 : 3 : 7 compositions and the results were evaluated using the proposed model. Five tanshinones including dihydrotanshinone I, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, 1, 2 -dihydrotanshinquinone, and tanshinone IIA have been successfully separated (> 95 % purities) using a gradient profile optimized by the developed model. The gradient model can be used only with biphasic liquid systems in which one phase shows minimum composition changes when the other phase composition changes notably. This case is not the general case for biphasic liquid systems but can be applied with specific compositions of the quaternary hexane or heptane/ethyl acetate/methanol or ethanol/water most useful CCC liquid systems...|$|E

Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl acetate, isopropyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, <b>liquid-liquid</b> <b>chromatography</b> and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during cheese curing does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate. Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|E
40|$|Endopleura uchi (Huber) Cuatrec. is an Amazon species {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the treatment of inflammations and female disorders. Pure bergenin was isolated from the methanolic extract of bark of E. uchi, firstly by using <b>liquid-liquid</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> followed by column chromatography over Sephadex LH- 20 and then silica gel 60 flash chromatography. The structure of bergenin was identified {{on the basis of its}} NMR spectra. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity was determined by the measurement of the inhibitory concentration (IC) of bergenin against three key enzymes: COX- 1, COX- 2 (cyclooxygenases) and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2). These enzymes were selected because they are important targets for the discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs associated with the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. The IC 50 of bergenin for phopholipase A 2 was determined as 156. 6 µmol L- 1 and bergenin was not considered active as compared to the positive control, tioetheramide PC. Bergenin did not inhibit COX- 1 as well (IC 50 = 107. 2 µmol L- 1). However, bergenin selectively inhibited COX- 2 (IC 50 = 1. 2 µmol L- 1). Because of the use of E. uchi in traditional medicine, bergenin was quantified in teas prepared as prescribed in traditional medicine by RP-HPLC as being 3 % in the bark of E. uchi. The inhibitory activity towards COX- 2 is important, since selective inhibitors of COX- 2 have been clinically validated as anti-inflammatory therapeutics due to their enhanced gastrointestinal safety...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids are {{selectively}} {{released from}} white fat cells {{in accordance with}} well-defined rules relating their molecular structure and their mobilization rate, emphasizing the possible role of their physicochemical properties. Lipolysis is widely reported to work for conditions where only small amounts of substrate are available. We hypothesize that the preferential hydrolysis of a substrate fraction enriched in the most polar triacylglycerols (TAGs) reflects the pattern of selective fatty acid mobilization. Rat adipose tissue was first manipulated by dietary means to obtain {{a wide spectrum of}} fatty acids. Fat cell TAGs were separated into eight fractions according to polarity by <b>liquid-liquid</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> and their fatty acid proportions and compositions were determined by GLC. In the most polar TAG fractions, the relative enrichment of fatty acids (percentage in a TAG fraction divided by percentage in total TAGs) increased with the number of double bonds for a given chain length, whereas it decreased with increasing chain length for a given degree of unsaturation. The relative enrichment of highly mobilized fatty acids (16 - 20 carbon atoms and four or five double bonds) was very high (more than 2. 5) in the most polar TAG fractions, whereas that of weakly mobilized fatty acids (20 - 24 carbon atoms and no or one double bond) was very low (less than 0. 5). The relative enrichment of moderately mobilized fatty acids (comprising all the others) was close to unity. Our study shows that the relative enrichment of fatty acids in the most polar adipose tissue TAGs is consistent with their relative mobilization rates. This supports our hypothesis and raises the possibility that the molecular species of TAGs might be one of the regulating factors...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to gain further insight into {{the relationship between the}} exposed surfaces and the functional properties of antibodies and their complexes with antigens in solution. To study this relationship, a new technique, <b>liquid-liquid</b> partition <b>chromatography</b> (LLPC) in aqueous two-phase systems, was developed further with respect to sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility. The capacity of LLPC to compare the surface properties of antibodies in relation to their antigen specificity was explored. The usefulness of LLPC for examination of the events upon binding of antigen and for analysis of surface properties of antigen-antibody complexes in relation their structural/functional properties were studied. In this study, it was shown that LLPC in aqueous PEG-dextran two-phase systems offers the unique possibilities of comparing the overall surface properties of intact antibodies and antigen-antibody complexes in solution. A remarkable relationship between the surface of an antibody´s combining site and its chromatographic behaviour was found. LLPC provided the means to screen the antigen-binding sites of unliganded antibodies for differences/similarities in exposed surfaces even in those cases when the specificities of the antibodies were unknown. Our data suggest that antibodies may be regarded as being constructed of highly solvent-exposed, dominant CDRs of variable shape and size which, depending on the actual isotype, are grafted onto different scaffoldings of basically conserved structure. Moreover, different conformational (isomeric) forms of antibodies and enzymes could be detected and even separated using LLPC. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that LLPC could be used to examine the events upon binding of ligand by both antibodies and enzymes. The surface properties of antigen-antibody complexes were found to be dependent on the variable regions of the antibodies, the nature of the antigen, and/or possible conformational changes induced by ligand-binding...|$|R
