The stoat (Mustela erminea) became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000.

50|$|The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) {{is a small}} insectivorous mammal {{found in}} Europe and North Africa. It {{is the most common}} of the white-toothed shrews. This species is found along the Mediterranean, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Portugal; in addition, the Osorio shrew of the Canary island of Gran Canaria, {{originally}} described as a separate species (Crocidura osorio), was later discovered to be a population of introduced greater white-toothed shrew. Its preferred habitats are grassland and woodland. It is slightly larger than the <b>lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew</b> but otherwise very similar, and can often be distinguished only by close inspection of its teeth which are unpigmented.|$|E

Known as the [...] "Scilly shrew", the type specimen is held by the British Museum. The other mammals found on Gugh are feral cats, rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and possibly the house mouse (Mus musculus). Permanent monitoring stations, consisting of boxes with chocolate wax inside, have been set up around the coasts of both Gugh and St Agnes and a 50 m baiting grid will be set up around any signs of rats. As of 2015 the brown rat is most likely eradicated on the island.|$|E
50|$|The mammals of Moscow Oblast include badger, squirrel, beaver, otter, muskrat, stoat, Russian desman, raccoon dog, hedgehog, hare (mountain and European), shrews (common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew, <b>lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew,</b> Eurasian water shrew, etc.), weasel, fox, moose, wild boar, European mole, {{brown and}} black rats, marten, mice and voles (wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, house mouse, Eurasian harvest mouse, {{northern}} birch mouse, bank vole, field vole, tundra vole, European water vole), European mink, deer (roe, red, spotted), hazel and fat dormouse, and European polecat. At the borders there are occasional bears, lynxes and wolves. In the southern areas {{there are also}} speckled ground squirrel, dwarf hamster, great jerboa and beech marten. Some areas contain stable populations of imported animals, such as flying squirrel, American mink and Siberian roe deer. In the oblast, {{there are more than}} a dozen kinds of bat and moth.|$|E
5000|$|The Cyrenaica shrew {{is found}} in Mediterranean {{vegetation}} such as scrub and also in littoral and rocky areas. It is thought to occur in degraded habitats, and to be largely terrestrial and nocturnal. It is very {{closely related to the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew</b> and is likely to share that species rather sociable habits and to [...] "caravan", i.e. the young follow their mother in a line holding their predecessor's tail in their mouth so that the family stays together while foraging or seeking shelter. It seems to be relatively common and its skulls are frequently found in the pellets of owls collected from within their range. The group of shrews this species belongs to are also known as [...] "musk shrews" [...] because of the musky scented secretions they produce and use to scent mark their territories by dragging their bellies along the ground.|$|E

50|$|The red-toothed shrews of the {{subfamily}} Soricinae are one {{of three}} living subfamilies of shrews, along with Crocidurinae (<b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrews)</b> and Myosoricinae (African <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrews).</b> In addition, the family contains the extinct subfamilies Limnoecinae, Crocidosoricinae, Allosoricinae and Heterosoricinae. These species are typically found in North America, northern South America, Europe and northern Asia. The enamel of the tips of their teeth is reddish due to iron pigment. The iron deposits serve to harden the enamel and are concentrated in {{those parts of the}} teeth most subject to wear.|$|R
40|$|We sequenced 998 base pairs (bp) of {{mitochondrial}} DNA cytochrome b and 799 bp {{of nuclear}} gene BRCA 1 in the <b>Lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew</b> (Crocidura suaveolens group) over its geographic range from Portugal to Japan. The {{aims of the}} study were to identify the main clades within the group and respective refugia resulting from Pleistocene glaciations. Analyses revealed the Asian <b>lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew</b> (C shantungensis) as the basal clade, followed by a major branch of C suaveolens, subdivided sensu stricto into six clades, which split-up in the Upper Pliocene and Lower Pleistocene (1. 9 - 0. 9 Myr). The largest clade, occurring over a huge range from east Europe to Mongolia, shows evidence of population expansion after a bottleneck. West European clades originated from Iberian and Italo-Balkanic refugia. In the Near East, three clades evolved in an apparent hotspot of refugia (west Turkey, south-west and south-east of the Caucasus). Most clades include specimens of different morphotypes and the validity of many taxa, in the C suaveolens group has to be re-evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{studied the}} {{terrestrial}} micromammals {{living in the}} “Parco Natura Viva” and in some surrounding areas, near Bussolengo (province of Verona). Animals were captured alive by non selective, Ugglan-type traps, which allow the imprisonment of multiple specimens at a time. We identified 5 terrestrial mammal species, 3 Rodentia and 2 Insectivora: Wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, Brown rat Rattus norvegicus, Yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, <b>Lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew</b> Crocidura suaveolens and Bi-coloured white-toothed shrew Crocidura leucodon. The Wood mouse was found widely spread (310 contacts) {{both inside and outside}} the park, in wooded and meadow areas, occupied mostly by neglected grasslands and shrubs and next to an unmanaged wood strip. The Yellow-necked mouse was found only in one out of 11 surveyed areas (13 captures), characterized by xeric-termophile shrub species and butcher’s broom undergrowth. The Brown rat (19 contacts) was detected both in areas outside the park and on internal but impoverished ones (as those near the dunghill). <b>Lesser</b> <b>white-toothed</b> <b>shrew</b> (5 contacts) and Bi-coloured white-toothed shrew (1 contact) were found only outside the park or near its boundaries...|$|E
