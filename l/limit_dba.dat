40|$|Opencast and {{underground}} mining operations produce large quantities of dust as well noise due to increased mechanisation to augment production and enhance productivity {{to meet the demands}} of consumer industry. Exposure of miners to high concentrations of dust and noise may cause occupational health hazards like pneumoconiosis and noise induced hearing loss and other allied health risk. Health risk to miners from dust depends on dust size, concentration and duration of exposure whereas noise induced hearing loss depends on sound pressure level, frequency and exposure level of workers. Exposure of workers to dust concentrations and sound pressure levels beyond threshold limit values as prescribed limits by statutory enactments and guidelines may adversely affect the health of mine workers. To assess the status of dust concentrations and noise levels generated by various machines and exposure levels of workers, conduct of systematic dust and noise survey in mines is essential. It will help in assessing the situation vis-a-vis dust and noise standards so that effective dust and noise control strategies can be adopted to minimize their menace. Keeping this in view, this project work was undertaken to carry out dust and noise survey in an iron ore mine of SAIL. From dust and noise survey carried out in Bolani iron ore mines, it was observed that: -> The dust level at the mine site office was minimum (0. 14 mg/m 3) whereas the maximum dust level was found at the crusher plant area (3. 1 mg/m 3). The dust concentration at lump loading station, fine loading station, mine face and mine site office was less than safe working limit(3 mg/m 3) whereas at the washing plant and crusher plant area were found more than the safe working limit. -> The noise level at the secondary cone crusher was maximum (102. 2 dBA) whereas at the control room minimum (76. 2 dBA). The noise level at dumper, drill machine, drum scrubber, double deck screen and dewatering screen was more than 90 dBA which is maximum permissible limit for 8 hrs working period.

The exchange rate of 5 -dB was used in both study locations. Noise levels were measured using personal exposure noise dosimeters and a sound level meter. The hearing threshold levels were measured at baseline and then followed up at the first month (post-shift exposure) and again, at the sixth month (pre-shift exposure). Data on hearing threshold levels were measured using a manual audiometer. Hearing protection devices with appropriate noise reduction rate were used to reduce noise exposure among participants. The data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20. 0 for Windows. Data for participants were then imputed as per-protocol analysis and based on the intention-to-treat principle. Independent t-tests, Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, McNemar’s and repeated measures ANOVA were used in the statistical analysis. iv Results As per-protocol analysis, mean hearing threshold levels on right ear of participants at 3000 and 4000 Hz were statistically significantly lower in Factory 2 with exposure <b>limit</b> at 85 <b>dBA</b> compared to Factory 1 at 90 dBA, (3. 17; 95...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} a major {{environmental}} source of pollution in the whole planet, both in developed and in developing nations. The study being reported here {{has been carried out}} {{on one of the most}} busy and crowded streets in the downtown area of Kerman, located in south east of Iran, which have heavy traffic during the day. Total of 20 measuring points were selected along the main road and its 6 connecting streets. In this study the A-weighted continuous equivalent sound level values and statistical levels were manually measured at each site separately. The noise equivalent level varied between 66 to 79. 5 dBA. The results of the study established the fact that noise levels are more than the acceptable <b>limit</b> of 60 <b>dBA,</b> which is the daytime governmentally prescribed noise limit for residential-commercial areas. This paper also describes the reaction of the environmental noise of the city of Kerman. A total of 250 questionnaires were processed. The results of the interview questionnaire revealed the following items; (I) the main isolated noise source was traffic (50 %) and street noise (34 %); (II) 70 % of the people classified the noise in his/her street as “very high”; (III) 52 % and 48 % of the respondents answered that noise bother them more in morning and evening, respectively; (IV) 86 % and 86. 8 % of the subjects answered that traffic noise produce physicsl and psychological annoyance to them; (V) the main outcomes of exposure to noise were: irritability (40. 8 %), insomnia (24 %), difficulty in concentrating (16 %) and conservation disruption (16 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{industrial}} noise pollution and its effects on the blood pressure of workers during activities in textile factory in Ilam,which is situated in west of Iran. A cross-sectional study was performed on a group included 81 workers and 30 people as sample and control group, respectively. A questionnaire was filled out and then the other measurements including the total sound pressure level, weight, height, pulse, blood pressure and all the rest of medical examinations have been respectively done. The average sound pressure level measured for sample and control group was respectively (94. 86 ± 6. 63) and (61. 93 ± 4. 56) dBA. The result also showed that by taking mean values for each quantitative variable, statistically only the age has significant difference between opposing groups. Sound frequency analysis in A and C networks over a frequency range between 125 to 16000 Hz revealed a significant differences in such away that sound pressure level for the sample group was higher than the <b>limited</b> threshold (85 <b>dBA).</b>   Moreover, the results from the survey of the total sound pressure level in A –and C – weighted according to blood pressure status, BMI and age indicate a significant statistical correlation between the mentioned variables. A highly significant correlation was found by    test between the level of sound pressure, blood pressure status, BMI and the age group in different octave band center frequencies. It is concluded that planning for working hours of workers to decrease the noise exposure and employment of young workers with appropriate BMI may reduce the adverse effects of noise...|$|R
