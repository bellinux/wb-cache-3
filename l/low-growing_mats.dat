5|$|The only genus is Maihuenia, {{with two}} species, {{both of which}} form <b>low-growing</b> <b>mats.</b> It has some {{features}} that are primitive within the cacti. Plants have leaves, and crassulean acid metabolism is wholly absent.|$|E
50|$|Cushion plants form large, <b>low-growing</b> <b>mats</b> {{that can}} {{grow up to}} 3 m in diameter. The typical form is a compact mass of closely spaced stems with minimal apical {{dominance}} that terminate in individual rosettes. Each stem grows at a consistent rate {{so that no one}} rosette is more exposed {{than the rest of the}} cushion. Observations on senescence have concluded that cushion plants typically die en masse rather than individual rosettes dying at separate times. Underneath the living rosettes, the plants typically produce nonphotosynthetic material or allow previous leaves to die, creating an insulating effect.|$|E
50|$|Silky wilsonia is a <b>low-growing</b> <b>mat</b> forming species, {{growing to}} 10 cm tall. The plant {{is covered with}} short, white hairs imparting a silvery appearance. The small, crowded leaves are concave and {{overlapping}} and are 1.5 to 4 mm long and 2 to 3 mm long. White flowers appear between September and December in the species native range. These are followed by capsular fruits which are 3 mm long.|$|R
50|$|All {{the species}} of Benthamiella are <b>low-growing</b> {{cushions}} or <b>mats,</b> with small overlapping leaves, and flowers with short or no stems, appearing within or {{just above the}} leaves. The flowers are typical of those of the Solanaceae (nightshade family), being tubular with five free lobes at the end. Most species have white or pale yellow flowers, although deeper yellows are found and Benthamiella nordenskioldii may have flowers tinged with violet.|$|R
