5000|$|When the <b>LEP</b> <b>collider</b> started {{operation}} in August 1989 it accelerated the electrons and positrons {{to a total}} energy of 45 GeV each to enable production of the Z boson, which has a mass of 91 GeV.

At a Lorentz factor ( [...] = particle energy/rest mass = GeV/0.511 MeV) of over 200,000, LEP still holds the particle accelerator speed record, extremely close to the limiting speed of light. At the end of 2000, LEP was shut down and then dismantled in order to make room in the tunnel for the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).|$|E

50|$|Indirect {{searches}} for Z&prime;-bosons {{are carried out}} at electron-positron colliders, since these give access to high-precision measurements of {{the properties of the}} Standard Model Z-boson. The constraints come from mixing between the Z&prime; and the Z, and are model dependent because they depend not only on the Z&prime; mass but also its mixing with the Z. The current most stringent limits are from the CERN <b>LEP</b> <b>collider,</b> which constrains Z&prime;-bosons to be heavier than a few hundred GeV, for typical model parameters. The ILC will extend this reach up to 5 - 10 TeV depending on the model under consideration, providing complementarity with the LHC because it will offer measurements of additional properties of the Z&prime;-boson.|$|E
50|$|Until August 2008, {{the highest}} energy {{collider}} {{in the world}} was the Tevatron, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, in the United States. It accelerated protons and antiprotons to slightly less than 1 TeV of kinetic energy and collided them together. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been built at the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics (CERN), has roughly seven times this energy (so proton-proton collisions occur at roughly 14 TeV). It is housed in the 27 km tunnel which formerly housed the Large Electron Positron (<b>LEP)</b> <b>collider,</b> so it will maintain the claim as the largest scientific device ever built. The LHC will also accelerate heavy ions (such as lead) up to an energy of 1.15 PeV.|$|E
5000|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{an oblique}} correction {{refers to a}} particular type of radiative correction to the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Oblique corrections are defined in four-fermion scattering processes, ( [...] + [...] → [...] + [...] ) at the CERN <b>LEP</b> <b>collider.</b> There are three classes of radiative corrections to these processes: vacuum polarization corrections, vertex corrections, and box corrections. The vacuum polarization corrections are referred to as oblique corrections, since they only affect the mixing and propagation of the gauge bosons and they do not depend on which type of fermions appear in the initial or final states. (The vertex and box corrections, which depend on the identity of the initial and final state fermions, are called nonoblique corrections.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{evidence}} for electroweak radiative corrections not contained in α(mZ) is examined. At low energies {{there is very}} strong evidence {{in the analysis of}} the unitarity of the CKM matrix. At <b>LEP</b> and <b>collider</b> experiments the current direct signals are not strong, but there is substantial indirect evidence, which will likely become sharper when mt is determined. The advantage of using (∆r) res as a measure of these effects is emphasized. In order to improve the direct evidence, more accurate measurements of mW and the on–resonance asymmetries are indicated. 1 The presence in electroweak physics of large corrections associated with the running of α at the vector boson scale was emphasized long ago [1]. The detailed analysis of electroweak corrections not described by the running of α is also a matter of long standing among particle physicists [2 – 5]. Recent discussions of signals for the latter effects have focussed on <b>LEP</b> and <b>collider</b> studies [6, 7]. On the basis of the directly measured values of mW and mZ, Hioki conclude...|$|R

50|$|Hanson {{received}} her PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973.She spent sixteen years at SLAC, {{first as a}} research assistant {{and then as a}} permanent staff member, working on the SPEAR electron-positron collider. Whilst there, Hanson participated in the discovery of the J/psi meson and tau lepton. Most notably, her work led to the first evidence for quark jet production in electron-positron annihilation, for which she was awarded the 1996 Panofsky Prize with Roy Schwitters. Subsequently, her research at electron-positron facilities has taken place at the PEP storage ring and Linear Collider at SLAC and on the OPAL experiment at the <b>LEP</b> <b>collider</b> at CERN, where she served as Physics Coordinator. She currently performs studies for a future muon accelerator facility, {{and is a member of}} the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E
5000|$|A {{particularly}} striking {{feature of}} these events, which were first observed at DESY and studied {{in great detail}} by experiments at the <b>LEP</b> <b>collider,</b> is their consistency with the Lund string model. The model indicates that [...] "strings" [...] of low-energy gluons will form most strongly between the quarks and the high-energy gluons, and that the [...] "breaking" [...] of these strings into new quark-antiquark pairs (part of the hadronization process) will result in some [...] "stray" [...] hadrons between the jets (and in the same plane). Since the quark-gluon interaction is stronger than the quark-quark interaction, such hadrons will be observed much less frequently between the two quark jets. As a result, the model predicts that stray hadrons will not appear {{between two of the}} jets, but will appear between each of them and the third. This is precisely what is observed.|$|E
5000|$|The S and T {{parameters}} are both affected by varying {{the mass of}} the Higgs boson (recall that the zero point of S and T is defined relative to a reference value of the Standard Model Higgs mass). Before the Higgs-like boson was discovered at the LHC, experiments at the CERN <b>LEP</b> <b>collider</b> set a lower bound of 114 GeV on its mass. If we assume that the Standard Model is correct, a best fit value of the Higgs mass ccould be extracted from the S, T fit. The best fit was near the LEP lower bound, and the 95% confidence level upper bound was around 200 GeV.http://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/ Thus the measured mass of 125-126 GeV fits comfortably in this prediction, suggesting the Standard Model may be a good description up to energies past the TeV ( [...] = 1,000 GeV) scale.|$|E

The deflection of the beams due to the beam-beam interaction has been mea-sured using orbit monitors located close to the interaction points. The dependence of the beam-beam deflection on the transverse distance between the beams has been used to optimise the overlap of the beams in the vertical plane and to measure the beam sizes at the interaction points. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been a massive endeavour spanning almost 30 years from conception to commissioning. Building the machine with the highest possible energy (7 [*]TeV) in the existing large electron–positron (<b>LEP)</b> <b>collider</b> tunnel of 27 [*]km circumference and with a tunnel diameter of only 3. 8 [*]m has required considerable innovation.
