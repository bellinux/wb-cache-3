40|$|The {{following}} {{article examines}} <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> among indentured East Indian women in British Guiana (now Guyana). The {{research shows that}} <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> among indentured East Indian women were not as broad as those among indentured East Indian men. The main reasons for this are that Indian women were recruited from the lower ranks of Indian society, which stymied <b>leadership</b> <b>roles,</b> and the authoritarian structure of the plantation system, which supported patriarchal trends. Moreover, the colonial records do not reveal <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> among Indian women because the records are based on imperial domination and exploitation, reflecting anecdotal rather than analytical evidence. The article shows {{that in spite of}} restrictions, indentured Indian women did engage in <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> on the sugar plantations but were not as open about these roles as their male counterparts were. Nonetheless, their engagement in <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> was instrumental in turning adverse circumstances to their advantage, and they used strategies that were not altogether obvious to the supporters of patriarchy...|$|R

Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994.

5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out as {{significant}} political figures, the more prominent {{of whom was}} Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury.

One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E
