Data from human running experiments are processed, analyzed and split into the two domains: stance phase and flight phase. By examining this data, we present a set of outputs, i. e., functions of the kinematics, which appear to represent human running; moreover, we show that this output data can be described by the time-solution to a linear spring-mass-damper—termed the canonical <b>locomotion</b> <b>function.</b> This observation motivates {{the construction of a}} human-inspired optimization that determines the parameters of the canonical <b>locomotion</b> <b>function</b> that provide the best fit of the human data while simultaneously enforcing partial hybrid zero dynamics, i. e., that the human outputs track the canonical locomotion functions even through impacts. The main result is a method for numerically solving this optimization problem that prov-ably results in stable robotic running. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the “human-like ” robotic running obtained through this procedure. I...|$|E

40|$|In nature, {{a variety}} of limbless {{locomotion}} patterns flourish from the small or basic life form (Escherichia coli, the amoeba, etc.) to the large or intelligent creatures (e. g., slugs, starfishes, earthworms, octopuses, jellyfishes, and snakes). Many bioinspired soft robots based on locomotion have been developed in the past decades. In this work, based on the kinematics and dynamics of two representative locomotion modes (i. e., worm-like crawling and snake-like slithering), we propose a broad set of innovative designs for soft mobile robots through simple mechanical principles. Inspired by and go beyond existing biological systems, these designs include 1 -D (dimensional), 2 -D, and 3 -D robotic locomotion patterns enabled by simple actuation of continuous beams.

The present study investigated the possible role of GDNF in injured spinal cords following transection injury (T 9 –T 10) in adult rats. The locomotor function recovery of animals by the BBB (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan) scale score showed that hindlimb support and stepping function increased gradually from 7 days post operation (dpo) to 21 dpo. However, the <b>locomotion</b> <b>function</b> in the hindlimbs decreased effectively in GDNF-antibody treated rats. GDNF immunoreactivty in neurons in the ventral horn of the rostral stump was stained strongly at 3 and 7 dpo, and in the caudal stump at 14 dpo, while immunostaining in astrocytes was also seen at all time-points after transection injury.

40|$|As a hyper-redundant robot, a 3 D snake-like robot {{can perform}} many other {{configurations}} {{and types of}} locomotion adapted to environment except for mimicking the natural snake locomotion. The natural snake locomotion usually limits locomotion capability of the robot because of inadequacy in the mechanism and actuation to imitate characters of natural snake such as the too many DOFs and {{the characteristics of the}} muscle. In order to apply snake-like robots to the unstructured environment, the researchers have designed many gaits for increasing the adaptability to a variety of surroundings. The twist-related locomotion is an effective gait achieved by jointly driving the pitching-DOF and yawing-DOF, with which the snakelike robot can move on rough ground and even climb up some obstacles. In dfis paper, the twist-related <b>locomotion</b> <b>function</b> is firstly solved, and simplified to be expressible by sine or cosine function. The 2 D locomotion such as V-shape and U-shape is achieved. Also by applying it to the serpentine locomotion or other types of locomotion, the snake-like robot can complete composite locomotion that combines the serpentine locomotion or others with twist-related locomotion. Then we extend the twist-related locomotion to 3 D space. Finally, the experimental results are presented to validate all above analyses.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which aggregates of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) mediate their toxicity is uncertain. We show here that {{the expression of the}} 42 -amino-acid isoform of Aβ (Aβ 1 – 42) changes the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease. A subsequent genetic screen confirmed the importance of oxidative stress and a molecular dissection of the steps in the cellular metabolism of reactive oxygen species revealed that the iron-binding protein ferritin and the H 2 O 2 scavenger catalase are the most potent suppressors of the toxicity of wild-type and Arctic (E 22 G) Aβ 1 – 42. Likewise, treatment with the iron-binding compound clioquinol increased the lifespan of flies expressing Arctic Aβ 1 – 42. The effect of iron appears to be mediated by oxidative stress as ferritin heavy chain co-expression reduced carbonyl levels in Aβ 1 – 42 flies by 65 % and restored the survival and <b>locomotion</b> <b>function</b> to normal. This was achieved despite the presence of elevated levels of the Aβ 1 – 42. Taken together, our data show that oxidative stress, probably mediated by the hydroxyl radical and generated by the Fenton reaction, is essential for Aβ 1 – 42 toxicity in vivo and provide strong support for Alzheimer’s disease therapies based on metal chelation...|$|E

40|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of neural}} stem/progenitor cells is a promising therapeutic strategy for {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). In this study, we tested whether combination of neurotrophic factors and transplantation of glial-restricted precursor (GRPs) -derived astrocytes (GDAs) could decrease the injury and promote functional recovery after SCI. We developed a protocol to quickly produce a sufficiently large, homogenous population of young astrocytes from GRPs, the earliest arising progenitor cell population restricted to the generation of glia. GDAs expressed the axonal regeneration promoting substrates, laminin and fibronectin, but not the inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Importantly, GDAs or its conditioned medium promoted the neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro. GDAs were infected with retroviruses expressing EGFP or multi-neurotrophin D 15 A and transplanted into the contused adult thoracic spinal cord at 8 days post-injury. Eight weeks after transplantation, the grafted GDAs survived and integrated into the injured spinal cord. Grafted GDAs expressed GFAP, suggesting they remained astrocyte lineage in the injured spinal cord. But it did not express CSPG. Robust axonal regeneration along the grafted GDAs was observed. Furthermore, transplantation of D 15 A-GDAs significantly increased the spared white matter and decreased the injury size compared to other control groups. More importantly, transplantation of D 15 A-GDAs significantly improved the <b>locomotion</b> <b>function</b> recovery shown by BBB locomotion scores and Tredscan footprint analyses. However, this combinatorial strategy did not enhance the aberrant synaptic connectivity of pain afferents, nor did it exacerbate posttraumatic neuropathic pain.

40|$|Background: Lower motor neurons in {{the spinal}} cord lose supraspinal inputs after {{complete}} spinal cord injury, leading {{to a loss of}} volitional control below the injury site. Extensive locomotor training with spinal cord stimulation can restore <b>locomotion</b> <b>function</b> after spinal cord injury in humans and animals. However, this locomotion is non-voluntary, meaning that subjects cannot control stimulation via their natural "intent". A recent study demonstrated an advanced system that triggers a stimulator using forelimb stepping electromyographic patterns to restore quadrupedal walking in rats with spinal cord transection. However, this indirect source of "intent" may mean that other non-stepping forelimb activities may false-trigger the spinal stimulator and thus produce unwanted hindlimb movements. Methods. We hypothesized that there are distinguishable neural activities in the primary motor cortex during treadmill walking, even after low-thoracic spinal transection in adult guinea pigs. We developed an electronic spinal bridge, called "Motolink", which detects these neural patterns and triggers a "spinal" stimulator for hindlimb movement. This hardware can be head-mounted or carried in a backpack. Neural data were processed in real-time and transmitted to a computer for analysis by an embedded processor. Off-line neural spike analysis was conducted to calculate and preset the spike threshold for "Motolink" hardware. Results: We identified correlated activities of primary motor cortex neurons during treadmill walking of guinea pigs with spinal cord transection. These neural activities were used to predict the kinematic states of the animals. The appropriate selection of spike threshold value enabled the "Motolink" system to detect the neural "intent" of walking, which triggered electrical stimulation of {{the spinal cord}} and induced stepping-like hindlimb movements.

40|$|Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1987 {{as one of}} the most important biomarkers in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subject brain tissue. Besides being involved in AD cognitive deficits, there is an accumulating body of evidence supports that APP and APP-cleavage products participate in multiple pathological and physiological processes in brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system. In this study, we are interested in the effect of APP and APP-cleavage products on spinal circuit based locomotion. While the cognitive deficits related to AD have being thoroughly studied, locomotion impairments observed in AD patients as well as in transgenic model animals are understudied. Locomotion deficits like loss of balance and slowness in stepping speed were previously thought to be caused by brain degeneration and only occurring late in the disease progression (3). However, there is evidence showing that motor deficits precede cognitive failure (4). Recent researches show that, spinal cord changes have been observed in early stage of AD. It is possible that AD pathology also happens locally in the spinal cord, contributing to AD-related motor deficits. In this study, I aim to address two hypotheses: 1) APP and APP-cleavage products in spinal cord participate in locomotion regulation in an expression dependent manner; 2) APP and its cleavage products impair neuronal plasticity in spinal cord as they do in the brain. To test these two questions, I investigated the locomotion and the spinal cord changes in human mutated amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) over-expressing model mice, PDGFβ-APPSw/Ind (J 20). The locomotion of J 20 mice was tested before and after complete spinal cord transection, and the spinal learning was also evaluated by an instrumental learning paradigm, paw withdrawal learning paradigm (PaWL). Changes in locomotion kinematics patterns and spinal learning have been detected in J 20 mice when compared to their WT littermates.

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} {{progresses}} in two stages. After the damage-causing physical event, comes {{an extended period}} when additional loss of cells and nerve fibers will occur and inflammatory and scar forming processes will come to prevail. The secondary events, however, also present {{a window of opportunity}} during which pharmacological intervention may decrease the extent of permanent neurological impairment. A few drugs have been tested clinically for such effects, but none is currently in use for spinal cord injured patients. Hence {{there is a need for}} additional therapeutic candidates. This thesis addresses the lack of clinical candidates by investigating the possibility to reposition drugs in clinical use for other indications, by testing them in the acute stage of spinal cord injury. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of the three cancer drugs erlotinib, rapamycin, and imatinib. These drugs all inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and their respective molecular targets are likely to be involved in promoting the degenerative secondary events following the initial trauma. Hence these drugs offer a potentially fast translational process to serve as a first line treatment, protecting vulnerable tissue and allowing improved functional recovery. In vitro, we characterized astrocytic cultures from adult rats and found that both growth conditions and choice of rat substrain will change astrocyte parameters and we further identified which of the tested substrains produce an astrocytic culture most similar to a human astrocytic culture (Paper I). We then characterized the spontaneous functional recovery of different rat substrains subjected to a mild contusion injury and found differences in recovery of hindlimb <b>locomotion</b> <b>function,</b> bladder function and sensory function with regard to mechanical stimuli (Paper III). The results should aid in optimizing the experimental and translational value of these in vitro and in vivo model systems. To determine the therapeutic potential of erlotinib, rapamycin and imatinib, we administered the drugs per os with a 30 minute delay during the acute stage of a contusion injury in rats and monitored functional recovery. We found erlotinib treatment to accelerate bladder and locomotor recovery (Paper IV). We also characterized the spatiotemporal activation of the target of rapamycin, mTORC 1, after the spinal cord injury. We found a biphasic activation of glial cells, primarily macrophages and microglia, revealing possible windows of opportunity for targeting mTORC 1 with rapamycin in spinal cord injury (Paper V). However, acute treatment with rapamycin did not alter recovery of bladder function or locomotion (Paper IV). We found that imatinib enhanced recovery of locomotion and bladder function by effectively reducing negative secondary events and rescuing spinal tissue, including axons (Paper II). To determine the possible clinical potential of imatinib we further delayed the initial administration of the drug, assessed motor and sensory recovery and searched for potential biomarkers in serum (Paper VI). We found imatinib to improve hind limb locomotion when administered with a 4 hour delay and to improve bladder recovery even with a 24 hour delay. The 4 hour delay treatment had modest positive effects on recovery of mechanical and thermal sensory functions and we identified alterations of two cytokines/chemokines as candidate biomarkers. In conclusion, further studies of erlotinib and rapamycin are needed in order to determine their therapeutic potential in spinal cord injury. Imatinib, however, stands out as a candidate drug for clinical trials in acute spinal cord injur...|$|E
40|$|Mudskippers {{have many}} {{morphological}} adaptations that {{enable them to}} cope with the different conditions encountered in and between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. This is challenging especially for fishes with a body plan suitable for the aquatic medium. In addition to essential processes such as osmoregulation, excretion, respiration, thermal balance, and <b>locomotion,</b> basic <b>functioning</b> senses such as photoreception, chemoreception, and mechanoreception must now accommodate both habitats (Sayer 2005). At a position usually directly on or close to the body surface, receptor cells can readily receive impulses from the surrounding environment but at the same time, expose these receptors to external conditions. The adaptations to these demanding environments have made mudskippers a frequently studied fish group and make them possible extant models for the Paleozoic evolution of vertebrate transition from water to land (Graham and Lee 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study has}} been carried out in order to analyze the parameters able to affect the productivity of a harvester working under alpine conditions. The study considers the Timberjack 1270 D harvester, equipped with the Timberjack H 758 header, during thinning operation in Norway spruce pure stands and in Norway spruce, Fir and Beech mixed stands. The experimental data allowed to build up a productivity model that consists of three parts: tree processing model, locomotion model and delay model. The time required for processing the tree is function of the tree volume; the time required for <b>locomotion</b> is <b>function</b> of stand density, terrain steepness and harvesting intensity. Data show that an increase in mechanization degree entails, thanks to a productivity increase, operative costs (€/m 3) lower than those of harvesting motor-manually performed...|$|R
30|$|Terrestrial mobile robots mainly include wheeled, tracked, legged, hybrid, snake-like, and spherical robots [1, 2], {{which have}} {{different}} adaptability and locomotion modes. Different from conventional robots that actuated by motors inside {{to hold a}} constant shape, some mechanisms realize <b>locomotion</b> and manipulation <b>functions</b> by shifting shapes with the change of the linkages [3]. In recent years, some linkage structures constructed by basic or special geometry configurations, such as Euclidean polyhedron, have been proposed. Conformable tetrahedrons are the simplest space-filling form {{in the same way}} triangles are the simplest plane-filling facets [4]. The tetrahedron-based mobile mechanism has been commonly explored.|$|R
25|$|Almost {{all adult}} arachnids have eight legs, and arachnids may be easily {{distinguished}} from insects by this fact, since insects have six legs. However, arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages {{that have become}} adapted for feeding, defense, and sensory perception. The first pair, the chelicerae, serve in feeding and defense. The next pair of appendages, the pedipalps, have been adapted for feeding, <b>locomotion,</b> and/or reproductive <b>functions.</b> In Solifugae, the palps are quite leg-like, so that these animals appear to have ten legs. The larvae of mites and Ricinulei have only six legs; a fourth pair usually appears when they moult into nymphs. However, mites are variable: as well as eight, there are adult mites with six or even four legs.|$|R
