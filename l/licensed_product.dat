500|$|In 2007, Burger King began {{licensing}} its logo {{and items}} to outside companies for non-Burger King products. A licensed products company, Broad Street Licensing Group, and its manufacturing partner, the Inventure Group, introduced the first {{products in the}} fall of that year: flavored potato crisps in two flavors, flame-broiled burger and French fries with ketchup. Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second <b>licensed</b> <b>product,</b> the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund. Industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme, with Rob Frankel, author of the book The Revenge of Brand X, stating [...] "just because you can do something does not mean you should." ...|$|E
500|$|N. W. Ayer & Son, the {{advertising}} firm retained by De Beers in the mid-20th century, succeeded in reviving the American diamond market. And the firm created new markets {{in countries where}} no diamond tradition had existed before. N. W. Ayer's marketing included product placement, advertising focused on the diamond product itself rather than the De Beers brand, and associations with celebrities and royalty. Without advertising the De Beers brand, De Beers was advertising its competitors' diamond products as well, {{but this was not}} a concern as De Beers dominated the diamond market throughout the 20th century. De Beers' market share dipped temporarily to 2nd place in the global market below Alrosa {{in the aftermath of the}} global economic crisis of 2008, down to less than 29% in terms of carats mined, rather than sold. [...] The campaign lasted for decades but was effectively discontinued by early 2011. De Beers still advertises diamonds, but {{the advertising}} now mostly promotes its own brands, or <b>licensed</b> <b>product</b> lines, rather than completely [...] "generic" [...] diamond products. [...] The campaign was perhaps best captured by the slogan [...] "a diamond is forever". [...] This slogan is now being used by De Beers Diamond Jewelers, a jewelry firm which is a 50%/50% joint venture between the De Beers mining company and LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{appears to}} be saying that LGE simply {{licensed}} Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine <b>licensed</b> <b>product</b> with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E

To a lesser extent, experiential and functional meanings attached to Olympic licensed items were also identified...|$|R
