5|$|Due to the {{internal}} hearing, the City of Chicago was simultaneously paying <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> defend Burge during an appeal by Wilson and a new civil case by Banks, while employing <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> prosecute him on departmental charges. The City of Chicago hired outside counsel to prosecute the detectives at {{the internal}} hearing. After having spent $750,000 to defend Burge in the Wilson case, the City of Chicago questioned whether to follow normal practices and pay {{for the defense of}} its police officers.|$|E

30|$|Recall {{that the}} {{construction}} of the network requires the notion of a lawyer wining or losing. We take the following approach: In proceedings where the lawsuit was accepted or partially accepted, we say that the plaintiff’s lawyers won over the defendant’s <b>lawyers,</b> giving rise <b>to</b> a directed (and weighted) edge from every defendant’s <b>lawyer</b> <b>to</b> every plaintiff’s <b>lawyer</b> (complete bipartite graph). In a dismissed case, we consider what the plaintiff’s <b>lawyers</b> lost <b>to</b> the defendant’s <b>lawyers,</b> giving rise <b>to</b> a directed (and weighted) edge from every plaintiff’s <b>lawyer</b> <b>to</b> every defendant’s <b>lawyer.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2004 Bamber's defence team, which {{included}} Giovanni di Stefano, applied unsuccessfully {{to have the}} CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal. His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009. The CCRC provisionally rejected Bamber's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document. It invited his <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> respond within three months, extended the deadline {{to allow them to}} study all 406 crime-scene photographs, and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry.|$|E
5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context. Erskine's reply opened with a defence {{of the freedom of}} <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> represent whichever clients came to them, and followed with an exposition of his views {{on the nature of the}} freedom of the press—arguing that the publication of radical tracts served only to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses, and could not be seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and paved the way for the 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{attracted}} canon <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> his household, including Gerard la Pucelle, Peter of Blois, and Henry Pium of Northampton, {{all of whom}} {{advised him}} on legal matters. At the Council of Westminster that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen canons were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the oversupply of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and tonsure, and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual judgment {{as well as in}} the execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the Decretals and the other collections of canon law of the 13th century.|$|E

At the time, they had been writing songs in {{preparation}} for the follow-up to their 2005 album A Beautiful Lie. For the bulk of the film, the band, consisting of Jared Leto, his brother Shannon Leto, and Tomo Miličević, is shown working with producers Flood and Steve Lillywhite to create what would eventually become This Is War. Between recording sessions, they meet with <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> negotiate for the band's survival.|$|E
5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|All three {{channels}} televise {{events such}} as congressional hearings, White House press briefings and presidential speeches, {{as well as other}} government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings and Pentagon press conferences. Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches, and presidential press conferences. According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election, 85% of C-SPAN viewers voted in that election. The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89% of C-SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election. In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.|$|E

5|$|Becky reveals to Steve that Hooch arrested her for {{shoplifting}} {{when she}} was fifteen, and attempted to molest her. She filed a complaint against him at the time, and Hooch is determined to get his revenge as this harmed his promotion prospects. During Becky's trial, Steve develops genuine feelings for her and they begin an affair, with Steve promising to leave Michelle. Although he keeps his promise, Becky reunites with Jason, eventually leading to him proposing to her. She accepts but reconsiders when Steve proposes as well. Becky ultimately breaks up with Jason and moves in with Steve. His daughter, Amy Barlow (Amber Chadwick), initially dislikes Becky, prompting her to put their wedding on hold though Steve eventually convinces her to set a date. Becky turns up to her wedding so drunk that the vicar refuses to perform the ceremony. They plan a second ceremony, Slug returns, seemingly reformed but actually working for Hooch. Slug plants drugs on Becky. At Becky and Steve's 2nd wedding, the reception is raided by police, and Becky is arrested for drug possession. Steve hires <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> free Becky and after Steve and Becky find Slug and convince him {{to tell them what}} Hooch has on him that he would even consider framing Becky, they use it to blackmail Hooch into calling a truce and drop the charges.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve {{temporarily}} as judges {{at any level}} in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> practice in Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.|$|E

5|$|When Gilberto {{moved to}} England and began {{training}} with Arsenal, {{he bought a}} house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire. Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to the new way of life in London. However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool {{in the second half of}} the FA Community Shield game in which he scored the winning goal. As the 2002–03 FA Premier League season began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from compatriot Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002. However, his legal problems continued, since his transfer to England still was not fully resolved. As a result, Gilberto instructed his <b>lawyers</b> <b>to</b> start legal proceedings against Atlético Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002. For the second half of the 2002–03 season, he remained a regular starter in the Arsenal side. Even though he suffered a lapse in form towards the end of the season, he won an FA Cup winner's medal, playing in the final at the Millennium Stadium as Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0.|$|E
