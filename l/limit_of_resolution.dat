5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|The Discovery {{quadrangle}} {{lies within}} the heavily cratered part of Mercury {{in a region}} roughly antipodal to the 1550-km-wide Caloris Basin. Like {{the rest of the}} heavily cratered part of the planet, the quadrangle contains a spectrum of craters and basins ranging in size from those at the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> of the best photographs (200 m) to those as much as 350km across, and ranging in degree of freshness from pristine to severely degraded. Interspersed with the craters and basins both in space and time are plains deposits that are probably of several different origins. Because of its small size and very early segregation into core and crust, Mercury has seemingly been a dead planet for a long time—possibly longer than the Moon. Its geologic history, therefore, records with considerable clarity some of the earliest and most violent events {{that took place in the}} inner Solar System.|$|E
