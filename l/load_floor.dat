25|$|The Matador station wagons had an {{available}} rear-facing third-row {{bench seat}} increasing total seating {{from six to}} eight passengers. In addition, all wagons included a roof rack and a two-way tailgate that opened when the rear window was down either from the top {{to serve as an}} extended flat surface that was even with the <b>load</b> <b>floor,</b> or to swing open like a regular door hinged on the left side.|$|E
25|$|Packaging {{is cited}} as both an {{advantage}} and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, {{as compared to}} coil springs, depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufactures to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping {{the diameter of the}} shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to coil springs. Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to coil springs on production road cars.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was purchased}} by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) {{to serve as a}} master for the series and was designated C-55. After military evaluation, the sole example was returned to Curtiss-Wright and subsequently re-sold to the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). During testing, General Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold became interested in the potential of the airliner as a military cargo transport and on 13 September 1940, ordered 46 modified CW-20As as the C-46-CU Commando; the last 21 aircraft in this order were delivered as Model CW-20Bs, called C-46A-1-CU. None of the C-46s purchased by the U.S. military were pressurized and the first 30 delivered to the AAF were sent back to the factory for 53 immediate modifications. The design was then modified to the C-46A configuration, receiving enlarged cargo doors, a strengthened <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> and a convertible cabin that speeded changes in carrying freight and troops. The C-46 was introduced to the public at a ceremony in May 1942, attended by its designer, George A. Page Jr.|$|E
2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|E

The results for the 5 experimental conditions show that the radiant cooling <b>load</b> of <b>floor</b> peak error is less than 2. 3 % comparing with the value which is calculated by radiant time series method, and average error is not more than 3. 2 %. Its mean absolute error is 1. 2 % and 1. 7 % respectively.

5000|$|As {{with most}} Kei cars, the 200-series came in two primary variants: The [...] "V" [...] Series is a windowed van style {{intended}} for light commercial use. This variant featured a fold down {{rear bench seat}} without seat belts. The [...] "S" [...] series, intended for private use, is largely similar but the larger, more comfortable rear seats are equipped with belts and are further {{to the rear of}} the vehicle with more leg room. While the seats still fold down, unlike the [...] "V", the [...] "S" [...] does not offer a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor.</b> These characteristics are due to Japanese tax preferences for commercial vehicles, which only allow for temporary accommodation in the rear and demand a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor.</b> The range received a very subtle facelift of a more rounded overall appearance for 1993, it included altered front and rear lights, bumpers, and a new bonnet and front seats. This version was available to Japanese customers from August 1992 and also incorporated some changes to the lineup, including the new RV-4 model with crossover pretensions. Turbocharged automatics now received a four-speed transmission.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a two-door wagon, known as the [...] "Van", as is typical in Japan where wagons are {{traditionally}} only for commercial purposes, which featured a horizontally divided tailgate and a maximum 400 kg payload (200 kg with 4 passengers). The rear seat had steel backing and when folded down formed a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor,</b> as per legal requirements for Japanese commercial vehicles. Strapping points were visible in the rearmost side windows. Its top speed is slightly lower, at 122 km/h.|$|R

40|$|Endotoxins can {{significantly}} affect {{the air quality}} in school environments. However, there is currently no reliable method for the measurement of endotoxins {{and there is a}} lack of reference values for endotoxin concentrations to aid in the interpretation of measurement results in school settings. We benchmarked the “baseline” range of endotoxin concentration in indoor air, together with endotoxin <b>load</b> in <b>floor</b> dust, and evaluated the correlation between endotoxin levels in indoor air and settled dust, as well as the effects of temperature and humidity on these levels in subtropical school settings. Bayesian hierarchical modeling indicated that the concentration in indoor air and the <b>load</b> in <b>floor</b> dust were generally (< 95 th percentile) < 13 EU/m 3 and < 24, 570 EU/m 2, respectively. Exceeding these levels would indicate abnormal sources of endotoxins in the school environment, and the need for further investigation. Metaregression indicated no relationship between endotoxin concentration and load, which points to the necessity for measuring endotoxin levels in both the air and settled dust. Temperature increases were associated with lower concentrations in indoor air and higher <b>loads</b> in <b>floor</b> dust.
