60|$|I thought I {{was to be}} pitched {{again into}} the hold, but this time I was mistaken. Lowell <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small room {{situated}} in the extreme bow.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Etherington met me at {{the door}} of his appartement, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> inner room without speaking. Here he stood gazing, for some time, in my face, with {{paternal}} concern.|$|R
6000|$|They seized my kayak by the point, [...] They {{pulled me}} o'er the sea, [...] They <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> island lone, [...] And thus {{they spoke to}} me: [...] "Bad man, are there not bachelors [...] Both old and young to spare, [...] Whom you might kill, and eat your fill, [...] For all the world would care?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} your {{handwriting}} was very welcome, {{and not the}} less so because your sister had <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> expect <b>a</b> letter from you.|$|R
6000|$|... [466] Audubon {{says in his}} Journal of {{the same}} date:--"Captain Hall <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seat {{immediately}} opposite to Sir Walter Scott, the President, where I had a perfect view of the great man, and studied Nature from Nature's noblest work." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gooseberry had {{followed}} {{us into the}} room. His loose eyes rolled frightfully--not in terror, but in exultation. He had made a detective-discovery on his own account. [...] "Look here, sir," [...] he repeated--and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> table {{in the corner of}} the room.|$|E
60|$|Nick {{followed}} Mademoiselle {{with his}} eyes until she had disappeared beyond the hall. She did {{not so much as}} turn. Then he took me by the arm and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bench under a magnolia a little distance away, where he seated himself, and looked up at me despairingly.|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of study for the Graduate Certificate of Education (Tertiary Teaching) we participated in a seminar about Problem Based Learning (PBL) and were asked <b>to</b> write <b>a</b> piece of {{assessment}} about this topic. I struggled long and hard with PBL {{and came up with}} a fairly mediocre piece of work to be assessed. This <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> interest in PBL itself and, to the writing of this general overview of the subject. It has helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> understand the concept and its implications within the tertiary system <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much greater degree...|$|R
60|$|A {{careful study}} of these varied races, {{comparing}} them {{with those of}} Eastern Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Australia, has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> adopt <b>a</b> comparatively simple view as to their origin and affinities.|$|R
60|$|Before sunrise I was out. Soon the jumping {{flight and}} cheery good-morning of <b>a</b> downy {{woodpecker}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> old field with scattered evergreen clumps. There {{is no better}} time for a quiet peep at the birds than the morning after a snow-storm, and no better place than the evergreens. If {{you can find them}} at all (which is not certain, for they have mysterious ways of disappearing before a storm), you will find them unusually quiet, and willing to bear your scrutiny indifferently, instead of flying off into deeper coverts.|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> distant part of {{the hall}} where a crowd of deeply {{attentive}} auditors were assembled round an elderly man of plain, honest, trustworthy aspect. With an earnestness that betokened the sincerest faith in his own doctrine, he announced that {{the destruction of the}} world was close at hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wi' that he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seat, an' we sat down. I was so took aback an' amused that I {{waited to}} see what would foller an' what he'd got to say that was so partikler--but, I say, Archie, them buffalo runners has got the wind o' us, an' are showin' us their heels, I fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} the Indian, wondering who the friend might be, for I had no friends, and he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fine stone {{house in a}} new street. Here I was seated in a darkened chamber and waited there a while, till suddenly a sad and sweet voice that seemed familiar to me, addressed me in the Aztec tongue, saying, 'Welcome, Teule.' ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seat by {{the north}} door, between two pews, very black and silent. There we sat, he putting his gun {{carefully}} beside him. He remained perfectly still, thinking.|$|R
60|$|She <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> where <b>a</b> fallen rock lay {{within a}} few paces, and behind it we sat {{ourselves}} down in such a position that Martina could watch the Table of Offerings {{by the light of}} the moon.|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> inner chamber where I beheld {{a battery}} of twenty radium pumps any {{one of which was}} equal to the task of {{furnishing}} all Mars with the atmosphere compound. For eight hundred years, he told me, he had watched these pumps which are used alternately a day each at a stretch, or a little over twenty-four and one-half Earth hours. He has one assistant who divides the watch with him. Half a Martian year, about three hundred and forty-four of our days, each of these men spend alone in this huge, isolated plant.|$|R
6000|$|Something in {{this letter}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sudden change of plan. As mother was now quite {{comfortable}} again I said to her, [...] "Zuleema has gone to Chicago to do some shopping. I think I'll run down and meet her and ask her to help me select the curtains and wall-paper for your new room. What {{do you say to}} that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enter," [...] he said. [...] "Enter!" [...] {{scanning}} me all {{the while}} with his twinkling eyes. [...] "Enter, my son!" [...] And he took me and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chamber in the inner hall, closed to the door, and then, having glanced at the letters that I brought, {{of a sudden he}} fell upon my neck and embraced me.|$|E
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chair. I have an indistinct remembrance that he {{was very}} affectionate. I don't think he put his arm round my waist to support me--but I am not sure. I was quite helpless, and his ways with ladies were very endearing. At any rate, we sat down. I can answer for that, if I can answer for nothing more.|$|E
30|$|The {{requirements}} and shift in paradigm for OCO and NPP PEATE <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lead <b>a</b> large refactoring and modernization of the Apache OODT data processing subsystem called CAS (for “Catalog and Archive System”). The OODT CAS, under my leadership, underwent {{a series of}} changes.|$|R
60|$|Sir, I {{assure you}} very solemnly, {{and with a}} very clear conscience, that {{nothing in the world}} has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> such <b>an</b> {{undertaking}} but my zeal for the honor of this House, and the settled, habitual, systematic affection I bear to the cause and to the principles of government.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} Anne Hume {{discusses}} how use of scholarship and action research <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> introduce <b>an</b> intervention into my science education programmes called Content Representations (CoRes). My initial findings strongly indicate CoRes {{could be very}} useful tools for helping student teachers develop the professional knowledge base they need for teaching...|$|R
6000|$|... "That black rascal {{has found}} {{something}} {{over on the}} shore of the Big River," [...] said Farmer Brown's boy to himself. [...] "I'll go over there to see what it is. There isn't much escapes the sharp eyes of that black busybody. He has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of interesting things, one time and another. There he is on the top of that tree over by the Big River." ...|$|E
6000|$|He stood up, {{and taking}} {{me by the}} hand, <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large looking-glass, which made up the pier {{in the front of}} the parlour. [...] "Look there, madam," [...] said he; [...] "is it fit that that face" [...] (pointing to my figure in the glass) [...] "should go back to Poictou? No, madam," [...] says he; [...] "stay and make some gentleman of quality happy, that may, in return, make you forget all your sorrows;" [...] and with that he took me in his arms, and kissing me twice, told me he would see me again, but with less ceremony.|$|E
60|$|When I {{arrived at}} the house I was met by {{the young man who}} had set me the morning's task; but he was taciturn now, and wore a cold, estranged look, which seemed to portend trouble. He at once <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> part of the house at a {{distance}} from the hall, and into a large apartment I now saw for the first time. In a few moments the master of the house, followed by most of the other inmates, also entered, and on the faces of all of them I noticed the same cold, offended look.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{points out}} some {{relevant}} {{elements of the}} discussion about heuristics paths {{for the analysis of}} the French religious field. Being a Brazilian anthropologist has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> construct <b>a</b> specific approach on this field identifying the sects social problem as part of an old tradition that has discussed the minorities’ believers groups position in the French religious field...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{conceptual}} and theoretical underpinnings that have <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> develop <b>an</b> artistic practice rooted in interventions in the form/function/ {{exchange of commodities}} to create micro-political renegotiations of subordination [...] using the act of exchange {{as a way of}} reflecting on the greater ideological order of social, cultural, and economic structures that maintain current relations of powe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I briefly outline my Ph. D. findings, which <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> call for <b>a</b> renewed {{commitment}} <b>to</b> collective practice approaches. I argue that social work {{has suffered from}} a trend towards decontextualizing and technologizing practice. I assert that social work needs to reclaim and revalue the importance of materiality {{as a framework for}} understanding people's experience, both service users and social workers...|$|R
60|$|Then two of {{the chief}} nobles came forward, and taking torches <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{magnificent}} chamber that I had never seen before. Here they changed my apparel, investing me in robes which were still more splendid than any that I had worn hitherto, being made of the finest embroidered cotton and of the glittering feathers of the humming bird. On my head they set wreaths of flowers, and about my neck and wrists emeralds of vast size and value, and a sorry popinjay I looked in this attire, that seemed more suited to a woman's beauty than to me.|$|E
60|$|As it cannot {{exist in}} right on any {{rational}} and solid principles of government, so neither does it {{exist in the}} constitution of Oriental governments,--and I do insist upon it, that Oriental governments know nothing of arbitrary power. I have taken as much pains as I could to examine into the constitutions of them. I have been endeavoring to inform myself at all times on this subject; of late my duty has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more minute inspection of them; and I do challenge the whole race of man to show me any of the Oriental governors claiming to themselves a right to act by arbitrary will.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Veronese, with {{a charming}} smile, took my hand, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shadowy arbour, whence we enjoyed a {{prospect}} of many rivers and {{mountains in the}} poets' heaven. Among these I recognised the triple crest of the Eildons, Grongar Hill, Cithaeron and Etna; while the reed-fringed waters of the Mincius flowed musically between the banks and braes o' bonny Doon to join the Tweed. Blithe ghosts were wandering by, in all varieties of apparel, and I distinctly observed Dante's Beatrice, leaning loving {{on the arm of}} Sir Philip Sidney, while Dante was closely engaged in conversation with the lost Lenore, celebrated by Mr. Edgar Allan Poe.|$|E
40|$|In {{our studies}} on the primary immune response, we have used germfree, colostrum-deprived swine taken {{three to five days}} prematurely by hysterectomy. These piglets lack gamma {{globulin}} until they are immunized. Upon antigenic stimulation, early macroglobulin antibody is produced within 48 hours; subsequently late euglobulin antibody is produced. Our results have <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> formulate <b>a</b> new instructive model for the onset of antibody formation...|$|R
6000|$|We {{discovered}} {{each other}} at the same instant. Words can hardly measure the mutual consternation. I felt scared; and in a moment it flashed upon me that he looked so. This last observation was like a breath of inspiration. It <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> demonstration before he should regain his wits. I jumped forward with a flourish, and threw my hat at him.-- ...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{reflection}} on my practice in a service-learning course, in which students got involved in exhibitions of works created by people with disabilities. Those exhibitions were unique {{in the way the}} students were not simply receptionists or spectators. They wrote their comments on the work each selected, and put them beside the works. Non-artists' (students and myself) involvement with the art of people with disabilities in various forms, together with the exhibitions, <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> redefine art. The art redefined is an art of creating human relations through acts of gift-giving and giftreceiving. Creating new human relations in grass-roots community, it is also an art that will prepare for social changes. This essay witnesses a possibility of the art of people with disabilities for society. Main thoughts in this essay are presented by reference to William Morris, Theodore Adorno, and other distinguished writers and scholars...|$|R
