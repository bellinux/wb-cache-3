500|$|Peter goes to {{retrieve}} Meg from her [...] "party" [...] and asks Meg {{to come as}} Lois wants her there. Meg just says it's just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she wasn't there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. Peter then has an epiphany, the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees {{to come home and}} the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> before he can drink the poisoned punch and Pulls Meg out before she can drink Her's, oblivious {{to the fact that he}} is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The Cult Leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as [...] "The Man in White". Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{keep talking}} to him, I ask him {{questions}} {{and he looks}} at his watch," [...] Millen said. [...] "I said, 'You got some place you need to be?' And he goes, 'Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' So I ask him another question, he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and begins}} hurriedly searching the bins, [...] bending down {{and going on}} his knees. THE PRESS reverses the [...] {{notebook}} again and sketches him.] ...|$|E
60|$|He pulled <b>at</b> <b>his</b> choking collar, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{opened the}} window to stare down <b>at</b> the street, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> tried to read the evening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, <b>looked</b> again <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> Three minutes had gone by since he had first <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Smith clicked {{his tongue}} sympathetically. Mr. Renshaw <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
60|$|Canon Spratte <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{and gave}} her a reassuring smile.|$|R
6000|$|NAPOLEON (brusquely, rising). No: lay {{nothing here}} until the officer for whom I am waiting comes back. (He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and takes to walking {{to and fro}} between the {{fireplace}} and the vineyard.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. PENNE (dictates)--"On {{one side}} was love and Kate; {{on the other}} side his {{heritage}} of social position and family pride. Would love win? Love, that the poets tell us will last forever! (Perceives that Miss Lore looks fatigued, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.)</b> That's a good long stretch. Perhaps we'd better knock off a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|GIUSEPPE (sympathetically). Not {{the least}} in the world, excellency: is there? (Napoleon again <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> evidently growing anxious.) Ah, one can see {{that you are a}} great man, General: you know how to wait. If it were a {{corporal}} now, or a sub-lieutenant, at the end of three minutes he would be swearing, fuming, threatening, pulling the house about our ears.|$|E
60|$|Editor Westbrook <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> with an {{affected}} show of leisure.|$|R
60|$|Grief <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was early}} yet, only eight o'clock.|$|R
60|$|He started, {{threw the}} papers into a drawer, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She bows {{her eyes}} rather than her head, the {{movement}} is so slight and curious, and he withdraws. Clear of the room he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> but is inclined to doubt it by a minute or thereabouts. There is a splendid clock upon the staircase, famous, as splendid clocks not often are, for its accuracy. [...] "And what do YOU say," [...] Mr. Tulkinghorn inquires, referring to it. [...] "What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [She {{lifts the}} coat. But ROBERTS puts it back, and wraps it [...] round her. He tries {{to meet her}} eyes, but cannot. MRS. [...] ROBERTS stays huddled in the coat, her eyes, that follow him [...] about, are half malicious, half yearning. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> [...] again, and turns to go. In the doorway he meets JAN THOMAS, a [...] boy of ten in clothes too big for him, {{carrying}} a penny [...] whistle.] ...|$|E
60|$|BURGESS (pretending to belittle the aristocracy, {{but with}} his eyes gleaming). Hm, I thort you wouldn't git a piorr's (peer's) nevvy visitin' in Victoria Park unless he were {{a bit of a}} flat. (Looking again at the picture.) Of course I don't 'old with that pictur, Candy; but still it's a 'igh class, fust rate work of art: I can see that. Be sure you hintroduce me to him, Candy. (He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> anxiously.) I can only stay about two minutes.|$|E
60|$|Staffer folded {{a letter}} he had been reading, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Baron <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{and gave}} a {{guttural}} exclamation of disappointment.|$|R
60|$|Left by himself, Crayford <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and called}} to a sailor outside.|$|R
6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI (with a boyish laugh of delight). That'll do. Thank you. (<b>Looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and {{suddenly}} becomes businesslike.) Time's up, Major. You've managed those regiments {{so well that}} you are sure {{to be asked to}} get rid of some of the Infantry of the Teemok division. Send them home by way of Lom Palanka. Saranoff: don't get married until I come back: I shall be here punctually at five in the evening on Tuesday fortnight. Gracious ladies--good evening. (He makes them a military bow, and goes.) ...|$|E
6000|$|WAITER. Quite sure, sir. She expects you at {{a quarter}} to one, sir. (The gentleman, soothed at once by the waiter's voice, looks {{at him with a}} lazy smile. It is a quiet voice, with a gentle melody in it that gives {{sympathetic}} interest to his most commonplace remark; and he speaks with the sweetest propriety, neither dropping his aitches nor misplacing them, nor committing any other vulgarism. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> as he continues) Not that yet, sir, is it? 12:43, sir. Only two minutes more to wait, sir. Nice morning, sir? ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Hodgson {{opens the}} great colloid {{underbody}} porthole through which I watch over-lighted London slide eastward as the gale gets hold of us. The {{first of the}} low winter clouds cuts off the well-known view and darkens Middlesex. On the south edge of it I can see a postal packet's light ploughing through the white fleece. For an instant she gleams like a star ere she drops toward the Highgate Receiving Towers. [...] "The Bombay Mail," [...] says Captain Hodgson, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "She's forty minutes late." ...|$|E
60|$|Link Stevens {{stepped out}} and, {{removing}} helmet and goggles, coolly <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bashwood <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and hurriedly {{took his}} hat from a side-table.|$|R
60|$|Her husband <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and then}} held {{it with the}} face toward her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was pretty}} rotten. Derek held out his hand, as a chappie {{naturally}} would, being introduced to a strange chappie, and Wally Mason, giving it an absolute miss, went on talking to me just {{as if we were}} alone, you know. Look here. Here was I, where this knife is. Derek over here--this fork--with his hand out. Mason here--this bit of bread. Mason <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and says 'I'm sorry, Freddie, but I find I've an engagement for lunch. So long!' and biffed out, without apparently knowing that Derek was on the earth. I mean...." [...] Freddie reached for his glass. [...] "What I mean is, it was dashed embarrassing. I mean, cutting a fellow dead in my rooms. I don't know when I've felt so rotten!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{arrival of}} these two grandees has somehow cast a solemnity over the company. The weather is talked about: {{brilliant}} in itself, it does not occasion very brilliant remarks among Colonel Newcome's guests. Sir Brian really thinks it must be as hot {{as it is in}} India. Sir Thomas de Boots, swelling in his white waistcoat, in the armholes of which his thumbs are engaged, smiles scornfully, and wishes Sir Brian had ever felt a good sweltering day in the hot winds in India. Sir Brian withdraws the untenable proposition that London is as hot as Calcutta. Mr. Binnie <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and at the Colonel. [...] "We have only your nephew, Tom, to wait for," [...] he says; [...] "I think we may make so bold as to order the dinner,"--a proposal heartily seconded by Mr. Frederick Bayham.|$|E
60|$|It is slow work {{travelling}} in Germany. The German train {{does not}} hurry or excite itself over its work, {{and when it}} stops it likes to take a rest. When a German train draws up at a station, everybody gets out and has a walk. The engine-driver and the stoker cross over and knock at the station-master's door. The station-master comes out and greets them effusively, and then runs {{back into the house}} to tell his wife that they have come, and she bustles out and also welcomes them effusively, and the four stand chatting about old times and friends and the state of the crops. After a while, the engine-driver, during a pause in the conversation, <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and says he is afraid he must be going, but the station-master's wife won't hear of it.|$|E
60|$|The Major <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and rose--with fluent {{apologies for}} {{abruptly}} leaving the table.|$|R
60|$|By <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> Dick {{saw that}} it was three o'clock in the morning.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed his}} hand across his {{throbbing}} head, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> Nearly half-past three.|$|R
60|$|Suppose for instance, a study card, {{like the}} one {{described}} in a preceding chapter, is made, so as to mark the time of recess and of study. The teacher near the close of recess, is sitting {{with a group of}} his pupils around him, telling them some story. They are all interested, and they see he is interested. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and shows by his manner, that he is desirous of finishing what he is saying, but that he knows that the striking of the bell will cut short his story. Perhaps he says not a word about it, but his pupils see that he is submitting to the control which is placed over them: and when the card goes up, and he stops instantly {{in the middle of his}} sentence, and rises with the rest, each one to go to his own place, to engage at once in their several duties, he teaches them a most important lesson, and in the most effectual way. Such a lesson of fidelity and obedience, and such an example of it, will have more influence, than a half hour's scolding about whispering without leave, or a dozen public punishments. At least so I find it, for I have tried both.|$|E
6000|$|After it is over, and he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{he finds}} it has taken him longer than that. Added to which he has said next to nothing-- next to nothing, that is, of what he meant to say. It went wrong from the very start. As {{a matter of fact}} there wasn't any start. He entered the room and closed the door. That is as far as he got. The {{cigarette}} he never even lighted. There ought to have been a box of matches on the mantelpiece behind the photo-frame. And of course there were none there. For her to fly into a temper merely because he reminded her that he had spoken about this very matter at least a hundred times before, and accuse him of going about his own house [...] "stealing" [...] his own matches was positively laughable. They had quarrelled for about five minutes over those wretched matches, and then for another ten because he said that women had no sense of humour, and she wanted to know how he knew. After that there had cropped up the last quarter's gas-bill, and that by a process still mysterious to him had led them into the subject of his behaviour {{on the night of the}} Hockey Club dance. By an effort of almost supernatural self-control he had contrived at length to introduce the subject he had come home half an hour earlier than usual on purpose to discuss. It didn't interest her in the least. What she was full of by this time was a girl named Arabella Jones. She got in quite a lot while he was vainly trying to remember where he had last seen the damned girl. He had just succeeded in getting back to his own topic when the Cuddiford girl from next door dashed in without a hat to borrow a tuning-fork. It had been quite a business finding the tuning-fork, and when she was gone they had to begin all over again. They had quarrelled about the drawing-room carpet; about her sister Florrie's birthday present; and the way he drove the motor-car. It had taken them over an hour and a half, and rather than waste the tickets for the theatre, they had gone without their dinner. The matter of the cold chisel still remained to be thrashed out.|$|E
50|$|An Adanac {{wristwatch}} {{was seen}} in an episode of Hawaii 5-O from 1971, in a scene where one man <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and the name can clearly {{be seen on the}} face of the watch on his wrist.|$|E
60|$|Fogerty decided quickly. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{he rushed}} out and arrested a passing taxicab.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> again, and {{the world}} grew black. It was twelve minutes after ten.|$|R
60|$|Wemmick, having {{finished}} <b>his</b> breakfast, here <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and began}} to get his coat on.|$|R
