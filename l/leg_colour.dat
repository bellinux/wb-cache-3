50|$|The Vanikoro white-eye {{differs from}} its {{geographically}} closest congener, the Santa Cruz white-eye (Zosterops sanctaecrucis), by several features including {{a much longer}} bill and different eye-ring and <b>leg</b> <b>colouring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adults are {{medium-sized}} {{to small}} and usually have mainly dark body and <b>leg</b> <b>colours.</b> Males congregate in characteristic dancing swarms beneath trees; females are more retiring in habit. Larvae are characterised by their flattened bodies with striking lateral protuberances, and live as scavengers in {{various kinds of}} decaying organic matter.|$|R
50|$|The {{somewhat}} shimmering, golden-hued pubescence of the gaster {{is characteristic}} of all the worker castes. On the gaster, erect bristles are limited to the posterior segments. The reddish <b>leg</b> <b>colour</b> distinguishes it from the similar but smaller C. sericeus.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} differ {{slightly in}} bill {{size and the}} breast and <b>leg</b> <b>colour</b> of young birds. Recent evidence suggests that birds on the Atlantic coast of southwest Europe are distinct from all three, and may be an as-yet undescribed subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Like the Pacific race of black-legged {{kittiwake}}, the red-legged kittiwake has a well-developed hind toe. As occasional individual black-legged kittiwakes have reddish legs, any {{reports of}} red-legged {{away from the}} subarctic Pacific must record {{all of the other}} differences, not just the <b>leg</b> <b>colour,</b> for acceptance by bird recording authorities.|$|E
50|$|The {{village indigobird}} or steelblue widowfinch (Vidua chalybeata) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} belonging to the family Viduidae. It is distinguishable from other indigobird species by bill and <b>leg</b> <b>colours,</b> the colour tinge of the male's breeding plumage, song, and to lesser extent, the nestling's plumage and mouth pattern. The bill colour can be red or white depending on the population, {{and there is some}} regional variation in the colour tone of the male's plumage.|$|R
6000|$|... "M. Milne Edwards (Annales des Sci. Nat., I ser., tom. xvi. p. 50) {{has given}} a curious table of {{measurements}} of fourteen specimens of Lacerta muralis; and, taking {{the length of the}} head as a standard, he finds the neck, trunk, tail, front and hind <b>legs,</b> <b>colour,</b> and femoral pores, all varying wonderfully; and so it is more or less with other species. So apparently trifling a character as the scales on the head affording almost the only constant characters." ...|$|R
60|$|No comb, head {{said to be}} surmounted by a {{longitudinal}} crest of soft velvety feathers; nostrils said to be crescentic; wattles well developed; <b>legs</b> feathered; <b>colour</b> black. From North America. The Breda fowl seems to be closely allied to the Guelderland.|$|R
50|$|The <b>leg</b> <b>colour</b> brightens {{during the}} spring {{breeding}} season, when the birds sometimes move to higher elevations. Males show mutual aggression at this time and establish territories by calling and display flights which may include exaggerated wing beats. A receptive female will follow the male in flight and copulation may follow soon after. The top of a slope in burnt grassland is a favourite location for nesting.|$|E
50|$|The Denizli is a {{breed of}} rooster {{developed}} in Denizli, Turkey. It is characterised by its long-crowing abilities, {{with the general}} guideline being a crow of 20-25 seconds in their first year. The breed is divided into 3 groups based on colour, body structure, and comb types. It is described as having black eyes, dark gray or purple <b>leg</b> <b>colour,</b> with silver or red hackles and sometimes red feathering on the wings. They weigh 3-3.5 kg.|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of Simuliidae, Simulium (Chirostilbia) brunnescens, was {{discovered}} at Chapada dos Guimarães, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and nearby municipalities (Paranatinga, Rosário do Oeste and Nobres). This species is described here based on the adults, pupae and larvae. This species {{is closely related to}} Simulium (C.) subpallidum Lutz, but could be differentiated in all stages: females, <b>leg</b> <b>colour</b> pattern and frontal dilatation size; males, gonostyle shape; pupae, number of gill filaments; larvae, body size and colour, postgenal cleft, ratio between antenna and stalk of labral fan...|$|E
5000|$|They have white plumage {{including}} {{a thick layer}} of down, with only the face and <b>leg</b> <b>colours</b> distinguishing the two species. They look plump and dove-like, but are believed to be similar to the ancestors of the modern gulls and terns. There is a rudimentary spur on the [...] "wrist" [...] (carpal) joint, as in plovers. The skin around the eye is bare, as is the skin above the bill, which has carbuncular swellings. They derive their English name from the horny sheath which partially covers the upper mandible of their stout bills. They are commonly known in the Antarctic as [...] "Mutts" [...] because of their call which is a soft [...] "Mutt, mutt, mutt" ...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the four}} breeds of the Belgian Sheepdog is the local Malinois. The Mechelse koekoek is a local poultry breed, fleshy {{chickens}} with black and white feathers which extend on the birds' <b>legs,</b> with <b>colours</b> reminiscent of a cuckoo, hence the name.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying persons with a mobile robot. In the proposed system, people are first detected and then tracked with the robot's laser rangefinder sensor, using an independent Kalman filter for each person. After segmentation, the rectangular region of the image containing the person is divided into regions corresponding to the person's head, torso and <b>legs.</b> <b>Colour</b> features are extracted from each region for input to a pattern recognition system. Five alternative classification methods were investigated, including experiments on a real robot and with a static camera system. The best identification performance was obtained with an ensemble of self-organizing maps (ESOM), where one self-organizing map is trained for each person in the robot's database. We also discuss how to incorporate the new method into a complete application of a robotic security guard...|$|R
40|$|International audienceColour {{variation}} {{in time and}} space among animals may affect social relationships such as pairing and dominance interactions. For instance, some birds are naturally sensitive to <b>leg</b> <b>colour,</b> with some colours being more visible or attractive than others. The colour of the leg-rings used to mark birds may thus be related to behavioural and reproductive variables. Most studies have investigated this effect for adults during reproduction, but leg-ring colour may also affect the behaviour of young birds. We tested the potential effect of leg-ring colours on the within-brood dominance hierarchy of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings while each brood formed a stable and exclusive family unit with its mother. Ducklings did not acquire a within-brood dominance rank according to the colour of their own ring. This result suggests that mallards may not have a sensory bias for a given colouration. However, ducklings wearing a ring of the same colour as one of the two rings of their mother were dominant over their siblings. We discuss the potential behavioural and methodological implications of this result...|$|E
50|$|Podarcis liolepis (Columbretes wall lizard or Catalan wall lizard) is {{very similar}} to the other lizards in the Podarcis genus. This species was {{formerly}} described as a subspecies of the Iberian wall lizard, but has now been elevated to species status. These are slender lizards with long tails, narrow tapered heads and long thin toes, and stout <b>legs.</b> <b>Colours</b> are variable, although generally grey-brown. Often very subtle spots and stripes along the back and flanks can be seen and these can be more distinguished in the female. The underside is a much lighter cream or beige with sometimes a reddish tint. Adults grow 15-20 cm in length from the nose to tip of the tail. Body length can be a little as one third of the total body length, the tail making up the other two thirds.|$|R
25|$|The coat can {{be either}} smooth or rough; the smooth coat being close and flat while the rough is dense, flat, and more profuse around the neck and <b>legs.</b> The <b>colour</b> is {{typically}} a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears.|$|R

5000|$|According to The Guardian, [...] "His {{first great}} success {{came with the}} world famous Carimate chair {{produced}} by the Cassina company. The chair was a bestseller for years and mixed rural simplicity (the straw of the seat) with urban sophistication. There were the smooth lines of the wooden supports and <b>legs,</b> the <b>colour,</b> the pop-art bright red frame and elements of Scandinavian design." ...|$|R
50|$|The Myrmecia browningi looks {{similar to}} any bull ant {{that is similar}} to the jack jumper ant, {{excluding}} that its mandibles and <b>legs</b> are dark <b>colours.</b> The species was first described by Ogata & Taylor in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese pond heron is {{typically}} 47 cm long with white wings, a yellow bill {{with a black}} tip, yellow eyes and <b>legs.</b> Its overall <b>colour</b> is red, blue and white during breeding season, and greyish-brown and flecked with white at other times.|$|R
50|$|A. cochranae has a snout to vent length (SVL) up to 63 mm {{in males}} and 53 mm in females. It has {{relatively}} short and massive <b>legs.</b> The <b>colour</b> {{of its body}} varies from beige brown to chestnut red and the back exhibits light spots. A dark chestnut crossband extends from the snout to the head, the nape, and the eyes. The largest part of the tail is dark grey to black. The hatchlings have clear white crossbands on the tail.|$|R
5000|$|Turnspits were {{described}} as [...] "long-bodied, crooked-legged and ugly dogs, with a suspicious, unhappy look about them". Delabere Blaine, a 19th-century veterinarian (and self-described [...] "father of canine pathology"), classified the turnspit dog as a variety of spaniel. Often, they are shown with a white stripe {{down the center of}} their faces. According to Bingley's Memoirs of British Quadrupeds (1809): [...] The Turnspits are remarkable for their great length of body and short and usually crooked <b>legs.</b> Their <b>colour</b> is generally a dusky grey spotted with black or entirely black with the under parts whitish.|$|R
50|$|The legs of swans are {{normally}} a dark blackish grey colour, {{except for the}} two South American species, which have pink <b>legs.</b> Bill <b>colour</b> varies: the four subarctic species have black bills with varying amounts of yellow, {{and all the others}} are patterned red and black. Although birds do not have teeth, swans have beaks with serrated edges that look like small jagged 'teeth' as part of their beaks used for catching and eating aquatic plants and algae, but also molluscs, small fish, frogs and worms. The mute swan and black-necked swan have lumps at the base of their bills on the upper mandible.|$|R
50|$|The Posavac Hound is a solidly built {{dog with}} a {{somewhat}} long body, close-fitting drop ears, a long tail, and a gentle expression. The breed has an ideal height around 50 cm (20 ins) at the withers. The short, flat coat is slightly longer on the belly and backs of <b>legs</b> (feathering). Coat <b>colour</b> is a reddish wheaten, marked with white.|$|R
50|$|Early wool hose were {{fitted to}} the leg, and 15th century hose were often made particolored or mi-parti, having each <b>leg</b> a {{different}} <b>colour,</b> or even one leg made of two colors. These early hose were footed, {{in the manner}} of modern tights, and were open from the crotch to the leg. When very short doublets were in fashion, codpieces were added to cover the front opening.|$|R
50|$|The female {{is a very}} large, hairy orb-weaver, up to 25 mm {{in length}} (excluding <b>legs).</b> The overall <b>colour</b> is a dirty white, {{sometimes}} with a pinkish tinge. A distinctive feature {{is the presence of}} two roughly triangular dark patches {{at the front of the}} abdomen, each with a small white spot within. The male is very much smaller, only reaching 9 mm in length.|$|R
50|$|Adults grow to a {{total length}} of 15 - 25 cm, with a {{carapace}} 6 - 10 cm long. The antennal plate is visible {{in front of the}} carapace and has two large spines. The first pair of antennae are forked and the second pair are long, thick and spiny. There are long, slender flaggella at the tips of the antennae. There are no claws on the first four pairs of walking <b>legs.</b> The <b>colour</b> of this spiny lobster is dark greenish purple with pale transverse bands on the posterior edge of the abdominal segments. The base of the tail fan has pale spots and the antennae are a uniform <b>colour.</b> The walking <b>legs</b> have slender longitudinal pale stripes.|$|R
50|$|The Javan pond heron is {{typically}} 45 cm long with white wings, a yellow bill {{with a black}} tip, yellow eyes and <b>legs.</b> Its overall <b>colour</b> is orange, slaty and white during mating season, and brown and flecked with white out of the mating season. The non-breeding plumage {{is similar to that}} of the Chinese and Indian pond herons and is virtually indistinguishable in the field. It breeds from June to September. It is migratory.|$|R
5000|$|The adult of the {{nominate}} subspecies is {{a medium-sized}} rail, 23 - 28 cm long with a 38 - 45 cm wingspan. Males typically weigh 114 - 164 g and females are slightly lighter at 92 - 107 g. The upper parts from the forehead to tail are olive-brown with black streaks, {{especially on the}} shoulders. The sides {{of the head and}} the underparts down to the upper belly are dark slate-blue, except for a blackish area between bill and eye, and brownish sides to the upper breast. The flanks are barred black and white, and the undertail is white with some darker streaks. The long bill and the iris are red, and the legs are flesh-brown. The sexes are similar; although the female averages slightly smaller than the male, with a more slender bill, determining sex through measurements alone is unreliable. The juvenile has a blackish crown and a white chin and throat. The underparts are buff or white with darker bars, and the flank markings are brown and buff, rather than black and white. The undertail is buff, and the eye, bill and <b>leg</b> <b>colours</b> are duller than the adult. The downy chick is all black apart from a mainly white bill. After breeding, the rail has an extensive moult, and is flightless for about three weeks. Individual adults can be identified by the markings on the undertail, which are unique to each bird. Adult males have the strongest black undertail streaks. It has been suggested that the dark barring on the undertail of this species is a compromise between the signalling function of a pure white undertail, as found in open water or [...] species like the common moorhen, and the need to avoid being too conspicuous.|$|R
50|$|Its closest {{relative}} is {{the greater}} yellowlegs, which {{together with the}} spotted redshank form a close-knit group. Among them, these three species show all the basic <b>leg</b> and foot <b>colours</b> found in the shanks, demonstrating that this character is paraphyletic. They are also the largest shanks apart from the willet, which is altogether more robustly built. The greater yellowlegs and the common greenshank share a coarse, dark, and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage.|$|R
60|$|This may be {{considered}} as the typical breed, as it deviates only slightly from the wild Gallus bankiva, or, as perhaps more correctly named, ferrugineus. Beak strong; comb single and upright. Spurs long and sharp. Feathers closely appressed to the body. Tail with the normal number of 14 feathers. Eggs often pale buff. Disposition indomitably courageous, exhibited even in the hens and chickens. An unusual number of differently coloured varieties exist, such as black and brown-breasted reds, duckwings, blacks, whites, piles, etc., with their <b>legs</b> of various <b>colours.</b>|$|R
