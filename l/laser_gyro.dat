2500|$|When the Boeing 757-200 entered {{service in}} 1983, it was {{equipped}} with the first suitable ring laser gyroscope. This gyroscope took many years to develop, and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing. It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving. The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the <b>laser</b> <b>gyro</b> {{was that they were}} the only one that didn't have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes, so they wouldn't be competing against themselves. The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all, due to a problem called [...] "lock-in", whereby the two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other's frequencies toward convergence and therefore zero output. The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by applying a random white noise to the vibration. The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer-Vit, made by Owens Corning, because of helium leaks.|$|E

40|$|In {{past years}} much {{interest}} {{has been shown}} in the development of optical gyroscopes which offer the potential of solid state, highly reliable performance immune from many of the mechanical effects which restrict the performance of conventional spinning mass gyroscopes. Both ring laser and fiber optic gyros operate by sensing the difference in propagation time between beams of light traveling in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions about some closed optical path [1]. This paper presents a brief overview of optical gyroscopes and examines their suitability to a particular application where the current mechanical device has exhibited poor reliability. Conclusions are formulated that support the recommendation of developing an open loop, analog fiber optic gyroscope which will satisfy the requirements of the particular application of interest {{as well as those of}} similar systems. With the advent of laser technology in the 1960 ’s, a concentrated effort began to replace rotating mass gyros with devices utilizing circulating light. This effort resulted in the development of laser gyroscopes for certain high performance applications such as aircraft navigation. More recently, a parallel effort has emerged to develop fiber optics gyroscopes which can potentially be smaller, more rugged, and less costly than <b>laser</b> <b>gyros.</b> Key words: Rotating mass gyros, fiber optic gyroscope, ring <b>laser,</b> <b>laser</b> <b>gyros,</b> ope...|$|R

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of MET sensors over competing inertial technologies is their combination of size, performance and cost.

50|$|Apart from {{calibrating}} sights, {{there was}} no significant difference in field artillery laying arrangements for most of the 20th century. However, in the 1990s new or modified guns started adopting digital sights, following their successful use in the multi-launch rocket system developed in the 1970s. In these the azimuth and elevation were entered manually or automatically into a layers computer, then guided the layer's use of horizontal and elevation controls until the barrel was in the required horizontal and vertical alignment. This computed a correction for the cross level of the gun and used feedback from electro-mechanical devices, such as gyroscopes and electronic clinometers, aligned to the axis of the bore. These devices were subsequently replaced by ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyros.</b>|$|R
50|$|A ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyro</b> splits a beam {{of laser}} light into two beams in {{opposite}} directions through narrow tunnels in a closed circular optical path {{around the perimeter of}} a triangular block of temperature-stable Cervit glass with reflecting mirrors placed in each corner. When the gyro is rotating at some angular rate, the distance traveled by each beam becomes different—the shorter path being opposite to the rotation. The phase shift between the two beams can be measured by an interferometer, and is proportional to the rate of rotation (Sagnac effect).|$|E
