5000|$|Poole Methodist Chapel {{is a small}} {{building}} with a square plan. [...] It is constructed in red brick, and has a hipped slate roof. The chapel is in a single storey, and has an entrance front of three bays. The central door is panelled and is decorated with a Gothic motif. The doorway is round-headed, the fanlight being filled by a board decorated with seven radiating daggers. Above the doorway is a semicircular hood mould, over which is a <b>lamp</b> <b>fitting</b> and an elliptical panel inscribed with [...] "Wesleyan Methodist Chapel" [...] and the date 1834. The door is flanked on each side by a Gothic-style arched window containing Y-tracery, over which is a pointed hood mould. Under the eaves, the bricks form a dentilled pattern.|$|E
5000|$|When completed, the {{memorial}} stood 14 feet high, with a dome supported by four worked marble columns, {{supported by a}} polished granite die. On {{two sides of the}} dome were sculptured likenesses of Dr Koch. The marble columns and sculptured work were imported from Carrara in Italy. The granite for the die and plinth came from Mount Elliot, near Townsville - that used for the die was polished to a mirror-like finish, while that of the plinth was [...] "fine-axed".The memorial was still in the Townsville workshops in late May 1903 but was in place at the intersection of Abbott and Spence Streets by 13 June 1903, when it was unveiled by Major-General Sir Herbert Chermside, the Governor of Queensland. By , {{the memorial}} also carried two street signs. By the late 1920s the single lamp and lamp base {{at the top of the}} dome had been replaced with a pair of gas street lamps suspended from a tall metal column. By the late 1940s, the lamps and <b>lamp</b> <b>fitting</b> at the top of the dome had been removed entirely. Photographic evidence suggests that the memorial remained in the centre of the intersection until at least the mid-1960s, but had been removed to nearby Anzac Memorial Park (bounded by Abbott and Spence Streets and the Esplanade), by the mid-1970s. It was relocated within this park following redevelopment of the reserve in the mid-1990s.|$|E

Surakarta: Teacher Training and Education of Surakarta Sebelas Maret University, January, 2013. The {{objective}} {{of research is}} to find out: 1) background of Mr. Tutur Sudrajat’s metal lamp craft establishment, (2) material and tools as well as process used, (3) design motive applied to metal lamp craft, and (4) finishing technique used. The strategy used was a single embedded case study. The data sources used were informant, place and event, document and literature. Techniques of collecting data used were interview, observation, and documentation. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling. Data validation was done using data triangulation and review informant. Techniques of analyzing data used were interactife: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing or verification. Considering the result of research, the following conclusion could be drawn. (1) The background of metal lamp craft establishment departed from Mr. Tutur hobby who loved art since he was very young. For that reason, he wanted to create the ornamental lamp with his own creation and attempted to make ornamental lamp with unique and different design motive, and finally, it is known as Metal Lamp Craft Ethnic. (2) The material and tools as well as process used in producing included: 2. 1) Materials. a) main material: plate, carbon paper, treatment liquid, mica, lamp, cable, electrical plug, fitting, screw and bolt. b) supporting material: oil, glue. c) finishing material: putty, paint, thinner, stretch-resistant plastic, packing cardboard. 2. 2) The tools used were: pencil, ballpoint, ruler, meter tape, U saw, jig saw, and mini drill, hand drill, stand drill, electric weld, cutter grinder, grinder, rived pincer, file, pincer, metal cutter, acrylic cutter, hammer, metal scissor, compass, sandpaper, screwdriver, brush, kanebo, compressor, spray gun, hair dryer. 2. 3) The production process: preparing tool and material, preparing design mall, cutting the plate, moving the mall design into plate, cutting, sandpapering, making the hole for screw and bolt, metal folding, plat washing using treatment liquid, drying, drying heating, brushing, putty, priming up to finishing painting, paint drying, the installation of <b>lamp</b> <b>fitting,</b> cable, electric plug, mica, anterior, lamp covers installation, and packing, (3) the design motive applied to metal lamp craft included: a) pakem batik motif, b) contemporary batik motif, c) puppet motif, d) modern motif, e) ball logo motif, f) calligraphy motif, g) cartoon, (4) finishing technique used in producing metal lamp craft included: putty, sandpapering, painting, drying, and packaging...|$|E
50|$|A bipin or bi-pin, (sometimes {{referred}} to as two-pin, bipin cap or bipin socket), is a standard from the IEC for <b>lamp</b> <b>fittings.</b> These are used on many small incandescent light bulbs (especially halogen lamps), and for starters on some types of fluorescent lights as well.|$|R

40|$|Energy-efficient {{lighting}} installations, {{together with}} dimming controls, {{can make a}} good contribution to building energy conservation. Energy-efficient <b>lamp</b> <b>fittings</b> provide high light-output values with less power consumption, and electronic circuitry is more efficient than conventional ballasts. Dimming controls can lower lamp output to save energy when illuminance from daylight and light fittings exceeds the target value. This article studies lighting energy consumption and cost analysis when such lighting schemes are used. The findings would be useful for planning green and sustainable energy schemes and applicable to other spaces with similar architectural layouts and lighting control systems.

2500|$|Although an {{inductive}} pulse {{makes it more}} likely that the lamp will start when the starter switch opens, it is not actually necessary. The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>fittings</b> used a filament lamp as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s. [...] Special lamps were manufactured that were rated at 170volts and 120watts. [...] The lamp had a thermal starter built into the 4 pin base. The power requirements were much larger than using an inductive ballast (though the consumed current was the same), but the warmer light from the lamp type of ballast was often preferred by users particularly in a domestic environment.|$|R

50|$|Garden {{lighting}} can be {{an important}} aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, {{it is more important to}} determine the type of <b>lamps</b> and <b>fittings</b> needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.|$|R

The sunset flush had faded, but the sky shone a transcendent green. The air was very clear; every wavy line of bluff was picked out in a {{wonderful}} deep blue. Muriel thought she had never seen such strength and vividness of color. Then she glanced round the long car. It was comfortable except for the jolting; the silvery gray of its cane-backed seats contrasted with the paneling of deep brown. The big <b>lamps</b> and metal <b>fittings</b> gleamed with nickel. All the girl saw connected her with luxurious civilization, and she wondered with a stirring of curiosity what awaited her in the wilds, where man still grappled with nature in primitive fashion.|$|R
