5|$|Following her {{departure}} from parliament at the 2013 election, Gillard has remained engaged with the <b>Labor</b> Party. After Labor's defeat {{at the federal}} election held in September 2013, Gillard penned an op-ed for Guardian Australia, wherein she wrote about her legacy and how she believes the <b>Labor</b> Party ought to rebuild. In June 2015, Gillard participated in Sarah Ferguson's The Killing Season, a three-part documentary series which chronicles {{the events of the}} Rudd–Gillard years in power. The television series featured in-depth interviews with key <b>Labor</b> Party officials during the Rudd–Gillard Governments. Prior to the 2016 election campaign, Gillard offered her assistance to the <b>Labor</b> party, whereby a video was released of her endorsing and seeking donations for the party's education policy. She later joined former <b>Labor</b> Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating at Bill Shorten's <b>Labor</b> campaign launch on 19 June 2016.|$|E

Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the <b>Labor</b> Party candidate's 50.39%. Weaver contested the result, accusing the <b>Labor</b> Party of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the <b>Labor</b> Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E

5|$|<b>Labor</b> {{conducted}} an extensive campaign in marginal LCL {{seats at the}} 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the <b>Labor</b> Party taking power. As Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, the youthful and charismatic Dunstan made his older peers look lethargic as television became increasingly ubiquitous. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying <b>Labor</b> as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in <b>Labor</b> replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, <b>Labor</b> lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander {{and was able to}} convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, <b>Labor</b> won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.|$|E

40|$|Solow (1958) argued that, from 1929 to 1954, US {{aggregate}} <b>labor's</b> share was not stable {{relative to}} what we would expect given individual industry <b>labor's</b> shares. I confirm and extend this result using data from 1958 to 1996 that includes 35 industries (roughly two-digit SIC level) and spans the entire US economy. Changes in industry shares in total value-added are essentially unrelated to aggregate <b>labor's</b> share movements. Industry <b>labor's</b> shares comovements contribute positively to aggregate <b>labor's</b> share movements. These findings give us a clearer perspective {{on one of the}} stylized facts of economic growth. If the great macroeconomic ratio is meaningful, it must be interpreted in terms of long-run, offsetting shifts in "services" industries versus "goods" industries, both in terms of their <b>labor's</b> shares and shares in total value-added.

40|$|Through {{description}} of three-steps characteristic of dual economic theory and its practical {{significance to the}} process of industrialization and urbanization in China, and making comparative analysis between important criterion of "Lewis turning point" and current situation of rural surplus <b>labors</b> market in China, we can find that there exists a great deal of surplus <b>labors</b> in rural areas in our country, improvement of peasant income is the result of external interference of government, and demographic dividend in our country hasn’t finished. These phenomena go against the theory of "Lewis turning point". So it can prove that "Lewis turning point" in China hasn’t come yet. The paper points out the major factors of coexistence of â€œmigrant workers scarcityâ€ and <b>labors</b> redundancy in our country. The first one is structure contradiction of <b>labors</b> market; the second one is law of supply-demand of <b>labors</b> market; the third one is institutional barrier which hinders <b>labors</b> in free flow of census register and social guarantee. Therefore, if we want to realize successful transfer of rural surplus <b>labors</b> and the goal of industrialization and urbanization, we must promote upgrading of industrial structure, change the style of economic growth and realize harmonious development of regional economy in macrocosmic level; And in microcosmic level, we should eliminate institutional barrier which hinders transfer of rural surplus <b>labors.</b> Rural surplus <b>labors</b> transfer, â€œMigrant workers scarcityâ€, Lewis turning point, Institutional reformï¼ŒChina, Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} stability of aggregate <b>labor's</b> share constitutes {{one of the}} great macroeconomic ratios. However, changes in individual industry <b>labor's</b> shares are essentially statistically independent of one another, and the average values of industry <b>labor's</b> shares vary widely. We present a two-sector model of economic development with induced innovation that can rationalize these phenomena as well as several other empirical regularities of real economies. Specifically, the model can account for (i) manufacturing industries becoming increasingly capital-intensive over time despite (ii) an increase in the relative price and share in total output of service industries; (iii) aggregate <b>labor's</b> share remains within a narrow range despite (iv) individual industry <b>labor's</b> shares being uncorrelated with one another over time. In the long-run the model economy can attain either a neoclassical steady-state or endogenous growth, giving it the potential to account {{for a wide range of}} real world development experiences. : <b>Labor's</b> Share, Factor Shares, Development, Biased Technical Change...|$|R

5|$|<b>Labor</b> {{remained}} the largest party in Parliament, but lost the two-party preferred vote at 49.2% and saw its numbers decrease from 26 to 23.

Dunstan appealed to Connelly and offered him the role of Speaker. However, the reforms to the Legislative Council's election bore fruit. Of the 11 seats up for election, <b>Labor</b> won six with 47.3% of the vote, and the LM two, allowing <b>Labor</b> a total of 10 seats.

40|$|Background: Lactation onset {{is a term}} of {{multiplying}} {{breast milk}} until the release of breast milk for the first time. It is also perceived by mothers as a bit hard breast, inflammed, and full of breast milk or the release of colostrum. Colostrum is the first liquid secreted by breast milk gland since the first day until the fourth day of labour. One {{of the factors that}} influences lactation onset is labour methods. Mothers who undergo sectio caesaria surgery will experience pain and prolonged effects of anesthesia compared to mothers with normal <b>labors.</b> Objective: To investigate the difference of colostrum releasing onset in post partum mothers with normal <b>labors</b> and sectio caesaria in Panembahan Senopati General Hospital, Bantul. Method: This study was quantitative with cross sectional design. The number of samples were 80 respondents selected with purposive sampling technique. Study instrument was observational sheets. Data analysis applied Mann-Whitney test. Result: The majority of respondents who had normal <b>labors</b> and sectio caesaria experienced different colostrum onset. In normal <b>labors,</b> the time of colostrum release was 1 day. In sectio caesaria <b>labors,</b> the time of colostrum release was 2 days. The average duration of post partum mothers with normal <b>labors</b> was 13, 6 hours and post partum mothers with sectio caesaria was 22, 6 hours. The result of Mann-Whitney test was that there was a difference between colostrum release onset of post partum mothers with normal <b>labors</b> and sectio caesaria with p-value of 0, 001 (p< 0, 05). Conclusion: Colostrum onsets were different in normal <b>labors</b> and sectio caesaria <b>labors.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Still, many simply define dyspnea as {{difficulty}} in breathing without further specification, which may confuse it with e.g. <b>labored</b> breathing or tachypnea (rapid breathing). <b>Labored</b> breathing has occasionally {{been included in the}} definition of dyspnea as well.

For instance, in respiratory arrest by a primary failure in respiratory muscles the patient, if conscious, may experience dyspnea, yet without having any <b>labored</b> breathing or tachypnea. The other way around, <b>labored</b> breathing or tachypnea can voluntarily be performed even when there is no dyspnea.|$|R
