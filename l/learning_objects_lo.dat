40|$|A benefit promised from <b>learning</b> <b>objects</b> (<b>LOs)</b> is {{the ability}} to reuse and repurpose them, thereby saving time and money when {{producing}} learning content. Yet anecdotal evidence and informed opinions indicate that relatively little reuse is taking place as of yet. Thinking of information as data put into context, it is hypothesized that the higher contextual component of <b>learning</b> <b>objects</b> and the associated cost of contextualization is inhibiting reuse and repurposing in the education and training arenas. Standards and specifications such as LO Metadata (LOM) and the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) serve to reduce that cost and thereby promote reuse. They permit the creation of <b>learning</b> <b>objects</b> that have both pedagogic impact and reusability, and are therefore of more value in many situations.
