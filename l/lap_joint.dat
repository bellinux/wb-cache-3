5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, <b>lap</b> <b>joint,</b> corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a <b>lap</b> <b>joint</b> geometry.|$|E

The NTSB investigation revealed evidence of pre-existing fatigue, and determined the probable cause of the incident to be related to an error in the manufacturing process for joining fuselage crown skin panels. This incident led to the FAA increasing the inspection rate of certain airframes. The incident followed a similar one, Southwest Airlines Flight 2294, in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Friction stir {{lap welding}} of 7 B 04 {{aluminum}} alloy {{was conducted in}} the present paper, {{and the effect of}} welding speed on the defect features and mechanical performance of <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> was investigated. The results indicate that the hook defect at the advancing side (AS) can reduce the effective thickness of the top sheet, and the sheet thinning level is gradually lowered by increasing the welding speed. The cold lap defect at the retreating side (RS) can result in effective thickness reduction in both top and bottom sheets, and the total height of the cold lap defect varies slightly with the welding speed. The tensile properties of the <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> are largely related to the sheet thinning levels caused by the defects. The fracture strength of AS-loaded <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> is progressively increased with increasing welding speed, while that of RS-loaded <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> evolves slightly with welding speed. It is found that the affecting characteristic of loading configuration on the joint performance is also dependent on the welding speed. At lower welding speeds, the AS-loaded <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> show lower fracture strength than the RS-loaded <b>lap</b> <b>joints.</b> When the welding speed is high, the AS-loaded <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> present superior tensile properties to RS-loaded <b>lap</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

The process of making test specimens and performing tests in order to assess the tensile, shear and compressive properties of the bulk adhesive, was followed by extensive numerical modelling of the Iosipescu shear test with the LS-DYNA finite element software to develop and verify the adhesive material model on coupon level. Different measurement methods, e. g. strain gauges and digital image correlation (DIC), were used to obtain accurate strains in the initial linear elastic part of the stress-strain curve and in the yield range for all test temperatures. Single <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> of aluminium-aluminium and composite-composite adherends were tested to obtain failure loads at room temperature and sub-zero temperatures.

40|$|The {{long term}} {{durability}} of FRP repaired steel structures {{is crucial for}} their safe use and effective design. Past studies that investigated the durability of FRP-steel single <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> have focused on their response under extreme temperature and curing conditions, but without representing the actual on-site conditions for typical civil engineering applications. This research presents an experimental investigation into the effects of hygrothermal cycles and sustained loading on steel-CFRP bonded <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> under typical environmental conditions. A total of 84 steel-CFRP single <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> and 126 Epoxy specimens were prepared and exposed to five hygrothermal cycles and sustained loading conditions. Specimens that survived the long-term loading were then tested to failure for evaluating their residual strength. The temperature cycles ranged from 15 oC to 50 oC and the relative humidity ranged between 40 - 70 % under different combinations. These practical ranges of hygrothermal cycles were combined with realistic curing temperatures and curing times. Sustained loads that equal to 30 % and 50 % of the failure loads were also applied. The results show that exposure to hygrothermal conditions only has little impact on the bonding strength. However, when hygrothermal and sustained loading were applied simultaneously, the bond strength of the <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> was significantly affected in some circumstances. The thesis starts with a background that includes the different type of FRP application on the field {{as well as the}} modes of failure commonly found in steel-FRP composite application. The factors that affect the durability of the <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> are discussed as well. It is then followed by a critical literature review of the most related studies on the durability of steel-CFRP <b>lap</b> <b>joints.</b> Next, existing classical models that are used for the analysis of <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> are discussed and compared. The models are then used to provide an approximate prediction of the expected failure loads in the experimental study. The experimental plan and results are then collated and discussed in detail followed by the main conclusions of the thesis...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} assess failure within the adhesive, a failure {{criterion}} is needed. The suitability of different failure criteria for adhesives in single <b>lap</b> <b>joints</b> was studied by Harris and Adams [33], with the conclusion that for toughened ductile adhesive like the one {{used in the present}} study, the maximum principal strain is the best suited criterion. Further work carried out by Broughton et al. [22] also showed that strain-based failure criteria give more accurate results than stress-based failure criteria for adhesively bonded joints. Additionally, this work showed that a maximum principal strain criterion was better suited to scarf joints, whereas a peak shear strain criterion was better suited to <b>lap</b> <b>joints.</b> The models analyzed in this study have the characteristics of <b>lap</b> <b>joints,</b> thus the peak shear strain is chosen as failure criterion.|$|R
