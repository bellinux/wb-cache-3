5|$|Originating in German soil today Riesling is Germany’s leading grape variety, {{known for}} its {{characteristic}} “transparency” in flavour and presentation of terroir, and its balance between fruit and mineral flavours. In Germany, Riesling normally ripens between late September and late November, and <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> Riesling can be picked as late as January.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{wines from}} Germany cover {{a vast array}} of tastes from sweet to off-dry halbtrocken to dry trocken. <b>Late</b> <b>harvest</b> Rieslings can ripen to become very sweet dessert wines of the beerenauslese (BA) and trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) class.|$|E
5|$|Other {{varieties}} {{with significant}} production by harvested acres in 2016 are Syrah, Merlot, Tempranillo, Pinot blanc, Gewürztraminer, Viognier, Cabernet franc, Müller-Thurgau, Sauvignon blanc, and Zinfandel, V. vinifera based wines produced in smaller quantities include Arneis, Baco noir, Black Muscat, Chenin blanc, Dolcetto, Gamay noir, Grenache, Marechal Foch, Malbec, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petite Syrah, Sangiovese, and Sémillon. The state also produces fruit wine, sparkling wine, <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wine, ice wine, and dessert wine.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E
5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|Zinfandel {{is grown}} across the {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker.|$|E

Early harvested almonds also had similar oil quality (based on ultraviolet absorption coefficient measurements) and oil composition but lower sugar content and modified sugar composition compared with <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> almonds. Storage of shelled almonds resulted in kernels with higher oil content, better oil quality, similar oil composition, similar sugar content and some modifications in sugar composition compared with in-shell stored almonds. Finally, storage for 6 months at either 5 or 20 degreesC resulted in lower moisture content, higher oil content, similar oil quality and composition, similar sugar content and some modifications in sugar composition compared with freshly harvested almonds.

But 1 -MCP treatment has no significant effects on the indexes related with ethylene synthesis to the seeds of <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> fruit. 1 -MCP can be used to inhibit the synthesis of ethylene in the seeds effectively and keep the quality and extend the shelf life of early harvested Yali pear fruit...|$|R
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. <b>Late</b> <b>Harvest</b> wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the world's wine producing regions lie between the temperate latitudes of 30° and 50° in both hemispheres with regions lying closer to the equator typically harvesting earlier due to their warmer climates. In the Northern Hemisphere, vineyards in Cyprus begin harvesting as early as July. In California some sparkling wine grapes are harvested in late July to early August at a slightly unripe point to help maintain acidity in the wine. The {{majority of}} Northern Hemisphere harvesting occurs in late August to early October with some <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wine grapes being harvested throughout the autumn. In Germany, the United States and Canada, ice wine grapes can be harvested as late as January. In the Southern Hemisphere harvest can begin as early as January 1 {{in some of the}} warmer climate sites in New South Wales, Australia. The majority of Southern Hemisphere harvesting occurs between the months of February and April with some cool climate sites like Central Otago, New Zealand picking <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wine grapes in June.|$|E
25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|E
50|$|Verdea {{is a white}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety that {{originated}} in Tuscany but is today mainly grown in the Lombardy wine region of northern Italy. The grape is sometimes confused with the white Verdeca grape of the Apulia region and the French wine grape Verdesse from Savoy due to similarities in their names and synonyms.

40|$|The {{research}} on forming atypical aging off-flavor in wines (UTA) was {{revealed a significant}} correlation between the UTA, the concentration of 2 -aminoacetophenones (AAP) and the wines produced from grapes affected by stress (lack of water or nitrogen supply), wines from grapes grown in high yielding vineyards or earlier harvested grapes. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the different grape ripeness and synthesis of indole- 3 -acetic acid and tryptophan in must and wine of white cultivar Rhine Rieslin (Vitis vinifera L.). Treatments in the research have been the two periods of the grape harvesting dates (regular and <b>late</b> <b>harvesting)</b> from two different locations (Mladice and Hrnjevac). Indole- 3 -acetic acid and tryptophan in must and wine were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector. As the process of ripening was going on the concentration of indole- 3 -acetic acid and tryptophan in must and wines have been reduced regardless the year of research and vineyards positions. Wines produced from <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> grapes have a lower possibility of the appearance of atypical aroma aging effect compared to the regular harvest...|$|R

25|$|The {{focus of}} Sancerre winemakers is usually {{to express the}} pure fruit {{flavours}} of Sauvignon blanc and the natural terroir of the region with very little adjustments taking place during winemaking. Most Sancerre is produced without malolactic fermentation and little oak influences. However, since the late 20th century more producers have begun experimenting {{with some degree of}} oak fermentation or aging. While most of the wines in this area are produced dry, in exceptionally warm and ripe years (such as 1989) some producers have made a <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wine. However, these are very rare. And while Sancerre blanc is the most widely produced style, both Sancerre rouge and a dry rosé style wine are also produced with Pinot noir.|$|E

25|$|The wines have {{historically}} been predominantly white, and the finest made from Riesling. Many wines have been sweet and low in alcohol, light and unoaked. Historically many of the wines (other than <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> wines) were probably dry (trocken), as techniques to stop fermentation did not exist. Recently much more German white wine is being made in the dry style again. Much of the wine sold in Germany is dry, especially in restaurants. However most exports are still of sweet wines, particularly to the traditional export markets such as Great Britain, which is the leading export market {{both in terms of}} volume and value. The United States (second in value, third in volume) and the Netherlands (second in volume, third in value) are two other important export markets for German wine.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} several {{alternatives}} to the chemical control of postharvest decay have been examined but satisfactory levels of control, with a single system, have not been achieved yet. In the present study {{the results of an}} integrated postharvest approach are reported. Early and <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> hybrid mandarin fruit “Fremont” and “Fairchild”, inoculated with Penicillium digitatum (Pers. :Fr.) Saccardo, were cured at 36 °C for 36 h with 95 % RH and then fumigated with 0, 5, 15, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μL/L of acetic acid (AAC) vapours for 15 min. Following the treatments, fruit was stored at 20 °C and 80 % RH to simulate a marketing period, and after 2 weeks the decay incidence and the visual appearance were evaluated. Curing or fumigations performed alone reduced decay with respect to untreated fruit, but the best control was achieved with combined treatments. For early harvested fruit the lowest decay percentage was obtained by using 75 μL/L with 8. 3 % and 2. 1 % of rots for “Fremont” and “Fairchild”, respectively, whereas for <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> fruit the highest efficacy was observed using 50 μL/L (1. 4 % and 6. 6 %).

25|$|The {{period of}} the 19th century {{before the arrival of}} {{phylloxera}} was a golden age of wine. The industrial revolution enriched a bourgeoisie clientele for the best wines and the rural exodus to the factories created a large market for mass-produced wines. A prominent example for white wines was the viticulture in Germany. The feeling of freedom infused into the German winemakers under French occupation during the First Empire prevented the aristocracy and the clergy from recovering all the vineyards from which they were dispossessed. The practice of <b>late</b> <b>harvest</b> was widespread and the more or less sweet wines gained balance against their always lively acidity. In 1872 the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute was created and it was the source of a great amount of interbreeding giving new varieties – the best known of these is the Müller-Thurgau. During the same period, Switzerland adopted, along the shores of Lake Geneva, vineyards predominantly producing white wine.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the wine}} renaissance of the 1960s, {{the quality of}} California's dessert and {{fortified}} wines have been dramatically improved. Beringer {{was one of the}} first to create a botrytized wine from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. Though unlike in Sauternes, Beringer's wine was made of grapes regularly harvested and then introduced at the winery to Botrytis cinerea spores created in a laboratory. Since then California winemakers in places like the Anderson Valley AVA have found vineyards where this noble rot can occur naturally on the grapes. The Anderson and Alexander Valley AVAs have also developed a reputation for their <b>Late</b> <b>Harvest</b> wines made from Riesling. Several French and Italian style Muscat wines are produced throughout California and are known for their intense aromatics and balanced acidity. The port-style wines in California are often made from the traditional Portuguese wine grapes like Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão and Tinta Roriz. Some uniquely Californian styles are also made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} the stage of ripeness on L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) gene expression, accumulation of anthocyanins and total phenolics, and on antioxidant activity in the skin of table grapes treated with 20 % CO 2 + 20 % O 2 + 60 % N 2 for 3 or 6 d at low temperature (0 °C). The residual effect of high CO 2 treatment after transfer to air was also studied. In early harvested grapes, neither the anthocyanin content nor the accumulation of VcPAL mRNA was affected by any of the CO 2 treatments applied. However, in <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> grapes, the duration of high CO 2 treatment determined its effect and a 6 d treatment with CO 2 sustained higher levels of total phenolics and anthocyanin accumulation, and VcPAL expression than observed in untreated <b>late</b> <b>harvested</b> grapes.
