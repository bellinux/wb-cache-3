5|$|In 2012 Syngenta bought Belgian RNAi firm Devgen for $522 {{million and}} Monsanto paid $29.2 {{million for the}} {{exclusive}} rights to intellectual property from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. The International Potato Center in Lima, Peru is looking for genes to target in the sweet potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally. Other researchers are trying to silence genes in ants, caterpillars and pollen beetles. Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn rootworm, a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts <b>larval</b> <b>growth,</b> killing them within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the study}} of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis larvae, {{barbiturates}} were found to increase {{the length of the}} larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase {{in the time it takes}} to reach the stage of pupation. Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development. However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> and then decreases the development rate of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults. Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.|$|E

25|$|The torpedo scad, Megalaspis cordyla (also {{known as}} the hardtail scad, finny scad, finletted {{mackerel}} scad and cordyla scad), is a species of moderately large marine fish classified in the jack and horse mackerel family, Carangidae. The torpedo scad is distributed throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Tonga in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in south. It is a schooling pelagic fish which occupies the surface layers of both inshore and offshore oceanic waters. The torpedo scad is easily identified by both its 'torpedo' shaped body and a series of detached finlets at the rear of both the dorsal and anal fins. The largest recorded individual was 80cm long and weighed 4 kg, although it is more common at lengths less than 40cm. It is a predatory species, taking a variety of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans by both active and filter feeding. There is a shift in diet as the species grow; however fish is the dominant prey in all size classes. Torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at 22cm in females and 26.4cm in males, with spawning occurring between March and July in India, where significant research into <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> and morphometrics has been carried out.|$|E
500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{reproduction}} occur in frogs, prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. In the former, {{adopted by the}} majority of species, adult frogs [...] at certain times of year assemble at a pond, lake or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae. This often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals. In explosive breeders, mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area. In these frogs, mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> is rapid in order {{to make use of the}} ephemeral pools before they dry up.|$|E
2500|$|Also, [...] {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to assess the effects of light exposure on developmental variability in larvae.

These findings suggest darkness may be a stimulus for <b>larval</b> <b>growth.</b> However, the variations in light photoperiods mentioned above had no effect on pupal duration times.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The {{effects of}} food {{availability}} and water temperature on <b>larval</b> Pacific herring <b>growth</b> rates and survival were studied using a coupled biophysical model for 1993 through 1997. The herring growth model included feeding gains, metabolic costs, mortality losses and vertical migration of the herring larvae. In years when springtime oceanographic processes {{resulted in a}} high concentration of zooplankton, food availability did not limit <b>larval</b> herring <b>growth</b> rates; water temperature determined survival. However, in other years, food availability did limit survival, either due to insufficient food concentrations or to inaccessibility of the food. Vertical migration occasionally was restricted by strong water column stratification, which prevented the larvae from reaching food concentrations sufficient for growth. Thus the amount of food, the temperature, and the vertical distribution of the food and the larvae were found to affect growth.

50|$|The larvae of burying beetles feed {{partly by}} begging for predigested carrion {{from parents and}} partly by self-feeding. In this species, {{juvenile}} hormone, a major regulatory insect hormone, stimulates begging and growth. Elevating larval juvenile hormone levels (by topical application of the analogue methoprene) increase begging indicating that juvenile hormone in insects could have a similar function to that of testosterone and corticosterone in birds. Elevated juvenile hormone levels {{have a negative effect}} on <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> regardless of whether larvae forage by begging or by self-feeding. This shows that the effects of juvenile hormone on <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> are independent of the effects on begging, suggesting that the mechanisms by which juvenile hormone affects offspring growth in insects differ from those by which testosterone and corticosterone affect growth in birds.|$|E

50|$|Increased acidity {{levels in}} {{breeding}} areas may be problematic for moor frog populations, as it reduces survival {{and growth of}} the aquatic embryos and larvae. When exposed to acidity, moor frogs were however shown {{to be able to}} adapt relatively rapidly (within 16-40 generations). Local adaptation to acidity is also possible in survival during the embryonic stage, during which frogs are most sensitive to severe acidity. Moreover, compared to those from neutral sites, acid origin populations have higher embryonic and larval acid tolerance (survival and larval period were less negatively affected by low pH), higher <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> but slower larval development rates, and larger metamorphosing size. Divergence in embryonic acid tolerance and metamorphic size correlates most strongly with breeding pond pH, whereas divergence in larval period and <b>larval</b> <b>growth</b> correlates most strongly with latitude and predator density, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Newly {{recruited}} juvenile {{gray snapper}} Lutjanus griseus were collected each fall for two consecutive years (2000 and 2001) from sites in Florida and North Carolina. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across sites based on otolith microstructure. <b>Larval</b> otolith <b>growth</b> trajectories were generally similar for larvae from different sites and years; however, the mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) was 1 d longer for fish from North Carolina than for {{fish from the}} more southern sites. As a result, fish were larger at settlement to North Carolina. Estimated juvenile growth rates ranged between 0. 62 and 0. 88 mm/d and differed across sites and years, growth being generally faster at the southern sites. Water temperature accounts for some of this variability; however, site-specific differences in other factors probably contributed {{to some of the}} observed differences in growth. Back-calculated spawning patterns showed a lunar association with the new and first-quarter moons at all sites except for North Carolina. Settlement patterns were lunar cyclic as well: settlement pulsed during the third-quarter and new moons at all sites, and in North Carolina an additional pulse associated with the full moon was present. Patterns of <b>larval</b> and juvenile <b>growth</b> coupled with recruitment dynamics across the latitudinal gradient are consistent with northward Gulf Stream transport of larvae from southern spawning sites...|$|R
