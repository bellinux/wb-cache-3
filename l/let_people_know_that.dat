25|$|Guru: The will {{to suffer}} and {{sacrifice}} should be there. But {{there is no}} need to get drenched or starved. Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you intend to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my view…. Give publicity to all these in the papers. <b>Let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E

[...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to <b>let</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

But I was wishing {{we had a good}} farm in Bartlett, or Bethlehem, or Littleton, or some other township round the White Mountains; but not where they could tumble on our heads. I should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called Squire, and sent to General Court for a term or two; for a plain, honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer. And when I should be grown quite an old man, and you an old woman, {{so as not to be}} long apart, I might die happy enough in my bed, and leave you all crying around me.
