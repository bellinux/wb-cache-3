25|$|At {{least one}} {{contributing}} mechanism for reduced spermatogenesis in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum is at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> degrees cooler {{than in the}} abdomen. Animal experiments {{in the middle of}} the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than a simple matter of temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E
25|$|At {{the death}} of her husband, Maria Isabella’s eldest son became King Ferdinand II. Unbeknownst to her, she {{was at the center of}} a liberal {{conspiracy}} hatched by Prince Vincenzo Ruffo della Scaletta and Peter Ugo, Marquis delle Favare. Their intention was to name Maria Isabella regent, displacing her conservative son from the throne for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years. The plot was discovered and immediately crushed by the young king. Ferdinand II was only 20 years old. Shy and quiet, he was, however, more energetic than his father and grandfather had been and took his duties as king more seriously. The relationship between Maria Isabella and Ferdinand II was cold. The Queen mother had a marked preference for her second son, Charles, Prince of Capua, who was more outgoing and shared her frivolity.|$|E

Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe geomagnetic electrokinetograph (GEK) {{was used to}} measure surface currents near the center of Monterey Bay during six separate 24 -hour periods from May through July, 1972. An average of 244 current vectors were derived for each cruise. The mean currents from these cruises are all southerly and ranged from 4. 1 cm/sec to 20. 4 cm/sec. The average of these mean currents is 12. 1 cm/sec toward 163 °T. These values were compared with individual currents derived from dynamic topographies from the same period.

40|$|We {{present a}} multi-epoch (20 years baseline) kinematical {{investigation}} of HH 52, 53, and 54 at optical and near-IR wavelengths, along with medium and high- resolution spectroscopic analyses, probing the kinematical and physical time variability {{conditions of the}} gas along the flows. By means of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength narrow-band images, we derived proper motions, tangential velocities, velocity and flux variability of the knots. Radial velocities and physical parameters of the gas were derived from spectroscopy. Finally, spatial velocities and inclination of the flows were obtained by combining both imaging and spectroscopy. The P. M. analysis reveals three distinct, partially overlapping outflows. In 20 years, about 60 % of the knots show some degree of flux variability. Our set of observations apparently indicates acceleration and deceleration {{in a variety of}} knots along the jets. For about 20 % of the knots, mostly coincident with working surfaces or interacting knots along the flows, a relevant variability in both flux and velocity is observed. We argue that both variabilities are related and that {{all or part of the}} kinetic energy lost by the interacting knots is successively radiated. The analysis indicates the presence of very light, ionised, and hot flows, impacting a denser medium. Several knots are deflected.

These kegs should not exceed 22 inches in length, 10 in extreme breadth, and 7 in extreme width; a cask of these measurements would hold about 40 lbs. weight of water, and its own weight might be 15 lbs. As the water is expended, {{it is easy to}} replace the diminished weight by putting on a bag from one of the other packs. Before starting away into the bush, these kegs should be satisfactorily fitted and adjusted to the pack-saddle that is intended to carry them, {{in such a way that}} they may be packed on to it with the <b>least</b> possible trouble. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> leather or iron loops Fixed to each keg, and made to catch on to the hooks which are let flush into the sides of the pack-saddle, will effect this.|$|R
