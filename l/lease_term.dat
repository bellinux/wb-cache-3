2500|$|WRC was {{a charter}} {{affiliate}} of the National Broadcasting Company when it launched in November 1926. When NBC split its programming into two networks two months later, WRC {{was assigned to}} the Red Network. NBC's other radio chain, the Blue Network, had no affiliate in the national capital until RCA entered into a lease agreement with WMAL in 1933. [...] WRC and WMAL would become de facto sister stations during the <b>lease</b> <b>term,</b> which ran for eight years. [...] WRC moved its frequency to 950 AM in 1928, and then shifted to 980 AM in 1941 {{as a result of the}} North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. [...] With WRC as its cornerstone, RCA/NBC later birthed WNBW television (channel 4, now WRC-TV) and WRC-FM (93.9Mc., now WKYS); both stations signed-on in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} items {{that may be}} sold with vendor financing, for example, {{automobile}} leasing, the notional cost of the good may effectively be hidden and the APR subsequently rendered meaningless. An example {{is a case where}} an automobile is leased to a customer based on a [...] "manufacturer's suggested retail price" [...] with a low APR: the vendor may be accepting a lower lease rate as a trade-off against a higher sale price. Had the customer self-financed, a discounted sales price may have been accepted by the vendor; in other words, the customer has received cheap financing in exchange for paying a higher purchase price, and the quoted APR understates the true cost of the financing. In this case, the only meaningful way to establish the [...] "true" [...] APR would involve arranging financing through other sources, determining the lowest-acceptable cash price and comparing the financing terms (which may not be feasible in all circumstances). For leases where the lessee has a purchase option {{at the end of the}} <b>lease</b> <b>term,</b> the cost of the APR is further complicated by this option. In effect, the lease includes a put option back to the manufacturer (or, alternatively, a call option for the consumer), and the value (or cost) of this option to the consumer is not transparent.|$|E
