50|$|For {{low-energy}} photons, kerma is numerically {{approximately the}} same as absorbed dose. For higher-energy photons, kerma is larger than absorbed dose because some highly energetic secondary electrons and X-rays escape the region of interest before depositing their energy.

Almonds and walnuts were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis PT 30 and Salmonella Tennessee, and conditioned to four different water activities (0. 23, 0. 45, 0. 64, and 0. 84 aw). Thereafter, the inoculated/conditioned samples were irradiated to achieve up to a 5 -log reduction in Salmonella using a pilot scale <b>low-energy</b> <b>X-ray</b> food irradiator. Greater efficacy (D 10 -value: the dose required to eliminate 90 % of the microbial population) for inactivating SE PT 30 and S. Tennessee was seen on the surface of almonds (0. 226 – 0. 431 kGy) than on walnuts (0. 474 – 0. 930 kGy) at all water activities. Also, the efficacy did not change monotonically with water activity. Overall, no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in sensory characteristics was seen between non-irradiated almonds and those irradiated to achieve a 5 log reduction in Salmonella. However, irradiating walnuts to the dose corresponding to a 5 log reduction caused a perceivable change in flavor. Post-irradiation storage tests revealed that surviving bacterial counts did not change over 120 days, regardless of nut type, Salmonella serovar, and aw. Therefore, <b>low-energy</b> <b>X-ray</b> irradiation technology appears to be a promising non-thermal pasteurization strategy for certain types of nuts...|$|R

40|$|Unique {{properties}} of synchrotron radiation (SR), {{such as its}} high intensity, brightness, polarization, and broad spectral distribution (extending from x-ray to infra-red wavelengths) make it an attractive light source for numerous experiments. As SR facilities are rapidly being built all over the world, they introduce the need for <b>low-energy</b> <b>x-ray</b> dosemeters {{because of the potential}} radiation exposure to experimenters. However, they also provide a unique opportunity for <b>low-energy</b> <b>x-ray</b> dosimetry studies because of the availability of monochromatic x-ray beams. Results of such studies performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory are described. Lithium fluoride TLDs (TLD- 100) of varying thicknesses (0. 015 to 0. 08 cm) were exposed free in air to monochromatic x-rays (7 ÊtoÊ 17. 5 keV). These exposures were monitored with ionization chambers. The response (nC/Gy) was found to increase with increasing TLD thickness and with increasing beam energy. A steeper increase in response with increasing energy was observed with the thicker TLDs. The responses at 7 and 17. 5 keV were within a factor of 2. 3 and 5. 2 for the 0. 015 and 0. 08 cm-thick TLDs, respectively. The effects of narrow (beam size smaller than the dosemeter) and broad (beam size larger than the dosemeter) beams on the response of the TLDs are also reported. ...|$|R

50|$|This 'power law' method, while {{commonly}} employed, is {{of questionable}} appropriateness in contemporary scientific applications {{within the context}} of radiation interactions in heterogeneous media. This approach dates back to the late 1930s when photon sources were restricted to low-energy x-ray units (Mayneord 1937). The exponent of 2.94 relates to an empirical formula for the photoelectric process which incorporates a ‘constant’ of 2.64 x 10−26, which is in fact not a constant but rather a function of the photon energy. A linear relationship between Z2.94 has been shown for a limited number of compounds for <b>low-energy</b> <b>x-rays,</b> but within the same publication it is shown that many compounds do not lie on the same trendline (Spiers et al. 1946). As such, for polyenergetic photon sources (in particular, for applications such as radiotherapy), the effective atomic number varies significantly with energy (Taylor et al. 2008). As shown by Taylor et al. (2008), it is possible to obtain a much more accurate single-valued Zeff by weighting against the spectrum of the source. The effective atomic number for electron interactions may be calculated with a similar approach; see for instance Taylor et al. 2009 and Taylor 2011. The cross-section based approach for determining Zeff is obviously much more complicated than the simple power-law approach described above, and this is why freely-available software has been developed for such calculations (Taylor et al. 2012).|$|E
5000|$|Mammography is {{the process}} of using <b>low-energy</b> <b>X-rays</b> (usually around 30 kVp) to examine the human breast, which is used as a {{diagnostic}} and screening tool. The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses and/or microcalcifications. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended (2009) mammography every two years in {{women between the ages of}} 50 and 74. The American College of Radiology and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommends mammography every 2-3 years between 50 and 69. These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation. Additionally, mammograms should not be done with any increased frequency in people undergoing breast surgery, including breast enlargement, mastopexy, and breast reducation. The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) concluded that the trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of mammography screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years. The authors of systematic review write: [...] "If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings." [...] The authors conclude that the time has come to re-assess whether universal mammography screening should be recommended for any age group. They thus state that universal screening may not be reasonable. The Nordic Cochrane Collection, which in 2012 reviews updated research to state that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today. They state screening is “no longer effective.” They conclude that “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet.|$|E
