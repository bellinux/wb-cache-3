5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay's {{first stage}} play, Allah jang Palsoe was written as a realist {{response}} to whimsical contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly {{and the play}} was deemed difficult to perform, Allah jang Palsoe found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered {{a body of work}} by authors such as Lauw Giok Lan, Tio Ie Soei, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the <b>Lontar</b> Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{translations}} {{have been}} made. In 2007 Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was translated to Dutch as De roos uit Tjikembang by Sutedja-Liem; this edition {{was published by}} KITLV Press {{as part of the}} anthology De Njai: Moeder van Alle Volken: 'De Roos uit Tjikembang' en Andere Verhalen (The Njai: Mother of All Peoples: 'De Roos uit Tjikembang' and Other Stories). In 2013 the <b>Lontar</b> Foundation published an English-language translation by Fowler under the title The Rose of Cikembang. This included an introduction to the subject and social conditions, penned by Fowler.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Allah jang Palsoe was {{released}} by the Batavia-based publisher Tjiong Koen Bie in mid-1919. This edition included a foreword from the author, four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline {{of the state of}} the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay paid for this printing, a run of 1,000 copies, out of his own pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the Perfected Spelling System, as part of the first volume of the <b>Lontar</b> Foundation's anthology of Indonesian stage dramas.|$|E
25|$|The term Lontara {{has also}} come to refer to {{literature}} regarding Bugis history and genealogy, including the Sure’ Galigo creation myth. Historically, Lontara was also used {{for a range of}} documents including contracts, trade laws, treaties, maps, and journals. These documents are commonly written in a contemporary-like book form, but they can be written in a traditional palm-leaf manuscript also called Lontara, in which a long, thin strip of dried <b>lontar</b> is rolled to a wooden axis in similar manner to a tape recorder. The text is then read by scrolling the <b>lontar</b> strip from left to right.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Indians {{were the}} ones who taught the native {{inhabitants}} about writing. This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaf called <b>lontar</b> (see image to the left — magnify the image to see the writing on the flat side, and the decoration on the reverse side).|$|E
25|$|In Yingyai Shenglan, Ma Huan {{describe}} the writing system used in Majapahit. For the writing, {{they had known}} the alphabet using So-li (Chola - Coromandel/Southern India) letters. There is no paper or pen, they use Chiao-chang (kajang) or palm leaf (<b>lontar),</b> written by scraping it with a sharp knife. They also have a developed language system and grammar. The way the people talk {{in this country is}} very beautiful and soft.|$|E
25|$|Parvati, locally spelled as Parwati, is a {{principal}} goddess in modern-day Hinduism of Bali. She is more often called Uma, and {{sometimes referred to as}} Giriputri (daughter of the mountains). She is the goddess of mountain Gunung Agung. Like Hinduism of India, Uma has many manifestations in Bali, Indonesia. She is the wife of deity Siwa. Uma or Parwati is considered as the mother goddess that nurtures, nourishes, grants fertility to crop and all life. As Dewi Danu, she presides over waters, lake Batur and Gunung Batur, a major volcano in Bali. Her ferocious form in Bali is Dewi Durga. As Rangda, she is wrathful and presides cemeteries. As Ibu Pertiwi, Parwati of Balinese Hinduism is the goddess of earth. The legends about various manifestations of Parwati, and how she changes from one form to another, are in Balinese literature, such as the palm-leaf (<b>lontar)</b> manuscript Andabhuana.|$|E
25|$|Hari Raya Saraswati is {{dedicated}} {{the goddess of}} learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal {{of life as a}} human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, Brahma, who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, Shatarupa. On this day, offerings are made to the <b>lontar</b> (palm-leaf manuscripts), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks the start of the new year according to the Balinese Pawukon calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.|$|E

The Russian translation was done by A Pavlenko. The English translation, published by the <b>Lontar</b> Foundation, was done by John H. McGlynn. The German translation was done by Renate Lödel.

2500|$|It {{was largely}} {{replaced}} by the Latin alphabet {{during the period of}} Dutch colonization, though it is still used today to a limited extent. The term Lontara is derived from the Malay name for palmyra palm, <b>lontar,</b> whose leaves are traditionally used for manuscripts. In Buginese, this script is called urupu sulapa eppa which means [...] "four-cornered letters", referencing the Bugis-Makasar belief of the four elements that shaped the universe: fire, water, air and earth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} of Balinese architecture — {{such as the}} proper size, location, and alignment of building types — is written in the Asta Kosala Kosali. The Asta Kosala Kosali are eight guidelines for architectural designs originally inscribed in ancient Javanese on a <b>lontar</b> (palm-leaf manuscript). According to the Asta Kosala Kosali, the universe is divided in three: buhr (underworld, realm of the demons), buwah (human realm), and swah (heaven, realm of the gods). This cosmic division {{is reflected in the}} geography of Bali: the central mountainous area (especially Mount Agung) is seen as the abode of the gods, while the sea is associated with malevolent spirits; the in between coastal plains and foothills represent the human realm.|$|E
2500|$|Guests are welcomed {{inside the}} house {{to sit on the}} trojogan (from ojog, 'to head for' or 'to view'). The trojogan is {{basically}} a raised wooden platform situated directly opposite the entrance. A shelf to place the <b>lontar</b> manuscripts is situated in the wall of the trojogan. The head of the household would sit in the lubangan gede ("large cavity"), another raised platform situated to the uphill-side of the central entrance door. His wife would go to the hearth (situated to the downhill-side of the central entrance door) to prepare drink for the guest or to fetch [...] from the downhill larder (lubangan beten). The placement of the guest in the central compartment on the inner side of the house reflect some of the positive values attached to outsiders and exotic goods or influences among the Bali Aga.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lontar</b> {{texts are}} still read today in {{performances}} known as pepaòsan. Readings {{are made for}} a number of occasions, including funerals, weddings and circumcision ceremonies. Rural Sasak read the <b>lontar</b> texts as part of a ritual to ensure the fertility of their farm animals. Peter K. Austin described a pepaòsan which was performed as part of a circumcision ceremony in 2002, with paper copies of <b>lontar</b> texts rather than palm leaves.|$|E

The hat is worn by male Rotenese, more so in past years, {{to protect them from}} the sun while working outside (for example, while tapping the sap of <b>lontar</b> trees). It is made up of <b>lontar</b> leaf webbings and constructed without the aid of glue, sometimes even ornamented with coloured straps that complement the Rotenese tastes of rather simple artistry.|$|E
