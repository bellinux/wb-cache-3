5|$|Lutetium {{aluminium}} garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography. Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> bulbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like {{the lights on the}} John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{total area}} of the complex is 30,958m2, while the {{area of the}} arena is 10,964m2. Its height in the middle is 24m.

The corridor around the arena is divided into two symmetrical parts with 15 entrances on each side, including 30 outside entrances. Each sector has 2 transport access points (1 on each side), 10 arena entrances (5 on each side) and 16 tribune access points (8 on each side). Along the corridor, there are 10 beverage facilities (5 in each sector), 18 catering facilities (9 in each sector), 2 first aid points (1 in each sector), 36 toilets (6 for men, 6 for women and 6 for persons with physical disabilities in each sector). The hall has 12,000 seats but can accommodate 27,000 people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> {{products}} play a {{very important}} role in energy conservation and environmental protection. For the multidisciplinary design problem of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products, we establish the information model of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products based on the object tree, that is, a process and two trees. First we build a multidisciplinary design process of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products, clearing tasks and indicators of product design. Then we discuss the LED product modeling which is based on the design object tree and construct two trees of LED products, providing a necessary theoretical support for the design of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products.

25|$|The model rocket kits were {{a modest}} success and MITS {{wanted to try}} a kit that would appeal to more hobbyists. The November 1970 issue of Popular Electronics {{featured}} the Opticom, a kit from MITS that would send voice over an <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> beam. Mims and Cagle were losing interest in the kit business so Roberts bought his partners out, then began developing a calculator kit. Electronic Arrays had just announced a set of six LSI integrated circuit chips {{that would make a}} four-function calculator. The MITS 816 calculator kit used the chip set and was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. This calculator kit sold for $175 ($275 assembled). Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual for this kit and many others over the next several years. He often accepted a copy of the kit as payment.|$|E

25|$|The Holden Commodore is {{the current}} generic road vehicle of choice for the police. In the past they have used Ford Falcons and the Nissan Maxima. The highway patrol mainly uses the Holden Commodore S variant along with the Holden VF Commodore. The police also use unmarked models of the Holden Cruze and Holden Commodore. Liveries are {{chequered}} Battenburg markings orange-blue (older models - VT, VX and VZ Commodores) or yellow-blue (Newer Models, Captiva, Commodore VE and VF, trucks and vans), as well as cars in standard factory colours, {{commonly referred to as}} unmarked or undercover. Since 2008 the orange-blue livery is being phased out, and all marked patrol vehicles were expected to have the yellow-blue livery as well as <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> bars by 2014. Both Commodore sedan and wagon bodies are used - normally in V6 form. The Holden Commodore (VE, VT, VX and VZ) is currently being phased starting 2013 and slowly being replaced with Holden VF Commodores. The Holden Cruze is currently only used for Youth Aid, both marked and unmarked.|$|E
500|$|The red {{component}} of color television cathode ray tubes is typically emitted from an yttria (...) or yttrium oxide sulfide (...) host lattice doped with europium (III) cation (Eu3+) phosphors. The red color itself is emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects {{energy from the}} electron gun and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Tb3+ {{can be used as}} a doping agent to produce green luminescence.

500|$|Serving {{as part of}} Adam Stephen's brigade, Scott's 5th Virginia Regiment {{fought in}} the colonial victory at the December 26 Battle of Trenton. During the {{subsequent}} Battle of the Assunpink Creek on January 2, 1777, the 5th Virginia helped slow the advance of a combined force of British light infantry and Hessian mercenaries toward Trenton. Major George Johnston, {{a member of the}} 5th Virginia, opined that Scott had [...] "acquired immortal honor" [...] from his performance at Assunpink Creek.

In 2010, Cedar Point added a new flume ride on the park's Frontier Trail named Shoot the Rapids, which included two drops and a three-minute journey through a rustic, western-themed environment. It was removed in February 2016 following a history of low ridership and a serious incident in 2013 injuring seven riders.

2500|$|A {{variety of}} pyrope from Macon County, North Carolina is a violet-red shade {{and has been}} called rhodolite, Greek for [...] "rose". In {{chemical}} composition it may be considered as essentially an isomorphous mixture of pyrope and almandine, {{in the proportion of}} two parts pyrope to one part almandine. Pyrope has tradenames some of which are misnomers; Cape ruby, Arizona ruby, California ruby, Rocky Mountain ruby, and Bohemian garnet from the Czech Republic. Another intriguing find is the blue color-changing garnets from Madagascar, a pyrope-spessartine mix. The color of these blue garnets is not like sapphire blue in subdued daylight but more reminiscent of the grayish blues and greenish blues sometimes seen in spinel. However, in white <b>LED</b> <b>light,</b> the color is equal to the best cornflower blue sapphire, or Dblock tanzanite; {{this is due to the}} blue garnet's ability to absorb the yellow component of the emitted light.|$|E
