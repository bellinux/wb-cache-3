40|$|Abstract：This paper {{presents}} a {{detailed discussion of}} the bending properties of <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> web-core steel sandwich plates {{and the influence of}} weld width on stiffness and strength. The over-hanging three point bending test was conducted on the <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> web-core steel sandwich plates with various welds width by self-designed device, together with the finite element simulations. A good agreement is obtained between the 2 D FE analyses and experiment results. The stiffness and strength of the sandwich plates increased with the increasing of weld width, especially for the weld width lower than 60 % thickness of the core plate.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have found the welding of superduplex stainless steel UNS S 32760 (Zeron 100) by high power CO 2 laser to be an unacceptable process, because the austenite/ferrite (γ/α) ratio in the <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> bead normally deviates significantly from the optimum balance of 50 : 50. To date, the best γ/α ratio in a <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> reported in the published literature was ∼ 30 : 70.

40|$|Abstract. The CW CO 2 laser {{weldability}} {{of various}} Al-Mg alloys {{was investigated in}} terms of weld strength, ductility, Vickers hardness, formability and solidification cracking tendency when both autogenous and wire feed welding were made. Tensile strength of the <b>laser</b> <b>welds</b> was {{lower than that of}} the corresponding base metals, and it was linearly proportional to the Mg content of the weld metal. Formability and ductility of Al-Mg alloy <b>laser</b> <b>welds</b> were lower than those of corresponding base alloys as well. As for the weld solidification structure, as the Mg content increased in the weld metal, more equiaxed grains developed. Hence, softening of weld metal and solidification cracking were decreased in the weld metal containing higher Mg. Solidification cracking of Al-Mg alloy <b>laser</b> <b>welds</b> showed the highest susceptibility at 1. 6 to 1. 9 wt. % Mg, and it decreased with further increase of Mg content...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. All steel <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> {{sandwich}} plates {{have found}} {{their position in the}} marine and land vehicles. To implement such design accurately, knowledge about its strength properties and the influence of <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> dimensions on strength is necessary. In this paper, the over-hanging three point bending tests were conducted on the <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> web-core steel sandwich plate with various weld dimensions by self-designed device, together with the finite element simulations. The results show that the joint is formed on the first plastic hinge when the load is no longer a linear relationship with the deflection, and the joint cracking when the load reaches the maximum bearing capacity of sandwich plate. The joint yield load and the maximum bearing capacity of the sandwich plates increased with the increasing of weld width. Meanwhile, the mode of failure of sandwich plates also changed: When the weld width is smaller, the mode of failure is joint yield, When the weld width is greater than 3 mm, the mode of failure is the combination of partial joint yield, face plate and core plate local yield, while the face plate and core plate yield exists in the whole weld joint. It is necessary to consider the weld width in the design and evaluation of the strength of the <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> web-core sandwich plate...|$|R
