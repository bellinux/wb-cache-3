40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a microwave interferometer technique which measures the thickness of <b>liquid</b> <b>shim</b> material applied to composite surfaces. <b>Liquid</b> <b>shim,</b> which is a low dielectric material, is applied to spar cap surfaces in order to maintain wing skin mold-line tolerances while reducing stresses at the location of fastener holes. For this application, the thickness of the shim material must be controlled within specified limits. Microwave reflection techniques provide an alternative nondestructive approach to <b>liquid</b> <b>shim</b> thickness measurements...|$|R
30|$|The {{adhesive}} {{is a film}} EA 934 NA epoxy {{made from}} Henkel™. However, Hysol EA 934 NA is a bi-component thixotropic paste adhesive, which cures at room temperature and possesses better strength values when the cure process occurs at 300 °F (149 °C). The thixotropic nature and good compressive strength values are very important for potting, filling and fairing, {{as well as for}} <b>shim</b> <b>applications.</b> Hysol EA 934 NA is qualified as MMM-A- 132 Type 1, Class 3 for room temperature cure. It is important to highlight that the damage is an artificial debonding in the joint, which was simulated by inserting Teflon™ tapes within the joint.|$|R

Unlike the stock home screen, Google Now Launcher is not a component of Android itself; it is implemented {{as part of the}} Google Search application. Until 26 February 2014, when it was released on Google Play Store for selected Android 4.4 devices, Google Now Launcher was exclusively shipped by default on the Nexus 5, and was not enabled in Android 4.4 updates for any other Nexus device. While an update to the Google Search application containing Google Now Launcher (which itself was tweaked to improve compatibility with other devices as well) was publicly released shortly after the Nexus 5's release, the launcher itself could not at the time be enabled without installing a second <b>shim</b> <b>application.</b>|$|R
40|$|The F- 35 Joint Strike Fighter, {{produced}} by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, requires precision {{control of the}} designed-in shim gap between the forward fuselage understructure and the mating skin. The current manual shimming method results in excessive time and material waste which {{makes it impossible to}} support a peak production rate of one aircraft a day. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a concept for an efficient, automated <b>liquid</b> <b>shimming</b> system and to verify the feasibility of specific components of the system. A team was assembled to gather requirements for a production-ready shimming system, develop a shim cell concept, and complete a cost benefit analysis to justify the need for an automated system. Gage repeatability/reproducibility and accuracy tests were completed to verify that a non-contact metrology system could meet requirements for structure location and surface profile verification. Tests were performed to identify various material options and release agents for an outer mold line (OML) control tool, and a sub-scale OML control test tool was designed and fabricated. The results of this study provided Lockheed Martin Aeronautics the necessary foundation to verify system feasibility and validate system components in order to begin specification development for the procurement of an automated shim cell for F- 35 forward fuselage outer mold line control. © 2011 Lockheed Martin Corporation...|$|R

40|$|Maintenance, {{repair and}} {{overhaul}} {{companies have been}} reporting corrosion failure events in the Airbus A 320 CFM 56 - 5 b intakes. These intakes {{are attached to the}} power plant frame by a dissimilar material bonded joint, where <b>liquid</b> <b>shim</b> adhesive is used to avoid the dielectric formation between dissimilar materials. In previous works, the authors reported that the A 320 intakes corrosion {{is a result of the}} adhesive inability to avoid the dielectric formation, which is a result of micro-cracks formation within the adhesive layer. The main reason that lead to these cracks is the adhesive aging and thermal cycling at very low temperatures, which quite often reach values lower than - 50 ºC. This paper studies the effect of negative thermal loading on dissimilar materials bonded joints. Two epoxy adhesives are studied and compared, namely the Hysol EA- 934, which is the adhesive currently used in the A 320 Airbus intakes, and the Hysol EA- 9394, a second generation adhesive candidate to replace the actual adhesive. A numerical study was performed in order to simulate the adhesive joint using a finite element analysis commercial package, where several hypotheses were explored. These hypotheses where focused on the effects of several factors on the adhesive layer stress distribution. Factors such as temperature range, boundary conditions, variation of the coefficient of thermal expansion with temperature, and interfacial cracks between the adhesive layer and dissimilar adherend materials were analyzed. Results show that very low temperatures have a negative impact on the adhesives strength and micro-cracks formation may result from thermal loads below zero degrees Celsius, even for adhesives without any aging. Moreover, low temperatures in dissimilar materials bonded joints may create stress states that surpass the adhesive lap shear strength. Some conclusions are drawn regarding adhesive selection for dissimilar materials bonded joints in order to overcome these issues.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{several aspects}} of gradient and shim coil design and fabrication. New design techniques are coupled with experimental construction methods to expand small animal insert gradient and shim technology. The design techniques are also applied {{to other areas of}} magnetic resonance hardware. A custom 2 -axis gradient insert coil is designed and fabricated for the purpose of eddy current characterization. The construction tolerances were examined via bench top inductance measurements and eddy currents measurement inside a 7. 0 T head-only MR system. A great deal of freedom is available when positioning shielding coils with respect to their corresponding primary coils in small animal inserts before eddy currents become prohibitive for imaging. A new method for actively shielding electromagnets is presented. The minimum energy method for designing shielding coils of any geometry is developed and validated against historical methods. Several shielded gradient insert coils are designed, including a cylindrical gradient set with rectangular shields, which demonstrates the versatility of this new method. The performance of the shielded insert coils is reported. A high power custom shim insert coil is designed and optimized for dynamic <b>shimming</b> <b>applications.</b> This 10 -axis shim insert coil is designed to operate at currents higher than any previously existing shim sets. Several experimental fabrication methods are tested during the construction of the insert coil. Inductance, resistance and cooling measurements are conducted and compared to design specifications. Field measurements are taken using a 3 -axis field transducer and the shim efficiencies are calculated. Finally mutual inductance measurements are taken between strongly coupled axes to verify active shielding performance. Lastly, the minimum energy method for active shielding is applied to several MR fringe field type problems. Shields are designed to conform to rooms within an imaging facility for the purpose of controlling the magnetic footprint of an MR system. The MR room itself it designed to house an active shield, along with rooms adjacent to the MR room and a small equipment cabinet located inside the MR room is also fitted with a shield. The performance of the shields is calculated, and the feasibility of such shields is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method of 3 D {{automated}} <b>shimming</b> in high-resolution <b>applications.</b> This does not heavily rely on Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) modules {{and can be used}} with any spectrometer equipped with shims and homospoil facilities at least. The method exploits Fourier imaging technique for mapping of static magnetic field inhomogeneity and field shapes generated by shim coils, which are used as input for calculations of shim corrections by least squares fitting. The results of testing with protonated and deuterated solvents with 13 shims set on a Unity INOVA 300 spectrometer are also presented. Key words: shim gradients; field mapping; shim mapping; orthogonality of transverse shims; automated shimming. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To improve B 0 <b>shimming</b> for <b>applications</b> in high- and ultrahigh-field {{magnetic}} resonance imaging and {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. Methods: An existing image-based constrained B 0 shimming algorithm was enhanced using two techniques: (1) A region of less interest was introduced to control B 0 field inhomogeneities {{in the vicinity of}} the region of interest; (2) multiple sets of starting values were used for the fitting routine, to avoid “getting trapped” in a local minimum of the optimization function. The influence of constraints during the fitting procedure, due to hardware limitations, on the B 0 shim result was investigated. The performance of this algorithm was compared to other B 0 shim algorithms for typical shim problems in head and body applications at 3 T and 7 T. Results: Utilization of a weighted region of less interest lead to a significant gain in B 0 homogeneity adjacent to the region of interest. The loss of B 0 quality due to the enlarged total shim volume within the region of interest remained minimal, allowing for improved artifact reduction in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Multiple sets of starting values and consideration of shim field constraints led to an additional gain in B 0 shim quality. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm allows for more flexible control of B 0 inhomogeneities and, hence, enables gains in image and spectral quality for MR applications...|$|R
30|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{introduced}} to enhance the ability of dispersing of nanotubes in solvents, for example, polymer and DNA wrapping, sidewall functionalization, modification through π–π stacking with aromatic molecules and addition of surfactant [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. These methods usually cannot disperse a very large amount of CNTs, thus, a much simpler and more convenient method is needed {{to be capable of}} dispersing the CNTs at higher concentrations for large scale applications. Many efforts have been made to search the convenient solvents for CNT low solubility. One of the best groups of solvent for dispersing of CNTs is the group of room temperature ILs which can disperse the CNTs well without disarranging the structures by the formation of bulky gels. Very recently Aida et al. [19] demonstrated that discotic ionic liquid crystals of triphenylene derivatives [20, 21] bearing six imidazolium ion pendants [22] are the best liquid crystalline dispersants for pristine CNTs. They showed that the orientation of CNTs is a dominant factor for charge-carrier transport properties of the ionic <b>liquid</b> crystalline/CNT composite. <b>Shim</b> et al. [23] investigated the solvated single- and double-walled CNTs in the ILs. They indicated that cations and anions show smeared-out, cylindrical shell-like distributions outside of the nanotubes regardless of the nanotube diameter. Some attempts have been done for determining the dispersion mechanism of CNTs in ILs. The simulation evidence and experimental results have indicated that the ILs interact with CNTs by weak interaction of van der Waals other than the previous supposed cation −π interaction [24].|$|R
