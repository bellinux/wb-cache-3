40|$|The couple {{relationship}} {{is a major}} factor in alleviating loneliness. Midlife and older adults without a couple relationship, especially after widowhood or divorce, are at serious risk <b>of</b> <b>loneliness.</b> Outcomes <b>of</b> empirical research, both dating back to the former century (Lopata, 1980, 1996), as well as based on recent research (Aartsen & Jylhä, 2011; Ben-Zur, 2012; Guiaux, Van Tilburg, & Broese van Groenou, 2007), have shown that widowed and divorced older adults are frequently characterized by high levels <b>of</b> <b>loneliness.</b> Yet, some older adults within a couple relationship also report loneliness. About one in six older married men and women experiences moderate or strong levels <b>of</b> emotional <b>loneliness</b> (De Jong Gierveld, Broese van Groenou, Hoogendoorn, & Smit, 2009).

25|$|Films about {{athletics}} are overwhelmingly {{focused on}} running events: the 1962 film The <b>Loneliness</b> <b>of</b> the Long Distance Runner (based {{on the book}} of the same name) explores cross country running as a means of escape.

Biopics are found within the genre, including Prefontaine (regarding Steve Prefontaine) and Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951) featuring Burt Lancaster as Thorpe.

40|$|Background: Dispositional optimism, {{defined as}} a {{generalized}} tendency to positive outcome expectancies, is associated with well-being and successful aging. However, it remains unclear whether optimism is also correlated to less feelings <b>of</b> <b>loneliness</b> over time. We aimed to determine whether dispositional optimism is prospectively associated with less feelings <b>of</b> <b>loneliness,</b> independently <b>of</b> potential confounders inherent to the aging process. Methods: We observed 416 older men aged between 70 and 89 ¿years (mean 74. 9 ¿years, standard deviation [SD] 4. 7 years) within the population-based Zutphen Elderly Study during 10 ¿years of follow-up. Baseline dispositional optimism was assessed using a four-item questionnaire. The presence <b>of</b> feelings <b>of</b> <b>loneliness,</b> the main outcome of our study, was assessed using the 11 -item <b>loneliness</b> scale <b>of</b> De Jong Gierveld in the years 1990, 1993, 1995, and 2000. The association between baseline dispositional optimism and loneliness over time was tested by using multilevel regression analysis and by adjusting for potential confounders (i. e. age, living arrangement, social contacts, widowhood, memberships, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms). Results: Feelings <b>of</b> <b>loneliness</b> significantly increased during 10 ¿years of follow-up but showed temporal stability (reliability coefficient 0. 78).
