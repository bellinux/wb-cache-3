500|$|Myers {{obtained}} the coaching job at his alma mater, Centre College, and brought all the above-named players with him. McMillin and Weaver {{did not have}} sufficient high-school credits to enter college and enrolled at Somerset High School for the 1916-17 year, playing with Red Roberts. [...] "I've got a boy under my wing down here in Texas who's a football-playing fool and I {{want him to go}} to Centre.

2500|$|Aguirre {{describes}} the SEC as an agency created {{to protect the}} public from Wall Street, but now protects Wall Street from the public, and calls it a revolving door, where people move from SEC positions to highly lucrative positions on Wall Street and also in reverse. [...] "All the agencies have to some extent or another a revolving door [...] But at the SEC, what you rotate into is an enormous salary leap. SEC managers may make $200,000. That same person may make $2 million as a starting salary on the outside and can move up from there. Now, when he leaves, I'm not sure he's worth $2 million as a lawyer, but he takes his Rolodex with him and that Rolodex is gold. The system maintains itself, because those that stay know their turn will come if they play the game. They see a director or associate director move onto a $2 million job with a Wall Street law firm. Then, the departed employee calls back to his former colleagues and says, 'you know I really don't think there is much of a case against so-and-so, I'd <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> take a look at it.' And the case goes away; the system goes on in perpetuity." [...] Two of Aguirre's supervisors left the SEC for lucrative positions at private law firms. Paul Berger works at Debevoise and Plimpton. After failing to investigate the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, Linda Chatman Thomsen left her position as SEC Enforcement Director to become a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, where according to the Wall Street Journal, she would be part of its [...] "white-collar defense group". Robert Khuzami, who succeeded her, worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan's Southern District of New York, then went to Deutsche Bank for several years before returning being named SEC Enforcement Director.|$|E

5000|$|Transformance cannot effect psychotherapeutic change {{without the}} {{requisite}} and crucial act of meta-therapeutic processing, or metaprocessing for short. Metaprocessing {{is the cornerstone}} of AEDP methodology. The intent of metaprocessing is to maximize the power of transformance moments by exploring the experience of having the experience as it is happening (for example, the therapist may ask, [...] "what is it <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have had this deep emotional experience right now?"), especially in the context of experiences that are therapeutic or positive. [...] Slowing down the emotional experience (somatic, emotional, cognitive) through [...] "moment-to-moment tracking", not only primes its neuroplastic potential, but allows the therapist to help the patient maintain a well-regulated, as opposed to overwhelming, emotional experience (dyadic affect regulation). A second form of relational metaprocessing asks the patient what it was like “to do this with me?” (“dyadic affective reflective process”) which further [...] "undoes the patient’s aloneness", while also strengthening the attachment bond for further emotional work. Empirical studies confirm clinical observations that positive emotions naturally arise following metaprocessing. Positive emotions fortify the patient's healing experience and promote enhanced resilience.|$|E

I have been informed that this company has been sworn into {{the service of the}} Confederate States. If so, the only thing to be done is to communicate this fact to General Fagan. If the State troops which can be raised in La Fayette County are already raised you are authorized to disband the militia. If convenient, I would <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to Union County. Captain Holloway has been raising a company of mounted riflemen in that county. If his company is organized, you can disband the militia of that county. If the colonel is inefficient, and Captain Holloway has not got his company formed, let him swear his men in and get the militia together, and compel those who are liable to the conscript law to go into the State or C. S. service". [...] These new units of Arkansas State Troops were placed under the overall command of Col. William H. Trader who was detailed to Governor Flanagin by General E. Kirby Smith. Col. Trader remained in command of the state troops until he resigned in June 1864.|$|E
