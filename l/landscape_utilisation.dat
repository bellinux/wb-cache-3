40|$|Abstract The {{investigation}} into ecotones enabled {{a better understanding}} of the causal relationships between certain landscape elements, <b>landscape</b> <b>utilisation</b> categories and ecotones. By studying ecotones, we wanted to expand understanding of patterns having an influence on the landscape condition, structure, functions, landscape elements and their relationships. The fuzzy approach was applied for better understanding and modelling of ecotones. This methodology was afterwards built in expert system. The landscape assessment process based upon an expert system allows for a multidisciplinary view of a landscape. The landscape is evaluated from several perspectives: the ecological stability, soil erosion, retention capacity and economic landscape calculations by designed expert system. These results from expert system were taken into consideration during mapping ecotones. Ecotones may serve as one of the distinctive indicators of the impact humans have on the landscape. It is therefore necessary to develop more sophisticated methods of their studying. ...|$|E
40|$|The archaeological {{interpretation}} of past land management practices can be greatly enhanced through examination of soil thin sections. Features relating to manuring practice {{are among those}} key to interpreting agricultural practices. The sources and the pro¬cesses leading to the distribution of these manure materials may further improve knowledge of the past <b>landscape</b> <b>utilisation.</b> The use of quantitative analyses to examine soil thin sections opens the possibility of considering these relationships between manured areas in greater detail and to extract more subtle spatial and temporal changes in past management. In this study the validation of this methodology has been tested with quantitative image analysis methods used to examine manure inputs to a well-documented historical landscape of Papa Stour, Shetland, where intensive manuring has been practised until the 1960 s. By using both historic and ethnographic evidence to validate the image analysis protocol, diﬀerences in spatial and temporal distribution are examined for the practices of manuring with both fuel residues and with turf. The validation of the hypotheses expected from ethnographic and historical data that quantitative soils-based evidence allows the deﬁnition of variations in manuring strategies and provides a more secure basis from which to interpret manuring management strategies in archaeological landscapes...|$|E
40|$|After {{the brief}} {{presentation}} of the major karstic areas in Morocco, the article focused essentially on the Atlas mountains to investigate {{the impact of the}} agriculture on the natural systems equilibrium. Socio-economic changes (demographic pressure, escalation of the <b>landscape</b> use, <b>utilisation</b> of new techniques in water harvesting, etc [...] .) have sometimes fathered mechanisms of degradation. Many indicators seem to reflect these mechanisms. The pedologic indicators, soil erosion, the hydrologic and geomorphic indicators, are apprehended to demonstrate existent correlation between different variables and the often negative impacts of land over-use in the karstic domain of the Middle Atlas...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{landscape}} attracts {{more and}} more often new forms of tourism, alternatives to the traditional ones. The visit to a region, expressing its naturalness and its local culture, does indeed enrich the tourist with new experiences that complete the itineraries within historical towns.  The delicate relationship between <b>landscape</b> and <b>utilisation</b> of open land has been therefore the leading thread of the research that promotes a multifunctional rural economy (touristic/agricultural/zootechnical), together with an appreciation of the value and identity of these places.  The resulting action field has been articulated in two level: the first refers to places of historical and naturalistic interest and to those with touristic potentialities; while the second focuses on ordinary places that are the settings to sites of “excellence” and to excursion routes. The increase in value of the countryside has been centred on two different landscapes: those of high touristic interest and the ordinary ones...|$|R
40|$|In 1972, VA {{published}} {{an account of}} Oliver Rackham's survey of a late medieval timber-framed house at Stanton, West Suffolk, in which he deduced from the surviving structure the amount of timber the original had required, its cost, and how many trees of varying ages and sizes {{had been used to}} build it. Following the example of Rackham's work, a similar survey of a typical sixteenth-century timber-framed house in the Sussex Weald was carried out, which has not only revealed striking differences between the two regions in the type of trees used {{and the way in which}} they were worked, but also valuable information about the early-modern Wealden <b>landscape</b> and contemporary <b>utilisation</b> of its resources...|$|R
40|$|Species of Old World fruit-bats (family Pteropodidae) {{have been}} {{identified}} as the natural hosts of a number of novel and highly pathogenic viruses threatening livestock and human health. We used GPS data loggers to record the nocturnal foraging movements of Acerodon jubatus, the Golden-crowned flying fox in the Philippines to better understand the <b>landscape</b> <b>utilisation</b> of this iconic species, with the dual objectives of pre-empting disease emergence and supporting conservation management. Data loggers were deployed on eight of 54 A. jubatus (two males and six females) captured near Subic Bay on the Philippine island of Luzon between 22 November and 2 December 2010. Bodyweight ranged from 730 g to 1002 g, translating to a weight burden of 3 - 4 % of bodyweight. Six of the eight loggers yielded useful data over 2 - 10 days, showing variability in the nature and range of individual bat movements. The majority of foraging locations were in closed forest and most were remote from evident human activity. Forty-six discrete foraging locations and five previously unrecorded roost locations were identified. Our findings indicate that foraging is not a random event, with the majority of bats exhibiting repetitious foraging movements night-to-night, that apparently intact forest provides the primary foraging resource, and that known roost locations substantially underestimate the true number (and location) of roosts. Our initial findings support policy and decision-making across perspectives including landscape management, species conservation, and potentially disease emergence...|$|E
40|$|Agent-based {{models can}} predict {{system-level}} properties of populations from stochastic simulation of fine-scale movements. One important application to conservation lies {{in their ability}} to consider the impact of individual variation in movement and decision-making on populations under future landscape changes. Here, we present a spatially explicit agent-based simulation of a population of jaguars (Panthera onca) in a mixed forest and farmland landscape in Central America that demonstrates an application of least-cost modelling, a description of the way that agents move through their environment, to equilibrium population dynamics. We detail the construction and application of the model, and the processes of calibration, sensitivity analysis and validation with empirical field data. Simulated jaguars underwent feeding, reproduction, and mortality events typical of natural populations, resulting in realistic population dynamics and home range sizes. Jaguar agents located inside protected forest reserves exhibited higher fitness (fecundity, energy reserves, age and age of mortality) as well as lower energy- and habitat-related mortality than jaguar agents located outside these reserves. Changes in fecundity directly affected the dynamics of simulated populations to a larger degree than either mortality or agent–agent interactions. Model validation showed similar patterns to camera traps in the field, in terms of <b>landscape</b> <b>utilisation</b> and the spatial distribution of individuals. The model showed less sensitivity to socially motivated and fine-scale movements, apart from those directed towards feeding and reproduction, but reflected the interactions and movement of naturally occurring populations in this region. Applications of the model will include testing impacts on population dynamics of likely future changes in landscape structure and connectivity...|$|E
40|$|Accounting {{for much}} of the {{landscape}} of southern England, chalk stream environments hold significant cultural, economic and ecological value. However, attempts to retain this value are often hindered by the remnants of historic management practices that have occurred across several millennia, as well as contemporary demands upon chalk stream amenity, including water abstraction, recreational use and fisheries management. One land-use that is believed to have a detrimental effect upon chalk streams, but which has been inadequately researched, is cattle grazing. Within this thesis the effects of cattle grazing in English chalk streams are assessed using a range of techniques. Terrestrial laser-scanning is employed to show that cattle can cause small, local changes in river bank topography. Direct and remote observations are used to link cattle behaviour to <b>landscape</b> <b>utilisation,</b> and a staticially significant correlation between air temperature and in-stream cattle activity is identified. Laboratory faecal analysis is conducted to establish the nutrient loading due to cattle, with results showing that cattle faeces contain signfiicant concentrations of phosphate. In-stream water turbidity monitoring is combined with remotely sensed cattle behaviour data to demonstrate that in-stream cattle activity has a minimal effect upon suspended sediment concentrations in an English chalk stream. A study using the diffuse fine sediment risk model, SCIMAP, highlights the hydrologically disconnected nature of English chalk streams, with model outputs concluding that topography, rather than land-use (cattle grazing), is the key control on diffuse fine sediment risk in English chalk streams. Combined, these individual findings provide a detailed, inter-disciplinary assessment that concludes the effects of cattle grazing in English chalk streams are different to those recorded in research from other environments, with physio-chemical effects (i. e. nutrient loading) being of greater significance than geomorphological agency (i. e. river bank destabilisation). This overarching conclusion has implications for the management of cattle grazing in English chalk streams, and these are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the research project Swedish and Finnish in the cultivated areas of Upper Norrland. The cultural landscape as a mirror of social organisation. The project has been {{supported by a grant from}} the Swedish Council for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences during the years 1997 - 1999. The results of the investigation are presented in two parts. Part I is based on analyses of cadastral maps from the late 17 th and early 18 th centuries of villages known at least as early as the mid 16 th century. In these maps, a recurring feature, gårdsgärdor, i. e. consolidated plots of land containing farm buildings and scattered arable areas, can be found in the whole of the vast investigated area, from the Ume to the Torne river valleys as well as on the Finnish side of the Bothnian Gulf. A region could thus be defined in which the original basis for the economy has been fishing and hunting. In this region, a southern or Swedish influence in the shape of an open field arable could be found on the western side of the Gulf up to and including the Kalix river valley whereas this feature was completely absent on the eastern side and in the Torne river valley. Part II deals with the rapid shore regression in the area and its effects on the <b>landscape</b> and resource <b>utilisation.</b> In many places cultivation of any importance probably became possible only during the late Middle Ages (14 th- 15 th centuries). Hunting, especially for seal, and fishing, both activities involving groups of people, were for a long time more important than cereal cultivation. Examples are given of areas of meadowland situated on recently emerged land that were owned by several villages in common. As has been shown in the case of Ostrobothnia, Finland, this ownership could have its roots in a previous joint use of the area as fishing waters, and the predecessors of the landowning villages may have been earlier teams for fishing. This presumed original resource utilisation by groups of people, coming from the south as well as from the east, may explain why many of the villages in the area so rapidly grew large compared to habitations in most other parts of Sweden. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyse the {{preconditions}} for increasedsalmon angling in the remaining wild salmon rivers in Upper Norrland in northernSweden, {{as well as to}} evaluate the present and possible future impacts on the localeconomy. It includes the identification of the internal and external conditions, in what ishere called the Salmon <b>Utilisation</b> <b>Landscape,</b> that influence the present use as well asfuture development of the Baltic salmon as a resource in angling. The empirical materialsderive from two mail surveys, 1) a survey of anglers in the River Byske and 2) a jointNordic survey on the economic value of recreational fishing. Interest in recreational fishing is widespread in Sweden. About 35 % of adultSwedes fish for recreation. Recreational fishery and angling can be seen as one expressionof the urbanised society's need for contact with nature and outdoor recreation. Salmonangling is one part of recreational fishery. Salmon are {{considered by many to be}} the 'biggame' of angling. Salmon anglers are often the most devoted kind of anglers, investingconsiderable resources into this leisure activity. The subgroup of Swedish salmon anglingspecialists is estimated at 10 - 30, 000 persons. The wider category of Active River anglersconsists of approximately 170, 000 persons. Salmon fishing in the River Byske has turned out to be representative of salmonangling in Upper Norrland, comparable with other high-class Scandinavian salmon rivers. The growing proportion of remote anglers in the 1990 s indicates that the Byske hasbecome a rather specialised angling water. The groups of Fishing tourists and Home fishersmake up two distinctive categories. Fishing tourists fish more intensively, have higher dailyexpenditures and show higher consumer surplus. They fish the river almost entirely forsalmon in. On the other hand, Home fishers to a large extent claim the right to fish fordecent prices and without any particular restrictions. During the 1990 s, the average annualincome to the local economy of Byske river valley derived from salmon angling fishingtourism was about 850, 000 SEK. Many river habitats have been depleted during the 20 th century and many salmonstocks were exterminated by severe degeneration factors linked to industrialisation. To thisis added the over-fishing on wild stocks of salmon and the mortality syndrome, M 74. Theavailable estimates of the potential production of wild salmon smolt in Upper Norrlandaggregates close to 1. 2 million. This can be converted to an angling activity of some 250, 000 fishing days. On the basis of the prevailing cost level, the potential angling activity in UpperNorrland would amount to a direct annual turnover of 75 million SEK, however theimpact caused by fishing tourism is likely to remain within the interval of 10 - 30 millionSEK. The Active River anglers' average willingness to pay for annual access to a salmon andsea trout scenario was 1, 100 SEK per capita. There is a widespread attitude among manyanglers that fishing should be accessible for all and prices should be kept low. In theNordic context such opinions are especially evident among Swedish anglers in general, butless frequent among devoted salmon anglers. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|Purpose It {{is clear}} that {{libraries}} consider the use of data to inform decision making a top priority {{in the next five}} years. Jisc’s considerable work on activity data has highlighted the lack of tools and services for libraries to exploit this data. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the potential of a shared analytics service for UK academic libraries and introduce the Jisc Library Analytics and Metrics Project (LAMP). The project aims to help libraries effectively management collections and services as well as delivering pre-emptive indicators and ‘actionable insights’ to help identify new trends, personalise services and improve efficiencies, economies and effectiveness (student attainment and satisfaction and institutional reputation, for example). The project builds on the Library Impact Data Project at the University of Huddersfield and the work of the Copac Activity Data and Collections Management tools. The paper will deliver a case study of the project, its progress to date, the challenges of such an approach and the implications the service has for academic libraries. Design, methodology or approach The paper will be a case study of the project and its institutional partners and early adopters work to date and explore both the technical and cultural challenges of the work as well as its implications for the role of the library within the institution and the services it provides. Specifically the case study will comprise of the following aspects: 1. A brief history of the work and the context of library analytics services in the UK (and internationally). A description of the approach adopted by the project, and the vision and goals of the project 2. Exploration of the challenges associated with the project. In particular the challenges around accessing and sharing the data, ‘warehousing’ and data infrastructure considerations and the design challenge of visualising the data sources in a useful and coherent way 3. Outline of the implications of the project and the resultant service. In particular the implications for benchmarking (within the UK and beyond), standards development for library statistics and impact (in particular the development of ISO 16439), service development, the role of the library within the wider institution and skills and expertise of librarians. Findings This paper will report on the initial findings of the project, which will run from January 2013 to October 2013. In particular it will consider the issues surfaced through the close engagement with the academic library community (through the projects community advisory and planning group) and the institutional early-adopters around data gathering and analysis. Practical implications Data accumulated in one context has the potential to inform decisions and interventions elsewhere. While there are a number of recognised and well understood use-cases for library analytics these tend to revolve around usage and collection management. Yet, the potential of a shared analytics service is in uncovering those links and indicators across diverse data sets. The paper will consider a number of practical impacts: Performance: benchmarking, student attainment, research productivity Design: fine tuning services, personalised support Trends: research <b>landscape,</b> student marketplace, <b>utilisation</b> of resources. The case study will explore these practical implications for libraries and what they mean for the future of the library within the academy. Originality and value of the proposal The paper will present a case study of a unique service that currently fills an important gap within the library analytics space. The paper will focus on the services potential to transform both the way the library works and how it is erceived by its users, as well as its role and relationship within the broader institution...|$|R
40|$|Least-cost and {{agent-based}} models present {{alternative approaches}} to modelling animal movements, at the population level and individual level respectively. This study introduces and tests a novel integration of adapted least-cost methods into agent-based simulations, {{in order to}} analyse connectivity and habitat preferences in two species of mammal. An initial proof-of-concept study built a set of empirically validated least-cost models of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) into a simple agent based model. Agents most closely simulated natural behaviours of dispersing hedgehogs when their movements accounted for temporally-dependent habitat preferences in addition to least-cost pathways informed by the connectivity map. The fitness of these agents increased in more highly fragmented landscapes, in contrast to agents that took least-cost pathways without time-specific preferences. The integration of functional connectivity with individual behaviour combined the advantages of both modelling techniques. Quantitative analysis of the individual-level consequences of moving within different landscape scenarios provides a unique way of applying model outcomes to direct conservation action. A second conceptual study applied integrative methods {{to the construction of}} an agent-based simulation scaled for jaguars (Panthera onca) occupying fragmented landscape in Belize. This simulation tested alternative configurations of a wildlife corridor currently under development in Central Belize as part of the intercontinental Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Six alternative corridor configurations and three control conditions differed substantially in their effectiveness at mixing agents across the environment, despite relatively little difference in individual welfare. Best estimates of jaguar movement behaviours suggested that a set of five narrow corridors may out perform one wide corridor of the same overall area. The first two studies set the framework for developing a detailed simulation of jaguar behaviour and population dynamics in a mixed forest and farmland landscape in the south of Belize. This more complex model drew on empirical data on resident jaguars in the region to simulate typical movement, feeding, reproduction and mortality events within a stable natural population. An overview of the construction and application of the model precedes detailed descriptions of its calibration, sensitivity analysis and validation with empirical data. Agents located inside protected forest reserves exhibited higher fitness, expressed in higher fecundity and lower energy- and habitat-related mortality, than agents located outside these reserves. Model validation showed similar patterns to field data in <b>landscape</b> <b>utilisation</b> and the spatial distribution of individuals. This approach to spatial modelling of population dynamics can provide novel insights into effective conservation strategies for large carnivores. Application of the model to the fragmented central corridor region of Belize sets the context for real-world conservation planning. Under current conditions, simulated jaguars formed a small but stable population with various levels of immigration. Implementation of wildlife corridors showed the largest tracts of physically connected reserves increased connectivity between spatially disconnected habitat patches but also increased vulnerability to environmental degradation...|$|E
