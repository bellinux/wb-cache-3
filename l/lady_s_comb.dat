40|$|The Afrotropical Mantispidae genera have {{previously}} been neglected and are poorly known. The genera are revised and redescribed. A new genus Afromantispa Snyman and Ohl is described with Afromantispa tenella comb. n. as type species. Perlamantispa (Handschin, 1960) is synonymised with Sagittalata Handschin, 1959. The new combinations within the genus include <b>S.</b> austroafrica <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> bequaerti <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> dorsalis <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> girardi <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> nubila <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> perla <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> pusilla <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> similata <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> royi <b>comb.</b> n., <b>S.</b> tincta <b>comb.</b> n. and <b>S.</b> vassei <b>comb.</b> n. An illustrated {{key to the}} genera Afromantispa gen. n., Sagittalata Handschin, 1959, Mantispa Illiger, 1798, Cercomantispa Handschin, 1959, Rectinerva Handschin, 1959, Nampista Navás, 1914, and Pseudoclimaciella Handschin, 1960 is provided. The wing venation of Mantispidae is redescribed. Similarities between the genera are discussed. Subsequent studies will focus on revising the taxonomic status of species, which are not dealt with in this study...|$|R

The obese wrestler taps out to <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> who kicks Masked Man M in the chest - a move he appears to greatly enjoy. This prompts him to accidentally swap out with his partner Chicken, who tries and fails to attack <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> She proceeds to beat him while an envious Masked Man M watches, begging for Chicken to swap out with him. Chicken succeeds, {{but at this point}} <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> also swaps out with the obese wrestler, to his dismay. Masked Man M manages to beat the obese wrestler, which angers The Boss. He storms down to the dressing room to confront Masked Man M and Chicken, as <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> was supposed to win the match. The Boss just barely misses the two as they flee the arena, Masked Man M carrying a box of <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> dolls he stole.|$|R

Romeo agrees, and, the next night, he eagerly goes out into the ring as Masked Man M. The two proceed to fight one another, much to Masked Man M's joy. The fight progresses until <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> traps Masked Man M in a headlock, suffocating him while telling him [...] "This is what you want, right?" [...] She brings him to a near death experience while telling him that he should just remain in his fantasy world. However, the children from his orphanage are attending that night and beg Masked Man M not to give up, which spurs him to touch one of the wrestling ring ropes with his foot. This forces <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> to release him from the headlock, but she then proceeds to continually beat him. <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> overestimates the power {{in one of her}} jumps and ends up getting knocked out by the impact when Masked Man M moves out of the way at the last minute. He holds her down and almost wins, but, at the last minute, is signaled to throw the match, which he does. After the match Masked Man M's popularity takes off and Romeo returns to the orphanage where he realizes that Sister Juliet is <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> as she has used the money to fix the place up.|$|R
40|$|The family Celyphidae (Diptera, Lauxanioidea) is {{verified}} {{as part of}} the New World fauna, with {{a second}} specimen discovered of a species described from French Guiana in 1844 by P. J. M. Macquart. As this species possesses characteristics that clearly suggest a separate lineage from the Old World celyphids, a new genus is proposed, Atopocelyphus gen. n., with the type species, Celyphus ruficollis Macquart, in the new combination Atopocelyphus ruficollis (Macquart), comb. n. A key to world genera of Celyphidae is presented, along with discussion of generic concepts. Chamaecelyphus Frey is synonymized under Spaniocelyphus Hendel, syn. n., resulting in the following 10 new combinations: Spaniocelyphus africanus (Walker), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> dichrous (Bezzi), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> gutta (Speiser), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> halticinus (Frey), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> kalongensis (Vanschuytbroek), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> ruwenzoriensis (Vanschuytbroek), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> straeleni (Vanschuytbroek), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> upembaensis (Vanschuytbroek), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> violaceus (Vanschuytbroek), <b>comb.</b> n.; <b>S.</b> vrydaghi (Vanschuytbroek), <b>comb.</b> n. The subgenera of Celyphus Dalman are elevated to genus rank, as Paracelyphus Bigot, stat. rev., and Hemiglobus Frey, stat. rev., resulting in the following 17 new and revised combinations: Hemiglobus cheni (Shi), comb. n.; H. eos (Frey), comb. n.; H. lacunosus Frey, comb. rev.; H. pellucidus Frey, comb. rev.; H. planitarsalis (Shi), comb. n.; H. porosus (Tenorio), comb. n.; H. pulchmaculatus (Liu &amp; Yang), comb. n.; H. quadrimaculatus (Tenorio), comb. n.; H. resplendens Frey, comb. rev.; H. rugosus (Tenorio), comb. n.; H. testaceus (Malloch), comb. n.; H. trichoporis (Shi), comb. n.; H. unicolor Frey, comb. rev.; H. violaceus Chen, comb. rev.; Paracelyphus hyacinthus Bigot, comb. rev.; P. medogis (Shi), comb. n.; P. vittalis (Shi), comb. n...|$|R

40|$|Alpha taxonomy, and {{specifically}} the delimitation of species, {{is becoming increasingly}} objective and integrative. The use of coalescent-based methods applied to genetic data is providing new tools for the discovery and delimitation of species. Here, we use an integrative approach via a combination of discovery-based multivariate morphological analyses to detect potential new species. These potential species are then used as a priori species in hypothesis-driven validation analyses with genetic data. This research focuses on the harvestmen genus Sclerobunus found throughout the mountainous regions of western North America. Based on our analyses, we conduct a revision of Sclerobunus resulting in synonymy of Cyptobunus with Sclerobunus including transfer of <b>S.</b> cavicolens <b>comb.</b> nov. and elevation of both subspecies of S. ungulatus: <b>S.</b> ungulatus <b>comb.</b> nov. and <b>S.</b> madhousensis <b>comb.</b> nov., stat. nov.
