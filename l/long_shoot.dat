500|$|Parts of {{the third}} film were shot during {{location}} filming of , a <b>long</b> <b>shoot</b> which finished on March 1, 2006. During August 2005, the Singapore sequence was shot. The set was built on Stage 12 of the Universal Studios backlot, and comprised 40 structures within an 80 by 130-foot (24 by 40-m) tank that was [...] deep. As 18th century Singapore is not a well-documented era, the filmmakers chose to use an Expressionist style based on Chinese and Malaysian cities of the same period. The design {{of the city was}} also intended by Verbinski to parody spa culture, with fungi growing throughout the set. Continuing this natural feel, the floorboards of Sao Feng's bathhouse had to be cut by hand, and real humidity was created by the combination of gallons of water and the lighting equipment on the set.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s Binoche [...] {{was cast}} {{in a series of}} {{critically}} and commercially successful international films, winning her praise and awards. In this period her persona developed from that of a young gamine to a more melancholic, tragic presence. Critics suggested that many of her roles were notable for her almost passive intensity in the face of tragedy and despair. In fact Binoche has nicknamed her characters from this period as her [...] "sorrowful sisters". Following the <b>long</b> <b>shoot</b> of Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, Binoche relocated to London for the 1992 productions of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights and Damage, both of which considerably enhanced her international reputation. Yet, from a professional and personal point of view, both films were significant challenges for Binoche; her casting opposite Ralph Fiennes's Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, instead of English actresses Helena Bonham Carter and Kate Beckinsale, was immediately contentious and drew derision from the British press, unimpressed that a uniquely English role had gone to a French actress. The film had its world premiere at the 1992 Edinburgh International Film Festival. Reviews were poor, with Binoche being cynically dubbed [...] "Cathy Clouseau" [...] and derided for her [...] "franglais" [...] accent. Both Binoche and director Peter Kosminsky distanced themselves from the film, with Binoche refusing to do any promotion for the film or to redub it into French.|$|E

60|$|With the Hop we {{have seen}} that three internodes were at the same time revolving; and this was the case with most of the plants {{observed}} by me. With all, if in full health, two internodes revolved; so that by the time the lower one ceased to revolve, the one above was in full action, with a terminal internode just commencing to move. With Hoya carnosa, on the other hand, a depending shoot, without any developed leaves, 32 inches in length, and consisting of seven internodes (a minute terminal one, an inch in length, being counted), continually, but slowly, swayed from side to side in a semicircular course, with the extreme internodes making complete revolutions. This swaying movement was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes, which, however, had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick. The case of another Asclepiadaceous plant, viz., Ceropegia Gardnerii, is worth briefly giving. I allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the length of 31 inches; this now consisted of three long internodes, terminated by two short ones. The whole revolved in a course opposed to the sun (the reverse of that of the Hop), at rates between 5 hrs. 15 m. and 6 hrs. 45 m. for each revolution. The extreme tip thus made a circle of above 5 feet (or 62 inches) in diameter and 16 feet in circumference, travelling at the rate of 32 or 33 inches per hour. The weather being hot, the plant was allowed to stand on my study- table; and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the <b>long</b> <b>shoot</b> sweeping this grand circle, night and day, in search of some object round which to twine.|$|E
60|$|Strange, stony Cagliari. We {{climbed up}} a street like a {{corkscrew}} stairway. And we saw announcements of a children's fancy-dress ball. Cagliari is very steep. Half-way up {{there is a}} strange place called the bastions, a large, level space like a drill-ground with trees, curiously suspended over the town, and sending off a <b>long</b> <b>shoot</b> like a wide viaduct, across above the corkscrew street that comes climbing up. Above this bastion place the town still rises steeply to the Cathedral and the fort. What is so curious is that this terrace or bastion is so large, like some big recreation ground, that it is almost dreary, and one cannot understand its being suspended in mid-air. Down below is the little circle of the harbour. To the left a low, malarial-looking sea plain, with tufts of palm trees and Arab-looking houses. From this runs out the long spit of land towards that black-and-white watch-fort, the white road trailing forth. On the right, most curiously, a long strange spit of sand runs in a causeway far across the shallows of the bay, with the open sea on one hand, and vast, end-of-the-world lagoons on the other. There are peaky, dark mountains beyond this--just as across the vast bay are gloomy hills. It is a strange, strange landscape: as if here the world left off. The bay is vast in itself; and all these curious things happening at its head: this curious, craggy-studded town, like a great stud of house-covered rock jutting {{up out of the}} bay flats: around it on one side the weary, Arab-looking palm-desolated malarial plain, {{and on the other side}} great salt lagoons, dead beyond the sand-bar: these backed again by serried, clustered mountains, suddenly, while away beyond the plain, hills rise to sea again. Land and sea both seem to give out, exhausted, at the bay head: the world's end. And into this world's end starts up Cagliari, and on either side, sudden, serpent-crest hills.|$|E
60|$|To {{ascertain}} {{more precisely}} what {{amount of movement}} each internode underwent, I kept a potted plant, during the night and day, in a well-warmed room to which I was confined by illness. A <b>long</b> <b>shoot</b> projected beyond {{the upper end of}} the supporting stick, and was steadily revolving. I then took a longer stick and tied up the shoot, so that only a very young internode, 1.75 of an inch in length, was left free. This was so nearly upright that its revolution could not be easily observed; but it certainly moved, and the side of the internode which was at one time convex became concave, which, as we shall hereafter see, is a sure sign of the revolving movement. I will assume that it made at least one revolution during the first twenty-four hours. Early the next morning its position was marked, and it made a second revolution in 9 hrs.; during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker, and the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over 3 hrs. As on the succeeding morning I found that the shoot revolved in 2 hrs. 45 m., it must have made during the night four revolutions, each at the average rate of a little over 3 hrs. I should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little. The shoot had now grown 3.5 inches in length, and carried at its extremity a young internode 1 inch in length, which showed slight changes in its curvature. The next or ninth revolution was effected in 2 hrs. 30 m. From this time forward, the revolutions were easily observed. The thirty-sixth revolution was performed at the usual rate; so was the last or thirty-seventh, but it was not completed; for the internode suddenly became upright, and after moving to the centre, remained motionless. I tied a weight to its upper end, so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement; but there was none. Some time before the last revolution was half performed, the lower part of the internode ceased to move.|$|E
40|$|High flower {{density is}} a {{prerequisite}} to obtain high yield. Considering that flower induction occurs simultaneously with shoot growth, shoot length could influence shoot flower abundance. Previous studies reported that nuts were borne in the apical part of the canopy on <b>long</b> <b>shoots.</b> But no data have been reported about possible relationship between flower density and shoot length. The aim of the present work was to assess whether flower density is related to shoot length in Corylus avellana L. Shoot morphological characteristics, flower number and flower sex was studied {{in two of the}} main cultivars of C. avellana. Female flowers were generally borne in apical <b>long</b> <b>shoots.</b> Shoot length was negatively correlated with flower density even though different behavior was observed between cultivars. Maximum estimated probabilities of shoot flowering varied between cultivars. These results suggest that flower density can be influenced by shoot length. Genotype can also affect such relationship. Flower density appeared to decrease in <b>longest</b> <b>shoots</b> in hazelnut. The effect of genotype on flower density may explain variation of productivity between cultivars...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the results of the study}} on morphological variability of leaves of a scattered tree species Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz) in Poland. The leaves from short- and <b>long</b> <b>shoots</b> were collected from 17 localities widespread within the range of the species in Poland. Leaves were measured according to 15 morphological traits. The biometric data were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis in attempt to define variability between local populations. Most of the leaf traits are significantly correlated and are characterised by moderate level of variation. The average among population component of variation was 32. 82 % and 27. 46 % for leaves on short- and <b>long</b> <b>shoots,</b> respectively. The differences between sampled populations are significant, but only a weak geographical pattern of this differentiation was detected. Clinal type of variation was ascertained in two traits. Leaf traits which discriminate best the studied populations are also indicated. It was proved that leaves on short shoots differ markedly in shape and size from those of <b>long</b> <b>shoots.</b> Leaves on <b>long</b> <b>shoots</b> are steadier, but morphological trait values are less correlated.
