25|$|The {{election}} was finally held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won a fourth successive electoral victory, {{even though the}} economy was still in recession {{and most of the}} polls had predicted either a narrow Labour victory or a hung parliament. Major's vigorous campaigning, notably his claim that the UK would have higher prices and higher taxes under a Labour government, was seen to have been crucial in his election win (in which he became the first–and as of 2015, only–Prime Minister to attract 14,000,000 votes in a general election), as was a high-profile campaign by The Sun newspaper against Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who resigned {{in the aftermath of the}} election to be succeeded by John Smith. The Conservative Party also touched upon the issue of immigration, claiming that under <b>Labour,</b> <b>immigration</b> would rise hugely.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher's {{stance on}} {{immigration}} {{in the late}} 1970s was perceived {{as part of a}} rising racist public discourse, which film critic Martin Barker termed [...] "new racism". As Leader of the Opposition, Thatcher believed that the National Front was winning over large numbers of Conservative voters with warnings against floods of immigrants. Her strategy was to undermine the Front narrative by acknowledging that many of their voters had serious concerns in need of addressing. In January 1978, Thatcher criticised <b>Labour</b> <b>immigration</b> policy with the goal of attracting voters away from the Front and to the Conservatives. Her rhetoric was followed by an increase in Conservative support {{at the expense of the}} Front. Critics on the left reacted in accusing her of pandering to racism. Sociologists Mark Mitchell and Dave Russell responded that Thatcher had been badly misinterpreted, arguing that race was never an important focus of Thatcherism. Throughout her premiership, both major parties took similar positions on immigration policy, having in 1981 passed the British Nationality Act with bipartisan support. There were no policies passed or proposed by her government aimed at restricting immigration, and the subject of race was never highlighted by Thatcher in any of her major speeches as Prime Minister.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} periods of recruitment. During the first period, which lasted until 1966, {{a large number}} of Turks came to the Netherlands through unofficial channels, either being recruited by employers or immigrating spontaneously. A small economic recession began in 1966. Some of the labour migrants were forced to return to Turkey. In 1968, the economy picked up again and a new recruitment period, which was to last until 1974, commenced. In May 1968, new European Economic Community rules forced the Netherlands to instate a travel visa system to regulate <b>labour</b> <b>immigration</b> and from then on, the state recruited foreign workers. The peak of Turkish labour migration occurred during these years. The Turks eventually surpassed other migrant nationalities in numbers and came to represent the Dutch image of guest workers. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, the Den Uyl cabinet ended <b>labour</b> <b>immigration</b> in 1974. Because from then on re-entry into the Netherlands was impossible, Turkish remigration strongly decreased. A system of family reunification had been arranged in the 1960s and gradually Turkish workers after 1974 brought over their wife and children. The latter predominantly married partners from Turkey. In the early twenty-first century the Second Balkenende cabinet imposed much stricter conditions on unification, to a large extent ending Turkish [...] "marriage immigration". This coincided with a drop in birth rates, leading to a gradual levelling off in the growth of people of Turkish descent. Since 2003, there have often been years with an emigration surplus.|$|E

50|$|Immigrants are {{motivated}} to leave their former countries of citizenship, or habitual residence, {{for a variety of}} reasons, including a lack of local access to resources, a desire for economic prosperity, to find or engage in paid work, to better their standard of living, family reunification, retirement, climate or environmentally induced migration, exile, escape from prejudice, conflict or natural disaster, or simply the wish to change one's quality of life.

50|$|In {{the last}} few {{election}} campaigns, Venstre's main {{focus has been on}} environmental issues, education, small-business and social issues. Venstre advocates higher taxes on activities that damage the environment. Some other issues Venstre advocate are increased <b>labour</b> <b>immigration,</b> abolition of the Church of Norway as the State church, abolishing the wealth and inheritance taxes, and more power to local authorities (kommuner). At the national convention in 2005, Venstre decided with a margin of only five votes to still oppose Norway joining the European Union, albeit weakly. It prefers continued membership in the European Economic Area. In 2007, Venstre became the first Norwegian party to advocate legalizing sharing of copyrighted digital material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{addresses}} the claim, particularly {{popular in the}} 2000 s and implicitly resting on a segmentation view of the labour market, that a flexible <b>labour</b> market-driven <b>immigration</b> policy (within the EU {{as well as from}} outside), often associated to a ‘Canadian model’, would respond to the economic needs of continental European countries. A comparative historical approach is applied, including analysis of historical series of unemployment and migration data and a qualitative analysis of secondary sources on Germany, Spain and Canada, selected as best representatives of different <b>labour</b> market and <b>immigration</b> regimes. The research asks to what extent, and how, immigration {{has been used as a}} ‘buffer’ for labour market uncertainty. Against ideas of a ‘Canadian’ model advertised in Europe (e. g. Germany), the historical and quantitative analysis shows that Canada itself has moved from short-term <b>labour</b> market-driven <b>immigration</b> policies to more long-term approaches. In fact, there has been a stronger labour market-migration link in Spain, but not without problems, The article is a small-N comparison of critical cases, that is most different labour market models. Major demographic and geographic differences exist between the three countries, which raises even more scepticism about the suitability of a Canadian model in Europe. The policy implications are centred on the detected paradox of <b>labour</b> market-driven <b>immigration</b> policies: in order to be sustainable, they need to have a long-term orientation and involve some degree of social integration policies. The article adds to comparative studies of migration policies through a stronger link to labour market analysis and in particular issues of uncertainty and segmentation...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to these social problems, Prime Minister Kirk created a special police task force in Auckland in 1973 which was tasked with dealing with overstayers. Its powers also included the power to conduct random checks on suspected overstayers. Throughout 1974, the New Zealand Police conducted dawn raids against overstayers which sparked criticism from human rights groups and sections of the press. In {{response to}} public criticism, the <b>Labour</b> <b>Immigration</b> Minister Fraser Colman suspended the dawn raids until the government developed a [...] "concerted plan." [...] In April 1974, Kirk also introduced a two - month amnesty period for overstayers to register themselves with the authorities and be granted with a two - month visa extension. Kirk's change in policies were criticized by the mainstream press, which highlighted crimes and violence perpetrated by Māori and Pacific Islanders.|$|E
50|$|On 17 November 2009, the Government finally {{approved}} the registered partnership bill, {{proposed by the}} Minister of Justice. The bill provides equal rights in <b>labour,</b> <b>immigration,</b> pension, tax, and civil law to same-sex couples as marriage does to opposite-sex couples. They also allow for someone to change their surname to match their partner's and take a common surname. The bill was passed on 10 December by the National Council, the lower house of parliament, in a 110-64 vote. The two governing parties voted in favour, while FPÖ voted against and BZÖ and the Greens voted mostly against. The Greens considered it {{a step in the}} right direction, but thought it did not go far enough. On 18 December, it was passed by the Federal Council (upper house) in a 44-8 vote.
