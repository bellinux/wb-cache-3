5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had <b>less</b> <b>clearance.</b> In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E

2500|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} the DMC-12 is its gull-wing doors. The common problem of {{supporting}} the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and a hydraulic pump in the Bricklin SV-1, although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DMC-12 features heavy doors supported by cryogenically preset torsion bars and gas-charged struts. These torsion bars were developed by Grumman Aerospace (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, PA) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors. A popular misconception of the DMC-12's gull-wing doors is that they require far more side clearance to open relative to ordinary side-hinge doors, such as when parked in a parking lot. In fact, the opposite is true: the DMC-12 requires far <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> than side-hinge doors, and this can be physically demonstrated. This misconception of side clearance may stem from a misunderstood location of the hinge point of the doors by persons unfamiliar with DMC-12s. These doors, when opening, only require [...] clearance outside {{the line of the}} car, making opening and closing the doors in crowded spaces relatively easy. Much like the doors fitted to the Lamborghini Countach, the DMC-12 doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels. Additionally, the doors featured red and amber [...] "safety" [...] lights around the perimeter. These lights illuminated when the door was open and could be seen from the front, rear or side of the vehicle at night or low light situations.|$|E
5000|$|A {{horse that}} is “tied {{in behind the}} elbow” has {{restricted}} movement of the upper arm because there is <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> for the humerus (it angles into the body too much). Reduced clearance of legs causes horse to toe-out to compensate.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adequate dosing of {{medication}} in renal impairment to prevent hospitalizations and adverse reactions {{is a growing}} concern in the aging society. There are several dosing guidelines available, but structural use is uncommon. OBJECTIVE: To perform a retrospective analysis of the incidence of required versus implemented dosage adjustments according to guidelines in patients with renal insufficiency at discharge and evaluate specific determinants responsible for the percentage of overlooked dosage adjustments. METHODS: Medication and laboratory data were collected from patients at discharge during February and November 2004. For patients with a calculated creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>less</b> than 51 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2), the necessity for dosage adjustments was evaluated by pharmacists. All data were collected for further research and subsequent statistical analysis. RESULTS: At discharge, 237 of 647 (36. 6 %) patients had a calculated creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>less</b> than 51 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2). Dosage adjustment based on renal function was necessary in 411 of 1718 (23. 9 %) of prescriptions. These adjustments were performed in 242 (58. 9 %) prescriptions and not performed in 169 (41. 1 %) cases. The risk of not adjusting the dosage was significantly associated with serum creatinine levels greater than 1. 71 mg/dL and creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>less</b> than 35 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) (p < 0. 05). The risk of not adjusting the dosage was also significantly associated with drugs producing severe consequences when dosing guidelines were overlooked (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a calculated creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>less</b> than 51 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2), dosing according to their renal function can be improved. Because of the need and the association found in this study, an alert system could help prescribers and pharmacists to adapt drug dosage in patients with renal impairment...|$|R
50|$|There are optical quality {{implications}} as well—not {{only because}} the image from the lens is effectively cropped—but because many lens designs are now optimized for sensors smaller than 36 mm × 24 mm. The rear element of any SLR lens must have clearance for the camera's reflex mirror to move up when the shutter is released; with a wide-angle lens, this requires a retrofocus design, which is generally of inferior optical quality. Because a cropped-format sensor can have a smaller mirror, <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> is needed, and some lenses, such as the EF-S lenses for the Canon APS-C sized bodies, are designed with a shorter back-focus distance; however, they cannot be used on bodies with larger sensors.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertical}} clearance for vehicles {{is limited by}} the portals and sideways sway structs. These are relatively low in older bridges. In Washington State bridges, the sway struts are often curved downwards at the outer ends, with <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> above the outer lanes and outer shoulders. Tall loads then need to use the inner lanes for maximal clearance. These bridges are vulnerable to impacts by overheight vehicles, and such impacts were common. There was a known strike on this bridge that occurred on October 22, 2012, and investigators found evidence of several other impacts in years past. Bridge inspection reports dating back to 1979 frequently note damage caused by over-height vehicles, and an inspection report from late 2012 noted a three-inch gash in the steel.|$|E

50|$|The area {{required}} for a converter station with a transmission rating of 600 megawatts and a transmission voltage of 400 kV is approximately 300 x 300 metres (1000 x 1000 feet).

5000|$|In {{some areas}} with {{restricted}} clearances, particularly {{in urban areas}} in east London (converted from 1500 V DC) and on suburban routes around Glasgow, 6.25 kV was used. A system known as [...] "Automatic Power Control" [...] was developed to allow trains to automatically switch between the voltages whilst moving. All the driver {{had to do was}} shut off power and coast until clear of the neutral section; the system automatically opened the circuit breaker, detected a change in voltage and switched over the transformer to the correct input voltage setting, then closed the circuit breaker. This system proved somewhat unreliable and, with experience, it was found that <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> was needed for 25 kV than had initially been allowed for. This allowed the 6.25 kV sections to be converted to 25 kV, with the last section, at the London end of the London Tilbury and Southend line, being converted in 1983.|$|E
50|$|In {{the home}} shop the {{radial arm saw}} is an {{alternative}} to the table saw. Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The radial arm saw requires <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The radial saw is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs to be placed {{in the center of the}} shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a horizontal boring machine and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and disk sander. The major shortcoming of most current radial arm saws for home-use is that, most radial arm saws that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. A high-quality radial arm saw has carefully machined track arm ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the mechanisms of clearance of Plasmodium yoelii-infected erythrocytes (RBC) from the peripheral circulation of mice. Parasitized RBC labeled with 51 Cr were cleared from the blood of normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice at a much more rapid rate than were nonparasitized RBC, and preincubation of parasitized RBC in antiplasmodial antibody failed to significantly enhance clearance. This apparent antibody-independent clearance mechanism was markedly abrogated by splenectomy, indicating a major role for the spleen in parasitized RBC clearance. Macrophage inactivation by silica treatment also impaired parasitized RBC clearance, but {{to a lesser extent}} than splenectomy. Although abrogation of phagocytic function by silica treatment had little effect on splenic sequestration of parasitized RBC, hepatic sequestration was significantly depressed. Schizont- and late trophozoite-infected RBC were rapidly removed from the circulation, whereas RBC containing rings and early trophozoites showed <b>less</b> <b>clearance</b> over time. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the architecture of the spleen serves as a sieve to entrap RBC that contain malarial parasites, particularly the more mature developmental forms...|$|E

50|$|The chief {{engineer}} was Ralph Modjeski, a Polish-American. Construction began on July 9, 1933. Ultimately, twenty-four men would die constructing the bridge. The western {{section of the}} bridge between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island presented an enormous engineering challenge. The bay was up to 100 ft deep in places and the soil required new foundation-laying techniques. A single main suspension span some 4100 ft in length was considered but rejected, {{as it would have}} required too much fill and reduced wharfage space at San Francisco, had <b>less</b> vertical <b>clearance</b> for shipping, and cost more than the design ultimately adopted. The solution was to construct a massive concrete anchorage halfway between San Francisco and the island, and to build a main suspension span on each side of this central anchorage.|$|R
