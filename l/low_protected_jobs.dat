40|$|Product market {{regulation}} and employment protection are highly correlated across OECD countries. Using an augmented model of monopolistic competition we show why {{in countries with}} more regulated product markets, incumbent workers prefer to <b>protect</b> <b>jobs</b> relatively more. Product {{market regulation}} increases the scope for employment protection because firms can bear the cost of employment protection more easily and still break even. Moreover, product market regulation decreases employment so that the workers' outside option becomes relatively worse. This increases the incentive to <b>protect</b> the <b>job...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we suggest a possible rationale for such reform distaste. When the rental market is very regulated, landlords screen applicants {{with regard to their}} ability to pay the rent. <b>Protecting</b> regular <b>jobs</b> offers a second-best technology to sort workers, thereby increasing the rental market size. We provide a model where non-employed workers demand <b>protected</b> <b>jobs</b> despite unemployment and the share of short-term jobs increase, whereas rents, wages and the individual risk of dismissal are unaffected...|$|R
