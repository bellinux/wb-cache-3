5000|$|A farm {{crossing}} on {{the approach}} to the station at Ballasalla. It has been unmanned since automation in 2002 when the traditional level crossing gates were replaced with modern <b>lifting</b> <b>barrier</b> controls. This crossing, despite only serving a nearby farm, {{is typical of the}} rural community and features a large (now derelict) gatekeeper's two storey house, once alleged to have been home to [...] "Blackcurrant Jack", somewhat of a local legend who was once employed as crossing keeper and used to walk the line collecting blackberries for making jam between the train services.|$|E

50|$|The level {{crossing}} was an automatic type using flashing warning lights (an AOCR - Automatic Open Crossing, Remotely Monitored), {{which had been}} installed in 1985/86 replacing <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> operated from the adjacent signal box.|$|R
50|$|The station's {{distinctive}} {{manually operated}} wooden level crossing gates (as {{seen in the}} accompanying photograph) {{have been replaced by}} modern <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> in January 2009, although they remain {{under the control of the}} adjacent NER signal box.|$|R
50|$|The {{line through}} Strawberry Hill (the Kingston Loop) opened in 1863, but Strawberry Hill station did not open until 1 December 1873. The current booking office {{building}} on the up, or western, side and the platform canopies date from the 1935 modernisation. <b>Lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> replaced the level crossing swing gates in 1973, the signal box was demolished in 1975.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} signal boxes {{close to the}} station, one of which remains in use. It {{is located on the}} north side of the line at the east end of the old station site and {{adjacent}} to a level crossing which is now guarded by <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers.</b> The junction to the Anglesey Central Railway has been disconnected.|$|R
50|$|The signal box, {{situated}} on the northern side of the line, just east of Berry Brow, was also used to manually operate the level crossing gates. It was fitted with a larger 22 lever LYR frame in 1893. Remotely operated automatic <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers,</b> monitored by CCTV, were installed at the road crossing in 1973 and this resulted in closure of the signal box on 16 December 1973.|$|R
50|$|At 2am on Saturday 18 April 2009, Network Rail {{replaced}} the old wooden gates {{on the level}} crossing {{at the entrance to}} Frinton with remotely operated <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers.</b> Network Rail did this, in spite of a three-year-long campaign by the town's people to save the gates, in order to improve performance and safety, and to reduce costs. The morning following the gates' removal, around a hundred people gathered to protest over the decision.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] level {{crossing}} at Warthill station {{was the first}} in the UK to have its manually operated gates replaced by <b>lifting</b> boom <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station, and all trains serving it, are {{operated}} by Northern. The manually operated level crossing gates {{seen in the}} photo and the wooden Great Central Railway signal box that operated them have both since {{been replaced by a}} modern brick structure and <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> respectively - the new signal box is on northside of the line, and is one of a few little boxes to be built in recent years. The station building is a private house now, but there are shelters on both platforms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signal box}} houses a 21 lever frame, made by McKenzie and Holland. In {{addition}} {{there is a}} manually operated gate machine to operate the level crossing barriers - this combination of manual gate wheel and <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> (rather that gates) being somewhat rare in the UK. The frame has had a chequered life as it was constructed for the Highland Railway by McK&H and first installed at Kingussie. It was removed in 1926 when a replacement level crossing mechanism was installed in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|Economic changes {{included}} <b>lifting</b> import <b>barriers</b> exposing {{local companies}} to international competition. Many companies went bankrupt or were sold, unemployment grew {{and support for}} the government deteriorated.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{air travel}} was {{expensive}} and few {{people of color}} could afford to fly. U.S. segregation laws were slowly being overturned to <b>lift</b> <b>barriers</b> for not only travel, but for employment opportunities. Coupled with the influx of workers from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean, and the independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, British need for labor in the post-war period made recruiting of 'coloured labour' {{in the same period}} a necessity. The following decades would increasingly see more women from former colonies enter aviation.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{the last}} station, when {{travelling}} from Cleethorpes towards Barton, to still have two platforms and the original station buildings. The buildings {{are no longer in}} railway use (the station has been unstaffed since 1969) and are in private ownership. The station signal box controls a nearby level crossing that still (as of summer 2016) has manually-wound wooden gates rather than modern <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers.</b> Since the main line was re-signalled in January 2016, the box has become the 'fringe' on this route to the Rail operating centre at York.|$|R
40|$|The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) {{provides}} vital {{funding for}} improved civil legal responses to domestic and sexual violence, but current approaches {{do not go}} far enough to address deep-rooted problems. This essay advocates for new approaches that address the problems survivors encounter in family courts, where civil remedies for domestic violence are typically pursued. These reforms require addressing stereotypes about perpetrators as well as victims, and <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> to civil legal assistance for vulnerable populations. This essay describes the goals of civil responses, barriers to achieving those goals, and proposes amendments to VAWA to address the problem...|$|R
5000|$|This {{industrial}} development had {{consequences for the}} GDLR's conventional line besides the upturn in rail traffic. The huge growth in road traffic - from near zero - by lorries and employees {{put pressure on the}} level crossings. This, together with the specific example of an accident on 7 April 1954 when a light engine collided with a van at Kiln Lane level crossing, resulted in the crossings adjacent to Kiln Lane and Great Coates tramcar halts having signalling and <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> installed and the lineside electricity cables being buried. The signalling introduced on both the electric and the conventional line was two aspect - red and white.|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} recent ethnic group, only 2,384 Japanese-born {{had arrived in}} Australia before 1979. The <b>lifting</b> of <b>barriers</b> in Australia to non-European immigration in the 1960s coincided with the Japanese post-war economic miracle which dissuaded Japanese from emigrating.|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) {{as a major}} food safety issue sets the situation for a fi rm-level opportunity. The Japanese government banned imports of cattle and beef from the U. S. when it established the fi rst cases of BSE there and refused to <b>lift</b> <b>barriers</b> because the Japanese viewed U. S. efforts to eliminate the BSE threat as inadequate. Creekstone Farms of Kentucky saw an opportunity in this situation as the Japanese and Korean governments agreed to imports of its beef if guaranteed BSE-free. The USDA has {{to decide whether to}} allow Creekstone to do this testing so that it can export its beef. The decision is diffi cult because many stakeholders have opposing views...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{will present the}} results of a {{technology}} and policy assessment we have performed on emerging issues and policy challenges of RFID technologies. RFID is a basic component of the future internet of things. A balanced view on opportunities and threats, on drivers and barriers is needed to ensure Europe to benefit from RFID. Privacy {{is one of the main}} concerns that come forward in the analysis performed. Europe has an active role to play to inform the public and the private sector of the opportunities and the associated hurdles, to <b>lift</b> <b>barriers</b> and to acquire innovative knowledge on privacy and security technologies, on frequency, standardisation and interoperability issues...|$|R

5000|$|There were {{originally}} three tracks here: {{on the south}} side was the platform line, on the north side a siding for Metro use, and in the middle the non-electrified through line for the BR freight. The ownership boundary between Metro and BR was the level crossing west of the station. A standard [...] "no vehicles" [...] road sign (white circle with red border) with a qualifying plate reading [...] "Except BR trains" [...] was used to indicate the limit of Metro operation, while there was also a fixed semaphore distant signal on the west (BR) side of the level crossing - effectively the Metro's only semaphore signal, as it was the distant for a Metro colour light. The TMO (trainman-operated) level crossing originally had boom gates (pushed by hand), but these were replaced in about 1984 with lightweight <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> (again hand-operated).|$|R
50|$|Accepting the {{diversity}} and understanding the need for dialogue, coexistence and fostering the interdependence are of crucial importance for peaceful and harmonious development of the Macedonian multicultural society. The dialogue, as a dimension of the human mind, is the key instrument for ironing the differences, <b>lifting</b> the <b>barriers</b> among people and free exchange of ideas.|$|R
40|$|Despite its {{reputation}} on healthcare excellence, peaceful environment, economical {{and social welfare}} status Hong Kong does not have structured and planned activities to promote medical tourism. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the factors influencing medical tourism development in Hong Kong. Qualitative research methodology was adopted to collect data from private and public hospitals' representatives, government bodies, institutions and doctors. Results revealed that 'policies and regulations', 'government support', 'costs', 'capacity problem' and 'healthcare needs of the local community' are the main barriers to medical tourism development. Several ways were suggested to <b>lift</b> <b>barriers</b> such as formulating new policies for promotional activities, new actions to attract investment for medical tourism market and co-operation between hospitality sector and medical institutions to develop medical tourism products. Further research studies were suggested to investigate the expectations and needs of the potential or current medical tourists. School of Hotel and Tourism ManagementRefereed conference pape...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The current {{contribution}} {{considers the}} use of the emerging modal forms want to / wanna for the speech act of advice with reference to two cognitive frameworks, viz. force dynamics and frame semantics. It is held that a volitional semantic core is projected in terms of wanting as a force dynamic experience which extends to the addressee as a mental extrapolation. In frame semantic terms the resulting speech act generates a new frame and new participant roles, so that the category “Attempt_suasion" is proposed as an addition for the verb form want in FrameNet. The interpretations in terms of both theoretical frameworks are further supported by the case of second person want to / wanna for advice with an added question tag, representing respectively a <b>lifted</b> <b>barrier</b> and a frame shift, and illustrating the added potential of the forms in terms of face, when compared to the modal should.

5000|$|The {{station was}} built {{next to the}} level {{crossing}} of Pinn Lane. This was operated by the station staff until 1875 when a small signal box was brought into use; it was situated {{on the north side}} of the line to the east of the road. The initial 11 levers were extended to 17 in 1943 when the cold store was built. On 11 June 1967 one of the two tracks between Pinhoe and [...] was taken out of use and trains towards London would often wait in the closed station for a westbound train to clear the 14 mi single track section. The level crossing gates were replaced with <b>lifting</b> <b>barriers</b> on 17 March 1968. The signal box was finally closed on 13 February 1988, the level crossing and signals now being controlled from Exmouth Junction. The old signal box was dismantled and re-erected in the railway museum at [...] on the Tamar Valley Line.|$|R
50|$|Bush then {{created a}} state Task Force on Faith-Based Programs, to {{identify}} and <b>lift</b> regulatory <b>barriers</b> for faith-based social service providers.http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/charchoice/faithful.pdf. The task force included J. Herbert Meppelink, the Executive Director of South Texas Teen Challenge.http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/charchoice/faithful.pdf. The resultant 1997 and 1999 Texas legislation exempted Faith-Based Programs, such as Teen Challenge, from state licensing and the health, safety and quality of care standards that accompany that licensing.|$|R
50|$|Prices set {{by market}} forces {{replaced}} government-determined prices. Farmers {{were permitted to}} own land and sell crops on the open market. State firms were granted increased decision-making authority and lost most of their subsidies and pricing advantages. The government set the exchange rate close to real market levels, <b>lifted</b> trade <b>barriers,</b> replaced import barriers with tariffs, and gave private sector firms direct access to imports and credit.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{contains}} an S-shaped, inverted conveyor channel in its undercarriage which <b>lifts</b> the <b>barrier</b> segments (which may weigh over 1,000 lb {{off the road}} surface and transfers {{them over to the}} other side of the lane, reallocating traffic lanes to accommodate increased traffic for the currently dominant (peak) direction These barriers are linked together with steel connectors to create a sturdy but flexible safety barrier.|$|R
40|$|The highway-railway grade {{crossing}} (HRGC) {{is a special}} intersection between two transportation modes of which their geometric features and characteristics are totally different. Regarding the safety measures at HRGC in Thailand, the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has installed traffic control devices based on outdated conventional design standards. The devices can be classified as passive and active controls. In general, the first group consists of stop signs and pavement markings, while flashing lights, automatic half <b>lift</b> <b>barriers</b> and gate barriers with manual control are considered as the second group. In practice, the SRT basically applies the criteria technique, called Traffic-Moment (TM), to evaluate the priority of HRGC required for the installation of traffic control devices. However, the SRT still lacks of comprehensive safety design standard and guideline for HRGC. This paper presents a review of HRGC design standards and regulations in Thailand. Safety countermeasures successfully implemented from international practices are also presented in the paper. The results of the paper would support a development of HRGC safety standard in Thailand...|$|R
5000|$|VRI is also {{closely related}} to other {{technologies}} such as License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). However, Vehicle Recognition is a wider umbrella term: VRI analyzes an entire vehicle instead of seeking out the numbers on a license plate. This term also encompasses recognition that does not require cameras; some VRI providers utilize RFID scanners to recognize vehicles at a distance and perform programmed actions automatically, such as <b>lifting</b> car <b>barriers</b> for approaching emergency vehicles.|$|R
