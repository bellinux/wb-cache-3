Conversely, the luxury-oriented Berlina and Calais sedans continued using a full-width boot-lid panel incorporating the registration plate and tail lamps.|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E
50|$|Another {{accessory}} was {{the remote}} <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> Fernlesegerät. For machines {{equipped with the}} extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel. A <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the Schreibmax, that the <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> and lightbulbs be removed. The remote panel {{made it possible for}} a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.|$|E

25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing <b>lamp</b> <b>panels</b> at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A xenon gas {{discharge}} flat <b>panel</b> <b>lamp</b> is {{made and the}} influence factors: the gas pressures, the gas compositions and gas gap on the luminous efficacy of the xenon {{gas discharge}} flat <b>panel</b> <b>lamps</b> were investigated. Marked increments of the luminous efficacy of the lamps were observed by optimizing the structures and the discharge conditions. The {{results showed that the}} xenon gas discharge flat <b>panel</b> <b>lamps</b> with a luminance of above 10, 000 cd/m 2, a luminous flux of above 450 lm, a size of 126 × 87 mm and an luminous efficacy of about 43 lm/W could be attained at about 450 torr xenon, 0. 71 mm gap distance and 2. 8 mm front glass layer thickness. The factors which influenced the luminous efficacy were discussed in the end. ...|$|R

50|$|Most {{military}} Enigmas {{also featured}} a plugboard (German: Steckerbrett). This altered the electrical pathway between the keyboard and the entry {{wheel of the}} scrambler and, in the opposite direction, between the scrambler and the lampboard. It did this by exchanging letters reciprocally, so that if A was plugged to G then pressing key A would lead to current entering the scrambler at the G position, and if G was pressed the current would enter at A. The same connections applied for the current {{on the way out}} to the <b>lamp</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple model of a bright-room contrast ratio (BRCR) measurement system for plasma display panels (PDPs) adopting a contrast enhancement film (CEF) by using an illumination design tool. Only four model parameters were used, namely, total ambient illumination power delivered by fluorescent <b>lamps,</b> a <b>panel</b> scattering rate, illuminance of PDP white patterns, and the absorption coefficient of a color adjusting film. These parameters were determined by simple optical measurements and matching simulations. The proposed model was employed to predict the BRCR values of four different CEF samples, and the simulated ones {{were found to be}} in agreement with measured ones within about 10 % relative-error...|$|R
5000|$|Optically {{efficient}} lighting equipment: Other types of street lights use a reflector {{to capture the}} light emitted upwards from the lamp. Even {{under the best of}} conditions, the reflector absorbs some of the light. Also for fluorescent lamps and other lamps with phosphor coated bulbs, the bulb itself absorbs some of the light directed back down by the reflector. The glass cover, called a refractor, helps project the light down on the street in a desired pattern but some light is wasted by being directed up to the sky (light pollution). LED <b>lamp</b> assemblies (<b>panels)</b> can send light in the desired directions without a reflector.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of plate buckling induced by spatial temperature gradients is described. A rectangular Hastelloy-X panel is subjected to local line heating by a focused quartz heat <b>lamp.</b> Two parallel <b>panel</b> edges are maintained at constant temperature by coolant flow. Point supports provide well-defined thermal-structural boundary conditions. Test results from transient elastic and inelastic tests demonstrate that substantial panel bending occurs due to initial panel warpage and thermally induced membrane compressive stresses...|$|R
50|$|Some M4 Enigmas {{used the}} Schreibmax, a small printer that could print the 26 letters {{on a narrow}} paper ribbon. This {{eliminated}} {{the need for a}} second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The Schreibmax was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the <b>lamp</b> <b>panel.</b> To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted plaintext.|$|E
5000|$|The 650 cc TR65T Tiger Trail {{came out}} in early 1982 and was based around the newly {{introduced}} Triumph TR65 Thunderbird engine albeit suitably altered for the trail and with electronic ignition. Whilst the press road test version was finished exactly as per the 750 cc model, the 1982/1983 brochure shows the 650 cc version, again in 'Sunburst Yellow' (Bike also reported a 'Lime Green' colour scheme for the TR65T which only appeared on Triumph's exhibition stand at the 1981 Earls Court Motorcycle show with a perforated sheet alloy guard curved over a TR7T silencer), to have different stylised 'T' tank decals with longer tails, the engine completely finished in satin black, a flat rectangular silencer with perforated sheet alloy guard, extended bash plate, 'dog leg' clutch and front brake levers, no headlamp stoneguard, centrestand as standard and {{the adoption of the}} roadster's instrumentation with centralised ignition/warning <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> and tachometer. Passenger footpegs on the 1982 brochure TR65T (and like the example held by the London Motorcycle Museum), {{in the absence of the}} usual subframe footrest brackets (omitted to accommodate the new style muffler/silencer), were instead welded upon the swingarm as on the 1973/4 TR5T Trophy Trail. However, the TR65T press bike supplied to Dirt Bike Rider, Motorcycling, The Biker [...] and SuperBike did not feature this or any cosmetic change from the TR7T. Ex-International Six Days Trials Gold Medallist, Ken Heanes, reported on a TR65T for Dirt Bike Rider (which erroneously referred to it as a TR7T in their by-line to the piece), rating it very highly as a competition machine.|$|E

40|$|The {{radiant heat}} test {{facility}} develops test sets providing well-characterized thermal environments, often representing fires. Many {{of the components}} and procedures have become standardized {{to such an extent}} that the development of a specialized design tool to determine optimal configurations for radiant heat experiments was appropriate. SPLASH (Single Panel Lamp and Shroud Helper) is that tool. SPLASH is implemented as a user-friendly, Windows-based program that allows a designer to describe a test setup in terms of parameters such as number of lamps, power, position, and separation distance. This document is a user manual for that software. Any incidental descriptions of theory are only for the purpose of defining the model inputs. The theory for the underlying model is described in SAND 2005 - 2947 (Ref. [1]).

2500|$|The British {{postponed}} {{their attack}} to 8 August, reduced {{the depth of}} the objective and made six [...] "Chinese" [...] attacks on 7 August, to inflict losses and mislead the defenders. The attack differed little from previous attempts, although careful briefings were conducted and elaborate measures taken to maintain communication, using contact-patrol aircraft to observe ground flares, mirrors, <b>lamps</b> and <b>panels.</b> Visual signalling posts and relay posts for runners were prepared and messenger-pigeons taken forward. Infantry wore shiny tin discs on the back of their equipment, to be visible from the air and a wireless station was set up near Favière Wood. Visual signalling still failed again during the attack, due to mist, dust and smoke. Congestion in the British trenches in front of Trônes Wood made a fresh attack impossible until next day. On 9 August, some battalions had not arrived by zero hour, the attacks failed and British troops isolated in Guillemont were overwhelmed and captured.|$|R

The DC electrical generator was replaced by a new AC alternator on all Fords (a way to distinguish a 1964 from a 1965 is to see if the alternator light on the dash says [...] "GEN" [...] or [...] "ALT"). The Mustang GT version was introduced as the [...] "GT Equipment Package" [...] and included a V8 engine (most often the [...] 289), grille-mounted fog <b>lamps,</b> rocker <b>panel</b> stripes, and disc brakes. In the interior the GT option added a different instrument panel that included a speedometer, fuel gauge, temp. gauge, oil pressure gauge and ammeter in five round dials (the gauges were not marked with numbers, however.) [...] A four-barrel carbureted engine was now available with any body style. Additionally, reverse lights were an option added to the car from August 1964 production. The Mustang was originally available as either a hardtop or convertible, but during the car's early design phases a fastback model was strongly considered. In 1965, the Shelby Mustang was born, it was available only in newly introduced fastback body version with its swept-back rear glass and distinctive ventilation louvers.|$|R
