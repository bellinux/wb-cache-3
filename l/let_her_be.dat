500|$|Her {{interest}} in acting sparked from watching her brother perform {{in a school}} production of The King and I when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>be</b> in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of HenryV starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief {{that she wanted to}} pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. [...] "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," [...] she said. Branagh's sister replied: [...] "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her arrogance, her {{political}} views and her {{conflicts with the}} Riksdag made her less and less liked during her tenure as queen. Carl Gustaf Tessin once said about her: [...] "It seems undeniable, that our Queen {{would have been the}} most staunch of republicans, had she been born a subject; but God has <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>be</b> born in a position, were one is vary of once's power".|$|E

[...] Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted {{in the sight of}} the world, is chaste in his sight -- I mean the harlot, slavery. For her his tongue is always profuse in words.

2500|$|Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, saying: [...] "He {{married a}} Cushite woman!" [...] and [...] "Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?" [...] God heard and called Moses, Aaron, and Miriam {{to come to}} the Tent of Meeting. God came down in cloud and called out to Aaron and Miriam: [...] "When a prophet of the Lord arises among you, I make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with My servant Moses; he is trusted {{throughout}} My household. With him I speak mouth to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he beholds the likeness of the Lord. How then did you not shrink from speaking against My servant Moses!" [...] As the cloud withdrew, Miriam was stricken with snow-white scales. Moses cried out to God, [...] "O God, pray heal her!" [...] But God said to Moses, [...] "If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? <b>Let</b> <b>her</b> <b>be</b> shut out of camp for seven days."

Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the Enterprise to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T'Pring (Arlene Martel).

The fight begins, and Spock gains the upper hand, garroting Kirk and killing him. McCoy orders an emergency transport directly to sickbay, while Spock is told by T'Pring that it was all a game of logic which would <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>be</b> with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the Enterprise where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.|$|E

Finally, Gold places Robin's heart into Pan's, only for Pan to discover that Gold tricked his father: Gold had returned Robin's heart to Robin earlier, while Pan was distracted.
