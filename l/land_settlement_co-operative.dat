This resulted in the <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> residents that being moved to high-rise settlement, they have encountered a change of high-rise vertical living culture that different from their living culture before. This study aims {{to find out the}} use of shared space in landed living and high-rise settlement. The research method used in this research is qualitative descriptive study. The site of the research is in the <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> of Kampung Pulo and the high-rise settlement of Jatinegara Barat. Kampung Pulo settlement is a residence of Jatinegara Barat residents before they are moved. The result of the research shows the change of space use for shared space from landed to high-rise settlement; (1) <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> more accommodate the diversity of communal activities than high- rise settlement. (2) in the <b>landed</b> <b>settlement</b> there is a territory transition space that accommodates the needs of interaction, homebased business activities, and play, whereas high-rise settlement there is no more transition space, so the need for interaction and play is contained in the public space, while the trading activities needs are mostly found within the private area.

40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of the {{research}} which went into the present study (a) to investigate the reasons {{for the establishment of a}} <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> scheme in Newfoundland during the period, 1934 - 1942, and to examine the methods used to implement it;(b) to investigate the political, natural environmental (site, material resources) and human factors that contributed to failures or successes in particular settlements; (c) to examine the demographic and landscape structure of each of eight settlements initiated under the scheme both in the period of Government sponsorship and at the present time. From a geographical point of view the main problem was interpreted to require (a) a reconstruction of the spatial organization of the <b>land</b> <b>settlements</b> during their early years of development and (b) an examination of the sequential development of these same settlements from their present structure. [...] The study began during March 1969 with examination of the literature, the collection of data from the Commission of Government files contained in the Newfoundland Archives and government departments, and the interviewing of key personnel involved in the <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> movement. During the period May - September 1969 field visits were made into each of the eight land settlements: Markland, Haricot, Lourdes, Midland, Brown's Arm, Sandringham, Winterland and Point au Mall, where informal interviews were conducted with as many original land settlers as possible. Formal questionaires were also completed for each household within the former designated territory established for <b>land</b> <b>settlement.</b> [...] It was found that the main purpose of the <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> scheme was to relieve the problem of unemployment. In its initial stages the scheme proceeded purely as an experimental scheme without any clearly defined policy in such important matters as - site selection, settler selection, management, or land tenure. Though the scheme was reorganized as a result of policy changes implemented in 1939, the total program affected only a small proportion of the Newfoundland population, and more particularly, a very small proportion of families on relief. The prosperity that came with World War II appears to have done more to rehabilitate families who did enter the <b>land</b> <b>settlements</b> than the <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> scheme itself. Since 1945 the <b>land</b> <b>settlements</b> appear to have evolved in much the same manner as other small settlements in Newfoundland, though each bears some population and landscape remnants of its origin...|$|R
