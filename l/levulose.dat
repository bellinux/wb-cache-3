5000|$|Monosaccharides (from Greek : single, sacchar: sugar), {{also called}} simple sugars, {{are the most}} basic units of carbohydrates. They are {{fundamental}} units of carbohydrates and cannot be further hydrolyzed to simpler compounds. The general formula is [...] They are the simplest form of sugar and are usually colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline solids. Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (<b>levulose)</b> and galactose. Monosaccharides are {{the building blocks of}} disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). Further, each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group (so, all of the carbons except for the primary and terminal carbon) is chiral, giving rise to a number of isomeric forms, all with the same chemical formula. For instance, galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses, but have different physical structures and chemical properties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rotation}} of the orientation of linearly polarized light was first observed in 1811 in quartz by French physicist François Jean Dominique Arago. In 1820, the English astronomer Sir John F.W. Herschel discovered that different individual quartz crystals, whose crystalline structures are mirror images of each other (see illustration), rotate linear polarization by equal amounts but in opposite directions. Jean Baptiste Biot also observed the {{rotation of}} the axis of polarization in certain liquids and vapors of organic substances such as turpentine. [...] Simple polarimeters have been used since this time to measure the concentrations of simple sugars, such as glucose, in solution. In fact one name for D-glucose (the biological isomer), is dextrose, referring {{to the fact that it}} causes linearly polarized light to rotate to the right or dexter side. In a similar manner, <b>levulose,</b> more commonly known as fructose, causes the plane of polarization to rotate to the left. Fructose is even more strongly levorotatory than glucose is dextrorotatory. Invert sugar syrup, commercially formed by the hydrolysis of sucrose syrup to a mixture of the component simple sugars, fructose, and glucose, gets its name from the fact that the conversion causes the direction of rotation to [...] "invert" [...] from right to left.|$|E
40|$|<b>Levulose</b> (D-fructose, fruit sugar), C 6 H 12 O 6 {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} ketohexose. This sugar has distinctive properties {{which make}} it of commercial interest. It is more costly than ordinary table sugar (sucrose). <b>Levulose</b> {{is characterized by a}} high degree of sweetness (6), great solubility (20), and medical usefulness when administered intravenously. Joslin (21) and Root and Baker (32) found <b>levulose</b> to be of great value in the treatment of diabetes. According to Daniel (8), it is assimilated and oxidized more quickly than sucrose, supplying the necessary energy requirements for the human system. Additional uses of <b>levulose</b> have been reported by McGlumphy and Eichinger (27), which include its application to improve the quality and the flavor of jams, jellies, marmalades, canned fruits, carbonated beverages, and corn sugar. Plants of the family compositae contain large amounts of <b>levulose</b> polymers, but the dahlia, chicory, and Jerusalem artichoke are the most promising sources because of the high <b>levulose</b> content and the ease of production (13). The tubers of Jerusalem artichoke were used in this study because they offer an inexpensive and prolific source from which <b>levulose</b> can be extracted. Since most of the <b>levulose</b> units in the artichoke tubers are linked together to form inulin or carbohydrate intermediate compounds between inulin and <b>levulose,</b> it is necessary to hydrolyze the material in order to free the <b>levulose.</b> Several investigators have reported the use of acid compounds. Anderson and Greaves (1) used H 2 SO 4 for hydrolysis, while Yamasaki (41) used HC 1 for the same purpose. Kleiderer and Englis (23) obtained complete hydrolysis of inulin by use of CO 2 and SO 2 at a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch at 150 o C. for 60 minutes. As fare as can be determined from the literature, little work was done prior to 1953 using radioactive material to study peaceful uses of atomic energy. Since that time, a law was passed by the United States Congress authorizing the use of radioactive material for peaceful purposes, thereby making it possible to use atomic energy for this study. Since previous work has shown that gamma rays can convert starch to simple sugar (33), it was therefore, assumed that the inulin and other carbohydrate intermediates of Jerusalem artichoke upon hydrolysis by beta or gamma rays might yield fructose (35). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of beta and gamma rays on inulin and other carbohydrate intermediate compounds present in the Jerusalem artichoke tubers and to compare the results with those obtained by hydrolysis with radiation plus hydrochloric acid...|$|E

40|$|When the {{pancreas}} {{of a dog}} is perfused aseptically with a Locke's solution containing dextrose in physiological concentrations, the optical rotation of the perfusate is diminished, but its reducing power is unaltered. This change also occurs if dextrose is added to a sugarfree pancreatic perfusate and the mixture incubated. These perfusates yield osazones with lower melting points than glucosazone, but when the perfusates are hydrolyzed with weak acid their optical, rotations and the melting points of their osazones are increased. These changes do not occur with <b>levulose,</b> or with an extract of {{the pancreas}} and dextrose. When the heart, spleen, or kidneys are perfused with dextrose solutions hydrolysis of the perfusates does not increase their optical rotation or power of reduction. When a pancreatic perfusate containing dextrose is circulated through a living heart {{not only do the}} above changes take place but, in addition, the reducing properties of the perfusate are altered. Hydrolysis of such a perfusate increases its reducing power, its optical rotation, and the melting point of its osazone. A heart does not cause this effect either alone or when perfused together with the spleen or kidneys. <b>Levulose</b> perfused through the heart and pancreas is unchanged. These phenomena are believed to be due to an enzyme or enzymes obtained from the perfused pancreas. The changes in optical rotation, in reduction, and in the osazones are accounted for by different degrees of dextrose condensation. While the living heart can destroy both dextrose and <b>levulose</b> to some extent, the experimental results suggest that the enzyme or enzymes derived from the perfused pancreas have a specific action on dextrose and are responsible for certain essential steps by which dextrose is prepared for normal utilization...|$|E

40|$|MacLean and de Wesselow (1) {{examined}} {{the type of}} blood sugar curves obtained in normal and diabetic subjects. They suggest that such curves rise very slowly or fail to rise during the second thirty minute period following administration of sugar by mouth, due to stimulation of the glycogen storage mechanism which abstracts the sugar from the blood more quickly than it enters. They believe that this dormant glycogen-forming function of the liver does not begin to act until the sugar concentration approaches 140 mgm. per cent. That the glycogen-storing function is stimulated by hyperglycemic levels is supported by Foster (2). He found that oral administration of glucose, when the concentration of the blood sugar is falling, results in little or no increase in blood sugar. This observation of Foster has been amply confirmed, especially {{by the work of}} du Vigneaud and Karr (3) and later by Lennox and Bellinger (4). That there is a relation between the fasting blood sugar level and its rise above the fasting level following the administration of <b>levulose</b> by mouth seems borne out by this investigation. This relationship is intimately concerned with the mechanism by which the normal subject maintains his fairly constant blood sugar level as recently shown by Jonas and his associates (5), Trimble and Maddock (6) and Sweeney (7). They show that the normal subject maintains a blood sugar almost invariably between 80 and 140 mgm. per cent during such diverse activities as rest, sleep, mild exercise, work, and eating.

40|$|Graduation date: 1935 This {{investigation}} was undertaken to determine, from a dietetic standpoint, the amounts and proportions of dextrose, <b>levulose</b> and sucrose present in Bosc pears, and to furnish information {{that might be}} of value {{in the development of}} by-products from the off-grade fruit of this variety. The attempt was made to carry out this work {{in such a way that}} fundamental information might be obtained concerning the physiological changes occuring during growth, storage, and ripening. Such information, it was hoped, might lead to a better understanding of the physiology of pears, and. in addition, shed some light on the dynamics of carbohydrate changes in fruit. The investigation has been carried on for two seasons and may be divided, into three general parts: (1) a study of the physical and chemical changes occuring during the latter stages of growth; (2) a study of the chemical changes occuring during storage; and. (3) a study of the chemical changes occuring during the ripening process. (1) The results of the study of the physical and chemical changes during one growing season show that the amounts of dextrose remain approximately constant during growth while the amounts of <b>levulose</b> increase steadily during most of this period, but decrease markedly during the last week on the tree. Sucrose is present in increasing amounts during the last seven weeks on the tree and increases very rapidly during the last week. (2) The results of the study of the chemical changes as observed during two storage seasons, show that there are marked differences between pears of two successive seasons and that the sugar content of fruit may show quite different changes during storage, depending upon the time of picking. It is apparent, however, that levu 1 ose increases during storage, in most cases, and that dextrose either remains constant or increases slightly. The behavior of sucrose appears to depend, to a considerable extent, upon the time of picking. (3) The results of the study of the ripening of pears show that chemical changes took place during ripening of fruit that attained prime eating condition, which are quite different than those which were observed during the ripening of fruit which developed mediocre eating quality. These changes were studied during two seasons and indicate that the conditions associated with the inversion of sucrose during ripening are correlated with the physical and. chemical changes involved in attaining good. eating quality. The chemical changes involved in ripening include a hydrolysis of some undetermined carbohydrate to yield sucrose which may or may not be inverted. <b>Levulose</b> increases in all cases, while dextrose either remains constant or increases, depending upon the extent of inversion of sucrose. The identity of the material yielding the increasing amounts of sugars, observed in ripening, was not determined.

Urine of fetuses and unfed calves did not contain it. By feeding different amounts of colostrum, by withholding it for some hours after birth, and by giving it alternately with milk, the appearance of protein in the urine as to time and quantity was clearly a function of the colostrum fed. Serum replacing colostrum produced the same effect to a less pronounced degree. The permeability of the kidneys as determined in a routine way on healthy calves killed within the 1 st week of life ceases after the 3 rd day. In the two cases fed repeatedly with colostrum, proteinuria was demonstrated up to 6 days in one case.

Incidence of streptococci in bovine milk in Hokkaido was 27. 0 % in cows (239 out of 886), and 11. 9 % in quarters (418 quarters out of 3508). 2. These streptococci were demonstrated from average 69. 2 % of mastitis quarters and 51. 4 % of quarters which secreted the abnormal milk, though it was demonstrated from normal milk in 18. 8 %. These percentages are widely diverse by farms. 3. Isolated strains of streptococci {{to the number of}} 319 were divided into Str. agalactiae; 126 (39. 5 %), Str. uberis; 80 (25. 1 %), Str. bovis; 34 (10. 7 %), Str. faecalis; 17 (5. 3 %), Str. lactis; 12 (3. 8 %), Str. dysgalactiae; 8 (2. 5 %), Str. acidominimus; 5 (1. 6 %), Str. pyogenes; 4 (1. 3 %) and others. 4. Eighty percent of Str. agalactiae and Str. dysgalactiae strain, 70 % of Str. uberis strain and about 90 % of Str. lactis strain were derived from mastitis or abnormal milk. Contrary to this, more than 50 % of Str. bovis or Str. faecalis were isolated from normal milk. 5. One hundred forty-five strains which reacted with group-B serum were serologically typed into type II; 114 (78. 6 %) and type III; 1 (0. 7 %) by precipitation reaction following LANCEFIELD. The author could not demonstrate any type specific carbohydrate antigens in the remaining 30 strains (20. 7 %) examined. 6. Some experiments were performed by agar gel diffusion method on the strains lacking type specific carbohydrate. Discussion was offered. 7. Survey on the distributions of these sero-types among cows in 4 farms showed interesting results characteristic to each farm. 8. Biochemical properties, especially sugar fermentation reaction were examined. According to this there seem to be 3 types; the salicin-negative- and trehalose-positive type, the salicin-positive and trehalose-negative type and the both-positive type. One biochemical type of Str. agalactiae tends to be detected in 1 farm. 9. Str. agalactiae produce acid from galactose, mannose, <b>levulose,</b> sucrose but not from xylose, rhamnose amygdalin, raffinose, inulin, sorbitol and mannitol without exception. With the characters of hydrolysis of sodium hippurate, non-splitting of esculin and production of ammonia from arginine, these fermentation reactions seem to be invariable by strain. 10. The strains which manifested the above mentioned biochemical characters all reacted promptly strong positive with group-B sera by precipitation...|$|E
40|$|If we glance {{again at}} the {{classification}} proposed by Andrewes and Horder we are struck at once {{by the fact that}} no hard and fast differences in fermentative properties characterize the various groups, and that the authors prefer to have recourse to the most frequent habitat of the organisms and to chemical tests, rather than to confine themselves to the latter method alone. From what has been said earlier in this paper, it becomes clear at once that the results gained by these authors are not convincing, for in their work they have failed to use the most favorable medium for growth of the organisms. And thus it can hardly be doubted that different reactions might have been obtained, under the conditions adopted by us. How otherwise could the fact be explained that of thirty-four of their pneumococci only eight fermented inulin. We had a similar experience while using the plain broth which led us to reject it as an unfavorable medium. Further, all our pneumococci fermented lactose with great rapidity. Andrewes and Horder report that eight of their series left lactose unchanged. Taking our own tests into consideration we find that working with but a small number of carbohydrates we were able to find six different varieties of streptococci among only 33 pathogenic strains. Which of the various substances is to decide us in the grouping of the organisms? Would we not find even greater variations from the most common type (see No. 4 in table) if we were to extend our tests over a larger series of chemical agents? These questions are difficult to answer and only extended experimentation with a great many streptococci and many media will clear up the doubtful points. In concluding it may be stated: 1. Streptococci vary considerably in their ability to produce acid from various carbohydrates. 2. Chemical tests of this kind should be made only in the media which are most favorable for the growth of the organisms. 3. Our results gave us six groups of streptococci, when tested upon dextrose, <b>levulose,</b> galactose, maltose, saccharose, lactose, inulin, dextrin and mannite, viz. : Those fermenting (1) all; (2) all but mannite; (3) all but inulin; (4) all but inulin and mannite; (5) all but inulin and lactose; and (6) all but inulin, mannite and saccharose. 4. In view of the comparatively small number of streptococci employed we are hardly warranted in making a definite classification. Perhaps a larger series of tests upon the media employed will enable us to divide streptococci into distinct classes characterized by certain fixed fermentative properties...|$|E
40|$|Various {{carbohydrates}} {{have been}} added to the fluid cultures of different strains of spirochetes in order to determine the behavior of the latter toward the carbohydrates. In the present experiment, amygdalin, arabinose, beerwort, dextrin, galactose, glycogen, glucose, inulin, lactose, <b>levulose,</b> maltose, mannite, raffinose, saccharose, and starch were tested with seven strains of Treponema pallidum and one strain each of Treponema calligyrum, Treponema microdentium, Treponema mucosum, and Spirochata refringens. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. In the media containing glycogen and glucose, Treponema microdentium did not grow as vigorously as in other sugar media, and an earlier degeneration set in. One strain of the pallidum and the calligyrum and mucosum showed a poor growth in the glycogen medium. Similarly, there was little growth in the second transfer of these spirochetes in the glucose medium. The growth of the spirochetes in the media containing carbohydrates other than those Just mentioned was generally good, and no difference could be distinguished between these and the control cultures without any carbohydrate. The only phenomenon which might be interpreted as indicating a favorable influence of these media upon growth was the abundant growth of the mucosum, which showed uniform length, regular curves, and active motility somewhat better than in the sugar-free medium. 2. The height of acidity was found in the cultures containing glycogen and glucose in the microdentium, amounting to 0. 1 N 4. 8 cc. for 10 cc. of the fluid culture. In the other sugar media the acidity varied between 0. 1 N 2 cc. and 0. 1 N 3. 2 cc. for the same amount. In the control cultures, the acidity fluctuated from 0. 1 N 0. 8 cc. to 0. 1 N 2 cc. There was no visible alteration in the appearance of the media after the spirochetes had grown for 3 or 4 weeks. In the case of Treponema microdenlium, a slight opalescence developed in the glycogen and glucose media after several weeks' standing, but there was no precipitation or coagulation of the proteins of the culture media. 3. There was no unusual morphological change in the spirochetes grown in the media containing any of the carbohydrates employed. The only phenomena which should be mentioned are (a) the frequent presence of the terminal appendages (or projections) in the refringens, and in most of the pallidum strains, and (b) the appearance of minute, retractile spherical bodies along the side of the spirochetes in the microdenlium cultivated in the glucose or glycogen media. Judging from the earlier degeneration of the species in the above mentioned media, these peculiar bodies may be interpreted as indicating a phase of plasmoptysis associated with the unfavorable surroundings prior to degeneration. Experimental evidence was not found for considering these spherules as a resistant or spore form of the spirochete...|$|E
