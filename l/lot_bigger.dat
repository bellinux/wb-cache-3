500|$|Bungie and Microsoft first showed ODST in a playable form at E3 2009, {{where the}} game's release date and retail {{versions}} were finalized. Bungie initially marketed ODST as a title smaller in scope than previous numbered {{entries in the}} series. When the game's retail versions were announced, however, the game received a standard price of US$60, which Bungie and Microsoft attributed to the game growing beyond the planned scope. [...] "Over the course of development it got a <b>lot</b> <b>bigger</b> than we were anticipating," [...] said Bungie's Lars Bakken. [...] "We thought of it more as an expansion and then it grew well beyond that." [...] Creamer explained that since the development platform was stable, [...] "we were able to create {{quite a bit more}} content than we originally thought we would". The game's length increased from original estimates of 3–5hours to 8–10. The discrepancy was not discussed until E3 2009 when Microsoft decided it was a full game. Unlike the post-launch support for Halo 3, ODST does not have downloadable content.|$|E

Looking to expand {{further into the}} toys business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. In 1997, <b>Big</b> <b>Lots</b> Inc. bought out 'MacFrugals' (Pic 'N' Save) stores for $995 million in stock, eventually converting those to the <b>Big</b> <b>Lots</b> brand. In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to private equity shops.

500|$|Commenting on {{the success}} of American {{producers}} such as Skrillex, Skream stated: [...] "I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a <b>lot</b> <b>bigger.</b> The bad side of that {{is that a lot of}} people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes." [...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. [...] The term metalstep has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Commit This to Memory, which were booked by Hoppus, were scheduled over six weeks at Seedy Underbelly Studios in Valley Village, a district of Los Angeles, California, which {{was actually a}} rented house that had once belonged to Jeff Porcaro, the drummer for Toto. The band had, according to Hoppus, [...] "a million ideas {{and a lot of}} energy and enthusiasm to make a great record". Pierre strove for the record to have a sound that resembled the bands Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the neighbors had called police to the band and Hoppus several times for being too loud at night time, especially when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to work on a song late at night. According to Pierre, Hoppus was not interested in putting his own stamp on the music, but rather bringing out the best in what he saw in the group. Hoppus generally modeled his production after Jerry Finn (a longtime producer of Blink-182), and therefore it involved much watching and listening. [...] "Mark kept telling us, 'Your name {{is going to be a}} <b>lot</b> <b>bigger</b> on the front than mine is on the back'," [...] recalled Justin Pierre, [...] "So he would throw suggestions out there but always say, 'Feel free to turn these down.' And we would!" ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a <b>lot</b> <b>bigger</b> jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues.

[...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe.
