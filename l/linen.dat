5|$|John Struthers {{was the son}} of Dr Alexander Struthers (1767–1853) and {{his wife}} Mary Reid (1793–1859). They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house. Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and <b>linen</b> merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a <b>linen</b> {{spinning}} mill built in 1792. <b>Linen</b> was threshed at the nearby threshing mill, and bleached in the open air near the house. There were still <b>linen</b> bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had gone by 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family. Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a <b>linen</b> maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.|$|E
5|$|<b>Linen</b> was Scotland's premier {{industry}} in the 18th century and {{formed the basis for}} the later cotton, jute, and woollen industries. Scottish industrial policy was made by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant <b>linen.</b> Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of <b>linen</b> manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. The British <b>Linen</b> Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish <b>linen</b> {{industry in}} the 18th century, exporting <b>linen</b> to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other <b>linen</b> manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the British <b>Linen</b> Bank in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969. It joined the established Scottish banks such as the Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1695) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1727). Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system {{by the end of the}} century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white <b>linen,</b> and on rare occasion with white thread on brown <b>linen.</b> Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe smear-ripened soft cheeses are characterised by {{a surface}} orange-red-brown colour, {{which has a}} {{microbial}} origin. For a long time, this colouration was mainly imputed to Brevibacterium <b>linens.</b> However, the latest published works, based on molecular biology, have shown a minor role for this bacterium. This study shows the results obtained with an industrial cheese named Vieux-Pané, which is characterised {{by the presence of}} carotenoids from Brevibacterium <b>linens</b> group at its surface. This demonstrates that, under certain conditions, the Brevibacterium <b>linens</b> group (Brevibacterium <b>linens</b> and Brevibacterium aurantiacum sp. nov.) is able to produce pigments and to colour cheeses effectively...|$|R
5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, {{the main}} {{industries}} in the town were flax spinning and <b>linen</b> weaving. To cope with increasing imports of flax, timber and hemp, and exports of coal, salt and <b>linen,</b> between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent {{for the production of}} floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in linoleum and coal.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of <b>linen</b> which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by <b>linen</b> manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The <b>linen</b> {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by <b>linen</b> merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
