5|$|As soon as {{the troops}} {{returned}} from France, the British Army began implementing <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> campaign and re-organizing formations. As part of this, the army's five motor divisions (made up of two brigades) were to be reformed as regular infantry divisions (made up of three brigades). As a result, the 66th Infantry Division was disbanded on 23 June. The 197th Infantry Brigade {{was transferred to the}} 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, the 198th Infantry Brigade went to the 1st London Division, and the 199th Infantry Brigade was assigned to the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the UK Ministry of Defence began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU). The update to GR4 standard, {{approved}} in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> GR1's {{performance in the}} 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012, Network Rail {{appointed}} BAM Nuttall as {{its main}} contractor. The Network Rail team which {{worked on the}} line was {{essentially the same as}} the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
30|$|Sixth, if {{you want}} to {{leverage}} the power of nature, you must accommodate yourself to nature. In other words, the mindset of human beings triumphing over nature should be changed to an attitude of seeking harmony between human beings and nature.

30|$|A <b>lesson</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of the cytotoxicity assays with fish cells was the importance of appropriate IVIVE models. Thus, this aspect was considered right <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning in the {{development of}} in vitro biotransformation assays. The prediction models enable the extrapolation of in vitro biotransformation rate values into in vivo biotransformation rates of the fish, allowing the calculation of a predicted BCF value [42, 102, 104]. In addition to physiological data with relevance for the toxicokinetics, the extrapolation models also consider the in vitro/in vivo bioavailability of the xenobiotics which is a critical factor influencing the outcome of the prediction [6, 25, 59, 82, 105]—another important <b>lesson</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studies on the cytotoxicity assays (see above). For the chemicals tested to date for in vitro biotransformation, a good agreement between in vitro predicted and empirically measured BCF values was observed [61, 73, 86]. What is still lacking is that the in vitro assays are tested with a broader array of chemicals in order to elucidate their chemical application domains.|$|R
50|$|A major <b>lesson</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Italian {{campaign}} {{was that the}} conversion to towed guns was not as advantageous as had been previously thought. The mobility and protection of the tank destroyer was found to outweigh the towed anti-tank gun's low profile. At Anzio, a number of British towed anti-tank gun units were overrun and knocked out simply because {{they were unable to}} redeploy on short notice, while self-propelled guns were able to fall back and continue fighting.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} thought behind the Compilation would later inspire the {{creation}} of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos, and would use <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would inspire {{the creation of}} another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, {{in conjunction with other}} extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the light}} of <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase {{the pressure on the}} German defences and disperse their defensive fire. SHAEF planners had advised, on 10 June, {{that the best way to}} break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation.|$|E

5|$|The IJN began reevaluating the Nagato {{design in}} light of <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Jutland in May 1916, {{experiments}} evaluating armor protection, and newly acquired information on the protective schemes of British and American capital ships. These lessons highlighted the need for better protection of the main gun turrets and magazines, as well as thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire. Existing methods of defense against mines and torpedoes had also proved to be inadequate and needed improvement. Eleven new designs were rejected between October and early 1917 before Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, superintendent of shipbuilding and the naval architect {{in charge of the}} fundamental design of the ships of the Eight-Eight Fleet, presented a heavily modified version of the Nagato design, A-125, to be built in lieu of the second ship of the class, Mutsu, on 12 June 1917, well before she was actually laid down.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{objectives}} of Operation Dragoon were the important French ports of Marseille and Toulon, which were considered essential {{to supply the}} growing Allied forces in France. The Allied planners were cautious, taking heed of <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Anzio and Normandy landings. They chose a location without high ground controlled by the Wehrmacht, conditions that had led to heavy casualties after the initial landings {{on one of the}} beaches at Normandy. The choice for the disembarkation site was an area on the Var coast east of Toulon. A preliminary air campaign was planned to isolate the battlefield and cut the Germans off from reinforcement by destroying several key bridges. A large airborne landing was also planned {{in the center of the}} landing zone to quickly seize the high ground overlooking the beaches. Parallel to the invasion, several commando units would take control of the islands off the coast.|$|E
5|$|The ship's air {{group was}} {{originally}} intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M 'Claude' fighters, plus four in storage, 18 Aichi D3A 'Val' dive bombers, plus two in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N 'Kate' torpedo bombers. This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, and three in storage for the A5Ms {{by the time the}} ship commissioned in 1942. As a result of the <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Midway in June, the ship's fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros, and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. By the end of the year, six more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As. Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.|$|E

5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia {{was based on a}} simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E
