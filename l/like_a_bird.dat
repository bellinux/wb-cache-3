5|$|Shrikes are {{passerine}} birds {{known for}} the habit of some species of catching other birds and small animals and impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns. A typical shrike's beak is hooked, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> of prey.|$|E
5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, {{although}} the concept originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992). Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima, and Takashi Iizuka. Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b> Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character. The team conducted research on dreaming and REM sleep, and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. An analogue controller, known as the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and was included with some retail copies sold.|$|E
5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
25|$|Tebbetts {{was born}} in Burlington, Vermont, but {{his family moved to}} Nashua, New Hampshire a few months after he was born. Shortly thereafter, his father died, leaving his mother to raise the family. Some reports state that Tebbetts {{acquired}} his nickname as a boy after an aunt observed that his voice sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> chirping, while other reports state the nickname was acquired while attending Providence College.|$|E

25|$|Bolas spiders {{are small}} nocturnal animals with oddly 'lumpy' abdomens. Females may {{grow up to}} 15mm or 1/2", while the males, which are smaller, measure in at about 2mm or 1/16". Several Mastophora species (e.g. M. cornigera) look like bird droppings, which enables them to rest unnoticed at day in fairly exposed places. M. bisaccata resembles the shell of a snail that is {{abundant}} in the spider's habitat. While the bird dropping mimics rest on the upper surface of leaves, M. bisaccata rests on the undersides. If removed from the surface, Mastophora females produce a pungent odor, which is highly unusual for spiders (other than bolas spiders, only one species of Cyrtarachne is known to do this). They do not attempt to flee when handled. Some species of Cladomelea also rest exposed on leaves during the day. However, the Australian Ordgarius magnificus, which displays eye spots on its back that make it resemble the moth they hunt, ties leaves together with silk to form a retreat. The females of some bolas spiders look remarkably <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> dropping, thanks to their large, globular abdomen and brownish cephalothorax. This {{is a form of}} defensive mimicry as the animals that prey on spiders pay little attention to bird droppings.|$|E
500|$|The Dici by Wonderbra {{television}} advertisements {{started in}} 1974. The brand was positioned to young {{women as a}} more natural alternative to the heavily-structured bras worn by their mothers. The animated ads featured the iconic die-shaped packaging. A bra exited the box <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird,</b> then metamorphosed into a seagull and flew away. The tagline reinforced a spirit of freedom and nature: [...] "Let it be Dici. Dici or nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{references}} to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b> The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, [...] "stuffing birds", bird being a British slang for a desirable woman. Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original [...] "stuffed bird", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.|$|E

500|$|According to Valiente, {{about the}} head were carvings of foliage, {{representing}} [...] "the forces {{of life and}} fertility, which Atho personifies." [...] She asserted that {{the signs of the}} zodiac were depicted on the horns, with [...] "the five rings of witchcraft" [...] on the forehead. The nose was ornamented with a pentagram, and acted as a cup to hold the Sabbat wine. She stated that the mouth was shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird,</b> representing the messenger of air, and that the chin was shaped like a triangle, again conveying esoteric meanings. Below this were twin serpents, one representing positive forces and the other negative.|$|E
500|$|... "Fly Like a Bird" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, first released on February 13, 2006 by Island Records as the sixth single from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Written and produced by Carey and James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright, the song is influenced by Gospel, soul, and R music genres. Its arrangement is built on piano chords and guitar melodies, and features Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton, who recites two Biblical verses during the song's introduction and bridge. Carey described [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] as the most personal and religious track from The Emancipation of Mimi, with its lyrics featuring a veritable prayer to God: [...] "Fly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird,</b> take to the sky, I need you now Lord, carry me high!".|$|E
500|$|The buoyant song has lyrics like [...] "I like to singy, singy, singy, <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> on a wingy, wingy, wingy", as {{electronic}} keyboard riffs and dance beats swirl the whole composition. Lyrically, [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] deals with {{love at first}} sight ("You're the one that I've been waiting for / I don't even know your name") and according to O'Brien, is [...] "an abstract world of nonsense lyrics, disco balls and glitz". It also talks about being in a trance and comparison with various cosmic phenomena in lines like [...] "Cosmic systems in a twine, astral bodies drip like wine", but ultimately returns to the subject of dance. Remixes were commissioned by Warner Bros. Records in April 2001, featuring mixes by DJ Peter Rauhofer, who transformed the track from techno to progressive house.|$|E

500|$|Sonic the Hedgehog {{creator and}} project {{director}} Ohshima created {{the character of}} Nights based on his inspirations from travelling around Europe and western Asia. He eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the main character of the game should resemble an angel and fly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b> Naka originally intended to make Nights into Dreams a slow-paced game, but as development progressed the gameplay pace gradually increased, in similar vein to Sonic the Hedgehog titles. The initial concept of the game featured the flying character in a rendered 2D sprite art, with side-scrolling features similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. The team were at first hesitant to switch the game from 2D to 3D, as Naka was sceptical that appealing characters could be created with polygons, in contrast to traditional pixel art sprites, which Sonic Team's designers found [...] "more expressive". According to Izuka, the game design and story took two years to finalise.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} social mammals, the calls reveal the sex and {{identity}} of the individual. [...] Dialects have also been detected between communities. [...] The male trill call, part of the male mating display, is much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> song {{in terms of its}} ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables, ranging between 13 and 35kHz in pitch and lasting 0.3 to 0.9seconds, repeating up to 1.5 times per minute. [...] Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities, and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within that theme. [...] These calls are not genetically programmed. [...] During play, young males produce early attempts at the trill call, which show high degrees of variability. [...] Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those of their neighbors, when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood. [...] This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being one}} of Davis' lesser-known records, Agharta belonged to a period in his career that {{influenced}} artists in British jazz, new wave, and punk rock, including guitarists Robert Quine and Tom Verlaine. It inspired a generation of musicians to focus on cathartic playing rather than precise instrumentation and composition. Quine was particularly fascinated by Cosey's electric guitar sounds; Bangs, who attended Quine's performance with the Voidoids in 1977, claimed [...] "he steals from Agharta! And makes it work!" [...] Other writers later lauded the quality and originality of Cosey's playing on the album, viewing it as a standard for guitar mastery and contrast. Down Beat critic Bill Milkowski credited his excursive style for [...] "spawning an entire school of 'sick' guitar playing" [...] and said the combination of Fortune's acerbic sax lines atop Foster, Henderson, and Lucas' syncopated grooves were 10 years ahead of Steve Coleman and Greg Osby's M-Base experiments. Tingen found Cosey's solos amazingly revealing and ahead of their time when heard decades later: [...] "Sometimes growling, scurrying around all corners like a caged tiger, sometimes soaring <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird,</b> sometimes deliriously abstract, sometimes elegantly melodic and tender, his electric guitar concept {{is one of the}} most original to have been devised on the instrument." [...] In Christgau's opinion, the noises he produced on the first track's second half [...] "comprise some of the greatest free improvisations ever heard in a 'jazz'-'rock' context." ...|$|E

500|$|Alongside Aladdins {{other main}} characters, Jasmine embodies the film's {{central theme of}} longing for freedom from some form of {{confinement}} or oppression. Both the film and its characters are influenced by Jasmine's [...] "power of choice". The character's desire for both freedom {{and a sense of}} agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations; the sole decision Jasmine maintains complete agency over during the entire film is who she falls in love with – aided by the Genie's refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love – although not who she marries. Although Jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond the confines of her palace, she only gets as far as the marketplace before returning home. Jasmine explores [...] "the idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can make you more vulnerable, not less", as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into the marketplace for first time. In the film, Jasmine releases a flock of birds from their cage, which serves as a metaphor for her own situation, being [...] "caged from a world she has never seen and yearns to be released." [...] Jasmine's bedroom is also shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> cage to represent her own confinement. Jasmine's story also explores themes such as civil rights, racial tolerance, social hierarchy, and Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|$|E
