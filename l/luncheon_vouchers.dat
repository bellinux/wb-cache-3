5000|$|A <b>luncheon</b> <b>voucher</b> (LV) is a {{paper ticket}} (voucher) {{used by some}} {{employees}} in the United Kingdom to pay for meals in private restaurants. It allows companies to subsidise midday meals (luncheons) for their employees without having to run their own canteens.|$|R
50|$|A meal <b>voucher</b> or <b>luncheon</b> <b>voucher</b> is {{a voucher}} {{for a meal}} given to {{employees}} as an employee benefit, allowing them to eat at outside restaurants, typically for lunch. In many countries, meal vouchers have had favorable tax treatment. Vouchers are typically {{in the form of}} paper tickets.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by the {{original}} <b>Luncheon</b> <b>Voucher,</b> a concept launched in the United Kingdom in 1954, Jacques Borel created Ticket Restaurant on the French market in 1962. A French government decree, passed in 1967, officially recognized the meal voucher as an employee benefit. The concept was launched outside France starting in 1976.|$|R

50|$|When {{there is}} a {{conflict}} between a Princess' work and school classes, absence from class or leaving early {{can be considered as}} a school vacation, and the absence will not show up on his attendance record. Every month the Princesses receive thirty school <b>luncheon</b> <b>vouchers</b> each. Therefore, when they eat at school, {{they do not have to}} pay. All necessary school supplies (notebooks, school apparel, etc.) are covered by the Princess budget, which is the largest in the whole school. Also, the Princesses will receive partial profit they can use as pocket money from the photography club that takes pictures of the Princesses and sells them to other students. The school rules require the photography club to share profits with whoever serves as model for the photos they sell, and the photographs of the Princesses are the most sought-after.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} days, {{a company that}} wanted to subsidise their staff lunches, but not run a canteen, had to have {{vouchers}} printed and make arrangements {{with one or more}} local restaurants to accept them. In addition, it would have to administer the scheme (for instance by checking and counting the vouchers returned from the restaurants prior to settling their account). In 1954, a businessman, John Hack, realised that a single standardised voucher acceptable across the UK would be more logical and efficient. He subsequently started the <b>Luncheon</b> <b>Vouchers</b> Company in 1955 to implement the nationwide Luncheon Voucher scheme. In 1956, nine large catering companies purchased the company, with Hack staying on as managing director. The company was bought by Accor in 1982. Restaurants that accept the vouchers display an [...] "LV" [...] logo in their windows.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the comparative analysis of means of enhancing productivity among construction workers {{with emphasis on}} financial and non financial incentives. The {{data were collected from}} respondent on 15 construction sites, which form nucleus of a stratified population chosen for the research. The questionnaire was designed using Likert rating scale on scale 1 to 4 and seventy questionnaire distributed, while the data were analyzed with the aid of mean item score, spearman correlation coefficient method, cross tabulation analysis was conducted on the incentives and work variables to determine relationship pattern. Also, Chi square analysis and product moment correlation was carried out to validate the existing relationship between incentives and productivity index. This study presents systematic approach through which available means of enhancing workers motivation in construction firms could be identified from the perspective of incentives with particular bias for financial and non-financial incentives. The study concluded with financial incentives like transport allowance, hospital allowance, cash awards, overtime-with-pay and accident insurance being found prevalent in the foreign firms while less of these are engaged at indigenous firms. Availability of <b>Luncheon</b> <b>voucher,</b> transport allowance and vehicle loan that are of financial incentive cadre was recorded at foreign firms relative to transport allowance, overtime-withpay and piece-rate among indigenous firms. Certain of the non-financial incentives could however be combined to reinforce the effect of financial based incentives, this tends to nullify the dis-satisfier factors that impedes productivity. To this end however, non-financial incentives the likes of: social security, conducive, accident free work environment, involvement in decision making and prompt payment of wages could be a potential high productivity inducer, if well administered and managed. This was based on the respondent’s preference for the administration of non-financial incentives. The presence of these as garnered from the respondent’s response accounts for the wide margin between foreign firms and indigenous firm’s productivit...|$|R
5000|$|Payne {{first came}} to {{national}} attention in 1978 when police raided her home and found a sex party was in progress. Men paid with <b>luncheon</b> <b>vouchers</b> to dress up in lingerie and be spanked by young women. Police found 53 men at her residence, in varying levels of undress, which included [...] "a peer of the realm, an MP, a number of solicitors and company directors and several vicars". A cartoon in the press at the time, according to Sarah Baxter in The Sunday Times, [...] "showed a vicar {{in bed with a}} prostitute, confronted by a policeman. 'I demand to see my solicitor,' said the vicar, 'who is in the next bedroom.'" [...] When the case came to trial in 1980, she was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, reduced to a fine and six months on appeal. She served four months in Holloway prison.|$|E
50|$|The scheme {{dates to}} 1946, when food {{rationing}} {{was still in}} force {{following the end of}} the war. The British government granted an extra-statutory tax concession, believing that this would help citizens afford healthy meals. Under the concession, <b>luncheon</b> <b>vouchers</b> are free of income tax and national insurance contributions up to the value of 3 shillings (15 pence) a day. The initial level of 2s. 3d. (11.25p) was increased in 1948 to its current level of 3/- (15p), but has not been adjusted for inflation since. The UK government announced in March 2011 its intention to abolish this relief with effect from April 2013, although this was subject to independent advice from the Office of Tax Simplification following wider consultation. The abolition of the concession, effective from 6 April 2013, was confirmed in December 2011, with the government maintaining its view that the relief was redundant given that it is worth only 15p per day.|$|E
50|$|Ten {{years after}} Crosfield's {{frustrated}} attempt {{to design a}} cheque sorting machine, the Scottish banks came to Crosfield {{and asked him to}} build a banknote sorting machine. The American equipment then used for cheque sorting could not handle the soft, light paper of used, sometimes sticky banknotes. In 1959, Crosfield set up a team of engineers at Fortress Road, London, and in 1964 they produced the first banknote sorting machines for the Scottish banks. He used optical character recognition and a new patented process for handling small, flimsy pieces of paper, called the 'Double curvature sheet feeder'. The banknote sorter was followed by machines for sorting and reading <b>luncheon</b> <b>vouchers,</b> postal orders and lottery tickets and for counting and dispensing banknotes. In 1966 Crosfield spun this new division off as Crosfield Business Machines, with its own management, offices, production and research in Watford. New equipment, built first for Nord West Lotto in Germany, coupled to small computers automatically printed out a list of prize winners and the weekly profit and tax liability for the lottery. Simultaneously a high-speed camera made a microfilm of the coupons as a security check. A few machines replaced hundreds of production staff. Another development, a sorting machine and 'garbler', first installed for the Dutch Central Bank, sorted good used banknotes from bad and bundled the good while shredding the bad, a task that formerly required a staff of thousands.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{transportation}} poses difficult dilemmas {{for social and}} environmental policy. There is broad agreement {{that a variety of}} 'carrot' and 'stick' measures are needed. This article asks whether tax-free travel vouchers for employees could be important as incentives or 'carrots' to encourage the use of public transport. The basic idea of it is like <b>Luncheon</b> <b>Vouchers</b> for public transport. Employers issue the vouchers and claim the tax back from the Government. Potentially, travel vouchers could generate a 'win-win' situation in which transport operators' rising revenues justified new services and these, in turn, encouraged more passengers. The research described here uses survey data and the National Travel Survey to examine acceptability and potential fiscal impact of a rural tax-free travel voucher scheme throughout the UK. These results show that there is sufficient acceptance of the idea of travel vouchers in rural areas to justify the further development of this policy. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT ” Accounting {{represent}} a privilege {{source of information}} for the fiscal bodies, the majority of fiscal obligations are being established {{on the basis of}} accounting data. There is interdependency between accounting and taxation, which is defining in the fiscal management of the enterprise. The accountancy is an element intended for obtaining pure and objective information, and therefore the intervention of taxation in accounting procedures is unacceptable. But accounting isn't perfect and therefore the fiscal body proposes itself t, as a user of the same information, to interpret them according to own interests. The employers can allow an individual allowance for food as a luncheon voucher. Through the collective working contracts there are established stipulations regarding the individual allowance of food which foresee: •the number of the employees from the unit that can receive monthly luncheon voucher and the nominal value of the luncheon voucher according to the financial possibilities of the employer; •the number of the monthly working days for which there are distributed <b>luncheon</b> <b>vouchers</b> to the employees; •The selection criteria regarding the employees that will receive luncheon voucher...|$|E
