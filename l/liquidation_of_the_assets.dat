5000|$|The third-most common {{method of}} {{estimating}} {{the value of a}} company looks to the assets and liabilities of the business. At a minimum, a solvent company could shut down operations, sell off the assets, and pay the creditors. Any cash that would remain establishes a floor value for the company. This method is known as the net asset value or cost method. In general the discounted cash flows of a well-performing company exceed this floor value. Some companies, however, are worth more [...] "dead than alive", like weakly performing companies that own many tangible assets. This method {{can also be used to}} value heterogeneous portfolios of investments, as well as nonprofits, for which discounted cash flow analysis is not relevant.

40|$|The {{methods of}} solving the debtor' s {{insolvency}} using the "sanitation" principle It has been 5 years since the Czech Insolvency Act was enacted. Therefore {{is it a good}} opportunity to summarize {{the pros and cons of}} the current situation in this branch of law. The Insolvency Act introduced the concept of two approaches to dealing with the debtor' s insolvency which are new in the Czech legal system: the restructuring and the discharge. Both of them share the "sanitation" principle which enables the debtor to continue their existence after having adopted certain measures. The thesis consists of five major chapters. First section provides the basic explanation of the concept of insolvency and the reasons for the special treatment for the bankruptcy of those who have more creditors. There is also a brief description of the insolvency' s procedure. The second chapter deals with the restructuring, which is the method {{of solving the}} insolvency of big companies (entrepreneurs). The third chapter focuses on discharge which is intended for those who are not engaged in business activities (non-entrepreneurs) and which enables them to get rid of their debts. The discharge can be performed in two modes: either by the <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> or through the performance of the payment calendar. The chapter four and [...] ...|$|E

The second folder contains a few items of correspondence with the United Restitution Organization regarding the Saenger family's claims. In the following folder is correspondence regarding Lotte Saenger's attempts to find out the fate of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Adolf Manheim of Liegnitz (Legnica). Finally, the firm M. Poppelauer's handwritten custom address book is in the last folder. Inserted into the book are several calling cards and some items of correspondence, some of which date to the early 20 th century. Erwin Saenger was born on May 4, 1907, and died on October 18, 1979. He was the son of Jacob Saenger and grandson of Moritz Poppelauer, founder of Verlagshaus M. Poppelauer. He was married to Lotte Saenger nee Mannheim of Liegnitz whose parents Adolf and Else Mannheim perished in the war. Erwin Saenger's mother was deported and died in Theresienstadt in 1942.

40|$|Many {{bankruptcy}} codes implicitly or explicitly contain net-worth covenants, {{which provide}} the firm’s bondholders {{with the right}} to force reorganization or <b>liquidation</b> if <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm falls below a certain threshold.

To consider <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> this on <b>the</b> valuation <b>of</b> corporate securities, we develop a model in which liquidation is driven by a state variable that accumulates with time and severity of distress.

40|$|This note {{provides}} an example of an optimal banking panic. We construct a model in which a banking panic is triggered by the banker, not the depositors.

In <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> this <b>liquidation,</b> all depositors withdraw their funds prematurely. <b>The</b> premature <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank’s <b>assets</b> strengthens <b>the</b> bank’s balance sheet.

40|$|How {{important}} are collateral constraints for the propagation and amplification of shocks? To address this question, we analyze a stochastic general equilibrium version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model by Kiyotaki and Moore (JPE, 1997) {{in which all}} agents face concave production and utility functions and are generally identical, except for the subjective discount factor. We document that <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> costly debt enforcement {{plays an important role}} in the endogenous amplification generated by the model. Limiting <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> borrowing up to a reasonable fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collateral <b>asset,</b> makes <b>the</b> amplification generated by collateral constraints sizable and significantly larger than what we observe either in the representative agent version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model, or in <b>the</b> version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model where inefficiencies in <b>the</b> <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collateralized <b>asset</b> are neglected. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonrecourse financing <b>of</b> securitization by {{a financial}} institution (FI).

However, our model also predicts that <b>the</b> nonrecourse financing <b>of</b> securitization, together with short-term maturity financing, forces the financial system to perform inefficiently in handling troubled loans and causes problems with inefficient liquidity support and overinvestment under certain conditions, despite <b>the</b> nonrecourse property <b>of</b> securitization. <b>The</b> theoretical results provide empirical implications for recent problems with securitized and structured finance in the United States and Europe...|$|R
40|$|I {{develop a}} {{framework}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> build-up and outbreak of financial crises in an asymmetric information setting. In equilibrium, two distinct economic states arise endogenously: normal times — periods of modest investment, and booms — periods of expansionary investment. Normal times {{occur when the}} intermediary sector realizes moderate investment opportunities. Booms occur when the intermediary sector realizes many investment opportunities, but also occur when it realizes very few opportunities. As a result, investors face greater uncertainty in booms. During a boom, subsequent arrival of negative information about an intermediary asset results in large downward shifts in investors’ confidence about <b>the</b> underlying quality <b>of</b> long-term assets. A crisis of confidence ensues. Investors collectively force costly early <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediated <b>assets</b> and move capital to safe assets, in a flight-to-quality episode. ...|$|R
