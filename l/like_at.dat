5|$|Former guitarist Scott Danough {{has said}} that he is {{influenced}} by metal and hardcore bands, <b>like</b> <b>At</b> The Gates, Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Integrity and Earth Crisis. Vocalist Brandan Schieppati has also mentioned American thrash metal bands as an influence on Bleeding Through, e.g. Testament or Exodus. In an interview, guitarist Brian Leppke added Cro-Mags, Entombed, Crowbar and Pantera as well to the list of influences. Lastly, keyboardist Marta Peterson is the one who brings industrial, symphonic black metal, and goth inspirations to the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|The single {{received}} a mixed reception from music critics who highlighted her genre combinations but downplayed the lyrics. A music video was not {{created for the}} single, but the singer performed it live on several occasions, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> the Heaven nightclub in London in February 2012. The performance was compared to ones by both Rihanna and Robyn.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look <b>like.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road {{on that side of the}} ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E

25|$|Current BSD {{operating}} system variants support {{many of the}} common IEEE, ANSI, ISO, and POSIX standards, while retaining most of the traditional BSD behavior. <b>Like</b> <b>AT</b> Unix, the BSD kernel is monolithic, meaning that device drivers in the kernel run in privileged mode, {{as part of the}} core of the {{operating system}}.|$|E

25|$|Only two concept {{vehicles}} were displayed at motor shows {{prior to the}} unveiling of the production model. The first concept was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001, to preview what a 21st-century GT-R would look <b>like.</b> <b>At</b> the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show, Nissan unveiled a redesigned concept, the GT-R Proto, stating that the production GT-R would be 80–90% based on this concept.|$|E
25|$|In {{relativistic}} mechanics, {{the momentum}} vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector {{is a time}} component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector (x,t). In exploring {{the properties of the}} spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig.3‑8a, by examining what a particle looks <b>like</b> <b>at</b> rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. p=0, but the time component equals mc.|$|E
25|$|This {{brought in}} Michael Clarke {{who had been}} recuperating at the team hotel after {{damaging}} {{his back on the}} first day. Due to this injury, Clarke needed Hayden to act as a runner. Warne made inroads with the bat, just <b>like</b> <b>at</b> Edgbaston four days previously, but Clarke only managed to add seven runs before being deceived by a slower ball from Simon Jones. Warne and Jason Gillespie saw the day out with Warne finishing on 45 not out.|$|E

25|$|The state {{includes}} two natural {{regions of the}} United States: the Central Lowlands and the Interior Low Plateaus. The till plains make up the northern and central regions of Indiana. Much of its appearance {{is a result of}} elements left behind by glaciers. Central Indiana is mainly flat with some low rolling hills (except where rivers cut deep valleys through the plain, <b>like</b> <b>at</b> the Wabash River and Sugar Creek) and soil composed of glacial sands, gravel and clay, which results in exceptional farmland. Northern Indiana is similar, except for the presence of higher and hillier terminal moraines and hundreds of kettle lakes.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the quality}} of the signal channel is also critical. A channel {{emulator}} can simulate how a device performs at the cell edge, can add noise or can simulate what the channel looks <b>like</b> <b>at</b> speed. To fully qualify the performance of a receiver, a calibrated transmitter, such as a vector signal generator (VSG), and channel emulator can be used to test the receiver under a variety of different conditions. Conversely, the transmitter's performance under a number of different conditions can be verified using a channel emulator and a calibrated receiver, such as a vector signal analyzer (VSA).|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who work}} at night and attempt to sleep during the day suffer because {{the timing of the}}ir sleep/wake {{schedule}} remains out of phase with the timing of the environmental light. Night workers are particularly prone to vehicle accidents, and their decreased alertness, performance, and vigilance are likely to blame for a higher rate of industrial accidents and quality control errors on the job, injuries and a general decline in work productivity rate. Recent information also suggests that as the body normally releases melatonin when it is dark, working under artificial <b>like</b> <b>at</b> night suppresses the released of melatonin, which may increase the risk of developing cancer.|$|E
