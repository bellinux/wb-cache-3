The ship {{was turned over to}} the War Department in 1919for use as Army transport USAT Orizaba. After her World War I service ended, Orizaba reverted to the Ward Line, her previous owners. The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the ship was chartered to United States Lines. While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service, American poet Hart Crane <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> his death from the rear deck of the liner off Florida in April 1932.|$|E

25|$|Notable {{incidents}} with damaged ice piers at McMurdo Station {{include an}} event 10 years earlier. The ice pier {{had been in}} use four seasons in 1983 when the freighter USNS Southern Cross docked at Winter Quarters Bay. Operation Deep Freeze officials pressed the pier into extended service {{in order for the}} freighter to make an unprecedented two supply runs in one season from Port Lyttelton, New Zealand, to McMurdo. However, efforts to extend the ice pier’s lifespan resulted in a cargo truck breaking through the ice. The driver of the truck standing atop the container <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> safety, receiving minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|Board {{began the}} 1968 season {{by winning the}} 440 yard race at an inter-club meeting in Brighton, her time of 54.8 comfortably inside the Olympic {{qualifying}} standard. She then <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} world rankings after winning over 400 m (53.5) at an international meeting in Moscow. However, at the Women's AAA championships in July, she spurned the chance of an almost certain victory in the 400 m and instead decided to contest the 800 metres. After winning her heat (2.05.7), she showed her huge potential in this event by running a superb 2:02.0 (the second fastest ever by a British woman), to finish 2nd to the reigning European 800 m champion, Vera Nikolic of Yugoslavia, whose time of 2:00.5 was a new world record.|$|E

25|$|In the men's series, {{the medals}} were {{expected}} to be taken from a combination of Alistair Brownlee, Jonny Brownlee and Javier Gómez. Alistair <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> the top of the standings after Lausanne, allowing his only non podium finish of the year, 29th in Sydney, to drop off, and now leading his brother and Gómez into the final round. The top three points look like this going into the final round: Alistair is on 3085 points, Jonathan with 2965 points, and Gómez with 2858 points. Fourth place man Alexander Brukhankov remained a threat to the podium with 2699 points. David Hauss was also still a candidate for the podium, sitting in fifth place going into Beijing on 2405 points. In Beijing, 1200 points were on offer to the winner, with 1100 to second and 1027 to third, where the 2011 World Champions will be crowned.|$|E
25|$|Helped {{in part by}} a newly inked {{distribution}} {{agreement between}} Word and A that would give Petra and other Word-distributed bands placement in mainstream music stores for the first time, Beat the System sold more than 200,000 copies in four months, {{and by the end of}} the year, Billboard had certified Petra as the biggest-selling gospel music group in the country. When it debuted at No.18 on the Billboard Top 40 Inspirational LPs chart in February 1985, Beat the System trailed both Not of This World (No.6 in its 56th week on the chart) and More Power to Ya (No.15 in week 115). Not for long: It <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> No.4 on the next chart, giving Petra two top 10 albums for the first time, and by June it had taken over the top spot on the chart, which it held for more than two months. In the end, Beat the System was one of the nation's top two Christian albums for nearly half a year.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1971 season, Butkus {{underwent}} preventive {{surgery on}} his right knee; he had torn ligaments in high school, but was able to continuing playing due to strong muscles compensating for the injury. In 1971, he recorded 117 tackles and four interceptions, leading the Bears in both statistics. He also scored a single point; in the closing minutes of {{a game against the}} Washington Redskins on November 14, the score was tied at 15 and the Bears had lined up to kick an extra point. The snap went over holder Bobby Douglass' head, who then raced back to retrieve the ball and looked to pass it. Butkus, who was playing as a blocking back, ran into the end zone and <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> receive the pass for the winning score. Butkus later called the play his favorite of his career. Despite the statistical output, {{for the first time since}} 1966 Butkus was not named to a major All-Pro first team, instead earning second-team honors from the NEA and Pro Football Writers Association.|$|E

25|$|Perón's {{planning}} prominently included political considerations. Numerous military {{allies were}} fielded as candidates, notably Colonel Domingo Mercante who, when elected Governor of the paramount Province of Buenos Aires, became renowned for his housing program. Having {{brought him to}} power, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) was given overwhelming support by the new administration, which introduced labour courts and filled its cabinet with labor union appointees, such as Juan Atilio Bramuglia (Foreign Ministry) and Ángel Borlenghi (Interior Ministry, which, in Argentina, oversees law enforcement). It also made room for amenable wealthy industrialists (Central Bank President Miguel Miranda) and socialists such as José Figuerola, a Spanish economist who had years earlier advised that nation's ill-fated regime of Miguel Primo de Rivera. Intervention of their behalf by Perón's appointees encouraged the CGT to call strikes {{in the face of}} employers reluctant to grant benefits or honor new labor legislation. Strike activity (with 500,000 working days lost in 1945) <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> 2 million in 1946 and to over 3million in 1947, helping wrest needed labor reforms, though permanently aligning large employers against the Peronists. Labor unions grew in ranks from around 500,000 to over 2million by 1950, primarily in the CGT, which has since been Argentina's paramount labor union. As the country's labor force numbered around 5million people at the time, Argentina's labor force was the most unionized in South America.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E
25|$|After a sixth-minute penalty to the Dragons {{helped them}} up into good field position, Jamie Soward from the ten-metre line kicked {{the ball over}} into the Roosters' in-goal and Mark Gasnier, racing through from the right side, <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> catch it on the full and put it down just inside the dead ball line. The video referee Bill Harrigan awarded the try and Soward's {{conversion}} was successful, so St. George Illawarra were leading 6-0 after eight minutes. However, video replays showed that in the lead up to the try, Dragons winger Brett Morris had passed the ball with a foot outside the touch-line so play {{should not have been}} allowed to continue. Later, in the sixteenth minute, the Roosters had made their way up into better field position when Todd Carney, twenty metres from the opposition try-line's right side, kicked high to the left corner. His winger Joseph Leilua caught the ball, crashed over the try-line, and while attempting to put it down had it knocked from his outstretched hand by Jamie Soward's knee, but Roosters captain Braith Anasta was there to ground it. The video referee was again called upon to award the try, and with Carney's kick going wide the score was 6-4 in favour of the Red & Whites. Less than two minutes after the restart of play St. George Illawarra knocked on in their own half and the Tricolours, after getting within fifteen metres of the try-line, moved the ball through the hands from {{the left side of the}} field to the right where Mitchell Aubusson crashed over near the corner. Carney again missed the conversion but his side was now in the lead 8-6 with a quarter of the match gone. In the twenty-sixth minute the Dragons were awarded a penalty in a goal-kicking position but Soward missed. At the thirty-minute mark St. George Illawarra prop Michael Weyman was helped off the field after getting a swinging arm to the head from Daniel Conn which was placed on report. The third quarter of the match was played in both ends of the ground with neither side able to turn their opportunities into points, so the teams left the field with the Sydney Roosters leading 6-8.|$|E

[...] In the sixth inning, Mets left fielder Endy Chávez had prevented the Cardinals from taking the lead when he <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> catch Scott Rolen's near-miss home run over the center field fence. [...] This time, however, Molina hit a two-run home run off Aaron Heilman over center field that was too high for Chávez to catch and gave the Cardinals a 3–1 edge.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Orizaba’s typical route had {{remained}} virtually the same, though Nassau and Tampico were dropped as ports of call. It {{was in this}} period that American poet Hart Crane <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> his death from Orizaba. At around noon on 27 April 1932, while the ship was headed to New York—some [...] north of Havana and [...] off the Florida coast—Crane, clad in pajamas and overcoat, climbed the rail at {{the stern of the}} ship and plunged into the ocean. The captain of Orizaba immediately stopped the ship and launched four lifeboats that searched in vain for two hours, but no trace of the poet was ever found. Before he jumped, Crane had been drinking and, the night before, had been the victim of homophobic violence after a pick-up attempt of a crewman ended with a severe beating.|$|E

Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Suffolk, {{the son of}} a dentist, Britten showed talent from {{an early}} age. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London and privately with the {{composer}} Frank Bridge. Britten first came to public attention with the a cappella choral work A Boy was Born in 1934. With the premiere of Peter Grimes in 1945, he <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden, he wrote [...] "chamber operas" [...] for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is The Turn of the Screw (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Tittle and {{receiver}} R. C. Owens devised a pass play in which Tittle tossed the ball {{high into the}} air and the [...] Owens <b>leapt</b> <b>to</b> retrieve it, typically resulting in a long gain or a touchdown. Tittle dubbed the play the [...] "alley-oop"—the first usage of the term in sports—and it was highly successful when utilized. The 49ers finished the regular season with an 8–4 record and hosted the Detroit Lions in the Western Conference playoff. Against the Lions Tittle passed for 248 yards and tossed three touchdown passes—one each to Owens, McElhenny, and Wilson—but Detroit overcame a twenty-point third quarter deficit to win 31–27. For the season, Tittle had a league-leading 63.1 completion percentage, threw for 2,157 yards and thirteen touchdowns, and rushed for six more scores. He was deemed [...] "pro player of the year" [...] by a United Press poll of members of the National Football Writers Association. Additionally, he was named to his first All-Pro team and invited to his third Pro Bowl.|$|E
