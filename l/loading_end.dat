40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the non-contact buckling response of long rectangular plates subjected to compressive or shearing loadings is {{solely dependent on}} material and section properties, as well as boundary conditions along the two unloaded side edges. In addition, the boundary conditions at the <b>loaded</b> <b>ends</b> do not influence the critical load. The above rule was also applied to the analysis and design of plates in unilateral contact with elastic or rigid mediums although without any reasonable verification. The results contained in this paper reveal that the boundary condition at the <b>loaded</b> edges (<b>end</b> conditions) significantly affects the contact buckling performance. To investigate the end condition effect, a transfer function method is employed herein to study the initial buckling behaviour of thin plates with different boundary conditions resting on tensionless elastic or rigid foundations. For very long plates with both ends clamped, the buckling mode {{can be considered as}} a series of periodically repeating buckling waves and an infinite plate model with only one buckle wave being effective to predict the buckling behaviour. However, for long plates with simply supported <b>loaded</b> <b>ends,</b> local effects dominate the buckling mode and the buckling loads can be reduced by up to 18 % compared to long plates with clamped <b>loaded</b> <b>ends.</b> Experimental tests and ABAQUS modelling also verify that the critical stresses for plates with simply supported <b>loaded</b> <b>ends</b> are lower than those for plates with clamped <b>loaded</b> <b>ended</b> plates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the spatial behaviour ofthe steady state and transient elastic processes in an anisotropic elastic body subject to nonzero boundary conditions {{only on a}} plane nd. For the transient elastic processes, it is shown that at distance x 3 > ct from the <b>loaded</b> <b>end,</b> (c is a positive computable constant and t is the time), all the activity in the body vanishes. For x 3 < ct, an appropriate measure of the elastic process decays with {{the distance from the}} <b>loaded</b> <b>end,</b> the decay rate of end effects being controlled by the factor (1 - ~). Next, it is shown that for isotropic materials, inthe case of a steady state vibration, an analogue of the Phragm 6 n-LindelOf principle holds for an appropriate cross-sectional measure. One immediate consequence is that in the class of steady state vibrations for which a quasi-energy volume measure is bounded, this measure decays at least algebraically with the distance from the <b>loaded</b> <b>end...</b>|$|R

Based on the analysis of measured rebar strain, the distribution function of bond stress performed in cubic smooth spline was established. The distribution of bond stress and relative slip in bonded segment was obtained under the action of load at each stage, {{and the effects of}} steel fibre and concrete strength on bond properties were further analyzed. The results indicate that with the increasing of volume fraction of steel fibers and concrete strength, the bond stress of bonding specimens next to <b>loaded</b> <b>end</b> is improved and the ultimate bond stress moves to <b>loaded</b> <b>end</b> in general. Meanwhile, the slip at <b>loaded</b> <b>end</b> and free end were reduced. Finally, the bond-slip constitutive model reflecting the interaction process of rebar and SFRC was proposed...|$|R

40|$|Layered strata {{occurrence}} {{is frequently}} seen in underground constructions, the man-made excavation is thus easy to cause separation between neighboring strata. The sudden and unexpected occurrence of separation will induce significant shock wave and vibration to relative bolting system that initially holds the normal working space for underground production. The bolting system is extremely sensitive to this shock and is easily weakened or damaged. By examining {{the locations of}} strata separation {{and the extent of}} damage along an anchoring interface, this paper investigates the factors that influence the support strength of anchoring system. The results show that the support strength of a bolt is independent of the separation location if the resin-rock interface is intact. The opposite is the case if the separation width between the neighboring strata exceeds the ultimate critical value, which induces damage along the interface. In this case, the support strength increases exponentially as the separation increases. Separation at the free <b>loading</b> <b>end</b> dramatically decreases the support strength. However, this decrease is mitigated if the separation is located {{in the middle of the}} anchoring body or at the <b>loading</b> <b>end.</b> These results are then calibrated and verified in a laboratory test...|$|E

When curing temperature was less than 50  °C, the ultimate load increased gradually, which was increased by 47.2 % from 35 to 50  °C. When curing temperature exceeded 50  °C, the ultimate load decreased gradually, which was reduced by 5 % from 50 to 65  °C.

The interlaminar shear stress is com-posed of static and dynamic parts and the peak interlaminar shear stress, which occurs at the <b>loading</b> <b>end</b> under the step uniform pressure loading, {{is dominated by the}} static stress and is dependent on the stiffness ratio between the centre and the outer plies.

The edge of the FRP sheets was sufficiently far from the test region to eliminate the influence from local stress concentrations associated to uneven distribution of the applied load. Additionally, the initial region on the <b>loading</b> <b>end</b> of FRP sheet lying over the concrete block was left un-bonded to prevent corner spalling of the concrete blocks and to avoid a sudden load reduction on the FRP sheet during testing. The length of the leading un-bonded region varied in each specimen but was equal to 127  mm in most of the specimens. An un-bonded distance equal to the sheet width of 127  mm was deemed sufficient.|$|E

30|$|The {{superposition}} of {{the longitudinal}} shear {{capacity of the}} shear connector and natural bonding function provide longitudinal shear resistance of composite members, but they are relatively independent. However, considering the superposition effect of the two should depend on the shear connectors because the natural bonding function between cold-formed thin-walled C steel and foam concrete is not changed by shear connectors. The main influence factor is the buried depth of shear connector. For instance, when the shear connector buried depth is too small and near to the <b>loading</b> <b>end,</b> it will be premature to reach the ultimate shear capacity. That means the failure of shear connectors shall occur in the increasing segment of natural bond-slip. Otherwise the shear connectors will fail in the descending phase of natural bond-slip. Therefore, the maximum value will happen on the situation that the two peaks overlap. It’s best to make the self-drilling screws are being cut off as the same displacement as the peak force of natural bond.|$|E

The strain of CFRP strip, interfacial bonding shear stress, ultimate load and failure mode were analyzed through the test. The experiment results showed that the ultimate load and bonding shear stress of the specimens increased gradually when curing temperature was lower than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the bond material. Afterward, they gradually decreased with the increase in temperature. The bonding shear stress was gradually transmitted from the <b>loading</b> <b>end</b> to the free end.
