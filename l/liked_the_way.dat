25|$|Coppola hired Michael Smuin, a {{choreographer}} and {{co-director of}} the San Francisco Ballet, to stage the fight scene between Rusty James and Biff Wilcox because he <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he choreographed violence. He asked Smuin to include specific visual elements: a motorcycle, broken glass, knives, gushing water and blood. The choreographer spent a week designing the sequence. Smuin also staged the street dance between Rourke and Diana Scarwid, modeling it after one in Picnic featuring William Holden and Kim Novak.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 The Faith {{released}} an eight-song twelve inch EP called Subject to Change. It {{was produced by}} Ian MacKaye and showed the band progressing into more melodic territory {{with the addition of}} a second guitarist. Eddie Janney, formerly of the Untouchables and Ian MacKaye's short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union, joined The Faith at the end of 1982 to play second guitar and made his recorded debut. The addition was made because they wanted to get some more complex guitar ideas into the songs and soften the impact of guitar malfunctions, which were a constant threat during good shows. Not to mention, they just wanted a fuller sound and <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Eddie played.|$|E

As of 2011, she is studying accounting at Universidad Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña. She is known for being quiet, shy and humble.|$|E

500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{features}} greater background interaction {{than the}} original, such as {{levels in the}} dark. Williamson's favourite addition to the game was the sponge in the kitchen, which forced players to time their entry onto and exit from a platform. He also liked the toilet seat track. David Darling initially disliked the physics, stating he <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the first game achieved skids without feeling like a train manoeuvring. It was worked on until it {{was similar to the}} original, and ultimately it worked [...] "perfectly". According to WIlliamson, the team spent [...] "enormous amounts of time" [...] testing the game.|$|E
500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating, with Roger Ebert saying, [...] "I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I {{especially}} <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it introduces {{all of those}} political issues and lets them fight {{it out with the}} special effects." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was [...] "only half a mess", and that Ratner [...] "could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did." [...] However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's [...] "majesty".|$|E

He {{thought it was important}} that viewers see his eating habits, staying true to [...] "representing human beings." [...] However, Quong Tart stated that it sometimes reached a [...] "point where it might not be very pleasant to watch."

500|$|The main {{criticism}} of the game among reviewers is {{the length of the}} game. Eurogamer says that [...] "It's too short", while RPGamer state that [...] "The typical player can fly through the game's six relatively short dungeons in about ten hours". There are also various other complaints from reviewers: IGN claims that the kinstone system is overly repetitive; Nintendo World Report criticises the game's visuals on a Game Boy Player, and RPGamer details the game's low difficulty level as a disadvantage. Despite this, IGN's Craig Harris <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that the ability to become tiny had been incorporated to create fresh puzzles in the Zelda series. He continued to comment that [...] "It's an idea that's so well-conceived that I'd love to see worked in the series' 3D designs somewhere down the line".|$|E
500|$|When {{questioned}} {{about the difficulty}} of finding her album title on search engines such as Google, she noted that she chose to use forward slashes and backward slashes due to their ease at being typed and because she <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the album title looked on music players such as iTunes. She also suggested {{that it was a}} deliberate attempt to avoid detection by internet search engines. The Guardian Sian Rowe commented that M.I.A.'s deliberate [...] "shrinking away from a mainstream audience" [...] by the use of difficult, unsearchable symbols was part of a growing new underground scene perhaps trying to create a [...] "generation gap", where only [...] "the youngest and the most enthusiastic" [...] would seek out such band names by reading the right online sources.|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, after {{viewing the}} first episode, said the series had [...] "an older feeling to it" [...] {{because of the}} rounder {{character}} designs reminiscent of those from the 1980s and 1990s, calling it a [...] "great look" [...] with a [...] "wonderful simplicity" [...] and backgrounds [...] "filled with detail". Beveridge called the animation [...] "solid", and stated that the series had [...] "a whole lot of potential", making him excited to see more. He {{was impressed with the}} way the events of episode one were handled in the second episode, comparing the pacing and style to that of Kimagure Orange Road, which he stated is one of his favorites series. He especially <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the budding romance was shown between Ko and Wakaba back in the elementary school days, and how it affected the current relationship between Ko and Aoba.|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{praised the}} April and Andy {{relationship}} and the subplot with Ron and Mark, although he claimed Ron was the funnier of the duo and Mark's character is too normal and boring for the show. Fowler also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Leslie's political ambition conflicted with her conscience in the episode. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the main plotline with Leslie and the performances by Pratt and Offerman, particularly praising the jokes surrounding Ron's woodworking hobby. Kandell {{pointed out the}} episode did not suffer from Ann's absence and suggested although Rashida Jones is charming, the show does not need her. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club said the episode's main story was [...] "a bit of a trifle" [...] and the subplots were lacking, but that [...] "The Possum" [...] included several laughs and demonstrated Ron and Leslie's opposing attitudes about local government.|$|E
500|$|The {{supporting}} cast includes actors {{known for their}} improv work: Angela Kinsey, Kate Flannery, Oscar Nunez, Leslie David Baker, Brian Baumgartner, Melora Hardin, and David Denman. Kinsey had originally auditioned for Pam. The producers thought she was [...] "too feisty" [...] for the character, but they called her back for the part of Angela Martin, which she won. Flannery first auditioned for the part of Jan Levinson-Gould, before landing the role of Meredith Palmer. Baumgartner originally auditioned for Stanley, but was eventually cast as Kevin. Ken Kwapis, {{the director of the}} pilot episode, <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Phyllis Smith, a casting associate, read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as Phyllis. At the beginning of the third season, Ed Helms and Rashida Jones joined the cast as members of Dunder Mifflin Stamford. While Jones would later leave the cast for a role on Parks and Recreation, in February 2007, NBC announced that Helms was being promoted to a series regular.|$|E
500|$|In early reviews, the art {{and writing}} were praised. Reviewer Ginnis Tonic liked how the series has a {{specific}} focus on non-whites, such as the Hmong and Native Americans {{who live in the}} area. Slate columnist Dan Kois described the series as [...] "grounded in the economic and familial realities of small-town life". Truitt found the mood and themes to be a mix of Elmore Leonard and the Coen brothers. [...] Kois described Norton's art as [...] "wonderfully specific and evocative of the rural Midwest". Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Norton used a variety of body shapes and sizes for the cast and thought Englert's colors added an [...] "edginess" [...] to the story. Tonic found the subtle background details, such as music posters and the cleanliness of bedrooms, added to her understanding of the characters. James Fulton, writing for Inside Pulse, also noted touches like these excited him [...] "like few have in comics in the last few years." ...|$|E

[...] Gallagher said the episode returned to [...] "season one levels of Michael Scott stupidity", and particularly <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Dwight so readily accepted credit once the golden ticket promotion {{proved to be a}} success. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] an A- grade and particularly praised Steve Carell's Willy Wonka impression and the way Michael tried to distance himself after the promotional idea went bad. Rabin said, [...] "Tonight’s episode lacked a certain gravity but it delivered the goods, comedy-wise." [...] He also pointed out that the script was technically illogical in that Michael pretended he did not come up with the golden ticket idea despite the documentary camera crew filming his earlier discussions about it.|$|E
500|$|... "Volcano" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. USA Today critic Matt Roush {{praised the}} episode, especially the [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films. The Advertiser called the episode [...] "outrageously lewd" [...] and [...] "hysterically funny". The Washington Post critic Tom Shales considered the episode funnier than its precedent [...] "Weight Gain 4000". Peter Hawes of The Sunday Star-Times in Auckland, New Zealand, said the episode was funny and intelligent. He {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Once again, the US national psyche is imperishably captured by a crude cartoon." [...] He <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> adults were portrayed as less sensible than the children, and he particularly enjoyed the [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] videos: [...] "It is terrifyingly funny, for it is a word-for-word recreation of the insane Atom-bomb Safety film, created and distributed in 1952 by the US government, who never for a second thought it would work." [...] The Daily Record of Glasgow, Scotland, praised the episode and described it as [...] "hardcore humour": [...] "Love it or loathe it, you can't ignore the adult animation series whose bite is worse than its bark." ...|$|E

Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, {{what do you say to}} a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?" [...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), and she <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it sounded, and included the line at the beginning of the song.
