Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|Falle {{participated in}} a {{diversion}} program that allowed her to return to school. She said that she required {{a lot of support}} in order to fully exit prostitution, and found that support in her mother, her school, and Streetlight Support Services. Falle underwent a month of drug rehabilitation, which convinced her to become a counsellor. She then spent 90 days at the Toronto West Detention Centre and took seven months to finish high school. She went on to graduate from a college and a university. She received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College and graduated with honours. To remove the burns her pimp had inflicted on her, she had <b>laser</b> <b>surgery</b> that cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for <b>laser</b> <b>surgery,</b> including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E

25|$|Instead of <b>laser</b> <b>surgery,</b> {{some people}} require a vitrectomy to restore vision. A vitrectomy is {{performed}} {{when there is}} a lot of blood in the vitreous. It involves removing the cloudy vitreous and replacing it with a saline solution.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{will lose}} some of their {{peripheral}} vision after this surgery {{although it may be}} barely noticeable by the patient. The procedure does however save the center of the patient's sight. <b>Laser</b> <b>surgery</b> may also slightly reduce colour and night vision.|$|E

25|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>surgery</b> {{offers a}} number of benefits, {{including}} reduced risk of infection, less post-operative pain and swelling, reduced bleeding and improved visibility of the surgical field. Better hemostasis and visibility can in some cases minimize the need for anesthesia and/or reduce overall surgical time.|$|E
25|$|While not curable, {{treatment}} usually improves symptoms. Treatment {{is typically}} with metronidazole, doxycycline, or tetracycline. When {{the eyes are}} affected azithromycin eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, ivermectin cream, and isotretinoin. Dermabrasion or <b>laser</b> <b>surgery</b> may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} major {{treatments}} for diabetic retinopathy, {{which are very}} effective in reducing vision loss from this disease. In fact, even people with advanced retinopathy have a 95 percent chance of keeping their vision when they get treatment before the retina is severely damaged. These three treatments are <b>laser</b> <b>surgery,</b> injection of corticosteroids or anti-VEGF agents into the eye, and vitrectomy.|$|E
25|$|By {{equipment}} used: <b>Laser</b> <b>surgery</b> involves {{use of a}} laser {{for cutting}} tissue instead of a scalpel or similar surgical instruments. Microsurgery {{involves the use of}} an operating microscope for the surgeon to see small structures. Robotic surgery makes use of a surgical robot, such as the Da Vinci or the Zeus surgical systems, to control the instrumentation {{under the direction of the}} surgeon.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the terms}} <b>laser</b> eye <b>surgery</b> and {{refractive}} surgery {{are commonly used}} {{as if they were}} interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear). <b>Laser</b> eye <b>surgery</b> or <b>laser</b> corneal <b>surgery</b> is a medical procedure that uses a laser to reshape the surface of the eye. This is done to correct myopia (short-sightedness), hypermetropia (long sightedness) and astigmatism (uneven curvature of the eye's surface). It {{is important to note that}} refractive surgery is not compatible with everyone, and rarely people may find that eyewear is still needed after surgery.|$|R

25|$|Although these {{treatments}} are very successful (in slowing or stopping further vision loss), {{they do not}} cure diabetic retinopathy. Caution should be exercised in treatment with <b>laser</b> <b>surgery</b> since it causes a loss of retinal tissue. It is often more prudent to inject triamcinolone or anti-VEGF drugs. In some patients it results in a marked increase of vision, especially {{if there is an}} edema of the macula.|$|E
25|$|CO2 <b>laser</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{also another}} form of treatment. Transoral laser {{microsurgery}} allows surgeons to remove tumors from the voice box with no external incisions. It also allows access to tumors that are not reachable with robotic surgery. During the surgery, surgeon and pathologist work together to assess the adequacy of excision (“margin status”), minimizing the amount of normal tissue removed or damaged. This technique helps give the person as much speech and swallowing function as possible after surgery.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is {{refractive}} error (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the eyeball. Causes of refractive errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the eyeball, the shape of the cornea, and reduced flexibility of the lens. Too high or too low refractive error (in relation to the length of the eyeball) is the cause of nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal refractive status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are astigmatism or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, <b>laser</b> <b>surgery,</b> etc.).|$|E

25|$|In recent years, the {{advertorial}} emerged. Advertorials {{are most}} commonly {{recognized as an}} opposite-editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, {{a new form of}} <b>laser</b> <b>surgery,</b> or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.|$|E
25|$|If a melanocytic nevus is {{suspected}} of being a melanoma, {{it needs to be}} sampled or removed and sent for microscopic evaluation by a pathologist by a method called skin biopsy. One can do a complete excisional skin biopsy or a punch skin biopsy, depending on the size and location of the original nevus. Other reasons for removal may be cosmetic, or because a raised mole interferes with daily life (e.g. shaving). Removal can be by excisional biopsy or by shaving. A shaved site leaves a red mark on the site which returns to the patient’s usual skin color in about two weeks. However, there might still be a risk of spread of the melanoma, so the methods of Melanoma diagnosis, including excisional biopsy, are still recommended even in these instances. Additionally, moles can be removed by <b>laser,</b> <b>surgery</b> or electrocautery.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "armored" [...] endotracheal {{tubes are}} cuffed, wire-reinforced {{silicone}} rubber tubes.

This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, {{which can be used}} for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in <b>laser</b> <b>surgery</b> in and around the airway.|$|E
