5000|$|For use in more strenuous environments, a {{much more}} robust cable {{construction}} is required. In <b>loose-tube</b> construction the fiber is laid helically into semi-rigid tubes, allowing the cable to stretch without stretching the fiber itself. This protects the fiber from tension during laying and due to temperature changes. <b>Loose-tube</b> fiber may be [...] "dry block" [...] or gel-filled. Dry block offers less protection to the fibers than gel-filled, but costs considerably less. Instead of a loose tube, the fiber may be embedded in a heavy polymer jacket, commonly called [...] "tight buffer" [...] construction. Tight buffer cables are offered {{for a variety of}} applications, but the two most common are [...] "Breakout" [...] and [...] "Distribution". Breakout cables normally contain a ripcord, two non-conductive dielectric strengthening members (normally a glass rod epoxy), an aramid yarn, and 3 mm buffer tubing with an additional layer of Kevlar surrounding each fiber. The ripcord is a parallel cord of strong yarn that is situated under the jacket(s) of the cable for jacket removal. Distribution cables have an overall Kevlar wrapping, a ripcord, and a 900 micrometer buffer coating surrounding each fiber. These fiber units are commonly bundled with additional steel strength members, again with a helical twist to allow for stretching.|$|E
50|$|By 1995, {{several other}} {{companies}} {{had entered the}} wrapped cable market: in Europe, British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC) (in UK) introduced a product called Fibwrap' and Alcatel subsidiary IKO Kabel of Sweden marketed GWWOP under license from Furukawa. In Japan, GWWOP development had become a joint effort involving Sumitomo Electric Industries, Hitachi Cables, Furukawa Electric and Fujikura companies {{and each of the}} 4 companies supplied their own slightly different wrapped cable systems to power utilities in the domestic Japanese market. BICC also had a technology licence from Furukawa, but carried out extensive development work to make the product suitable for the European market: BICC re-designed the cable to use <b>loose-tube</b> technology and so provide a zero-strain environment for the optical fibres at all operating conditions of the overhead line; the tug and wrapping machine were re-designed to reduce the overall load on the conductor during the installation process. This included the use of a light-weight (but very costly) carbon-fibre cable drum in order to maximise the length of cable in a fixed payload weight. Being derived from GWWOP, both the BICC and Alcatel systems were limited to ground-wire installations and no phase-conductor installations were carried out.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA novel Niobium-doped SnO 2 nanofibres with {{a complex}} <b>loose-tube</b> (fiber-in tube) {{morphology}} containing a solid fibre within a hollow shell has been prepared by conventional, single-needle electrospinning. The formation mechanism of such 1 D architectures has been elucidated, showing {{the role of}} the niobium dopant in driving the morphology of electrospun tin oxide from dense fibres towards the <b>loose-tube</b> morphology by enhancing the Kirkendall effect where precursor salts diffuse to the fibre surface during calcination. The role of other parameters such as the heating rate and precursor concentration has also been studied, which would enable morphological control of the nanofibres through variation of these parameters which would alter the dominant mechanism of hollow fibre formation. The materials obtained have been characterized by electron microscopy, thermo-gravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and XRD. The <b>loose-tube</b> morphology materials have been further functionalised by depositing Pt nanoparticles prepared by a microwave assisted polyol method, where electrical conductivity and specific surface area measurements as well as accelerated corrosion tests and electrochemical measurements show that Nb doped SnO 2 loose-tubes are promising electrocatalyst supports for proton exchange membrane fuel cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNovel platinum-catalysed, corrosion-resistant, loose-tube-structured electrocatalysts for proton exchangemembrane {{fuel cells}} have been {{obtained}} using single-needle electrospinning associated with a microwave-assisted polyol method. Monodisperse platinum particles supported on Nb–SnO 2 demonstrated higherelectrochemical stability than conventional Pt/C electrodes during ex situ potential cycling and comparableactivity in the oxygen reduction reaction. In situ fuel cell operation under accelerated stress test conditionsof a membrane electrode assembly elaborated using a Pt/C anode and Pt/Nb–SnO 2 cathode confirmedthat the voltage loss is significantly lower for the novel cathode than for an MEA prepared using conventionalPt/C supported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the Nb–SnO 2 stabilised the supported platinum nanoparticlesagainst dissolution, migration and reprecipitation in the membrane. Pt/Nb–SnO 2 <b>loose-tubes</b> constitute amitigation strategy for two known degradation mechanisms in PEMFC: corrosion of the carbon support atthe cathode, and dissolution of Pt at high cell voltages...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo {{synthesis}} routes {{were used}} to design high surface area niobium-doped tin dioxide (Nb-doped SnO 2, NTO) nanostructures with either <b>loose-tube</b> (fibre-in-tube) morphology using electrospinning or aerogel morphology using a sol-gel process. A higher specific surface area but a lower apparent electrical conductivity was obtained on the NTO aerogel compared to the loose tubes. The NTO aerogels and loose tubes and two reference materials (undoped SnO 2 aerogel and Vulcan XC 72) were platinized with a single colloidal suspension and tested as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications. The specific surface area of the supports strongly influenced the mass fraction of deposited Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and their degree of agglomeration. The apparent electrical conductivity of the supports determined the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and the catalytic activity of the Pt NPs for the ORR. Based on these findings, electrospinning {{appears to be the}} preferred route to synthesize NTO supports for PEMFC cathode application...|$|E
