50|$|As design wave heights get <b>larger,</b> <b>rubble</b> mound breakwaters require larger armour {{units to}} resist the wave forces.

Larger gradings may be available, but the ultimate size is limited in practice by the natural fracture properties of locally available rock. Shaped concrete armour units (such as Dolos, Xbloc, Tetrapod, etc.) can be provided in up to approximately 40 tonnes (e.g. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco), before they become vulnerable to damage under self weight, wave impact and thermal cracking of the complex shapes during casting/curing.

50|$|The Little Blue Lake {{is one of}} {{a number}} of similar landforms {{occurring}} in the area to the south of the dormant volcano in Mount Gambier including the area around the dormant volcano at Mount Schank. These cenotes are similar in form as they all have collapse dolines with circular plans, cliffs, lakes filled to the water table, <b>large</b> <b>rubble</b> cones on their floors and clustered together in several groups along in the flat coastal plain composed of a Miocene limestone known as Gambier Limestone. These cenotes differ from other karst landforms in the south east of South Australia by their relative depth (i.e. as deep as 125 m in one cenote), the absence of any underwater phreatic passages and a different water chemistry. It is theorised that these cenotes were formed by the collapse of large underground water-filled chambers following the lowering of sea levels at the most recent Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago. The chambers themselves are likely to have been formed by groundwater acidified by gaseous Carbon Dioxide (CO2) rising up through fractures from the magma chambers during the volcanic eruptions occurring during the Pleistocene and the Holocene rather than by the usual acidification process involving the absorption of atmospheric CO2 by water prior to entering the water table. The cenotes then filled with freshwater as the sea level started to rise at about 8,000 years ago. The presence of stromatolites in at least eight cenotes including the Little Blue Lake is suggested as being an indicator of the recent formation of these landforms.|$|E

40|$|Many {{juvenile}} {{salmon and}} trout migrated from the Lemhi River drainage each fallwinter-spring period. Seaward migration of anadromous trout and salmon normally occurred inthe spring but pre-smolt anadromous and non-anadromous fishes also left the stream usuallybeginning in the fall. I compared data on temperature, food abundance, stream flow, cover andpopulation density with movements and conducted field and laboratory tests to determinereasons for {{the two types of}} movements. Smolts of the anadromous species migrated for an obvious reason but none of the factors Iexamined appeared to 2 ̆ 7 stimulate or release 2 ̆ 7 their seaward migration. Movement frequentlycoincided with changes in water temperature and stream flow, but I could not establish aconsistent causal relationship and concluded that photoperiod and perhaps growth must initiatethe physiological and behavioural changes associated with seaward migration. Non-anadromous and pre-smolt anadromous species emigrated from the streams for differentreasons than the smolts. I postulated that fish found the stream environment unsuitable duringthe winter. Stream temperature declined in the fall as fish began moving from the streams but Icould not induce more fish to stay in test troughs with 12 C water versus troughs with 0 - 10 Cwater. Fish emigrated before abundance of drift insects declined in winter. Emigration occurred inspite of the relatively stable flows in both streams. Population density modified the basic migrationpattern by regulating the number and percentage of fish that emigrated and to a limited extenttime of emigration. Movements of non-smolt trout and salmon correlated best with the amount of cover provided bylarge rubble substrate. Subyearling trout emigrated from Big Springs Creek which contained norubble substrate but remained in the Lemhi River which did.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{outlines}} {{the results of}} an integrated mapping project undertaken to provide a habitat map of the shallow Broward County seafloor between the 0 m and 35 m contour. The study area stretched from Golden Beach in northern Dade County to just north of the Palm Beach County line. To produce this map and assure its compatibility with other, in particular NOAA, mapping products, a series of data were integrated. Data types included Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) bathymetry, multi- and single-beam bathymetry, acoustic seafloor discrimination, ecological assessments, and groundtruthing. The method used for acoustic seafloor discrimination was based on the first echo and its associated tail, and on the second echo returns of a 200 kHz signal. Two survey systems were employed: QTC View and Echoplus. A series of controlled experiments and field verifications indicated {{that it was possible to}} distinguish acoustically between different scattering classes that correlated to different seafloor types. For the production of the final map, information obtained from LADS bathymetry, NOAA classification and scattering classes obtained by QTC View and Echoplus was fused. The final map showed three well-developed linear reef complexes, a series of deep and shallow ridges believed to be old shorelines, a large sand area between the middle and outer reefs, and a considerable amount of colonized pavement. Due to the lack of distinct geomorphologic zones, the maps were based solely on habitat as defined by the NOAA biogeography program; however distinctions between areas such as linear reef, spur and groove, and colonized pavement were based on benthic cover (as seen by acoustic seafloor discrimination and biological transects) and geomorphology. The outer linear reef was subdivided into four habitats: aggregated patch reef, spur and groove, linear reef and deep colonized pavement. The area east of the outer linear reef consisted of a very patchy environment with large patches of reef interspersed amongst the deep sand. These were more prevalent close to the reef and tapered off eastward, becoming sandier. The spur and groove, linear reef, and deep colonized pavement comprised the outer reef and were separated mainly based on geomorphology. The outer reef was separated from the middle linear reef by a wide sandy plane (deep sand), which was characterized overall by a different scattering class in QTC View than the shallow sand found inshore. Acoustic ground discrimination identified patches of higher scatter and lower scatter amongst the outer, middle, and inner linear reefs suggesting distinct benthic cover between these structures. The eastern boundary of the middle reef was distinct and easily mapped whereas acoustic discrimination aided in determining the western boundary. The inner reef was the least distinct reef as it is not a mature reef. Much of this reef is patchy growth atop an inshore ridge and reef zonation is absent. Acoustic ground discrimination suggested that patches of higher versus lower scatter existed between and within the linear reefs, indicating that dense fauna is patchily distributed. Shoreward of the inner reef, another sand area or a mixture of sand and colonized pavements were found. Several nearshore ridges were mapped that could be classified as linear reef habitat, but were thought to be of non-reefal origin. Therefore these structures were mapped separately even though similar habitat comprises the inshore ridges, the inner linear reef, and the shallow colonized pavements. Excluded habitats such as submerged vegetation and <b>large</b> <b>rubble</b> zones were not detected sufficiently enough to be mapped during this effort. Groundtruthing by way of underwater video drop cameras and in situ biological assessments aided in the refinement of the mapping categories. Accuracy assessment of an independent grid of target points showed the map to have a users accuracy between 83 % and 97 % and a producers accuracy between 81 % and 95 %. These are acceptable accuracies and compare similarly to NOAA published map accuracies. In conclusion, the amalgamation of several mapping approaches and data products provided a representative map of Broward County submarine habitats that was accurate to a very satisfactory level. The results of this survey are a good example of how similar mapping products can be attained through different means. The method employed to map Broward County appears to have equally and accurately illustrated the benthic community as more traditional methods like photo interpretation. Similar methodology should be used in other areas where photo interpretation is not feasible due to either absence of data or the turbidity of the water...|$|E

Istraživanja su obuhvatila i dijelove dvorišta u kojem su pronađeni tragovi mlađih objekata što se pripisuje graditeljskim aktivnostima obitelji Odescalchi koja je u posjed Iloka stupila krajem 17. st.

Archaeological {{research}} on the position of Dvor knezova Iločkih (Court of the Dukes of Ilok) in Ilok {{has been carried out}} systematically since 2001. In 2006, the research was focused on the efforts to define the north part of Gothic palace, the central yard and the northwest corner with its ramparts and towers. The first stage of research, which referred to the north wing of the palace and the yard, was carried out with difficulties because of numerous installations (gas, electricity, water), which are still in use. Baroque reconstructions, carried out by the Odeschalchi family, have been documented (the first reconstruction recorded was carried {{in the first quarter of}} the 18 th century, the last by the end of the 19 th century). The discovery of three limekilns, situated by the north front of the south wall of the north palace wing, which produced damage upon the wall, is related to the first Baroque renovation. The channel system, that points to the systematic scheme of water drainage from the castle and the surrounding buildings, is related to the reconstructions carried out by Baltazar III; the last reconstruction was performed during the reign of Innocent II. The built sewage system produced considerable damage on the north wing walls, the late medieval layers as well as the objects situated in the palace yard. Of the objects in the investigated part of the yard, foundation footings, built of bricks bound in yellow plaster, as well as a rectangular structure with a circular “accumulator tank”, made of bricks bound in clay, have been preserved. Chronologically, these objects may be classified as belonging to the Ottoman or early Baroque stage. The pavement of the castle from the Baroque stage had been made of stones with sharp edges, which could be found only in the south of the south curtain wall, while the original Gothic grade level was not found. However, in the northwest corner of the yard, because of the sagging of layers, a part of the Gothic floor has been preserved, which was composed of pebbles and <b>large</b> <b>rubble.</b> The sagging of layers occurred because of the burial of the object defined as a late medieval cellar, buried before the palace was constructed. Regarding the late medieval horizon, which preceded the palace of the Dukes of Ilok, an oven was discovered in the rooms No. 3 and 4, as well as a wall in the ditch by the west curtain wall. The north wing of the palace of the Dukes of Ilok, built in the middle of the 15 th century, was completely defined. It consisted of four rooms with plaster and brick floorings. The flooring level shows that we are dealing with cellar rooms. The flooring in the rooms was placed on a pre-loess layer, while the flooring in rooms No. 3 and 4 was placed on culture layers, which elevated them to a level higher by around half a meter. The curtain walls were built simultaneously, while the south wall was built subsequently. On the north side of the palace, five buttresses were defined, which form a constituent part of the north curtain wall, as well as two buttresses on the west side of the palace. Above the floor in rooms No. 3 and 4, a burn layer with short crossbow arrows was found, a proof of the hardships of the palace during the siege by Vladislav II Jagelović in 1494 or during the Ottoman conquest in 1526. On the very north edge of the plateau, the remains of an object are situated, belonging to the Baroque stage of the castle reconstruction. The ground plan of the object may be seen in the cadastral plan from 1863. The second stage of the research referred to the area between the west walls and the palace, as well as the northwest corner, where a tower of a four-angular ground plan was situated. The layer between the palace and the ramparts contained numerous fragments of polychromatic glazed oven tiles, ornamented with various figures, which probably stem from the rooms situated on the upper palace floor. These tiles had been imported from Central European workshops during the second half of the 15 th century. In the research of 2006, traces of settlements from the Antiquity and Prehistory were also documented. Remains of Antique architecture and five Early Roman graves were discovered. In the graves, numerous autochtonous and imported ceramic, glass and bronze objects were found. Out of these discoveries, most significant are grave No. 5, containing a sword in a sheath and a cingulum, as well as grave No. 3 with a bronze sheath. Continuous traces of Prehistoric settlements, ranging from the Neolithic to the Late Iron Age, have been recorded. Gornji grad (the Upper Town), was most densely inhabited during the Kalakača stage of the Bosut group in the Early Iron Age...|$|E
