The floor was defective but as {{there was only a}} contract between Junior Books and the main contractor there was no relationship in contract through which Junior Books could sue Veitchi, the subcontractor. Therefore, Junior Books was forced to bring an action in delict, arguing that Veitchi owed Junior Books a non-contractual duty of care.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy using RAD 7 {{professional}} radon monitor which detecting data is reliable, {{selecting a}} one-story cottage in Shenzhen city area as the research object, the measurement results showed the radon {{concentration in the}} soil around the one-story cottage area was low background; the soil surface radon exhalation rate of soil was higher and was about two times that of cement floor of the room which indicated that the soil is the largest source of indoor radon; the surface radon exhalation rate of cement floor was {{higher than that of}} ceramic tile floor and was about 4 times that of the ceramic tile floor. The indoor radon concentration in the room covered with cement floor was higher than that of the room covered with ceramic tile floor due to the larger surface radon exhalation rate of cement floor. Therefore, in order to reduce indoor radon concentration, the <b>laying</b> <b>floor</b> material with low surface radon exhalation should be selected and windows should be kept open for ventilation...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the work on this project {{was placed in the}} hands of Peter Kerr who designed the building and who acted as Clerk of Works. Most active members contributed their own brand of labouring towards the building - either in digging foundations, <b>laying</b> <b>floors</b> and joists, and other less specialist building jobs. The more sophisticated work, plumbing, brick laying, roofing, etc., was given out on a contract basis, so in the end the building cost what, even in 1960, was the ridiculous figure of about £4,500. The design allowed for future development and improvements and it is to the eternal credit of those involved in the original project that we have such a fine clubhouse today. Also in 1959, Roger Markland joined the Club and in his years at Moor was a prolific points-scorer and contributed to many of the Club's activities. He was also very involved in the building of the present pavilion.|$|R
