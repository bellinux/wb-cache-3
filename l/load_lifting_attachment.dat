40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of a high <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> {{exercise}} with low load motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability and health-related quality of life for patients with mechanical low back pain. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS: Patients with mechanical low back pain as their dominating pain mechanism. METHODS: The intervention programme consisted of a high <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> exercise, while the control group received low load motor control exercises over 8 weeks (12 sessions) with pain education included in both intervention arms. The primary outcome was pain intensity and disability, and the secondary outcome was health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Each intervention arm included 35 participants, analysed following 2 -, 12 - and 24 -month follow-up. There was no significant difference between the high <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> and low <b>load</b> motor control interventions for the primary or secondary outcome measures. Between 50 % and 80 % of participants reported a decrease in perceived pain intensity and disability for both short- and long-term follow-up.

Premature or late inhibition in the load-bearing arm activity would result in augmented arm deflection. Little is currently known about the timing operation of motor systems subserving coordinated, bimanual actions. In this study, we measured neuromagnetic brain activity with whole-head magnetoencephalography while 15 participants performed a bimanual load-lifting task. To investigate neural processes prior to <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> a beamformer was applied to 6 contiguous 200. ms time epochs spanning the entire premovement phase of the motor task.

40|$|Although {{individual}} {{heads of}} triceps surae, soleus (SO) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles, are often considered close functional synergists, {{previous studies have}} shown distinct activity patterns between them in some motor behaviors. The goal {{of this study was}} to test two hypotheses explaining inhibition of slow SO with respect to fast MG: (1) inhibition occurs at high movement velocities and mediated by velocity-dependent sensory feedback and (2) inhibition depends on the ankle-knee joint moment combination and does not require high movement velocities. The hypotheses were tested by comparing the SO EMG/MG EMG ratio during fast and slow motor behaviors (cat paw shake responses vs. back, straight leg <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> in humans), which had the same ankle extension-knee flexion moment combination; and during fast and slow behaviors with the ankle extension-knee extension moment combination (human vertical jumping and stance phase of walking in cats and leg <b>load</b> <b>lifting</b> in humans). In addition, SO EMG/MG EMG ratio was determined during cat paw shake responses and walking before and after removal of stretch velocity-dependent sensory feedback by self-reinnervating SO and/or gastrocnemius. We found the ratio SO EMG/MG EMG below 1 (p< 0. 05) during fast paw shake responses and slow back <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> requiring the ankle extension-knee flexion moment combination; whereas the ratio SO EMG/MG EMG was above 1 (p< 0. 05) during fast vertical jumping and slow tasks of walking and leg <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> requiring ankle extension-knee extension moments. Removal of velocity-dependent sensory feedback did not affect the SO EMG/MG EMG ratio in cats. We concluded that the relative inhibition of SO does not require high muscle velocities, depends on ankle-knee moment combinations, and is mechanically advantageous for allowing a greater MG contribution to ankle extension and knee flexion moments...|$|R
40|$|The 1991 - 1992 senior Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Design class {{continued}} work on {{the post}} landing configurations for the Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV) and the Emergency Egress Couch (EEC). The ACRV will be permanently docked to Space Station Freedom fulfilling NASA's commitment of Assured Crew Return Capability {{in the event of}} an accident or illness aboard Space Station Freedom. The EEC provides medical support and a transportation surface for an incapacitated crew member. The objective of the projects was to give the ACRV Project Office data to feed into their feasibility studies. Four design teams were given the task of developing models with dynamically and geometrically scaled characteristics. Groups one and two combined efforts to design a one-fifth scale model for the Apollo Command Module derivative, an on-board flotation system, and a <b>lift</b> <b>attachment</b> point system. This model was designed to test the feasibility of a rigid flotation and stabilization system and to determine the dynamics associated with lifting the vehicle during retrieval. However, due to priorities, it was not built. Group three designed a one-fifth scale model of the Johnson Space Center (JSC) benchmark configuration, the Station Crew Return Alternative Module (SCRAM) with a <b>lift</b> <b>attachment</b> point system. This model helped to determine the flotation and lifting characteristics of the SCRAM configuration. Group four designed a full scale EEC with changeable geometric and geometric and dynamic characteristics. This model provided data on the geometric characteristics of the EEC and on the placement of the CG and moment of inertia. It also gave the helicopter rescue personnel direct input to the feasibility study. Section 1 describes in detail the design of a one-fifth scale model of the Apollo Command Module Derivative (ACMD) ACRV. The objective of the ACMD Configuration Model Team was to use geometric and dynamic constraints to design a one-fifth scale working model of the Apollo Command Module Derivative (ACMD) configuration with a <b>Lift</b> <b>Attachment</b> Point (LAP) System. This model was required to incorporate a rigidly mounted flotation system and the egress system designed the previous academic year. The LAP system was to be used to determine the dynamic effects of locating the lifting points at different locations on the vehicle. The team was then to build and test the model; however, due to priorities, this did not occur. To better simulate the ACMD after a water landing, the nose cone section was removed and the deck area exposed.

MethodsSixteen young men, who were experienced in resistance training were randomly divided into two groups: fast contraction velocity (FCV – n= 8) and slow contraction velocity (SCV – n= 8). Both groups performed bench press and incline bench press exercises (free weights) with 4 sets of 12 repetitions maximum. There was a 50 seconds rest interval between each set, and 2 minutes interval between the exercises. The contraction velocity was 6 seconds for the SCV group and 1. 5 seconds for the FCV group. The total volume of load was recorded during the exercise bout, and the one repetition maximum (1 RM) was evaluated before (baseline) and for 96 hours after exercise to measure the neuromuscular function. ResultsThe results demonstrated that the FCV group provide a higher (p< 0. 05) volume of <b>load</b> <b>lifted</b> during the exercise bout, and had a significant decline (p< 0. 05) in the neuromuscular performance post-exercise, {{when compared to the}} SCV group.

40|$|AbstractDuring bimanual <b>load</b> <b>lifting,</b> {{the brain}} must {{anticipate}} {{the effects of}} unloading upon the load-bearing arm. Little is currently known about the neural networks that coordinate these anticipatory postural adjustments. We measured neuromagnetic brain activity with whole-head magnetoencephalography while participants performed a bimanual load-lifting task. Anticipatory adjustments were associated with reduction in biceps brachii muscle activity of the load-bearing arm and pre-movement desynchronization of the cortical beta rhythm. Beamforming analyses localized anticipatory brain activity to the precentral gyrus, basal ganglia, supplementary motor area, and thalamus, contralateral to the load-bearing arm. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} human neuroimaging study to directly investigate anticipatory postural adjustments and to explicitly partition the anticipatory and volitional aspects of brain activity in bimanual <b>load</b> <b>lifting.</b> These data contribute {{to our understanding of the}} neural systems supporting anticipatory postural adjustments in healthy adults...|$|R
