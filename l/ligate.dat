25|$|There are {{currently}} ten known prostaglandin receptors on various cell types. Prostaglandins <b>ligate</b> a sub-family of cell surface seven-transmembrane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are termed DP1-2, EP1-4, FP, IP1-2, and TP, {{corresponding to the}} receptor that ligates the corresponding prostaglandin (e.g., DP1-2 receptors bind to PGD2).|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays <b>ligate</b> an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E
500|$|For natural proteins, {{a series}} of {{purification}} steps {{may be necessary to}} obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity. Here, a [...] "tag" [...] consisting of a specific amino acid sequence, often {{a series of}} histidine residues (a [...] "His-tag"), is attached to one terminus of the protein. As a result, when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel, the histidine residues <b>ligate</b> the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded. A number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.|$|E

50|$|Although Golden Gate Cloning {{speeds up}} multisegment cloning, careful design of donor and {{recipient}} plasmids is required. In each cloning step, Golden Gate Cloning can assemble up to nine fragments and only requires homology in type II restriction enzyme sites so that the DNA fragments can be <b>ligated</b> seamlessly. After the fragments are <b>ligated,</b> the product {{will not have the}} original type IIS restriction site and will not be redigested in ligation reaction afterwards. Meanwhile, the original restriction sites, which are not <b>ligated,</b> can be redigested so that they can add more fragments into the plasmid. If the DNA fragments are well-designed to be compatible to one another, they can be <b>ligated</b> in a linear order in one step.|$|R
50|$|Hi-C uses {{high-throughput}} sequencing to {{find the}} nucleotide sequence of fragments. The original protocol used paired end sequencing, which retrieves a short sequence from each end of each <b>ligated</b> fragment. As such, for a given <b>ligated</b> fragment, the two sequences obtained should represent two different restriction fragments that were <b>ligated</b> together in the random ligation step. The pair of sequences are individually aligned to the genome, thus determining the fragments involved in that ligation event. Hence, all possible pairwise interactions between fragments are tested.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other methods, {{cassette}} mutagenesis {{need not}} involve primer extension using DNA polymerase. [...] In this method, {{a fragment of}} DNA is synthesized, and then inserted into a plasmid. It involves the cleavage by a restriction enzyme at a site in the plasmid and subsequent ligation {{of a pair of}} complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation in the gene of interest to the plasmid. Usually, the restriction enzymes that cut at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide are the same, permitting sticky ends of the plasmid and insert to <b>ligate</b> to one another. [...] This method can generate mutants at close to 100% efficiency, but is limited by the availability of suitable restriction sites flanking the site that is to be mutated.|$|E

40|$|Background: Phenytoin and {{amitriptyline}} {{are often}} reported to attenuate pain in chronic conditions. Information {{on their ability}} to ameliorate cognitive impairment associated with neuropathic pain remains unclear due to mixed results from studies. This study investigated the effects of phenytoin and amitriptyline on memory deficit associated with neuropathic pain. Methods: Twenty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D (n =  7). Groups A, B, C, and D served as sham control, sciatic nerve <b>ligated</b> untreated, sciatic nerve <b>ligated</b> receiving amitriptyline (5 mg/kg), and sciatic nerve <b>ligated</b> receiving phenytoin (10 mg/kg) respectively. Treatments lasted for 14 days, after which both ‘Y’ maze and novel object recognition test (NOR) were performed. On the last day of treatment, the animals were anesthetized and their brain excised, and the prefrontal cortices and sciatic nerve were processed histologically using hematoxylin and eosin. Results: There was memory impairment in the sciatic nerve <b>ligated</b> untreated group which was statistically significant (p <  0. 05) when compared to the phenytoin-treated, amitriptyline-treated, and sham control groups using the ‘Y’ maze and NOR tests. Histological quantification showed that the prefrontal cortices of the <b>ligated</b> animals showed increased neural population in comparison to normal control. These increases were significantly marked in the untreated <b>ligated</b> group. Sciatic nerve of untreated <b>ligated</b> group showed high demyelination and axonal degeneration which was ameliorated in the treated animals. Conclusions: The administration of amitriptyline and phenytoin can ameliorate neuronal injury, demyelination, and memory impairment associated with neuropathic pain in Wistar rats...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} in vitro and in vivo in order to clarify the mechanism by which abnormal erythrocytes occur in bile duct <b>ligated</b> rats. (1) Radioactive phospholipid precursors (32 P-inorganic phosphate and 14 C-glycerol) were intraperitoneally injected into rats with simultanous treatment of either a bile duct ligation or a sham operation. Incorporation of the precursors into phospholipids in liver, plasma and erythrocytes were observed at the 5 th hour, 1 st and 2 nd day after the treatments. Both the amounts and radioactivities in saturated-dienoic phosphatidylcholine in liver, plasma as well as in erythrocytes increased in the bile duct <b>ligated</b> rats as compared to those of the sham operated rats. This suggested that bile phosphatidylcholine, which contains much dienoic fatty acid, strongly participated in the metabolism of phospholipids in bile duct <b>ligated</b> rats. (2) Patterns of the transfer of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine from plasma to erythrocytes were found to be different between those of the bile duct <b>ligated</b> and sham operated rats. In sham operated rats lysophosphatidylcholine predominated in the transfer of phospholipid. On the other hand, in bile duct <b>ligated</b> rats the degree of direct transfer of phosphatidylcholine increased. (3) To further elucidate the different mechanism between bile duct <b>ligated</b> and sham operated rat phospholipid transfer, in vitro experiments were performed. It is conceivable that increased bile acids found in the bile duct <b>ligated</b> rat plasma, or exogenously added bile acid, brought about the changes in the phospholipid organization in erythrocyte membranes and this resulted in the direct transfer of phosphatidylcholine...|$|R

In vivo and in vitro techniques consisting of <b>ligated</b> loops, perfused segments and isolated enterocytes were employed in the study. STb induced secretion or decreased absorption of water, sodium, potassium and chloride in vivo. Soybean trypsin inhibitor significantly increased the STb induced secretion {{of water in the}} perfused rat intestine.
