5|$|Like {{the games}} before it, Cross Days is {{presented}} with <b>limited</b> <b>animation.</b> The game is audibly stereophonic with lip-synched voice acting, sound effects and background music.|$|E
5|$|Barbera's {{first foray}} into {{television}} was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan, Colonel Bleep. The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> Barbera would later carry over to his other television productions. Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{critics also}} {{mentioned}} its presentation. Stella praised the visuals {{and enjoyed the}} music despite it sounding dated, while Hatfield praised the music but criticized the graphics as uninspired. Reddick praised the visual overhaul, despite <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> for sprites outside battle. Dutton echoed Hatfield's sentiments about the visuals, finding them one of his main criticisms of the presentation alongside the dialogue.|$|E
5000|$|... 1929 - Painter, Róbert Berény joins Endre Gál's {{special effects}} atelier, Pantofilm, to produce <b>limited</b> <b>animations</b> {{including}} Az okos kandúr ("The Clever Tomcat"), and Sabol rovarirtó ("Sabol Insect Repellent").|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} an {{educational}} show, aimed at children, in which still pictures and <b>limited</b> <b>animations</b> told {{the stories about}} important figures and key events in Western history. 104 episodes were made in total, each running at {{five and a half}} minutes in length.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy VIII also {{introduced}} interactive elements to complement <b>Limit</b> Break <b>animations.</b> These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break range from randomly selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the resulting attack's potency.|$|R
5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of <b>limited</b> <b>animation,</b> which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. <b>Limited</b> <b>animation</b> became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E
5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to <b>limited</b> <b>animation,</b> studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E
25|$|One {{recurring}} {{technique is}} to superimpose lips onto an existing image, {{as in the}} Syncro-Vox <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> technique, resulting in the speaker saying things often quite out of character.|$|E
25|$|Brandon Jones from GameTrailers {{gave the}} game a 6.8/10, while praising its {{accurate}} parkour {{system and the}} creative environment navigation, he criticized the lip movement which is rarely on track, <b>limited</b> facial <b>animation,</b> repeated character model, lack of a backstory, unnecessary upgrades, occasionally dim AI, texture pop-up, graphical issues and game-breaking glitches.|$|R
25|$|Different graphic {{styles are}} used throughout. The game is usually {{displayed}} in a top-down perspective, showing representations of the different locations while the player {{is represented by the}} # symbol. Several segments of the game make use of all-text screens with <b>limited</b> ASCII <b>animation,</b> while other segments use either the Apple II's low-resolution or high-resolution graphics modes.|$|R
5000|$|Craig Harris of IGN {{reviewed}} the Game Boy Advance version and wrote, [...] "This game has everything {{that makes a}} game bad -- horrible <b>animation,</b> <b>limited</b> controls, and gameplay design that's just downright unbearable when put into action." ...|$|R
25|$|Character {{animations}} {{were created}} by Blizzard's David Gibson. To help give more personality to the 3D-rendered animation, Gibson applied traditional methods used in 2D <b>limited</b> <b>animation,</b> such as smear animation, instead of relying on motion blur effects, creating more exaggerated animations that support {{the feel of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|Boakes {{worked on}} the game for {{eighteen}} months, almost entirely on his own. All of the sound effects in the game were recorded in his own house, and enhanced using Sound Forge. Graphically, the game is presented entirely through pre-rendered static images, some of which feature <b>limited</b> <b>animation.</b> When the game was complete, Boakes published it independently under the XXv Productions label, making only 2000 copies. Although approached by two publishing companies interested in the game, Boakes chose to sell it independently online, where it soon began to attract positive reviews, and generate good word-of-mouth. Boakes was later approached by The Adventure Company, who signed a deal to distribute it globally, renamed Dark Fall: The Journal.|$|E

50|$|Another {{addition}} in the Japanese version {{not present}} in the other versions is alternate animated introduction and ending sequences. These sequences feature full animation, {{as opposed to the}} <b>limited</b> flash-style <b>animation</b> seen in the other animated sequences present throughout the game.

500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{complimentary}} {{in regards to}} the series' art style. In his website Lineboil, Aaron Simpson compared it to Garbage Pail Kids and the works of Don Martin, two elements of his childhood. Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew called Robertryan Cory's character designs [...] "impressive" [...] and [...] "distinctively styled", though he felt the art style's complexity made the <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> quality suffer as a result. Abby Koenig of Houston Press compared its [...] "ridiculous" [...] nature to the film Little Monsters, and proposed that Howie Mandel (featured in the latter work) guest voice a monster on the show. Shannon O'Leary of Publishers Weekly wrote that the show, along with others on the network such as Adventure Time and Superjail!, bore resemblance to the aesthetics of established independent comics artists. Meanwhile, Jason Krell of io9 considered it a failure despite its influences from Adventure Time, which made way for many successful original series on the network.|$|E
500|$|Loter {{typically}} visualized whatever script he {{was provided}} with {{after they had}} been written. With characters drawn with large heads and eyes, the show's colorful, [...] "hip and retro" [...] style is reminiscent of [...] "campy" [...] spy films released during the 1960s and 1970s. The New York Times observed that the show's retro setting is more {{similar to that of}} The Jetsons than The Simpsons. Using a <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> style, the characters wear a wide variety of costumes and hairstyles. Opting for a [...] "simplicity that was the hallmark of" [...] the 1960s, some of the architecture in Kim Possible is reminiscent of lairs owned by James Bond villains, while Bodner was inspired by the graphic design of posters Disney used during the same decade, as well a Chuck Jones and Maurice Noble. In Season 4, some episodes were intentionally filmed in multiplane to achieve a more cinematic image. Additionally, Disney Channel's animated series [...] inspired the animators and artists to approach Kim Possibles final season with an [...] "edgier" [...] design. Director Steve Loter declared Season 4 the series [...] "most international season" [...] because Kim and Ron travel to more exotic countries. Three different animation studios animated the series: Rough Draft, Starburst and Hanho.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{references}} {{are based on}} sight gags. The residents of Niceland and the bartender from Tapper are animated using a jerky motion that spoofs the <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> cycles of the sprites of many eight- and sixteen-bit arcade games. King Candy uses the Konami Code on an NES controller to access the programming of Sugar Rush. Throughout Game Central Station is graffiti that includes [...] "Aerith lives" [...] (referencing the character of Aerith Gainsborough from Final Fantasy VII), [...] "All your base are belong to us" [...] (an Engrish phrase popularized from the game Zero Wing), [...] "Sheng Long Was Here" [...] (referencing an April Fool's joke around a made-up character Sheng Long from Street Fighter), and [...] "Jenkins" [...] (a nod to the popular Leeroy Jenkins meme from World of Warcraft). There is also {{a reference to the}} Metal Gear series when Ralph is searching for a medal in Tapper's Lost and found, finding first a Super Mushroom from the Mario franchise, and then Metal Gear Solids [...] "Exclamation point" [...] (with the corresponding sound effect from the game). Mr. Litwak wears a black and white striped referee's shirt, a nod to the iconic outfit of Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day. One of the songs in the credits is an original work from Buckner and Garcia, previously famous for writing video game-themed songs in the 1980s. The Walt Disney Animation Studios opening logo is animated in an 8-bit pixelated fashion, whereas the Walt Disney Pictures closing production logo appears in a glitched state, a reference to the kill screen from many early arcade games such as Pac-Man.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, the BBC {{commissioned}} Big Finish Productions {{to remake}} Shada as an audio play {{which was then}} webcast in six episodic segments, accompanied by <b>limited</b> Flash <b>animation,</b> on the BBC website using illustrations provided by comic strip artist Lee Sullivan. The play starred Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor and Lalla Ward as Romana. The audio play was also broadcast on digital radio station BBC 7, on 10 December 2005 (as a 2-hour omnibus), and was repeated in six parts as the opening story to the Eighth Doctor's summer season which began on 16 July 2006.|$|R
50|$|Many {{critics say}} that Disney's own {{animation}} studio had lost most of its luster {{during the period from}} Walt Disney's passing through the 1980s. However, the studio took a number of risks that paid off handsomely, and DuckTales was one of those risks that won big. The studio gambled on the idea that a larger investment into quality animation could be made back through syndication - a concept that worked well with live-action TV reruns, but which had only been used with inexpensive cartoon series that either recycled theatrical shorts from decades past or only featured <b>limited,</b> low-budget <b>animation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} capacity <b>limits</b> {{in mental}} <b>animation</b> of static diagrams of mechanical systems and interprets these limits within current theories of working memory. I review empirical studies of mental animation that examined (1) {{the relation of}} spatial ability to mental animation (2) the effects of working memory loads on mental animation, (3) use of external memory in mental animation and (4) strategies for task decomposition that enable complex mental animation problems to be accomplished within the limited capacity of working memory. The effects of capacity <b>limits</b> on mental <b>animation</b> are explored by implementing a simple production system model of mental animation in the 3 CAPS production system architecture, limiting the working memory resources available to the model, and implementing strategies for managing scarce working memory resources. It is proposed that mental animation involves the visual-spatial and executive components of working memory and that individual differences in mental animation reflect the operation of these working memory components. ...|$|R
2500|$|Japanese {{animation}} studios were {{pioneers of}} many <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike Disney animation, where {{the emphasis is}} on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices. Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work. The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking [...] "tremendously impressive".|$|E
2500|$|Previous Doctor Who webcasts had <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> {{and were}} {{little more than}} a series of illustrations. [...] Earlier in 2003, BBCi had had some success with the {{original}} animated webcast Ghosts of Albion. [...] The animation for that story was provided by Manchester-based animation studio Cosgrove Hall, who were also hired to animate the missing episodes of Second Doctor serial The Invasion for its home release.|$|E
50|$|<b>Limited</b> <b>animation</b> as {{an artistic}} device and a style for an {{animated}} short film was pioneered {{in the independent}} animation studio UPA, which made the first serious attempt to abandon the inbetween-heavy approach first perfected by Disney and Max Fleischer. UPA's first effort at <b>limited</b> <b>animation,</b> Gerald McBoing-Boing, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Subject {{a few months after}} its release and it provided the impetus for this animation method to be accepted at the major Hollywood cartoon studios, including Warner Brothers and MGM. However, the real attraction of <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> was the reduction in costs: because <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> does not require as many drawings as fully inbetweened animations, it is much less expensive to produce. The 1950s saw most, if not all of the major cartoon studios change their style to <b>limited</b> <b>animation,</b> to the point where painstaking detail in their efforts occurred only rarely.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the origins}} of the movie, {{director}} Mamoru Oshii says he didn't envision it solely as a sequel to Ghost in the Shell. He said, [...] "I had a dozen ideas, linked to my views on life, my philosophy, that I wanted to include in this film.... I attacked Innocence as a technical challenge; I wanted to go beyond typical <b>animation</b> <b>limits,</b> answer personal questions {{and at the same time}} appeal to filmgoers." ...|$|R

50|$|The series {{features}} <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> technique.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Limited</b> <b>animation</b> {{involves}} the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or [...] "skippy" [...] movement animation. <b>Limited</b> <b>animation</b> uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America, <b>limited</b> <b>animation</b> {{can be used as a}} method of stylized artistic expression, as in Gerald McBoing-Boing (US, 1951), Yellow Submarine (UK, 1968), and certain anime produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, and other TV animation studios) and later the Internet (web cartoons).|$|E
