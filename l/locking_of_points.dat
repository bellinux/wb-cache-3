40|$|A {{modified}} fully-digital PN code {{tracking loop}} is proposed for direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication. By {{taking advantage of}} the inherent diversity, a modified code tracking loop is embedded into a RAKE receiver to avoid problems caused by unstable <b>locked</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> error signals. Such unsteadiness <b>of</b> <b>locked</b> <b>points</b> often occurs with a conventional code tracking loop because the error signals may be randomly biased by multipath fading. Thus, a robust pull-in capability can be provided over a time-variant fading channel where multiple propagation paths are arbitrarily correlated. Very attractive behaviors obtained using the proposed technique are verified...|$|R

5000|$|A {{facing point}} lock, FPL or point lock is a device which, {{as the name}} implies, <b>locks</b> a set <b>of</b> <b>points</b> in position, as well as proving {{that they are in}} the correct position. The [...] "facing point" [...] part of the name refers {{to the fact that they}} are to prevent {{movement}} <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> during facing moves, where a train could potentially split the points (end up going down both tracks) if the points were to move underneath the train - during trailing moves, the wheels of a train will force the points into the correct position if they attempt to move.|$|R
5000|$|To {{clip and}} scotch a set <b>of</b> railway <b>points</b> (Amer. a switch) uses {{two pieces of}} {{equipment}} to temporarily <b>lock</b> a set <b>of</b> <b>points</b> into a particular position. [...] The point clip clamps {{the end of a}} moving rail (the switch rail) of a set <b>of</b> <b>points</b> to its associated stock rail, and the scotch is a timber wedge used to ensure that the other moving rail is kept away from its associated stock rail. In this way the points are fixed in either the 'normal' or 'reverse' positions and cannot be moved by the usual setting mechanisms. For infrequently used points, this guards against mechanical failure <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> leaving them in a condition to derail trains. The 'clip and scotch' method {{can also be used to}} positively deny access to the turnout or mainline.|$|R
25|$|Locks were {{typically}} 100 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep, and the lifts averaged about 8 feet (between 6 and 10). Inside dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>lock,</b> for the boat, are over 90', for instance <b>Lock</b> 28 (<b>Point</b> <b>of</b> Rocks) is 90' 9", whereas typical freight boats were 92' long (including the rudder), making {{it necessary to}} turn the rudder to the side to fit in the lock. Lock 36, however, was known among boatmen for being troublesome, since it had a usable length of 89 feet 11 inches, being the only lock less than 90 feet in length. Locks were often whitewashed to facilitate low light (i.e., at dawn or dusk) visibility.|$|R
2500|$|Here {{is a list}} {{of items}} on the canal, as a canaller {{traveling}} by boat from Georgetown to Cumberland would see. (Note: some present day items are on this list also.) A typical canaller would know the canal by the names of the levels and the <b>locks.</b> Most list <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the canal's <b>points</b> <b>of</b> interest do not contain a list of the levels with their names like we have here. Also note that most lists <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> do not include Guard Locks 4 and 5, which a boat would have to pass through, if navigating the entire canal (It was generally possible for boats to pass through the other guard locks also, but that is {{if they were going to}} other destinations, usually on the Virginia/West Virginia side of the river). Also note sometimes there are often slight discrepancies in mileages, for instance NPS and Hahn reports Lock 75 at 175.60 miles, Davies lists [...] "175.35 (175.50)", and Hahn also reports the NPS mile markers are in the wrong place from Milepost 117 to Lock 51, further adding to the confusion. Also note that Some streets in Georgetown were renamed, mostly as numbered streets, pursuant to an 1895 law. See Georgetown street renaming.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the ILD FTD sub {{detector}} {{is one of the}} main tasks of the IFCA group. One of the main issues of tracking detectors is to know at each moment the exact position of every component. Having a deformation and displacement monitor system integrated in the sub detectors would be of great utility to deal with this task. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is the primary technique used in several areas for environmental and deformation monitor. Due to its light mass, their immunity to electromagnetic and magnetic fields and nuclear environments, multiplexing capability and the possibility to be embedded seems to be the best solution for our purpose. As a previous step, a technological demonstrator of FTD support-petals will be designed and manufactured with FBG sensors embedded in its carbon fiber sandwich structure. The aim will be to measure the deformation in predefined <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the demonstrator and calculate the deformed shape of the structure and the displacement between the <b>locked</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the petal...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the design and}} {{modeling}} of a sensor system that gives relative position measurements is described. The position is provided {{in the form of}} bearing and range to a retro target placed on a far field target. The system uses two laser sources. An off the shelf IR laser rangefinder is used to give range measurements based on time of flight. A second 633 nm source is used in conjunction with a fast steering mirror (FSM) and shear sensor on the backend of the optical path to control and detect, respectively, the shear at the retro target. Models of the FSM, optical path and shear sensor are developed. These models are used in an end to end simulation of the system. This simulation is used for compensator design and code development. Both simulated and benchtop experimental data are presented that demonstrate an open loop spiral search of the retro target, detection and <b>lock</b> up <b>of</b> the <b>pointing</b> system and tracking of a moving retro target.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{analysis}} and prototype characterization of a dual-electrode electro-optic modulator that can generate both amplitude and phase modulations with a selectable relative phase, termed a quadrature variable modulator (QVM). All modulation states {{can be reached by}} tuning only the electrical inputs, facilitating real-time tuning, and the device has shown good suppression and stability properties. A mathematical analysis is presented, including the development of a geometric-phase representation for modulation. The experimental characterization of the device shows that relative suppressions of 38, 39, and 30 dB for phase, single sideband, and carrier-suppressed modulations, respectively, can be obtained as well as that the device is well behaved when scanning continuously through the parameter space of modulations. The QVM is compared with existing optical configurations that can produce amplitude and phase-modulation combinations in the context of applications such as the tuning <b>of</b> <b>lock</b> <b>points</b> in optical-locking schemes, single-sideband applications, modulation fast-switching applications, and applications requiring combined modulations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We present, for {{the first}} time, high-spatial {{resolution}} observations combining high-order adaptive optics (AO), frame selection, and post-facto image correction via speckle masking. The data analysis is based on observations of solar active region NOAA 10486 taken with the Dunn Solar Tele-scope (DST) at the Sacramento Peak Observatory (SPO) of the National Solar Observatory (NSO) on 2003 October 29. The high Strehl-ratio encountered in AO corrected short-exposure images provides highly improved signal-to-noise ratios leading to a superior recovery of the object’s Fourier phases. This allows reliable detection of small-scale solar features near the diffraction limit of the telescope. Speckle masking imaging provides access to high-order wavefront abberations, which predominantly originate at high atmospheric layers and are only partially corrected by the high-order AO system. In addition, the observations provided qualitative measures of the image correction away from the <b>lock</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the AO system. We further present a brief inspection of the underlying imaging theory discussing the limitations and prospects of this multi-facetted image reconstruction approach {{in terms of the}} recovery of spatial information, photometric accuracy, and spectroscopic applications...|$|R
