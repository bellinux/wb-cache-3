40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} into second-language (L 2) development focuses {{on the role of}} cognitive factors and other individual differences. Studies of children and prime-of-life adult L 2 learners suggest that differences exist in the learning processes of these groups. However, to date, little empirical work has been conducted with older adult learners. In this article we argue that older adults’ L 2 <b>learning</b> <b>aptitudes,</b> processes, and outcomes merit investigation. We present interaction and working memory (WM) research as a case in point and then, as a preliminary illustration, report on a small-scale study of nine older adults, age 65 – 89, who were native speakers of Spanish learning English as a second language. These learners carried out communicative tasks with native speakers of English, who provided interactional feedback in response to nontargetlike question forms. Interestingly, the only older learners who showed L 2 development were those with the highest scores on a first-language listening-span test of WM. We conclude by proposing that larger scale longitudinal research into the often overlooked population of older L 2 learners is likely to shed interesting light on important questions concerning WM and learning processes in the field of second language acquisition...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} and {{evaluate}} competency-based web learning material (CBWLM) for the college practicum Microprocessor Laboratory. After using the CBWLM for 8 weeks, this study investigates CBWL’s learning effects and self-directed <b>learning</b> <b>aptitudes</b> (SDLAs) as well as exploring the influence of SDLA on learning effects based on the sample of 38 students. The {{results of this study}} indicate that over half of the students achieve the mastery level after using CBWLM. SDLAs of the mid-CBWL and post-CBWL do not influence learning effects. Research Background Competency-based learning (CBL), a non-linear, systematic, and self-learning process, allows learners to individually study each unit of the learning material depending on their own competency. Furthermore, it allows learners to perform repeated learning, remedial learning until they master each unit’s knowledge and skill in order to achieve required competency standards. CBL possesses the nature of systematic process, mastery learning, emphasizing individual differences and self-directed learning. Such a learning method stressing competency standards is specifically suitable for technical learning and training. Web learning is an inevitable trend in the future. However, it has a weakness—there are limitations to the presentation and learning methods for technical subjects. If we apply the concept of CBL to web learning, both will complement each other and improve web technical learning effects. As indicated by Lin and Liao (2000), the concept of competency-based learning material (CBLM) can enhance the effect of web learning materials. To sum up the argument mentioned above, it’s quite clear that competency-based web learning (CBWL) or competency-based web learning material (CBWLM) ought t...|$|R

40|$|One {{purpose of}} the study was to {{ascertain}} from directors of special education and school psychologists the degree of importance placed upon a set of factors (data) in making identification and placement decisions for handicapped students. Examples of these factors are data collected through the administration of tests and data resulting from the observations of teachers and parents. A second purpose was to measure the degree of usefulness, as perceived by directors of special education and school psychologists, placed upon instruments and techniques used in identifying and planning instruction for handicapped students. The instruments and techniques were categorized under the headings: Tests of Academic Potential, Tests of Academic Achievement, Tests of Personality and Adaptive Behavior, and Tests of Specific Attitudes. ^ From the review of literature, a two-part instrument was constructed to measure the importance of factors in making identification and placement decisions and the usefulness of assessment instruments in identifying and planning instruction for handicapped students. ^ The data were examined to determine: rankings of factors and assessment instruments; if rankings were independent of ranking groups; and if consistency existed in rankings of factors and instruments. Demographic data were examined for frequencies and percentages for 11 items. The study was summarized as follows: (1) Generally, the rankings of factors and assessment instruments and techniques were independent of the ranking groups. (2) Factors ranked among the highest for the three handicapping conditions were: data from tests of academic achievement and data resulting from the observation of regular classroom teachers, special education personnel, school psychologists, and parents. (3) Assessment instruments and techniques ranking among the highest five for the three handicapping conditions were: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, Key Math, Peabody Individual Achievement Test, Bender-Gestalt, Interviews, and the Detroit Test of <b>Learning</b> <b>Aptitudes.</b> (4) There was consistency in the rankings of the factors and the instruments and techniques between the two populations sampled. ...|$|R

A history of scoring poorly on an array of language aptitude tests taken at the appropriate time (MLAT-E for grades 3-6, PLAB for grades 7-12, MLAT for adults) can provide even stronger evidence for a language learning disability.

50|$|One of Carroll’s early {{projects}} in the 1950s involved developing a test of language aptitude (the Modern Language Aptitude Test (1953-58), or MLAT).

Initially, the government gave project funding to a professor at a university closer to the Defense Language School in Monterey, California, but his research was unsuccessful at providing a useful assessment tool. Carroll then received a grant for foreign language <b>learning</b> <b>aptitude</b> research through the Carnegie Corporation and worked with Stanley Sapon and the US Army-Air Force to develop the Modern Language Aptitude Test. The MLAT was published in 1959 by The Psychological Corporation and is still used today by many government organizations in the US and abroad to measure language <b>learning</b> <b>aptitude</b> and select candidates for language training programs.|$|E
