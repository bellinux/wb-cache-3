50|$|Bacteriophage PBC1 is a {{bacteriophage}} that infects the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus cereus. Though this <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> is {{a member}} of Siphoviridae, its genome sequence shows little similarity to those of other sequenced phages.|$|E
5000|$|The lytic cycle ( [...] ), {{is one of}} the two {{cycles of}} viral reproduction, the other being the {{lysogenic}} cycle. The lytic cycle results in the destruction of the infected cell and its membrane. A key difference between the lytic and lysogenic phage cycles is that in the <b>lytic</b> <b>phage,</b> the viral DNA exists as a separate molecule within the bacterial cell, and replicates separately from the host bacterial DNA. The location of viral DNA in the lysogenic phage cycle is within the host DNA, therefore in both cases the virus/phage replicates using the host DNA machinery, but in the <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> cycle, the phage is a free floating separate molecule to the host DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteriophages {{may have}} a lytic cycle or a {{lysogenic}} cycle, and a few viruses are capable of carrying out both. With <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> such as the T4 phage, bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. [...] As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. <b>Lytic</b> <b>phages</b> {{are more suitable for}} <b>phage</b> therapy. Some <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of temperate phage going dormant and is usually temporary.|$|R
40|$|Temperate phages were induced from Streptococcus cremoris R 1, BK 5, and 134. DNA {{from the}} three induced phages was shown to be {{homologous}} with prophage DNA in the bacterial chromosomes of their lysogenic hosts by the Southern blot hybridization technique. 32 P-labeled DNA from 11 <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> which had been isolated on cheese starters was similarly hybridized with DNA from 36 strains of lactic streptococci. No significant homology was detected between the phage and bacterial DNA. Phages and lactic streptococci used included phages isolated in a recently opened cheese plant and all the starter strains used in the plant since it commenced operation. The three temperate phages were compared by DNA-DNA hybridizations with 25 <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> isolated on cheese starters. Little or no homology was found between DNA from the temperate and <b>lytic</b> <b>phages.</b> In contrast, temperate phages showed a partial relationship with one another. Temperate phage DNA also showed partial homology with DNA {{from a number of}} strains of lactic streptococci, many of which {{have been shown to be}} lysogenic. This suggests that many temperate phages in lactic streptococci may be related to one another and therefore may be homoimmune with one another. These findings indicate that the release of temperate phages from starter cells currently in use is unlikely to be the predominant source of <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> in cheese plants...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The role of {{temperate}} phage p {{in determining the}} serology and eltor-lytic phage sensitivity in Vibrio cholerae was investigated. The only serological change found in six host strains was a change to roughness. This was accompanied by failure to adsorb several of the <b>lytic</b> <b>phages.</b> Various phage-sensitivity changes were induced by phage fl in two hosts at the post-adsorption level. In strain HP 47, three types of progeny were obtained of which one was universally resistant to <b>lytic</b> <b>phages.</b> These untypable lysogens were culturally stable but gave rise to segregants of the rare phage-type 6 on single colony selection...|$|R

No <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> has yet been discovered for Clostridium difficile, which is responsible for many nosocomial diseases, but some temperate phages (integrated in the genome, also called lysogenic) are known for this species; this opens encouraging avenues but with additional risks as discussed below.|$|E
5000|$|Bacteriophage &Phi;6, is {{a member}} of the Cystoviridae family. It infects Pseudomonas {{bacteria}} (typically plant-pathogenic P. syringae).

50|$|The {{distinction}} between lysogenic and lytic cycles {{is that the}} spread of the viral DNA occurs through the usual prokaryotic reproduction, while the <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> is spread through the production of thousands of individual phages capable of surviving and infecting other cells. The key difference between the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle is that the lysogenic cycle does not lyse the host cell. Phages that replicate only via the lytic cycle are known as virulent phages while phages that replicate using both lytic and lysogenic cycles are known as temperate phages.|$|E

40|$|Microcystis aeruginosa is {{a common}} {{cyanobacterium}} living in eutrophic, relatively warm water. Microcystis can produce strong hepatotoxins, named microcystins, which can cause chronic liver damage. Due to severe eutrofication, toxic Microcystis blooms have become a worldwide problem in many freshwater ecosystems such as drinking water reservoirs. Cyanophages form a natural biocontrol mechanism of cyanobacterial blooms, but {{little is known about}} freshwater cyanophages. In 2009 we were able to isolate both Microcystis aeruginosa colonies and cyanophages that infect Microcystis from eutrophic freshwater systems in Flanders, Belgium. In 2010 we could again isolate Microcystis colonies out of the same lakes, but <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> were absent. In this project we want to compare the diversity of Microcystis aeruginosa in the presence of <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> with the Microcystis diversity in the absence of <b>lytic</b> <b>phages,</b> in and between different lakes. Microcystis strains of 2009 are already characterized by HIP 1 (Highly Iterated Palindrome 1) profiling (Bittencourt-Oliveira et al. 2007, Comte et al. 2004), presence of three microcystin synthetase genes and sequencing of the full ITS (Internal transcribed spacer).

40|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of five completely sequenced Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes demonstrated that their diversification {{was achieved by}} a combination of DNA recombination events and an accumulation of point mutations. The five <b>phages</b> included <b>lytic</b> and temperate <b>phages,</b> both pac site and cos site, from three distinct geographical areas. The units of genetic exchange were either large, comprising the entire morphogenesis gene cluster, excluding the putative tail fiber genes, or small, consisting of one or maximally two genes or even segments of a gene. Many indels were flanked by DNA repeats. Differences in a single putative tail fiber gene correlated with the host ranges of the phages. The predicted tail fiber protein consisted of highly conserved domains containing conspicuous glycine repeats interspersed with highly variable domains. As in the T-even coliphage adhesins, the glycine-containing domains were recombinational hot spots. Downstream of a highly conserved DNA replication region, all <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> showed a short duplication; in three isolates the origin of replication was repeated. The <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> could conceivably be derived from the temperate phages by deletion and multiple rearrangement events in the lysogeny module, giving rise to occasional selfish phages that defy the superinfection control systems of the corresponding temperate phages...|$|R
50|$|In virology, {{temperate}} {{refers to}} the ability of some bacteriophages (notably coliphage Î») to display a lysogenic life cycle. Many (but not all) temperate phages can integrate their genomes into their host bacterium's chromosome, together becoming a lysogen as the phage genome becomes a prophage. A temperate phage is also able to undergo a productive, typically lytic life cycle, where the prophage is expressed, replicates the phage genome, and produces phage progeny, which then leave the bacterium. With phage the term virulent is often used as an antonym to temperate, but more strictly a virulent phage is one that has lost its ability to display lysogeny through mutation rather than a phage lineage with no genetic potential to ever display lysogeny (which more properly would be described as an obligately <b>lytic</b> <b>phage).</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{demonstrate}} bacteriocin production, depending on the sensitivity and labor intensiveness desired.To demonstrate their production, technicians stab inoculate multiple strains on separate multiple nutrient agar Petri dishes, incubate at 30 Â°C for 24 h., overlay each plate with one of the strains (in soft agar), incubate again at 30 Â°C for 24 h. After this process, the presence of bacteriocins can be inferred if there are zones of growth inhibition around stabs. This is the simplest and least sensitive way. It will often mistake phage for bacteriocins.Some methods prompt production with UV radiation, Mitomycin C, or heat shock. UV radiation and Mitomycin C are used because the DNA damage they produce stimulates the SOS response. Cross streaking may be substituted for lawns. Similarly, production in broth may be followed by dripping the broth on a nascent bacterial lawn, or even filtering it.

40|$|In this review, we assess {{our current}} {{understanding}} of the role of bacteriophages infecting the human gut bacterial community in health and disease. In general, bacteriophages contribute to the structure of their microbial communities by driving host and viral diversification, bacterial evolution, and by expanding the functional diversity of ecosystems. Gut bacteriophages are an ensemble of unique and shared phages in individuals, which encompass temperate phages found predominately as prophage in gut bacteria (prophage reservoir) and <b>lytic</b> <b>phages.</b> In healthy individuals, {{only a small fraction of}} the prophage reservoir is activated and found as extracellular phages. Phage community dysbiosis is characterized by a shift in the activated prophage community or an increase of <b>lytic</b> <b>phages,</b> and has been correlated with disease, suggesting that a proper balance between lysis and lysogeny is needed to maintain health. Consequently, the concept of microbial dysbiosis might be extended to the phage component of the microbiome as well. Understanding the dynamics and mechanisms to restore balance after dysbiosis is an active area of research. The use of phage transplants to re-establish health suggests that phages can be used as disease treatment. Such advances represent milestones in our understanding of gut phages in human health and should fuel research on their role in health and disease...|$|R
40|$|The human {{intestine}} harbors diverse {{communities of}} bacteria and bacteriophages. Given {{the specificity of}} phages for their bacterial hosts, there is growing interest in using phage therapies to combat the rising incidence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. A significant barrier to such therapies is the rapid development of phage-resistant bacteria, highlighting the {{need to understand how}} bacteria acquire phage resistance in vivo. Here we identify novel <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> in municipal raw sewage that kill Enterococcus faecalis, a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that resides in the human intestine. We show that phage infection of E. Â faecalis requires a predicted integral membrane protein that we have named PIPEF (for phage infection protein from E. faecalis). We find that PIPEF is conserved in E. Â faecalis and harbors a 160 -amino-acid hypervariable region that determines phage tropism for distinct enterococcal strains. Finally, we use a gnotobiotic mouse model of in vivo phage predation to show that the sewage phages temporarily reduce E. Â faecalis colonization of the intestine but that E. Â faecalis acquires phage resistance through mutations in PIPEF. Our findings define the molecular basis for an evolutionary arms race between E. Â faecalis and the <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> that prey on them. They also suggest approaches for engineering E.

40|$|Bacteriophage therapy of {{bacterial}} infections has received renewed attention {{owing to the}} increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A side effect of many antibiotics {{as well as of}} phage therapy with <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> is the release of cell wall components, e. g., endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria, which mediate the general pathological aspects of septicemia. Here we explored an alternative strategy by using genetically engineered nonreplicating, nonlytic phage to combat an experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. An export protein gene of the P. aeruginosa filamentous phage Pf 3 was replaced with a restriction endonuclease gene. This rendered the Pf 3 variant (Pf 3 R) nonreplicative and concomitantly prevented the release of the therapeutic agent from the target cell. The Pf 3 R phage efficiently killed a wild-type host in vitro, while endotoxin release was kept to a minimum. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections of mice with Pf 3 R or with a replicating <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> resulted in comparable survival rates upon challenge with a minimal lethal dose of 3. However, the survival rate after phage therapy with Pf 3 R was significantly higher than that with the <b>lytic</b> <b>phage</b> upon challenge with a minimal lethal dose of 5. This higher survival rate correlated with a reduced inflammatory response elicited by Pf 3 R treatment relative to that with the <b>lytic</b> <b>phage.</b> Therefore, this study suggests that the increased survival rate of Pf 3 R-treated mice could result from reduced endotoxin release. Thus, the use of a nonreplicating modified phage for the delivery of genes encoding proteins toxic to bacterial pathogens may open up a new avenue in antimicrobial therapy...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a {{relevant}} opportunistic pathogen involved in nosocomial infections that frequently shows low antibiotic susceptibility. One of its virulence factors {{is associated with}} the ability to adhere to surfaces and form virulent biofilms. This work describes the isolation and characterization of <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> capable of infecting antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. In addition, characterization of P. aeruginosa biofilms and the potential of newly isolated phages for planktonic and biofilm control was accessed. According to the results, the isolated phages showed different spectra of activity and efficiency of lysis. Four broad <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> were selected for infection of planktonic cells; however, despite their broad range of activity, two of the selected phages failed to efficiently control planktonic cultures. Therefore, only two phages (phiIBB-PAA 2 and phiIBB-PAP 21), highly capable of causing strong biomass reduction of planktonic cells, were tested against 24 h biofilms using a m. o. i. of 1. Both phages reduced approximately 1 - 2 log the biofilm population after 2 h of infection and reduction was further enhanced after 6 h of biofilm infection. However, biofilm cells of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 acquired resistance to phiIBB-PAP 21; consequently, {{an increase in the number}} of cells after 24 h of treatment was observed. Conversely, phage phiIB-PAA 2 for P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 continued to destroy biofilm cells, even after 24 h of infection. In these biofilms, phages caused a 3 log reduction in the number of viable counts of biofilm cells...|$|R

The image of 3 S infected UPEC host cells (NE) revealed multiple internal projections which showed progeny phages released out from host cells through these multiple sites. Whereas images of HNÎ¦ infected HN host cells showed central depression which illustrated that new phages released out through single exit point {{from the middle of}} cell.|$|R

(i) As previously shown for cellular genomes, each viral genome has a distinctive signature of short oligonucleotide abundances that pervade the entire genome and distinguish it from other genomes. (ii) The enteric temperate double-stranded (ds) phages, like enterobacteria, exhibit significantly high relative abundances of GpC = GC and significantly low values of TA, but no such extremes exist in ds <b>lytic</b> <b>phages.</b> (iii) The tetranucleotide CTAG is of statistically low relative abundance in most phages. (iv) The DAM methylase site GATC is of statistically low relative abundance in most phages, but not in P 1.

(v) The enteric temperate dsDNA phages form a coherent group: they are relatively close {{to each other and to}} their bacteria] hosts in average differences of dinucleotide relative abundance values. By contrast, the <b>lytic</b> dsDNA <b>phages</b> do not form a coherent group. This difference may come about because the temperate phages acquire more sequence characteristics of the host because they use the host replication and repair machinery, whereas the analyzed <b>lytic</b> <b>phages</b> are replicated by their own machinery.
