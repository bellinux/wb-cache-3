5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole</b> for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole.</b> Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he thought {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole,</b> the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 2014 Abuelazam filed a case {{in federal}} court against the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the United States Attorney General asking to be {{deported}} to Israel to face charges of an attempted murder that happened on October 1, 2009. Michigan authorities think the lawsuit is frivolous and {{expect it to be}} dismissed, noting that it is legally impossible because of Abuelazam's <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole</b> status, since convicts can not be deported until their full sentence is served.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2006, Bybee {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Kesser v. Cambra, granting habeas corpus to the defendant by a 6-5 vote. Richard Kesser {{had been convicted of}} hiring a hit man to kill his former wife and was sentenced to <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole.</b> During Kesser's trial in 1995, the prosecutor had eliminated three American Indian jurors and one Asian juror for racial reasons. Effectively granting Kesser a new trial, this decision laid out the current Batson analysis in the Ninth Circuit.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organization}} also opposes <b>life</b> imprisonment <b>without</b> <b>parole.</b> In 2016 CEDP surveyed {{death row}} inmates on their views of two California ballot measures, Propositions 62 and 66. Unsurprisingly, the inmates opposed Proposition 66, which calls for the speed-up of executions in California. However, inmates also opposed Proposition 62, since it enforces <b>life</b> imprisonment <b>without</b> <b>parole,</b> which is characterized by inmates, according to CEDP director Lilly Hughes, as [...] "just a death sentence with a different name." ...|$|R
25|$|July 1, 2008: The {{trial court}} granted Addison's request to {{bifurcate}} the sentencing {{portion of the}} trial, assuming a finding of guilt. Essentially, the determination by the jury regarding the death penalty will be made in two stages: first, whether the death penalty may be applied and, second, whether the death penalty should be applied, or if <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole</b> is the proper sentence. The court made numerous decisions throughout the year that allowed the death penalty to {{be presented to the}} jury.|$|E
25|$|Gilyard's {{background}} was dysfunctional; his father, Lorenzo Gilyard (February 24, 1927– October 24, 1999) {{was convicted of}} rape in 1970, his brother Darryl E. (also Daryle E.) (born February 12, 1953) was convicted of a drug-related murder in 1989 and sentenced to <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole,</b> and his sister, Patricia D. Dixon (born July 20, 1958), a prostitute, was convicted {{of the murder of}} a customer in 1983 and served a 10-year sentence. In his teen years, Gilyard was known to bully and sometimes beat women.|$|E
25|$|Haq's {{trial began}} in the King County Courthouse (Seattle) on April 14, 2008 and was covered on Court TV. On June 4, 2008, the jury found him not guilty on one count of {{attempted}} murder (for victim Carol Goldman); on the remaining counts, the jury declared itself to be hung. The judge declared a mistrial. His second trial commenced in late 2009, and he was found guilty on all counts, including aggravated first-degree murder, on December 15, 2009.

25|$|On September 16, 2005, Chai Soua Vang {{was found}} guilty of all six charges of first degree {{intentional}} homicide and three charges of attempted homicide by a jury of eight women and four men. On November 8, 2005, he was sentenced to six consecutive life terms plus seventy years (forty for two counts of attempted homicide plus five additional years for each count of homicide in the first degree); a sentence of <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole.</b> At the time, Wisconsin was one of 12 states in the United States that did not have the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma City {{also has}} its share of very brutal crimes, {{particularly}} in the 1970s. The worst of which occurred in 1978, when six employees of a Sirloin Stockade restaurant on the city's south side were murdered execution-style in the restaurant's freezer. An intensive investigation followed, and the three individuals involved, who also killed three others in Purcell, Oklahoma, were identified. One, Harold Stafford, died in a motorcycle accident in Tulsa not long after the restaurant murders. Another, Verna Stafford, was sentenced to <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole</b> after being granted a new trial after she had been sentenced to death. Roger Dale Stafford, considered the mastermind of the murder spree, was executed by lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Unanimous jury {{verdicts}} {{have been}} standard in US American law. This requirement was {{upheld by the}} Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases. When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation {{sometimes referred to as}} a hung jury), a mistrial is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in Ring v. Arizona, which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends <b>life</b> <b>without</b> <b>parole.</b>|$|E
