40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine {{whether there is a}} sign of <b>lowballing</b> in the initial audit engagement with a new auditor. I also examine how audit fees develop surrounding an auditor change. Auditors can be divided into big 4 and non-big 4 auditors. Therefore, companies can switch from big 4 or non-big 4 auditors into big 4 or non-big 4 auditors, hence there are four different types of auditor changes. I am interested in examining the effect of <b>lowballing</b> in these different kinds of auditor changes. The research is quantitative and regression analysis is utilized while analyzing the data. The data of this research covers information of US companies from 2008 to 2014 and it includes 30 626 firm-year observations. The effect of <b>lowballing</b> is assessed by examining the effect of auditor change on audit fee, and the similar analysis is performed while examining the <b>lowballing</b> within different auditor changes. The audit fee development is analyzed by comparing means of audit fees' natural logarithm. My findings indicate that there is a sign of <b>lowballing</b> in initial audit with a new auditor. However <b>lowballing</b> is also examined more thoroughly as the development of audit fees surrounding the auditor change is also investigated. Results indicate that for auditor switchers audit fees continue to grow from the initial engagement to the third year of engagement, and in the third year of the engagement the level of audit fees has exceeded the prior-change level of audit fees. The strongest effect of <b>lowballing</b> is found when companies switch from non-big 4 auditors to big 4 auditors...|$|E
40|$|Essay I: Management Forecast Consistency We posit that {{management}} forecasts that are predictable transformations of realized earnings without random errors are more informative than unbiased forecasts which manifest small but unpredictable errors, even if biased forecasts are less accurate. Consistent with this intuition, {{we find that}} managers who make consistent forecasting errors have a greater ability to influence investor reactions and analysts’ forecast revisions, even after controlling for the effect of accuracy. This effect is more economically significant and statistically robust than that of forecast accuracy. More sophisticated investors and experienced analysts are {{found to have a}} better understanding of the benefits of consistent management forecasts. Essay II: Biased Earnings Guidance: <b>Lowballing</b> versus Walk-Down In this study, we consider two forms of downward-biased managerial earnings forecasts that differ in the timing of their issuance. In <b>lowballing,</b> managers issue pessimistic forecasts at least one quarter ahead of earnings announcements. In walk-down, managers issue pessimistic forecasts less than one quarter before earnings announcements. We find that <b>lowballing</b> has a greater effect than walk-down on analysts’ forecast revisions and on establishing analysts’ expectations at beatable levels. <b>Lowballing</b> also generates greater short- and long-term market premiums associated with meeting and beating analysts’ forecasts than walk-down. Additional analysis reveals that managers who are more capable of processing financial information tend to lowball more frequently. These managers are also less likely to be fired...|$|E

40|$|Equilibrium {{models of}} dynamic {{insurance}} markets can be bifurcated according to underlying assumptions {{about whether or}} not insurers commit to long-term contracts. The difference is substantial in that commitment models imply price highballing over time while no-commitment models indicate price <b>lowballing.</b> Extant empirical studies provide mixed evidence, however. We use long-term care (LTC) insurance data, which allow us both to better control for heterogeneous, observable risk, to examine dynamic profitability and pricing in a relatively young, innovative insurance market. Our tests generally indicate temporal price <b>lowballing,</b> thereby providing support for the no-commitment models. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2004. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} analysts who display more {{consistent}} forecast errors {{have a greater}} effect on stock prices than analysts who provide more accurate but less consistent forecasts. This result leads to three implications. First, consistent analysts {{are less likely to}} be demoted to a less prestigious brokerage house and are more likely to be named All Star analysts. Second, analysts strategically "lowball" (that is, deliver downward-biased forecasts) to increase their consistency. This is because <b>lowballing</b> gives management an easier target to beat and, in turn, management grants analysts greater access to company information. Finally, the benefits of both consistency and <b>lowballing</b> increase while those of accuracy decrease when institutional/sophisticated investors are more of a presence in the analyst’s audience...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of {{experiments}} using laboratory markets designed to test several predictions of economic behavior generated by DeAngelo's (1980, 1981) characterization of the auditor-client contractual relationship. These predictions address (1) auditor pricing behavior {{in the face of}} start-up costs and transactions costs incurred by the client when switching auditors and (2) the effect of start-up costs and transactions costs on auditor independence. The research was motivated by the recent concern expressed by policy-makers regarding the link between auditor pricing behavior and independence and the unobservability of auditor prices and independence in the naturally-occurring market. It was reasoned that, given the difficulty of obtaining data in the real world, laboratory market research would be a good "first step" in evaluating theories linking auditor pricing behavior to independence. The laboratory markets used to test the predictions were run in two stages. In the first stage, which used a sealed offer auction, subjects offered to sell an imaginary service to a computerized buyer in a series of five-auction markets, with certain payoffs. The contract prices in {{the first phase of the}} experiment were used to measure equilibrium predictions in conditions of certain payoffs. The second stage of the experiment, which tested predictions concerning independence and equilibrium prices in a world of uncertain payoffs, was identical to the first stage, except that payments were conditional on outcomes which depended on a decision rule specified by the sellers after each auction. The results of the experiments show significant decreases in independence as theoretical quasi-rents available to the incumbent seller increased. Furthermore, evidence on the relationship between <b>lowballing</b> and independence was inconclusive, due to the inequality of quasi-rents observed in cells where <b>lowballing</b> was allowed or restricted. With respect to pricing behavior, <b>lowballing</b> was observed in all markets where it was permitted, and increased as the theoretical quasi-rent stream increased. In addition, theoretical equilibrium price predictions under conditions of certain payoffs are weakly predictive of winning offers made by sellers. However, in settings with conditional payoffs, equilibrium predictions were not achieved in the experiment, perhaps due to design artifacts, or to the existence of an unspecified, alternative equilibrium...|$|E

Rickey's contract as general manager was set to expire on October 28, 1950. Rickey's Dodgers stock was held on margin and he had fully levered life insurance policy. O'Malley <b>lowballed</b> Rickey with an offer of $346,000 (the purchase price). Rickey demanded $1 million ($ today).

[...] There were varying accounts about the sincerity of the offer because Zeckendorf and Pittsburgh Pirates owner John Galbreath were fraternity brothers, but {{there is a lot of}} evidence that he had a sincere interest in acquiring the team.

40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION We study a unit-demand, common-value, affiliated-signals auction {{model with}} two objects. We derive {{symmetric}} equilibrium for the sequential second-price auction, {{with and without}} revelation of the first-round winning bid. We demonstrate that auctioning objects in sequence generates a <b>lowballing</b> effect that reduces first-round revenue. Thus, revenue is greater in a single-round uniform auction for two objects than in a sequential auction with no bid announcement. When the first-round winning bid is announced, there are also two informational effects:apositiveeffect on second-round price and an ambiguous effect on first-round price. First-round revenue could be greater or smaller than with no bid announcement, and greater or smaller than the price in a uniform auction. As a result, total revenue in a sequential auction with winning-bid announcement could be greater or smaller than in a uniform auction. ...|$|E
40|$|Public-private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{are increasingly}} {{used to provide}} infrastructure services. Even though PPPs {{have the potential to}} increase efficiency and improve resource allocation, contract renegotiations have been pervasive. We show that existing accounting standards allow governments to renegotiate PPP contracts and elude spending limits. Our model of renegotiations leads to observable predictions: (i) in a competitive market, firms lowball their offers, expecting to break even through renegotiation, (ii) renegotiations compensate <b>lowballing</b> and pay for additional expenditure, (iii) governments use renegotiation to increase spending and shift the burden of payments to future administrations, and (iv) there are significant renegotiations {{in the early stages of}} the contract, e. g. during construction. We use data on Chilean renegotiations of PPP contracts to examine these predictions and find that the evidence is consistent with the predictions of our model. Finally, we show that if PPP investments are counted as current government spending, the incentives to renegotiate contracts to increase spending disappear. ...|$|E
40|$|Renegotiations of PPPs are pervasive. We {{argue that}} they can be used by incumbents to elude normal {{budgetary}} constraints and anticipate infrastructure spending. We show that renegotiations foster <b>lowballing</b> in ex ante auctions and both include additional compensations for the works originally contracted and add works not contemplated in the original contract. Nevertheless, spending anticipation is not inherent to PPPs, but the consequence of defective accounting standards. We show that if PPP investments are included as investments in the public budget spending caps prevent anticipation. Our thesis has three observable implications: (i) signi 8 ̆ 5 cant additional works should be added after renegotiating the contract; (ii) signi 8 ̆ 5 cant renegotiations should occur during construction; (iii) additional payments should be deferred to future administrations or users.

We derive symmetric equilibrium for {{the auction}} in which k 1 objects {{are sold in}} the first round and k 2 in the second round, with and without revelation of the first-round winning bids. We demonstrate that auctioning objects in sequence generates a <b>lowballing</b> effect that reduces first-round revenue. Thus, revenue is greater in a single-round, uniform auction for k = k 1 + k 2 objects than in a sequential uniform auction with no bid announcement. When the first-round winning bids are announced, we also identify two informational effects: a positive effect on second-round price and an ambiguous effect on first-round price. The expected first-round price can be greater or smaller than with no bid announcement, and greater or smaller than the expected price in a single-round uniform auction.

40|$|This paper {{adds to the}} scarce {{evidence}} on the determinants of audit fees in European countries outside the UK. The paper examines audit fees paid by companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 2002, {{which is the first}} year in which the disclosure of both audit fees and other fees paid to the auditor at the consolidated group level has been required by the Danish Financial Statements Act. Until 1 / 1 - 2005, listed companies are required to be audited by two independent auditors. Here, we have especially focused on the effect of this requirement on the pricing of audit fees. Our results indicate that having two independent auditors reduces total audit fees (most likely due to competitive pressure), but only for larger companies. We have used the core audit fee determinants model, which is a result of international research, with generic proxy variables for client size, complexity, risk profile and auditor size. Our findings indicate similarities with respect to the determining factors, but again a distinction has to be made between large and small companies. In small Danish companies, client size and complexity in a formal technical sense are decisive, which might indicate that audits of such companies involve a relatively large proportion of accessory accounting services in the audit service. In the generic large company, other decisive factors than client size include complexity of substance and general client risk, indicating that the typical audit of such companies is to a greater extent planned as regards risk and materiality. In contrast to most previous international research, analyses of the Danish data showed no general Big Four effect. However, our results indicate that PWC is <b>lowballing</b> in large companies and highballing in small companies. Finally, our results confirm international findings of a positive association between other fees and audit feesNo; keywords...|$|E
