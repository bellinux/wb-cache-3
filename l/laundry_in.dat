5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union <b>Laundry</b> <b>in</b> 1927.|$|E

Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a <b>laundry</b> <b>in</b> 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, mechanized washing systems had been added to most commercial <b>laundries.</b> However, <b>in</b> the tradition of art of hand <b>laundries</b> <b>in</b> France, the French immigrant held fast to hand finishing and ironing.

25|$|The Bateaux-Lavoirs {{were large}} {{flat-bottomed}} barges, protected by wooden or straw roofs, which were moored at designated places along the Seine {{and used by}} laundresses to wash <b>laundry</b> <b>in</b> the river. The laundresses paid the owners a fee {{for the use of}} the boat. There were some eighty of them in 1714; groups of six, moored two by two, were anchored across from Notre Dame, near the Pont Saint-Michel, and near the rue de l'Hôtel-Colbert. They preferred to be on the right bank, so the sunshine could dry the laundry.|$|E

In return, patrols from Givat Shaul guaranteed safe passage to Deir Yassin residents, in vehicles or on foot, passing through their neighborhood on the way to Jerusalem. Over time, Deir Yassin became a halfway site for Arab forces moving from Ein Karem and Malha to al-Qastal and Kolonia, which overlooked the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway.|$|E

25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, Filton was a small village, still {{detached}} from the city of Bristol to the south. Farming was the principal occupation. However, there was a large factory-like <b>laundry</b> <b>in</b> the village, opposite Filton House, owned by Samuel Shield. The Bristol to South Wales railway line passed through the village. There was a small station near the site of the current Abbey Wood Station. A much larger railway station, known as Filton Junction, opened in 1910, after the alternate rail route from Bristol to London was finished. In 1907 the northern terminus for Bristol Tramways was moved out from Horfield to Filton. Tram production in the tramway sheds commenced in 1908. The manufacture of aeroplanes started in the Bristol Tramway sheds in 1910. Aero-engine production started in 1920.|$|E

25|$|The East Room {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. The White House was unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung <b>laundry</b> <b>in</b> the bare East Room to dry. Although much of the White House was finished and decorated during Adams administration, the East Room was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the East Room. (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted too many of the trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined to appropriate funds to finish the room for fear it would look too much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the East Room partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E

This cost a single penny for bathing or washing and by June 1847 was receiving 4,284 people a year. This {{led to an}} Act of Parliament to encourage other municipalities {{to build their own}} and the model spread quickly throughout the East End. Timbs noted that [...] "... so strong was the love of cleanliness thus encouraged that women often toiled to wash their own and their children's clothing, who had been compelled to sell their hair to purchase food to satisfy the cravings of hunger".|$|E

Phoenix New Timess Troy Farah criticized the clip as one of the six worst music videos shot in a laundromat, and simply described it as [...] "Ewww".|$|E
500|$|New {{workshops}} {{built in}} 1901 allowed prisoners {{to work in}} bootmaking and tailoring, and from 1904, printing. Only {{a small fraction of}} prisoners were allocated to the workshops – 35 out of an average of 279 prisoners in 1902. In 1908, there were still few men employed in the workshops, 20 in tailoring, 15 in bootmaking, and 12 in mat making, with only half of these working at a time, and little improvement by the 1911 Royal Commission. The 20th century saw little change in the work prisoners did. There were similar workshops, with the addition of metal work, and similar jobs around the prison complex, including in the <b>laundry,</b> <b>in</b> the kitchen, and cleaning the prison. In 1984, 90% of prisoners were reported to be employed, either full-time or part-time. The meaningfulness of the work was nominal, as work was viewed as [...] "a management option rather than [...] production", but security concerns and discipline restricted the rehabilitative value of the work, and limited much of the work to jobs non-existent outside of prison.|$|E

None of the staff were trained in rehabilitation but were highly trained in security. The guards and staff of Alcatraz were subject to varying salaries. A new guard arriving in December 1948 was offered $3,024.96 per year, {{but there was a}} 6% deduction for retirement taxes a year (amounting to $181.50). The guards typically worked 40-hour weeks with five 8-hour shifts. Guards who worked between 6 pm and 6 am were given a 10% increase and guards doing overtime had to be reported and authorized by the warden. Officers generally had to pay 25 cents for meals and were charged $10 to rent an apartment on the island, to include laundry service, although larger families were charged anything from $20–43 a month for larger quarters and charged additional for <b>laundry.</b> <b>In</b> 1960, a Bureau of Prisons booklet revealed that the average prison population between 1935 and 1960 was 263; the highest recorded was 302 in 1937 and the lowest recorded was 222 in 1947.|$|E

Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon.

Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious.
