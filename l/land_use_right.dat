Sumera Peri-urban {{is both a}} {{space and}} a process, {{yet there is no}} cookie cutter {{definition}} that may be applied to developing cities encountering this phenomenon. Each space is constructed differently, and each process has different actors. This paper examines the role that the Communist Party of Vietnam plays in the creation of peri-urban space in Hanoi, and how this space affects residential and former agricultural <b>Land</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Right</b> holder’s livelihood opportunities. The notion of the peri-urban space has not fully been developed for Hanoi, thus I conclude that due to the establishment of policies made within the market economy, state-owned enterprises and corrupt practices on different governmental levels; these gaps and malpractices have led to illegal acts of land grabbing creating peri-urban spaces that disrupt <b>Land</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Right</b> holder’s livelihood practices.

40|$|Present-day China {{rural areas}} {{experience}} huge migration flows. Their most striking characteristic {{is a high}} geographical and temporal mobility. In particular, rural migrants keep {{going back and forth}} between origin villages and destination areas. In this paper, we show that this temporary feature of migration can be directly linked to land rights insecurity. Indeed, as village land property remains collective and as <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> can be periodically reallocated, out-migration can result in <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> deprivation. Moreover, the intensity of this land rights insecurity varies according to the village-level management of land, household and individual characteristics, and land plot contractual status. In this paper, we first delineate this idiosyncratic insecurity of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>rights,</b> to determine its effect on migration decisions through a simple model.

40|$|China is {{a socialist}} country and all land in China belongs to Chinese {{citizens}} as a whole. Article 10 of the 1982 Constitution upholds the Chinese land policy {{that reflects the}} traditional view of socialism - land of the country must be owned by the country (State) or its agricultural Collectives. State-owned enterprises or other organizations, which cannot own <b>land</b> themselves, may <b>use</b> <b>land</b> with permission from the State.

40|$|Summary. There {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} institutional change during the transformation from the centrally controlled system to a market-oriented economy in China since the early 1980 s. The socialist <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>right</b> as an institution of the out-going central planning system became an obstacle to the emerging land market for urban redevelopment, although land leasing as a new institution had created a real estate market primarily {{for the development of}} greenfield sites. From a case study of a district in Shanghai, it is discovered that rapid urban land redevelopment since 1992 has been greatly facilitated by the informal institution of a land development right. The land development right unlocks the process of land redevelopment in the central city, while the existing land users ’ <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>right</b> is taken care of during the gradual transition. Land use efficiency is improved to a great extent through land redevelopment to uses of higher productiv-ity. However, the informal and insecure institution of the land development right induces hasty land redevelopment. Assisted by a capricious land use planning regime, the land development right yields sub-optimal development. Clarification of property rights is the goal for further institutional change. 1...|$|E

There are 6 types of taxes directly about land and buildings, which are urban and township land use tax, farm land occupation tax, land appreciation tax, house property tax, deed tax and business tax in China. In order to promote the rational use of urban land and adjust the urban land income differential, Chinese government introduced urban and township land use tax, which levied on the town land use area {{in accordance with the}} fixed rate under specific circumstances.

30|$|The {{findings}} of this study indicates that to attain China’s grain security target in 2030 and 2050, the country must preserve and even increase its grain production areas through restrictions on the conversion of arable land for other purposes. This is because the simple preservation of existing arable land, through policies such as the “Red Line” policy, seems incapable of maintaining grain self-sufficiency rates at the target level by 2030 and 2050. The government should also encourage the reclamation of abandoned residential areas so that the land can once again be used for food production.
