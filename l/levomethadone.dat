50|$|<b>Levomethadone</b> (INN; L-Polamidon, L-Polamivet, Levadone, Levothyl), or levamethadone, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic and antitussive which is marketed in Europe {{and is used}} for pain management and in opioid maintenance therapy. In addition to {{being used as a}} pharmaceutical drug itself, <b>levomethadone,</b> or R-(−)-methadone, is the active enantiomer of methadone, having approximately 50x the potency of the S-(+)-enantiomer as well as greater μ-opioid receptor selectivity. Accordingly, it is about twice as potent as methadone by weight and its effects are virtually identical in comparison. In addition to its activity at the opioid receptors, <b>levomethadone</b> has been found to act as a weak competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex and as a potent noncompetitive antagonist of the α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Levomethadone</b> {{is listed}} under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961 {{and is a}} Schedule II Narcotic {{controlled}} substance in the US as an isomer of methadone (ACSCN 9250) and is not listed separately, nor is dextromethadone. [...] It is similarly controlled under the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz and similar laws in practically every other country.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially [...] {{those of the}} codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (codeine, ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) [...] which allows {{the use of a}} smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect , is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is {{a large part of the}} problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, <b>levomethadone,</b> ketobemidone, phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to aspirate while unconscious.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levomethadone</b> is a μ-opioid {{receptor}} agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone {{does not affect}} opioid receptors but binds to the glutamatergic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, and thus acts as a receptor antagonist against glutamate. Methadone {{has been shown to}} reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA antagonism. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. NMDA receptors have a very important role in modulating long-term excitation and memory formation. NMDA antagonists such as dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine (a dissociative anaesthetic, also M.O.A+.), tiletamine (a veterinary anaesthetic) and ibogaine (from the African tree Tabernanthe iboga, also M.O.A+.) are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. The dextrorotary form (d-methadone) acts as an NMDA antagonist and is devoid of opioid activity: it has been shown to produce analgesia in experimental models of chronic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In this {{methodology}} article a thermal threshold testing device designed to test nociception in cats was assessed in six dogs. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate baseline reproducibility of thermal thresholds obtained by the contact heat testing device, to assess the influence of acepromazine and <b>levomethadone</b> and fenpipramide in dogs. The relationship between change in nociceptive thermal threshold and the opioid′s plasma concentration was determined. Six adult beagle dogs received <b>levomethadone</b> (0. 2 mg/kg), acepromazine (0. 02 mg/kg) or saline placebo by intramuscular injection (IM) in a randomized cross-over design. Three baseline nociceptive thermal threshold readings were taken at 15 minutes intervals prior to treatment. Further readings were made at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 420 and 480 minutes after injection. A sedation score was assigned at every reading. Four saline placebo treatments were performed to assess baseline reproducibility. <b>Levomethadone</b> serum concentrations were measured prior and 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after drug dosing in a separate occasion. Results Acepromazine did not seem to increase the thermal threshold at any time. After <b>levomethadone</b> there was a significant rise of the thermal threshold between 15 to 120 minutes at serum concentrations between 22. 6 - 46. 3 ng/mL. Baseline reproducibility was stable in adult beagle dogs. Conclusion The thermal threshold testing system is a suitable device for nociceptive threshold testing in dogs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Opioid Maintenance Treatment (OMT) is an {{effective}} standard therapy for chronic opioid dependence. Opioid dependence and OMT {{are associated with a}} high prevalence of sexual dysfunction (SD), just like other substance dependencies. To the author’s knowledge, the importance of SD for OMT has never been investigated in direct comparison to other substance dependencies. Little is known about patients’ appraisal of OMT regarding SD. Data on the correlation between methadone dose and SD is unclear. Apart from methadone, <b>levomethadone</b> is the most often prescribed substance for OMT in Germany. Investigations on differences between methadone and <b>levomethadone</b> regarding SD are scarce. Aim: Investigation of SD in patients on methadone (MMT) and <b>levomethadone</b> (LMT) maintenance treatment compared to patients with other substance dependencies (POD). Assessment of patients’ appraisal, treatment satisfaction and need for advice. Investigation of the correlation between SD and opioid dose as well as substance differences. Methods: Survey of male and female patients on MMT (n= 41), LMT (n= 54) and POD (n= 90). Sexual function was assessed using a questionnaire including patients’ general self-rating, International Index of Erectile Function and Female Sexual Function Index. Results: 69. 1 % of patients on OMT and 18. 2 % of POD reported sexual dysfunction (p< 0. 001). POD were more satisfied with their sexual life (p= 0. 023). 62. 4 % reported deterioration of sexual function due to OMT. 55. 6 % liked to end OMT because of SD. 51. 4 % expressed the wish for medical advice because of SD, which only 15. 6 % had already received. A positive correlation between general self-rated SD and methadone equivalent dose was found (p= 0. 001), in particular in doses above 120 mg. Patients on MMT reported more erectile dysfunction than patients on LMT (p= 0. 032). Conclusion: The study hints at a high relevance of SD in OMT compared to other substance dependencies. It also indicates that many patients on OMT wish for more medical advice on SD. The findings suggest that SD could be associated with higher doses of methadone and <b>levomethadone.</b> It could be assumed that especially in patients receiving high doses and suffering from SD a dose reduction could be useful. Furthermore, the data hints at benefits of LMT compared to MMT regarding erectile function. It also suggests that SD could be an incentive to achieve opioid abstinence. The findings of this study should be confirmed by conducting studies with a greater number of cases and studies with interventional design...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{investigate}} regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in heroin-dependent patients during withdrawal and to assess the relation between these changes and duration of heroin consumption and withdrawal data. The rCBF was measured using brain SPECT with Tc- 99 m-HMPAO in 16 heroin-dependent patients during heroin withdrawal. Thirteen patients received <b>levomethadone</b> {{at the time of the}} SPECT scans. The images were analyzed both visually and quantitatively, a total of 21 hypoperfused brain regions were observed in 11 of the 16 patients. The temporal lobes were the most affected area, hypoperfusions of the right and left temporal lobe were observed in 5 and 5 patients, respectively. Three of the patients had a hypoperfusion of the right frontal lobe, 2 patients showed perfusion defects in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe and left parietal lobe. The results of the quantitative assessments of the rCBF were consistent with the results of the qualitative findings. The stepwise regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0. 54) between the dose of <b>levomethadone</b> at the time of the SPECT scan and the rCBF of the right parietal lobe. Other significant correlations between clinical data and rCBF were not found. The present results suggest brain perfusion abnormalities during heroin withdrawal in heroin-dependent patients, which are not due to the conditions of withdrawal. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} shock wave treatment on cutaneous nerve function, compared {{with the effects of}} local nerve block and sedation. Animals: 18 clinically sound Swiss Warmbloods. Procedure: Horses were randomly allocated to 3 groups and received different amounts and types of shock waves (extracorporeal shock wave treatment [ESWT] or radial pressure wave treatment [RPWT]). Horses were sedated with xylazine and <b>levomethadone.</b> Shock waves were applied to the lateral palmar digital nerve {{at the level of the}} proximal sesamoid bones on 1 forelimb. Skin sensitivity was evaluated by means of an electrical stimulus at the coronary band before and 5 minutes after sedation and at 4, 24, and 48 hours after application of ESWT or RPWT. On the contralateral forelimb, skin sensitivity was tested before and 10 minutes after an abaxial sesamoid nerve block. Results: No significant changes in skin sensitivity were detected, regardless of the shock wave protocol applied. Mean reaction thresholds after sedation were more than twice the baseline thresholds. After the abaxial sesamoid block, no reaction was recorded in any of the horses. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Application of ESWT or RPWT to the palmar digital nerve had no effect on cutaneous sensation distal to the treated region for at least 2 days after application. The analgesic effect of sedation on reaction to electrical stimuli was distinct but varied among horses...|$|E
40|$|Stress has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on pain perception and may result in either increased or decreased sensitivity depending on the challenging conditions. Accordingly, stress appears to {{play a central role}} in many functional somatoform disorders such as fibromyalgia. To create a long lasting stressful situation, male Wistar rats were exposed to a single restraint stress for 1 h only once or over periods of either one or two weeks. The effect on nociception was evaluated using the Randall-Selitto- and the tail-flick-test. After two weeks the animals exhibited a significant hyperalgesia in both tests. Due to the higher effect size and better comparability for pressure pain of tender points in human fibromyalgia syndrome further nociceptive testing was restricted to the Randall-Selitto-test. Additional analysis showed that rats with increased pain sensitivity also displayed elevated plasma levels of corticosterone with an accompanied enlargement of adrenal glands indicating a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which play a key role in the stress response. In order to test for a possible correlation of HPA-axis dysregulation and hyperalgesia a persistent increase in plasma corticosterone was generated in Wistar rats by the administration of different concentrations of corticosterone via drinking water for two weeks. Additionally the measurement of plasma ACTH and histological examination of the adrenal cortex, which represents the site of corticosterone synthesis, were preformed. Similar to the restraint stressed rats animals consuming different concentrations of corticosterone in drinking water exhibited also a significant mechanical hyperalgesia, indicating a dose-dependency to the amount of corticosterone in drinking water. These animals showed as well dose-dependent a concurrent reduction of the adrenal zona fasciculata and reduced ACTH plasma levels. On the other hand, the restraint animals exhibited an enlarged adrenal cortex and increased ACTH plasma levels. Thus it is the concluded that within a dysregulated HPA-axis, especially the persistently elevated plasma levels of corticosterone are associated with hyperalgesia. For further elucidation of this relationship studies were carried out on glucocorticoid receptors. For this purpose, from restrained and corticosterone drinking animals spleen lymphocytes were obtained, which were used for determination of responsiveness and density of glucocorticoid receptors. The lymphocytes of these animals showed a reduced sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors with an accompanied increase of receptor density, which is assumed to be an attempted decompensation mechanism. Furthermore, it supposed that the observed glucocorticoid receptor alterations may contribute to increased pain sensitivity, since a number of nociception-modulating neurotransmitters is affected by this receptor. In order to validate the hyperalgesia models and to obtain additional information on the underlying mechanisms, different drugs which are used in the therapy of functional somatoform pain disorders were tested by oral administration. In addition to the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Milnacipran, the opioide <b>levomethadone</b> was found to be active in both models while the NMDA-antagonist ketamine abolished mainly the restraint stress-induced hyperalgesia. In contrast, no effect was observed for the COX-inhibitor diclofenac in both stress- and corticosterone-induced hyperalgesia. The results indicate that a dysregulated corticosterone secretion leads in both hyperalgesia models to glucocorticoid receptor alterations, resulting in an increased pain perception due the influence on nociception-modulating neurotransmitters. Finally, both models seem to possess predictive validity as inhibition of hyperalgesia could be demonstrated for drugs used therapeutically to treat of functional somatoform pain disorders. Under animal welfare aspects the corticosterone-induced hyperalgesia model is a new animal friendly experimental method for mimicking stress effects on nociception...|$|E
