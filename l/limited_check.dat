5000|$|On 1 May, Dollfuss' {{government}} {{proclaimed the}} May Constitution (Maiverfassung), which diminished the term Republic and instead {{used as the}} official name of the state [...] "Federal State of Austria" [...] (Bundesstaat Österreich), though the constitution actually reduced the individual states' autonomy. The Federal Council was retained, though only as a significantly <b>limited</b> <b>check</b> on the Federal government. Rather than establishing the composition of a fifty-nine member National Council through direct suffrage, this was accomplished by four [...] "Councils" [...] representing the professionals from Austrian Culture, State affairs, the States of Austria (Länder) and Economic affairs (the latter elected by seven corporations supposedly representing workers and employers). The National Council lost its power to initiate legislation but was still expected to approve decrees from the government. All essential power lay with the Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler), who appointed his government single-handedly, and the Federal President (Bundespräsident), who named the Chancellor.As with Antonio de Salazar's 1933 constitution (and the Estado Novo regime in whole), the Maiverfassung promoted a Catholic corporatism which bore a strong resemblance to the principles outlined in Quadragesimo anno, rejecting capitalism and socialism.|$|E

It suggests the singular value decomposition (SVD) {{as a useful}} tool for detecting local weak and non-identification. This decomposition is useful for checking rank conditions of identification, identification strength, and it also offers parameter space ‘identification patterns’. With respect to other methods of identification the singular value decomposition is particularly easy to apply and offers an intuitive interpretation. We suggest a simple algorithm for analyzing identification and an algorithm for finding a set of the most identifiable set of parameters. We also demonstrate that the use of bivariate and multiple correlation coefficients of parameters provides only <b>limited</b> <b>check</b> of identification problems.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{drilling}} operations in offshore Arctic regions with harsh weather conditions is steadily growing {{due to the}} {{significant increase in the}} need for oil and gas. In order to still have an acceptable working environment and protection of the drilling and pipe handling equipment it is necessary to make improvements of upcoming drilling rigs. One of the items needed to be developed is the derrick/drill tower, which nowadays is a framework structure with only a limited protection against the severe weather conditions. A low weight of the derrick is desired in order to achieve improved stability conditions of the rig and hence be able to obtain a higher deck load capacity. The objectives with the current work were to propose a weight-optimized basic design of a stressed skin derrick and to compare it to a covered conventional truss derrick with respect to weight and strength. Aker MH has provided data about a conventional truss derrick which was used as a reference derrick for input of loads, dimensions and weights. In order to ensure enough structural strength, structural analyses have been carried out using FEM. The optimization software, LSOPT, has been used to weight-optimize the outer plating of the structure against yielding. The buckling strength of the plates and stiffeners was checked analytically and modifications were done to fulfill the buckling criteria. A limited buckling check of some stringers was also carried out to study the influence of the stringer weights. After the optimization against yielding, a structural weight of 619 mT was achieved and with the adjustments made for the buckling stability of plates and stiffeners a weight was obtained at 641 mT. The initially chosen stringers were shown to be significantly heavier than necessary and with the <b>limited</b> <b>check</b> and modifications of the stringers a final weight of 550 mT was achieved. The weight of a covered conventional truss derrick is estimated to 590 mT. The obtained weight of the stressed skin derrick is less than the covered conventional truss derrick. Further weight reduction potential exists if optimizations of stiffeners and stringers against the buckling criteria are carried out. The main conclusion of the work is that further developments of the stressed skin derrick should be of interest to carry out in order to have the possibility of using it in the future...|$|E

40|$|Fixed or static limit sensing is {{employed}} in control centers {{to ensure that}} spacecraft parameters remain within a nominal range. However, many critical parameters, such as power system telemetry, are time-varying and, as such, their 'nominal' range is necessarily time-varying as well. Predicted data, manual <b>limits</b> <b>checking,</b> and widened limit-checking ranges are often employed {{in an attempt to}} monitor these parameters without generating excessive limits violations. Generating predicted data and manual <b>limits</b> <b>checking</b> are both resource intensive, while broadening limit ranges for time-varying parameters is clearly inadequate to detect all but catastrophic problems. OSA provides a low-cost solution by using analytically selected data as a reference upon which to base its limits. These limits are always defined relative to the time-varying reference data, rather than as fixed upper and lower limits. In effect, OSA provides individual limits tailored to each value throughout all the data. A side benefit of using relative limits is that they automatically adjust to new reference data. In addition, OSA provides a wealth of analytical by-products in its execution...|$|R

This requirements {{leads to a}} large amount of data that needs to be stored and later analyzed. For example, a data stream of 4 Mbits/s and a test time of thirty minutes would yield 900 Mbytes of raw data.
