40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to the study of {{transition}} fronts of nonlocal Fisher-KPP equations in time heterogeneous media. We first construct transition fronts with prescribed interface <b>location</b> <b>functions,</b> which are natural generalizations of front <b>location</b> <b>functions</b> in homogeneous media. It it shown that these transition fronts have exact decaying rates as the space variable tends to infinity. Then, by the general results on space regularity of transition fronts of nonlocal evolution equations proven in the authors' earlier work (ShSh 14 - 4), these transition fronts are continuously differentiable in space. We show that their space partial derivatives have exact decaying rates as the space variable tends to infinity. Finally, we study the asymptotic stability of transition fronts. It is shown that transition fronts attract those solutions whose initial data decays as fast as transition fronts near infinity and essentially above zero near negative infinity...|$|R

Although the HSS is a unique master database, it can be distributed into different nodes for reliability and scalability reasons. In this case, a Subscriber <b>location</b> <b>function</b> (SLF) is needed to find the HSS that handles a particular user. When a user request reaches the I-CSCF {{at the edge of the}} administrative domain, this entity queries the SLF for the corresponding HSS and then, to prevent the S-CSCF from having to query the SLF again, sends the HSS address to the S-CSCF in the P-User-Database header. Then the S-CSCF will be able to directly query the HSS to get information about the user (e.g. authentication information during a registration).|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} Submodular set {{function}} {{has recently}} emerged as a powerful modeling tool for various summarization problems. Submodular functions naturally model notions of coverage, information, representation and diversity. Moreover, several important combinatorial optimization problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example, the set cover problem is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. The set cover function attempts to find a subset of objects which cover a given set of concepts. For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document. This is an instance of set cover. Similarly, the facility location problem is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility <b>Location</b> <b>function</b> also naturally models coverage and diversity. Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a Determinantal point process to model diversity. Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure {{can also be seen}} as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular. Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} identification and estimation of a censored nonparametric location scale-model. We first show {{that in the case}} where the <b>location</b> <b>function</b> is strictly less than the (fixed) censoring point for all values in the support of the explanatory variables, the <b>location</b> <b>function</b> is not identified anywhere. In contrast, when the <b>location</b> <b>function</b> is greater or equal to the censoring point with positive probability, the <b>location</b> <b>function</b> is identified on the entire support, including the region where the <b>location</b> <b>function</b> is below the censoring point. In the latter case we propose a simple estimation procedure based on combining conditional quantile estimators for various higher quantiles. The new estimator is shown to converge at the optimal nonparametric rate with a limiting normal distribution. A small-scale simulation study indicates that the proposed estimation procedure performs well in finite samples.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} modeling heteroscedasticity in semiparametric regression analysis of crosssectional data. Existing work in this setting is rather limited and mostly adopts a fully nonparametric variance structure. This approach is hampered by curse of dimensionality in practical applications. Moreover, the corresponding asymptotic theory is largely restricted to estimators that minimize certain smooth objective functions. The asymptotic derivation thus excludes semiparametric quantile regression models. To overcome these drawbacks, we study a general class of location-dispersion regression models, in which both the <b>location</b> <b>function</b> and the dispersion function are semiparametrically modeled. We establish uniﬁed asymptotic theory which is valid for many commonly used semiparametric structures such as the partially linear structure and single-index structure. We provide easy to check sufficient conditions and illustrate them through examples. Our theory permits non-smooth location or dispersion functions, thus allows for semiparametric quantile heteroscedastic regression and robust estimation in semiparametric mean regression. Simulation studies indicate significant efficiency gain in estimating the parametric component of the <b>location</b> <b>function.</b> The results are applied to analyzing a data set on gasoline consumption...|$|E
