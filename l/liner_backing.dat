Normal ceramic tiles and a <b>liner</b> <b>backing</b> have a mass-efficiency (EM) value of 3 {{compared}} to normal steel armour, while it fulfills STANAG 4569. The new nano-crystalline ceramic materials should increase the hardness compared to current ceramics by 70% and the weight reduction is 30%, therefore the EM value is larger than 4.

5000|$|The fourth {{inning of}} this game was {{especially}} eventful. In the top, Bake McBride and Manny Trillo opened with back-to-back singles off Vern Ruhle. Garry Maddox then hit a low <b>liner</b> <b>back</b> to the mound that Ruhle reached down and appeared to catch (replays were inconclusive). At first, plate umpire Doug Harvey signaled [...] "no catch", but then when Ruhle threw to first baseman Art Howe to either double off Trillo or retire Maddox (according to the call), Harvey called time to confer with the other umpires. Ed Vargo and Bob Engel concurred that Ruhle caught the ball, and Harvey changed his ruling. Howe, seeing McBride at third base, then ran down and touched second for an apparent triple play as Phillies manager Dallas Green and the Phillie infielders (especially Pete Rose) heatedly protested that Ruhle trapped the ball. Meanwhile, Harvey allowed McBride to return to second (determining that his original ruling of [...] "no catch" [...] was what caused McBride to run to third) and declared Trillo out from being doubled off first. Astros manager Bill Virdon protested that decision, but to no avail. The umpires then consulted with National League President Chub Feeney, who was seated {{in the first row}} behind home plate, and Feeney agreed with the ruling. Green and the Phillies then resumed their heated disagreement, and both the Phillies and the Astros decided to play the game under protest. After a total of 20 minutes worth of arguing from both sides, it hardly mattered as Larry Bowa grounded out for the third out.|$|R

5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a full load of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The <b>liner</b> caught <b>back</b> up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} bifurcation {{solution is}} presented for axisymmetric wrinkling on a lined pipe under axial compression without internal pressure. The internal liner consists of corrosion-resistant alloy (CRA), {{it is not}} metallurgically bonded to the carbon steel backing pipe, and it {{is assumed to be}} in a snug fit condition: i. e. there is no gap between the <b>liner</b> and the <b>backing</b> pipe, but also no prestress that would lead to a positive contact or gripping pressure between the <b>liner</b> and the <b>backing.</b> The backing is assumed to be much thicker than the liner, so that wrinkling-related deformations of the backing pipe can be neglected. The solution indicates that the incipient wrinkling strain for the snug-fit pipe without any imperfections {{is the same as the}} incipient wrinkling strain for a single pipe with (5 / 3) times the wall thickness of the liner, and the same midsurface diameter, as determined by the solution of Batterman (1965) for the case of small strains, or Peek (2000 a) for the case of finite strains. For the case when the liner-pipe friction is included the factor (5 / 3) increases slightly. A positive contact pressure due to prestress or internal pressure raises the wrinkling strain, whereas imperfections (e. g. at seam or girth welds) reduces it. The snug-fit solution accounts for neither, but nevertheless provides a useful reference wrinkling strain, and can be used to validate numerical solutions, and it gives a bifurcation modeshape and wrinkle length that can be used in numerical models to investigate post-bifurcation behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} {{case studies}} were examined {{to determine how}} different liner structures or plastic additives affect torque degradation.

Both torque studies provided a starting point for the application torque range for use in production.
