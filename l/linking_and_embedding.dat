[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In the present study, two CFH were designed in combination with ethical problem-solving guidelines. Two types of <b>links,</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>links</b> <b>and</b> question <b>links,</b> were used to foster crisscrossing navigation of the CFH and enhance performance in problem solving in engineering ethics. The main {{purpose of the study was}} two-fold: (a) Determine if the two types of <b>links,</b> question <b>and</b> <b>embedded,</b> differ significantly in promoting students' engineering ethical problem solving performance and on usage of website; (b) Determine if epistemological beliefs and moral judgment influence students' engineering ethical problem solving performance. Results indicated there were significant differences in ethical problem solving performance between the two groups who used two CFH. The question <b>link</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>link</b> groups used the three cases similarly, however, question links were more frequently used than the <b>embedded</b> <b>links,</b> <b>and</b> in the question link group, a significantly larger number of participants used the question links. The influence of the use of question <b>links</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>links</b> on participants' performance was different as well. Results also indicated that epistemological development was not a significant predictor for ethical problem solving performance in the two groups; while participants' moral reasoning skills did not influence ethical problem solving performance in the question link group, for the embedded link group, both P scores and N 2 scores were significant predictors for total case analysis scores...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the spatial-temporal dynamic status of Scotia-Fundy herring stocks in NAFO {{divisions}} 4 WX in the Bay of Fundy region and the Scotian Shelf. This thesis uses an alternative method to examine the dynamic in-season status of fish movement {{in space and time}} over the fishing season. Two models are presented based on Bayesian uncertainty statistical theory. A working computer decision model is developed to estimate the weekly stock abundance by area. A simulation model is developed to examine the strategic plan of the fishery. A visualized computer application tool, MapTest has been developed to implement the above two models. This application uses OLE (object <b>linked</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded)</b> techniques to present fishing data on a GIS (geographic information system) mapping system <b>and</b> <b>link</b> <b>and</b> <b>embed</b> to a Visual Basic application. Using MapTest, fishery scientists can estimate the stock abundance based on the available catch data and simulate the impact of alternative catch scenarios. This thesis used the MapTest application to analyze the catch and estimated abundance of the five spawning areas in the 4 WX herring fishery and processed three estimated caches year analyses. The computer application developed and illustrated here provides valuable information to assist decision makers in managing the fishery in real on a spatial-temporal basis throughout the fishing year...|$|R
40|$|The Web is ephemeral. Pages change frequently, and it {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} to find data or follow a link after the underlying page evolves. We present Zoetrope, a system that enables interaction with the historical Web (pages, <b>links,</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded</b> data) that would otherwise be lost to time. Using a number of novel interactions, the temporal Web can be manipulated, queried, and analyzed from the context of familar pages. Zoetrope is based on a set of operators for manipulating content streams. We describe these primitives and the associated indexing strategies for handling temporal Web data. They form the basis of Zoetrope and enable our construction of new temporal interactions and visualizations. ACM Classification: H 5. 2 [Information interfaces an...|$|R

50|$|Peer {{production}} {{does not}} produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the price mechanism or corporate hierarchy to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the capitalist market (though it can be <b>linked</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded</b> in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; {{as a mode of}} governance it differs from traditional linear hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective public property; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike private property, peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive - its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} a cell at molecular level, a notion of a "gene" is neither necessary nor helpful. It is sufficient to consider the molecules (i. e., chromosomes, transcripts, proteins) and their interactions to describe cellular processes. The downside of the resulting high resolution is that it becomes very tedious to address features on the organismal and phenotypic levels with a language based on molecular terms. Looking for the missing link between biological disciplines dealing with different levels of biological organization, we suggest {{to return to the}} original intent behind the term "gene". To this end, we propose to investigate whether a useful notion of "gene" can be constructed based on an underlying notion of function, and whether this can serve as the necessary <b>link</b> <b>and</b> <b>embed</b> the various distinct gene concepts of biological (sub) disciplines in a coherent theoretical framework. In reply to the Genon Theory recently put forward by Klaus Scherrer and Jürge n Jost in this journal, we shall discuss a general approach to assess a gene definition that should then be tested for its expressiveness and potential cross-disciplinary relevance...|$|R
