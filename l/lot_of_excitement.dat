While there she was reunited with Johnny (Chris Coghill), her first love. Metcalfe said this caused a [...] "real mix of emotions for Mercedes". She went on to elaborate {{that there was a}} lot her character wanted to say to Johnny but [...] "at the same time she doesn't see the point. There's a lot of anger there. But there's also a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> for Mercedes as she sees him again, because he was the guy who won her heart for the first time. The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E

[...] "As an artist with that kind of talent and vision emerges, it creates a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement,</b> and ticket sales worldwide demonstrate that people are really excited to see the show. Over {{the course of the next}} many months we're trying to play to as many people in as many places as possible", Fogel added. [...] "It's an across the board home run." [...] Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary. The Monster Ball sold out shows in Toronto, Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city. In Los Angeles, to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets, a second performance was announced prior to the onsale of the first shows, and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out. Billboard estimated that by the time the tour wraps up in 2011, it would have grossed close to US$200million worldwide.|$|E

[...] As with DecembeRadio's {{previous}} album, Scotty Wilbanks {{was hired as}} the producer. [...] Said Reedy of Wilbanks, [...] "We just have a kindredship as musicians and as players.... There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> and passion that comes from his end.... big thing for us is having a really good time. [...] If we're not {{having a good time}} making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to be on top of his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E

His big bands were characterized by big brassy arrangements, odd meters that somehow always swung, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> trumpet solos by Ellis, and an often visceral excitement. Although not equal to his best records such as Electric Bath, this late recording of Ellis' band is filled with all these traits, and thus exudes <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> and electricity". The Penguin Guide to Jazz said [...] "There are signs that Ellis was moving in a more commercial direction at this point, perhaps aware that jazz was still losing ground to pop and rock, though {{he must have known}} that as long as popular music was dance-driven it was unlikely that his work would have a major market presence".|$|R
40|$|Distributed Multi-Agent Intelligent Systems {{technology}} has generated <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> {{in recent years}} because of its promise as a new paradigm for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing software systems. Communication {{is the most important}} feature for meaningful interaction among agents in multi-agent systems. Communication enables agents to interact and share information to perform tasks to achieve their goals. Agent communication languages provide a standard in the protocol and language used in the agent communication, but can’t provide a standard in ontology, because ontology depends on the subject and concept of the communication. This lack of standardization, which impedes communication between agents, is known as the interoperability problem. In order to obtain semantic interoperability in distributed multi-agent Systems, agents need to agree on the basis of different ontologies. In this paper we propose a communication layers to outline the communication between agents. In addition a Multiplatform Communication System (MPCS) architecture is proposed to provide a highly flexible and scalable system. In MPCS architecture, a Dynamic Ontology Mapping System for Agent Communication (DOMAC) is proposed based on different mapping approaches in order to provide help in the conversation among different agents...|$|R
