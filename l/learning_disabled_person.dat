This article {{describes}} and discusses performance work devised by a <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person.</b> The generative {{process and the}} relationship between the author and the artist are examined. Central to the argument presented is the potential of this work to manifest a challenge to, and an alternative reading of, notions of beauty in live performance, that is predicated upon the materiality of disability rather than any compensation for the disabled performer or dance author. The article foregrounds a specific, embodied and coherent practice that is revealed as a radical turn in the representation of a doubly marginalized cultural context, that of disability and that of rural Wales. Such conceptualization and manifestation of an ?alternative beauty? is seen as opening a new aesthetic address that does not owe its provenance to the discourse of art in the community or to the arts therapies, and is instead indicative of an imperative to consider ways of perceiving performance outside of current ideological perspectives.

40|$|Sibling {{relationships}} are {{significant in the}} lives of people who have a learning disability. They usually form a major part of their social network and there is an expectation at government, social and family level that siblings will provide some degree of support in the event of parental decline. A mixed methodological approach was taken, utilizing a survey in Stage one and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) at Stage two. In the latter, 15 face to face semi-structured interviews were conducted to support the research aim of listening to the voices of adult siblings of people who have a learning disability, regarding their personal wishes or preferences in relation to a future support role. Three overarching themes were identified from nine superordinate themes: impact of learning disability, services, and sibling needs and recommendations. Key messages raised were that learning disability has a significant impact upon sibling lives throughout the life course; although the areas and degree of impact varies widely between individuals, most participants voiced concern about the future, particularly when older parents would {{no longer be able to}} provide care. Service issues were raised, as was the difference in role and function between families and service providers. In order to better meet sibling needs and recommendations for lifelong support, information and advice, more productive partnerships need to be established, particularly in the area of futures planning. This research presents the clear perspective that tangible benefits may be available as a direct result of association with learning disability. It also provides a deeper insight into parental response to learning disability alongside further rational for a lack of futures plans and why siblings may not want to co-reside with a <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person.</b> These findings have relevance to service providers, siblings of learning disabled people, students in the field of health and social care and wider society. ...|$|E

Lighting Design - Becky Mitchell. /Production Staff TFTS. /Publicity nad {{photography}} - Nick Strong. Performers - Carwyn Daniel, Andrew Evans, Helen Evans, Sam Evans, Heather Giles, Adrian Jones, Patricia Marks, Lucy Smith, Jo Strong, Edward Wadsworth. Helen Williams. Description: 1. What kind {{of dance}} performance might evolve through {{the agency of}} a disabled dance author? 2. In what ways might this work interrogate aesthetic principles of beauty in dance and the dancer?s body? 3. How does the disabled and untrained dancer see her/himself? 4. Can the large discrepancies in technical performance of choreography in this work, be perceived as contributions to a radical challenge to conventional notions of beauty and entertainment in performance? How might the inscription of disability in bodies reveal radical beauty and redefine new performance in rural Wales? How might the disabled artist communicate specific artistic visions and proceed through the creative process? How might asking these questions through practice, contribute to the process of a minority culture defining itself within Britain?A new piece authored by Edward Wadsworth and Cyrff Ystwyth. Wadsworth is a <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person.</b> ?Psychedelia? developed as a response by Wadsworth and the company to media reports of high levels of hate crime and hate speech committed against learning disabled people in Britain. This difficult and disturbing theme was threaded through Wadsworths? interest with the 1960 ?s cultural cliches of psychedelic music and fashion. Through discussion led by the Investigator embodied articulations of resistance and escape were formulated into choreography. The result was a performance that expressed issues of power and powerlessness, and ultimately dealt with the experience of dependancy, and the necessity for, care and support, whilst offering a challenge to social constructions of disabled people as deviant and as Snyder and Mitchell state: ?The re-deployment of disabled bodies serves as more than a tool of integration; it becomes a tool of art itself by reclaiming that which has been historically viewed as dysfunctional (Snyder and Mitchell 2001 : 386).

40|$|Abstract. Low {{social status}} is {{frequently}} ascribed to <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> children and adolescents. This article reviews published investigations of social status among <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> children, adolescents, and adults. Results indicate that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, not all or even most <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> {{are held in}} low esteem by their teachers, parents, and peers. In fact, some <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> students are popular. Therefore, as a group, the <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> may merely be {{at greater risk for}} attaining low social status. <b>Learning</b> <b>disabled</b> (LD) children's social skills have been a major focus for learning disability researchers during the last 10 years. Most of this research, which has predominantly examined LD children's social status, has led to the conclu-sion that relatively low social acceptance is com-mon among the <b>learning</b> <b>disabled</b> (Bryan & Bry...|$|R
40|$|Intended {{for adults}} with {{learning}} disabilities, this paper offers time management strategies in a work-sheet format. The paper, {{which was written}} {{with the assistance of}} adults with learning disabilities, explains setting goals, planning, organizing time, and avoiding stress. Guidelines for goal setting include: focus on the present; set goals that are measurable and have a beginning and an end; divide large goals into small parts; set a tentative time limit for the completion of each goal; establish some long-term goals; set realistic goals; revise goals if progress is not being made. Planning suggestions include setting priorities, maintaining flexibility, and scheduling a daily planning time. Time management suggestions include: make "to do " lists; use calendars or appointment books; and avoid time traps. Time management suggestions for managing a household are specifically discussed and include paying bills; buying, keeping and preparing food; doing housecleaning and laundry; organizing space; and sharing responsibility. The final section offers ideas for avoiding stress such as: organize yourself; keep a daily journal; accept and embrace change; and set aside time for relaxation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} among death anxiety, attitudes toward <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> and counselor effectiveness. The subjects of this study were 50 masters degree students at The University of Arizona. All subjects were volunteers and were enrolled in the Rehabilitation Counseling graduate program. Additionally, they had all completed a five-week Human Resource Development Program. The subjects were individually administered the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), the Attitudes toward <b>Disabled</b> <b>Persons</b> Scale (ATDP), Form B, and the 16 stimulus expressions from the Carkhuff Communication Index. The stimulus expressions were on audio tape and the subjects' responses were recorded for rating purposes.

In general, the results of the study indicate that less effective counselor trainees do not significantly differ from more effective counselor trainees in either their levels of death anxiety or in their attitudes toward <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> However, a significant negative correlation exists between counselor trainees' levels of death anxiety and their attitudes toward <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> Therefore, counselor trainees with high levels of death anxiety viewed <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> as being dissimilar to able-bodied persons...|$|R
