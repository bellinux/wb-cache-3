He had rented a small apartment in Stilwell, and was registered to vote from that location. The KCTV reporters said in their report {{they were unable to}} observe Kline or his family at the address. On two occasions, Kline was tailed by reporters from Johnson County back to Topeka, the location of his primary residence. [...] The Johnson County Sheriff's Office initially refused KCTV-5 access to records that <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> card passes at the Johnson County Courthouse garage, citing security concerns. Through exercise of the Freedom of Information Act, KCTV initially received redacted and incomplete records via the Johnson County Sheriff's Office. According to the report, the security system only saves 90 days worth of data and purged much of the electronic records in question. The KCTV report, based on the incomplete records, also suggested that Kline spent an inadequate amount of time in the Johnson Country District Attorney's Office, averaging only 29 hours per week. [...] KCTV5 devoted an entire 10pm newscast to deal with criticisms leveled at KCTV5's handling of the investigation the following day.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four 5 -substituted 2 '-deoxyuridines {{have been}} {{evaluated}} for their inhibitory effects on the growth of three human lymphoblast cell lines (Namalva, RAji and TK- (thymidine kinase deficient) Raji) and these inhibitory effects were compared to those for two murine leukemia cell lines (L 1210 / 0 and L 1210 /BdUrd). The latter was selected from the parental L 1210 / 0 cell line by its ability to grow at high concentrations of 5 -bromo-dUrd and could also be considered as TK-. There was a close correlation between the inhibitory effects of the deoxyuridine analogs on Namalva, Raji and L 1210 cells: the correlation coefficient (r) for <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 (median inhibitory dose) for L 1210 cell growth, on the one hand, and <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 for Namalva or Raji cell growth, on the other hand, was 0. 902 and 0. 929, respectively. There was also a strong correlation (r = 0. 936) between the <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 values for the two human lymphoblast cell lines. However, {{there was no significant}} correlation (r less than 0. 40) either between the <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 for the TK- Raji cells and the parental TK+ Raji cells, or between the <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 for the TK- L 1210 /BdUrd cells and the parental TK+ L 1210 / 0 cells. We may conclude therefore, that (i) the murine leukemia L 1210 cell system is predictive for the growth-inhibitory effects of 5 -substituted 2 '-deoxyuridines on human lymphoblast cell lines, and (ii) the antitumor cell activity of the 5 -substituted 2 '-deoxyuridines is, to a large extent, dependent on the thymidine kinase activity of the tumor cells. status: publishe...|$|E

No sign of illness was observed in any of the 52 juvenile hispid cotton rats inoculated with 3. 1, 1. 1, − 0. 9, or − 2. 9 log 10 median infectious dosesVeroE 6 (ID 50 -VeroE 6) of BCCV and euthanized on day 9, 18, 27, or 54 postinoculation (PI). Analysis of virus assay and serological data indicated that inoculum dose could significantly affect the pathogenesis of BCCV infection in juvenile hispid cotton rats. For example, the six animals inoculated with 3. 1 or 1. 1 <b>log</b> 10 <b>ID</b> 50 -VeroE 6 and euthanized on day 54 PI were virus positive and antibody positive, whereas the six animals inoculated with − 0. 9 or − 2. 9 <b>log</b> 10 <b>ID</b> 50 -VeroE 6 and euthanized on day 54 PI were virus positive but antibody negative. Microscopic examination of tissues from the animals inoculated with 3. 1 or 1. 1 <b>log</b> 10 <b>ID</b> 50 -VeroE 6 revealed diffuse, subacute pneumonitis in the lungs of all the animals euthanized on day 18 PI or thereafter, and indicated that the severity of pneumonitis was dependent upon inoculum dose as well as duration of infection (i. e., amount of time elapsed since inoculation) ...|$|R

40|$|Carrier {{transport}} {{properties of}} solution processed ultra thin (4 nm) zinc-tin oxide (ZTO) {{thin film transistor}} are investigated based on its transfer characteristics measured at the temperature ranging from 310 K to 77 K. As temperature decreases, the transfer curves show a parellel shift toward more postive voltages. The conduction mechanism of ultra-thin ZTO film and its connection to the density of band tail states have been substantiated by two approaches, including fitting logarithm drain current (<b>log</b> <b>ID)</b> to T- 1 / 3 at 310 K to 77 K according to the two-dimensional Mott variable range hopping theory and the extraction of density of localized tail states through the energy distribution of trapped carrier density. The linear dependency of <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> vs. T- 1 / 3 indicates that the dominant carrier transport mechanism in ZTO is the variable range hopping. The extracted value of density of tail states at the conduction band minimum is 4. 75 x 10 (20) cm(- 3) eV(- 1) through the energy distribution of trapped carrier density. The high density of localized tail states in the ultra thin ZTO film is the key factor leading to the room-temperature hopping transport of carriers among localized tail states.

40|$|A {{series of}} 96 diarylamidine (and diarylimidazoline) {{derivatives}} were evaluated for their inhibitory {{effects on the}} growth and DNA synthesis of murine leukemia L 1210 cells. The amidino- and imidazolino-substituted aryl moieties of the compounds consisted of phenyl, indole, indene, benzofuran, benzo[b]thiophene or benzimidazole. Several of these compounds were found to inhibit L 1210 cell proliferation with an ID 50 (50 % inhibitory dose) of 1 microgram/ml or lower. Structure-function analysis revealed that the antitumor cell activity of the diarylamidines depended on the planarity of the molecule, the presence of amidino- (or, preferably, imidazolino-) groups on both aryl moieties, {{the nature of the}} bridge connecting the two aryl moieties (preferably no bridge at all, phenoxy or ethene) and, finally, the nature of the aryl moieties (preferably, benzofuran or benzo[b]thiophene). Hence, compound 20 (6 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl) - 2 -[4 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl) phenyl] benzo[b]thiophene) emerged as the most potent inhibitor of L 1210 cell growth (ID 50 : 0. 21 micrograms/ml). Its inhibitory potency was {{similar to that of the}} well-known trypanocidal drug ethidium bromide (compound 98). For all diarylamidine derivatives taken together, some correlation (r = 0. 612) was noted between the <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 for L 1210 cell proliferation and the <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 for L 1210 cell DNA synthesis (as monitored by [methyl- 3 H]dThd incorporation). These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of the diarylamidines on L 1210 cell proliferation may at least partially reside in an inhibition of DNA synthesis. Compound 41 (2, 2 '-vinylenedi- 1 -benzofuran- 5 -carboxamidine), that exhibited a potent antitumor activity in vitro (ID 50 : 1. 5 micrograms/ml), was further evaluated for its antitumor efficacy in vivo and found to increase the median survival time of L 1210 cell-inoculated BDF 1 mice up to 204 %, if administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|During the Leader {{election}} phase, {{there may}} be no Leader in the system. Assume that each member in the Paxos group should take part in the Leader election. Therefore, they report the local last log sequence number (LSN) to the election service. Note that the local last LSN may be comprised of <b>log</b> <b>id,</b> generated log timestamp or epoch number, which can be used to order the state of each member. The election service elects a Leader from the reporting members in consideration of the LSN’s, i.e., the new Leader’s LSN must not be less than a majority of members’. When a majority of nodes acquire the election result and succeed in registering to the new Leader, the election phase is finished successfully. It is noteworthy that the Leader can maintain its authority by renewing its election lease periodically. If the majority of members note that the Leader’s lease is expired, the system will enter into the Leader election phase again.|$|E

The muscarinic antagonists were given by i. c. v. injection 1 min before carbachol, 1 micrograms/rat. 4 -Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4 -DAMP), a rather selective M 1 and M 3 receptor antagonist, was the most potent inhibitor of carbachol-induced ANF release, its ID 50 being 0. 18 nmol/rat. Pirenzepine, a selective M 1 antagonist, also potently inhibited the effect of carbachol, its ID 50 being 2. 74 nmol/rat. The M 3 -selective antagonist, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-diphenidol, was much weaker than pirenzepine, with an ID 50 of 57. 52 nmol/rat. The selective M 2 receptor antagonist, methoctramine, on the other hand, was a very weak inhibitor of carbachol-induced ANF release. The rank order of potency {{as well as the}} - <b>log</b> <b>ID</b> 50 of the antagonists tested were consistent with their pA 2 values for muscarinic M 1 receptors, suggesting that this receptor subtype may mediate the central effect of cholinergic mechanisms in the control of ANF release...|$|E
30|$|Blind {{rebroadcasting}} is {{the simplest}} mechanism {{to send a}} data packet in fully stateless manner such that any node pair in the network can reach each other. However, blind rebroadcasting suffers from severe performance degredation due to massive redundant rebroadcasts resulting in broadcast storm problem. An improved version of blind rebroadcasting is the simple flooding in which a node rebroadcasts a packet only when it is received for the first time. The received packets are checked using a <b>log</b> of packet <b>IDs</b> where each entry comprises of source address and sequence number. There are flooding schemes that evaluate additional variables for making the rebroadcast decision such as counter-based flooding and distance-based flooding. In these flooding schemes, only a subset of nodes that receive the packet will rebroadcast and hence they are known as efficient flooding schemes.|$|R

40|$|Titanium oxide (TiO(2)) {{has been}} {{extensively}} applied in the medical area due to its proved biocompatibility with human cells [1]. This work presents the characterization of titanium oxide thin films as a potential dielectric to be applied in ion sensitive field-effect transistors. The films were obtained by rapid thermal oxidation and annealing (at 300, 600, 960 and 1200 degrees C) of thin titanium films of different thicknesses (5 nm, 10 nm and 20 nm) deposited by e-beam evaporation on silicon wafers. These films were analyzed as-deposited and after annealing in forming gas for 25 min by Ellipsometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman Spectroscopy (RAMAN), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Ti-K edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). Thin film thickness, roughness, surface grain sizes, refractive indexes and oxygen concentration depend on the oxidation and annealing temperature. Structural characterization showed mainly presence of the crystalline rutile phase, however, other oxides such Ti(2) O(3), an interfacial SiO(2) layer between the dielectric and the substrate and the anatase crystalline phase of TiO(2) films were also identified. Electrical characteristics were obtained by means of I-V and C-V measured curves of Al/Si/TiO(x) /Al capacitors. These curves showed that the films had high dielectric constants between 12 and 33, interface charge density of about 10 (10) /cm(2) and leakage current density between 1 and 10 (- 4) A/cm(2). Field-effect transistors were fabricated in order to analyze I(D) x V(DS) and <b>log</b> <b>I(D)</b> x Bias curves. Early voltage value of - 1629 V, R(OUT) value of 215 M Omega and slope of 100 mV/dec were determined for the 20 nm TiO(x) film thermally treated at 960 degrees C. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
