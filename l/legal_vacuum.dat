In its view, the Anglo–Dutch Treaty did not divide up the Singapore Strait, in which Pedra Branca is situated, between the new Johor Sultanate under the British sphere of influence and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate under Dutch influence. Instead, both Britain and the Netherlands could access the Strait freely. Therefore, there was a <b>legal</b> <b>vacuum</b> with regard to sovereignty over the island, enabling the British to lawfully take possession of it between 1847 and 1851.|$|E

In Moscow, the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992. In the late 1990s, certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness, such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children.|$|E
40|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{was made}} among three nation-states, Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Each of these nation-states has {{indigenous}} populations within its borders. Each has chosen different legal mechanisms for interacting with indigenous peoples. For example, the United States has an extensive web of treaties with the tribes within its borders while Canada, in contrast, has relatively few. All three nation-states have grappled with armed conflicts with indigenous peoples {{well into the}} 20 th century. Indigenous peoples within each have long social, cultural, economic, and political histories which cross the borders of these countries. Within the provisions of NAFTA, each nation-state reserved the right to deny investors rights or preferences provided to "aboriginal peoples", "socially or economically disadvantaged minorities", or "socially or economically disadvantaged groups" in from two to five designated areas. All three approaches nevertheless leave substantial national and international <b>legal</b> <b>vacuums</b> that necessarily impact the implementation of NAFTA {{as well as the}} economic interests of indigenous peoples.

These factors, in large part, explain why hostile takeover transactions occur in significant numbers in only relatively few countries. Section II surveys information describing the takeover environment in four of those countries- The United States, Great Britain, Candada, and Australia. Section III considers legal context in which takeover regulation is embedded in these countries and the restraints the legal system imposes on bidders and target management. The discussion then narrows to {{a comparison of the}} rules of these systems that pertain to specific issues in tender offer regulation. The Article concludes by considering the larger question of whether specific impacts on transactional activity can be traced to particular aspects of these regulatory systems...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two other}} more unusual {{remedies}} that may be granted. When a law is declared unconstitutional, the Court of Appeal may apply the doctrine of prospective overruling to prevent prejudice to an accused by overruling the law only from {{the date of the}} judgment but preserving it with regards to acts done prior to the judgment. In Canada, the Supreme Court has held that unconstitutional laws can be given temporary validity to prevent a <b>legal</b> <b>vacuum</b> caused by the voiding of laws until the legislature has had time to re-enact the laws in a constitutional manner.

25|$|The {{constitution}} also vows {{to respect}} the human rights, defining the latter by its endorsement of the Charter of the United Nations, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

25|$|In some cases, {{especially}} in the high plateau, cooperatives and community organizations access the distribution companies’ network and sell electricity to small rural communities. Sometimes, those are organized enterprises that provide the service to middle-size towns, but in most cases, they are small organizations that serve family communities. This situation faces a <b>legal</b> <b>vacuum</b> since the consumers benefiting from these scheme, who do not consume the minimum power established legally established, cannot be considered as regulated ones. In addition, these consumers are localized outside the distribution companies’ concession areas, so they cannot receive the companies’ service. In practice, the distribution companies are reselling electricity to the mentioned organizations outside the legal framework. Accurate information {{on the number of}} organizations that operate in rural areas does not exist. However, there are approximately three in La Paz, twenty in Oruro and three in Potosi.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse certain {{approaches}} which have arisen in the area of intellectual property and its link with knowledge management at the Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado (UCLA). The focus of the analysis is based, mainly, on the need for regulation of intellectual property through a law guaranteeing and protecting intellectual creativity which is being produced at the UCLA, oriented to both the national and international legal system. We continued with further investigation on knowledge management, with intellectual property as the focal point, as relating to this study. Finally, some guidelines are presented for consideration in the structure and composition of the authority which is to carry out knowledge management at the UCLA, from a legal point of view. The analysis was compiled firstly with documents from different sources, followed by a multiple choice questionnaire, to reach a series of final considerations. Among these, it was evident that university management showed little initiative in planning, in the programmes, projects and specific agreements in the area of intellectual property. It was also clear that there was a <b>legal</b> and strategic-organisational <b>vacuum</b> in matters of the special legal regulation referred to; even when small steps towards its recognition were made by the UCLA authorities, creating the Commission for Intellectual Property, approving an optional subject, and with the special laws on the material at the stage of being written...|$|R
40|$|The Maya International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (Maya ICBG) {{research}} project began in 1998 {{in the central}} highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, in a difficult and contentious legal, social and political climate. The researchers' good intentions were that the indigenous Maya people would both contribute to the project and benefit from it. However, gaps in the way local communities were included became a focus for international resistance to the project, which was abandoned in 2001. No single actor should bear the total responsibility {{for what happened to}} the Maya ICBG, but none is devoid of it. Through a comparison with the San- Hoodia case we discuss how parties on all sides implicitly understood ‘collaboration’ and ‘benefit sharing’, which can easily become controversial due to conflicting assumptions about how and to what extent different groups of people should benefit from the potential royalties, and who should make these decisions. Like the San peoples, the Maya stood to receive a very small proportion of any profit that might come from the development of commercial products. These benefits, whether realized or not, are never ethically neutral, so the transparent, full and free prior informed consent of communities to accept the risk of going along this path is absolutely essential. Both cases played out in a domestic <b>legal</b> and policy <b>vacuum.</b> Questions about the legitimacy of processes and decisions emerge as fundamental. The failure of the Maya ICBG was due largely to the lack of an appropriate prior informed consent process built on trust and adequate representation. The question of Maya identity and self-representation through forms that are ‘credible’ to outside bioprospectors is an ongoing issue. The pan-Mayan identity currently under construction in Chiapas faces similar challenges to those of the San people...|$|R
25|$|The European Court of Human Rights judge Giovanni Bonello {{claims that}} the detainees were {{released}} in 1921 after having no legal framework to prosecute war criminals, due to a <b>legal</b> <b>vacuum</b> in international law, therefore contrary to Turkish sources, no trials were ever held in Malta. The release of the Turkish detainees was accomplished in exchange for 22 British prisoners held by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. As a result of this, the British authorities did use any of the – mostly documentary – evidence on Armenian atrocities of which Turkish prisoners had been accused and convicted by Turkish military courts shortly after the armistice.Ottoman military members and high-ranking politicians convicted by the Turkish courts-martial were transferred from Constantinople prisons to the Crown Colony of Malta on board of the SS Princess Ena and the SS HMS Benbow by the British forces, starting in 1919. Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe {{was in charge of}} the operation, together with Lord Curzon; they did so owing to the lack of transparency of the Turkish courts-martial. They were held there for three years, while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to find a way to put them on trial. However, the war criminals were eventually released without trial and returned to Constantinople in 1921, in exchange for 22 British prisoners of war held by the government in Ankara, including a relative of Lord Curzon. The government in Ankara was opposed to political power of the government in Constantinople. They are often mentioned as the Malta exiles in some sources.|$|E

2500|$|Facing {{the housing}} scandals, as the {{chairperson}} of the Housing Authority, Wong vowed to grasp the opportunity to reform the bureaucratic and corrupted Housing Department. However, she quickly became the target to be blamed by the public opinions. Many civil groups representing residents of the public housing estates reproached Wong for being incompetent to supervise the housing constructions and they demanded her and the Director of Housing, Tony Miller to step down. In June 2000, Secretary for Housing, Dominic S. W. Wong appointed Director of Intellectual Property, Stephen R. Selby {{as the chairman of}} the Investigation Panel on Staff Discipline in the Yuen Chau Kok and Tin Chung Court Incidents to see if anyone was derelict in the whole scandal. Apart from the pressure from the government, Democratic Party's legislator Fred Li moved a motion of no confidence on both Rosanna Wong and Tony Miller in the Legislative Council on 9 June. Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa later paid a special visit to the Legislative Council on 23 June and addressed to the Council Meeting.

2500|$|On October 19, 2004, a Toronto lawyer {{successfully}} challenged a [...] "no left turn" [...] traffic ticket on {{the basis}} that the sign was not bilingual in accordance with the 1986 French Language Services Act. The judge in R. v. Myers ruled that the traffic sign was not a municipal service, but instead was regulated under the provincial Highway Traffic Act and therefore subject to the bilingual requirements of the French Language Services Act. As this was a lower court ruling, it did not affect any other court. However the implication of the decision was that many traffic signs in bilingually designated areas of Ontario would be invalid. It was feared that the ruling would have a similar effect as the Manitoba Language Rights ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada, in this case forcing municipalities to erect new bilingual road signs at great expense and invalidating millions of dollars in existing tickets before the courts. The City of Toronto appealed the ruling. At the appeal hearing both parties asked the court to enter a plea of guilty. A guilty verdict was entered even though no arguments were made by either side on the merits of the case. The situation created a <b>legal</b> <b>vacuum</b> for several years, during which numerous defendants used the bilingual signage argument to fight traffic tickets. The precedent was overturned by the Ontario Court of Appeal in a 2011 case, R. v. Petruzzo, {{on the grounds that the}} French Language Services Act specifically states that municipalities are not required to offer services in French, even in provincially regulated areas such as traffic signage, if the municipality has not specifically passed its own bylaw governing its own provision of bilingual services.|$|E
