If one assumes that H97-04's 150 m width is its longest <b>linear</b> <b>dimension</b> then it had an area of about 17,671 m2. Bonebeds other than H97-04 were less than 50 m wide. These individual component bonebeds tend to have areas of only a few hundred to a few thousand square feet and would have maximum areas of somewhat less than 2,000 square meters. The individual bonebeds at Hilda were generally smaller than those at Dinosaur Provincial Park.|$|E

40|$|Objective : The {{purpose of}} the study was to measure the size and {{describe}} the morphology of sella turcica in different skeletal types. Materials and methods : Lateral cephalometric radiographs of 180 subjects (91 males, 89 females) in the age group of 9 to 27 years were grouped into skeletal Class I, II, III (60 subjects in each group). <b>Linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> which include the length, depth and anteroposterior diameter were measured and the shape was analyzed. A student t-test was used to calculate the difference in <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> and oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to study the relationship between sella turcica size and skeletal types. Results : Considering the age groups, <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> were larger in older group than in younger group (p < 0. 01). Significant difference was noted in length between males and females (p < 0. 05). When skeletal types were compared to the sella size, significant difference was found in the length and diameter. The shape of sella turcica appeared normal in majority of the subjects (61 %). Conclusion : <b>Linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> and shape of sella turcica in the current study can be used as reference standards for further investigations involving the sella turcica in South Indian population...|$|R
40|$|The {{study has}} been devoted to change {{analysis}} of <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions,</b> surfaces and drying shrinkage rate, {{in the course of the}} convector drying of celery. It has been found that drying resulted in most significant changes of cube edges in their central parts. The shape of lateral surfaces of celery cubes changed from the originally square to irregular, resembling sandglass. In spite of this, the analysed characteristic <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> altered in a nearly identical way. In the course of drying and the progressive reduction of water content, the characteristic <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the surface of celery samples declined, while the drying shrinkage rate increased. The change rate of studied values depended on the appearance of the first and the second drying periods. No significant dependency was found between the temperature of drying medium (in the analysed measurement period) and the dynamics of surface change, <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> alteration and shrinkage rate. Next, the studied values were used in the empirical verification of adopted theoretical models of celery drying kinetics, in the first and the second period of drying. Empirical verification confirmed the correctness of adopted mathematical models. The relative local error was no higher than 15 %, while the global error did not exceed 2. 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} aortic regurgitation (AR) or mitral regurgitation (MR) relies on the accurate assessment {{of the severity of}} the regurgitation as well as its effect on left ventricular (LV) size and function. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is an excellent tool for quantifying regurgitant volumes as well as LV size and function. The 2008 AHA/ACC management guidelines for the therapy of patients with AR or MR only describe LV size in terms of <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> (i. e. end-diastolic and end-systolic dimension). LV volumes that correspond to these <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effect of regurgitant volume on LV volumes and chamber dimensions in patients with isolated AR or MR and preserved LV function. Methods Regurgitant volume, LV volume, mass, <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and ejection fraction, were determined in 34 consecutive patients with isolated AR and 23 consecutive patients with MR and no other known cardiac disease. Results There is a strong, linear relationship between regurgitant volume and LV end-diastolic volume index (aortic regurgitation r 2 = 0. 8, mitral regurgitation r 2 = 0. 8). Bland-Altman analysis of regurgitant volume shows little interobserver variation (AR: 0. 6 ± 4 ml; MR 4 ± 6 ml). The correlation is much poorer between regurgitant volume and commonly used clinical linear measures such as end-systolic dimension (mitral regurgitation r 2 = 0. 3, aortic regurgitation r 2 = 0. 5). For a given regurgitant volume, AR causes greater LV enlargement and hypertrophy than MR. Conclusion CMR is an accurate and robust technique for quantifying regurgitant volume in patients with AR or MR. Ventricular volumes show a stronger correlation with regurgitant volume than <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions,</b> suggesting LV volumes better reflect ventricular remodeling in patients with isolated mitral or aortic regurgitation. Ventricular volumes that correspond to published recommended <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> are determined to guide the timing of surgical intervention. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} sexual dimorphism as well as to predict sex using facial <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> and angles among Hausas of Kano state Nigeria. A total of 283 subjects comprising 147 males and 136 females age range 18 – 25  years participated. Photographs methods were used to capture the face. Independent sample t-test was used to test for sex differences in the variables. Binary logistic regression was applied to obtain a predicting equation (BLR model) for sex. The predicted probabilities of BLR were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that all the facial <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> showed significance sexual dimorphism except interocular distance, upper facial width, philtrum length, lower vermilion width, left and right orbital width. With regards to sex prediction, upper facial height was the single best predictor of sex with an accuracy of 76. 2 % and 24 – 33 % contribution to the prediction. However, the percentage accuracy increased to 91 % when six variables were pooled together in the equations. For facial angles, only nasion and aperture modified angle did not show significant gender differences. However, in the variables with significant sexual dimorphism only nasomental angle showed a significant level of sex prediction with an accuracy of 70. 3 %. In conclusion, sex discrimination using facial <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> and angles was well established in this study. The sex of an individual of Hausa ethnic group can be determined using facial <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Dispite sexual dimorphsm shown by facial angles, only nasomental angle was good discriminator of sex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rough model method (RMM) is {{explained}} through {{its application to}} the design of a pressurized circular shaped conduit with benches, widely used in practice. The three basic equations of turbulent flow are firstly applied to define explicitly the geometric elements of a referential rough model characterized by an arbitrary assigned relative roughness value. The required <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the studied conduit are then easily deduced by multiplying the homologues <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the rough model by a non-dimensional correction factor. Friction factor is not indispensable when applying the RMM, unlike current design methods. Resulting RMM equations are not only explicit but are also valid in the entire domain of turbulent flow...|$|R

Methods. The investigation was carried out on 80 lateral cephalometric radiographs of two groups of male and female subjects between 18 and 25 years of age with natural dentitions. The analysed group consisted of 30 subjects with symptoms of temporomandibular disorders, and the control group of 50 subjects without such symptoms. According to the values of the ANB angle (position of the maxilla with the mandible- Steiner cephalometric analysis) all subjects were classified in the skeletal class 1. The roentgen craniometric analysis of cephalometric radiographs included the evaluation of 25 <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> which values were compared between the examined groups and with the values of the same dimensions in the Bolton standards for 18 years of age. Results. The results of this study confirmed the presence of significant differences between the examined <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the Bolton standards and the same dimensions measured in the subjects of the analyzed and the control group. The comparative analysis of these values between the groups confirmed the presence of significant differences in following <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> at the level of p< 0, 00 : S - Cs(Go), Mol - PP, Mol - MP and Ar - Go. Conclusion. Significant differences between the examined <b>linear</b> <b>dimensions</b> measured in the subjects included in this study and the same dimensions in the Bolton standards can be explained by specific morphologic features of the craniofacial skeleton in people of our population.
