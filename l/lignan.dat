40|$|In sesame seeds, high {{concentrations}} of <b>lignans</b> are present. When these <b>lignans</b> are fermented in the human colon, a range of structurally different <b>lignans</b> is formed. A good liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) protocol {{for the analysis of}} <b>lignans</b> in complex mixtures is lacking. In order to develop such a protocol, electrospray ionization (ESI) -MS and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) -MS, both in the positive and negative ionization mode, were compared. An extract from defatted sesame meal was analyzed by APCI-MS and ESI-MS, before and after deglucosylation. APCI-MS was found to be a more generic method than ESI-MS because <b>lignans,</b> especially sesamolin, sesamin and pinoresinol, were better detected by APCI-MS than by ESI-MS. Positive and negative ionization modes had to be combined in order to detect all <b>lignans</b> in a bacterial culture grown on aglyconic, acid-treated <b>lignans</b> from sesame oil and defatted sesame meal. <b>Lignans</b> with methylenedioxy-bridged furanofuran structures mostly lack phenolic hydroxyl groups and were, therefore, optimally detected in positive ionization mode. Dibenzylbutadiene <b>lignans,</b> which were formed during fermentation, carry hydroxyl groups and were better detected in negative ionization mode...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Lignans</b> {{constitute}} {{a group of}} phytochemicals, which are produced by oxidative dimerization of two phenylpropanoid units. Furfuran type <b>lignans</b> such as secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol or pinoresinol are widely distributed in edible plants, {{and most of those}} dietary <b>lignans</b> are metabolized by the gut microflora to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans, traditionally classified as phytoestrogens. The rich sources of <b>lignans</b> are flaxseed, sesame seeds, cereal products, and Brassica vegetables. There is a growing interest in biological functions of <b>lignans</b> from edible plants, since a higher intake of edible plants containing <b>lignans</b> is known to reduce the incidence of certain chronic diseases. This review deals with the isolation and preparation of furfuran type <b>lignans</b> from edible plants, and their bioactivities such as anticancer, antioxidant, cardiovasculoprotective, neuroprotective, and antiinflammatory activities, so that recent informations about bioactive <b>lignans</b> from edible plants may be available for the development of potential functional food agents.

40|$|Background/Aims: Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) could elicit oxidative stress, {{trigger and}} aggravate endothelium damage in several ischemic retinopathies including diabetic retinopathy (DR). The leaves of Eucommia ulmoides O., {{also referred to}} as Tu-chung or Du-zhong, have been used for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes, showing great antioxidant activity and anti-glycation activity. <b>Lignans</b> {{is one of the main}} bioactive components of Eucommia ulmoides. This study mainly investigated the effect of <b>lignans</b> treatment on AGEs-induced endothelium damage. Methods: MTT assay, Hoechst staining, and calcein-AM/ propidium iodide (PI) staining was conducted to determine the effect of <b>lignans</b> treatment on endothelial cell function in vitro. Retinal trypsin digestion, Evans blue assay, isolectin staining, and western blots were conducted to determine the effect of <b>lignans</b> treatment on retinal microvascular function in vivo. Western blot, protein immunoprecipitation (IP), MTT assays, and enzyme activity assay was conducted to detect the effect of ligans treatment on oxidative stress response. Results: <b>Lignans</b> protected retinal endothelial cell against AGEs-induced injury in vitro and diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction in vivo. <b>Lignans</b> treatment could regulate oxidative stress response in retinal endothelial cell line, retina, and liver. Moreover, we showed that NRF 2 /HO- 1 signaling was critical for lignans-mediated oxidative stress regulation.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Lignans</b> and {{flavonoids}} {{are widely}} distributed phenolics {{in the plant}} kingdom. Aryltetralin type <b>lignans</b> (podophyllotoxin derivatives) as the major secondary metabolites of Linum species {{play an important role}} in the production of chemotherapy drugs. In the present study, <b>lignans</b> and flavonoid glycosides from aerial parts of Linum mucronatum subsp. orientale were isolated and identified. Methods: The phytochemical investigation has been carried out on Hexane, DCM and MeOH extracts of the plant. Separation of chemical constituents was done using different chromatography (CC, prep-TLC, GC/MS and HPLC) methods. The major compounds of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol extracts were isolated and their structures were elucidated using co-chromatography in the presence of known <b>lignans,</b> HPLC and NMR techniques. Results: Our results showed that podophyllotoxin and 6 -MeO-α- peltatin, as new compound, are the major <b>lignans</b> of the DCM extract of L. mucronatum subsp. orientale. Two new flavonoid glycosides were also elucidated in the methanolic extract.

40|$|The {{methanol}} extract of sesame (Sesamum indicum) seeds was fractionated and purified {{with the}} assistance of conventional column chromatography to afford 29 compounds including seven furofuran <b>lignans.</b> Among these isolates, (+) -samin (1) was obtained from the natural source for the first time.
