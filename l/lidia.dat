5|$|Thunderstorm {{activity}} {{near the}} eye soon decreased in coverage, and <b>Lidia</b> began a weakening trend. Because of two troughs, {{one over the}} northern Gulf of California and another over the Southwestern United States, the weakening system began to re-curve northeast. Heading towards mainland Mexico, the hurricane weakened significantly a day after its peak, in which <b>Lidia</b> was only a mid-level Category2 hurricane. Continuing to weaken, <b>Lidia</b> made landfall in Sinaloa at 1800UTC on September13. Shortly after landfall, Hurricane <b>Lidia</b> then accelerated northeastward and then east-northeastward. It weakened to a depression just after crossing the international border with Texas. Tropical Depression <b>Lidia</b> dissipated near Austin on September14. The remnants of the cyclone were absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

Tropical Storm <b>Lidia</b> rapidly weakened and dissipated the same day. <b>Lidia</b> killed at least 73 people and caused at least $80 million (1981 USD) which is equivalent to $193 million (2010 USD) in damage.

5|$|Hurricane <b>Lidia</b> was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from a tropical wave on September 8, <b>Lidia</b> steadily organized and became a hurricane on September 10.
