25|$|The {{line was}} mostly served by whistle stops {{consisting}} of lean-tos with green flags {{that would be}} displayed {{to call for a}} stop. A large wharf was built on the lakeshore in 1879, giving rise to the village of Jackson's Point. The T purchased the <b>lake</b> <b>steamer</b> Enterprise to provide connection service across Simcoe. The main services for the LSJR were summertime passengers visiting the beaches to the west, and a major wintertime service shipping cut ice to Toronto. Early service was often disrupted by livestock wandering onto the lines, and upset farmers would retaliate by spreading lard on the rails on uphill sections.|$|E
25|$|Of these, 20 {{were killed}} at Nkhata Bay where those {{detained}} in the Northern Region {{were being held}} prior to being transferred by <b>Lake</b> <b>Steamer</b> to the south. A local Congress leader, {{who had not been}} arrested, encouraged a large crowd to gather at the dockside at Nkhata Bay, apparently to secure the release of the detainees. Troops who should have arrived in the town early on 3 March were delayed and, when they arrived, the District Commissioner felt the situation was out of control, and he ordered then to open fire. The other death on 3 March was in Blantyre, and there were six more deaths in the Northern Region and five in Machinga District up to 19 March. Most if these deaths occurred when soldiers of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment or Kings African Rifles were ordered to open fire on rioters. The remainder of the 51 officially recorded deaths were in military operations in the Northern Region.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{thought he}} must be going mad, but {{insanity}} implied some definite delusion or hallucination, and, so {{far as he could}} make out, he had none. He was simply crushed by a nameless foreboding. Something dreadful was to happen, but this was all he felt; knowledge had no part in his condition. He could not say whether he slept during the two nights that passed before he reached Toledo, where he was to take the <b>lake</b> <b>steamer</b> for Buffalo. He wished to turn back again, but the relentless pressure which had kept him from turning back at the start was as strong as ever with him. He tried to give his presentiment direction by talking with the other passengers about a recent accident to a <b>lake</b> <b>steamer,</b> in which several hundred lives were lost; there had been a collision in rough weather, and one of the boats had gone down in a few minutes. There was a sort of relief in that, but the double action of the mind brought the same intolerable anguish again, and he settled back for refuge under the shadow of his impenetrable doom. This did not lift till he was well on his way from Albany to New York by the Hudson River. The canal-boat voyage from Buffalo to Albany had been as eventless as that to Toledo, and his <b>lake</b> <b>steamer</b> had reached Buffalo in safety, for which it had seemed as if those lost in the recent disaster had paid.|$|E
60|$|Business called Weston to Winnipeg a {{few days}} after his {{interview}} with Ida, and, as it happened, he met Stirling {{at the head of the}} companionway when the big <b>lake</b> <b>steamer</b> steamed out into Georgian Bay. Neither of them had any other acquaintance on board, and they sat together in the shade of a deckhouse as the steamer ploughed her way smoothly across Lake Huron a few hours later. Weston had arranged to meet a Chicago stock-jobber who had displayed some interest in the mine, and he had chosen to travel up the lakes because it was more comfortable than in the cars in the hot weather, besides being somewhat cheaper, which was a consideration with him. Stirling, it seemed, was going to inspect the route for a railroad which an iron-mining company contemplated building. He lay in a deck-chair, with a cigar in his hand, apparently looking out at the shining water which stretched away before them, a vast sheet of turquoise, to the far horizon.|$|E

He spoke in a loud cheerful voice; he laughed jollily at no apparent joke; he bowed very low and said, [...] "GOOD-evening!" [...] at parting, and they went away as if he had blessed them.|$|E

6000|$|His little <b>lake</b> <b>steamer,</b> the Lady Nyassa, {{had been}} packed {{on board the}} Hetty Ellen, and had formed the only shelter Miss Mackenzie had from the sun, and the {{transference}} of this occupied some time. Then the unhappy Pioneer began to proceed at her snail's pace, one day on a sand- bank, another with the machinery out of order, continually halting for supplies of wood, and thinking {{a couple of miles}} a good day's work. Captain Wilson, shocked at the notion of women spending weeks in labouring up that pestiferous stream, beset with mosquitoes by night and tsetse flies by day, offered to man his gig and take them up himself. So desperate a journey was it for a frail invalid like Miss Mackenzie, that one of the sailors took a spade to dig her grave with; and in fact she was soon prostrated with fever. None of the party knew who lay sleeping in his grave under the trees. The natives on the island entirely denied having seen or heard anything of the Bishop, and never gave Mr. Burrup's letter, fearing perhaps that some revenge might fall on them. Baffled by not meeting him, Captain Wilson still would not leave the ladies till he should have seen them safe among their friends, and pushed on his boat with speed very unlike that of the tardy Pioneer, and thus, in a day and a half, arrived at Chibisa's, where the Malokolo came down to the boat, with tidings that, though their language was but imperfectly understood, were only too certain. The brave and tender-hearted leader of the mission was dead! Still there was hope of Mr. Burrup; but Captain Wilson would not allow the young wife to take the difficult journey only to find desolation, but went on by land himself, leaving her with Miss Mackenzie, under charge of his ship's surgeon, Dr. Ramsay. He came back after a few days, having become too ill by the way to get further than Soche, where he had been met by three of the mission party, who now returned with him to Chibisa's, with the tidings in all their sad fulness; and the mournful party set forth upon their return. On coming to the island, he demanded Mr. Burrup's letter, and the negroes looked at one another, saying, [...] "It is all known." [...] They gave him the letter, but it was with very great difficulty that they could be persuaded to show him the grave, over which he set up a cross of reeds, and then continuing this sad voyage, placed the ladies on board his ship, and carried them back to Capetown.|$|E
