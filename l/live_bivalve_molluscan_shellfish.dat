40|$|The American {{hard-shelled}} clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) is {{a valuable}} <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> <b>shellfish</b> in the U. S. A, and Canada. This bivalve is somewhat like the cockle (familiar to most Irish people) or the palourde (Venerupis decussata) which is gathered on {{some parts of the}} Irish coast and exported to France. Unlike the cockle which lives in sand, or the palourde which is found mainly in coarse sand and shingle, the hard-shelled clam lives in sandy mud. Some years ago this clam established itself in Southampton Water, on the south coast of England. It is thought that this particular stock originated from live clams thrown overboard from an American liner. Due to the warming effect of the outflow from a large power station near Southampton, coupled with naturally occurring high sea-water temperatures in this area, the clams were able to breed and multiply. Normally the seawater temperatures around the coasts of Gt. Britain and Ireland are too low to permit the clams to multiply by natural breeding...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> <b>shellfish,</b> such as oysters, filter {{large volumes}} of water {{as part of their}} feeding {{activities}} and are able to accumulate and concentrate different types of pathogens, particularly noroviruses, from fecal human pollution. Based on our previous observation of a specific binding of the Norwalk strain (prototype norovirus genogroup I) to the oyster digestive tract through an A-like carbohydrate structure indistinguishable from human blood group A antigen and on the large diversity between strains in terms of carbohydrate-binding specificities, we evaluated the different ligands implicated in attachment to oysters tissues of strains representative of two main genogroups of human norovirus. The GI. 1 and GII. 4 strains differed in that the latter recognized a sialic acid-containing ligand, present in all tissues, in addition to the A-like ligand of the digestive tract shared with the GI. 1 strain. Furthermore, bioaccumulation experiments using wild-type or mutant GI. 1 Viruslike particles showed accumulation in hemocytes largely, but not exclusively, based on interaction with the A-like ligand. Moreover, a seasonal effect on the expression of these ligands was detected, most visibly for the GI. 1 strain, with a peak in late winter and spring, a period when GI strains are regularly involved in oyster-related outbreaks. These observations may explain some of the distinct epidemiological features of strains from different genogroups...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV), an enteric {{pathogen}} of both humans and animals, is excreted by infected individuals {{and is therefore}} present in wastewaters and coastal waters. As <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> <b>shellfish</b> are known to concentrate viral particles {{during the process of}} filter feeding, they may accumulate this virus. The bioaccumulation efficiencies of oysters (Crassostrea gigas), flat oysters (Ostrea edulis), mussels (Mytilus edulis), and clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) were compared at different time points during the year. Tissue distribution analysis showed that most of the viruses were concentrated in the digestive tissues of the four species. Mussels and clams were found to be more sensitive to sporadic contamination events, as demonstrated by rapid bioaccumulation in less than 1 h compared to species of oysters. For oysters, concentrations increased during the 24 -h bioaccumulation period. Additionally, to evaluate environmental occurrence of HEV in shellfish, an environmental investigation was undertaken at sites potentially impacted by pigs, wild boars, and human waste. Of the 286 samples collected, none were contaminated with hepatitis E virus, despite evidence that this virus is circulating in some French areas. It is possible that the number of hepatitis E viral particles discharged into the environment is too low to detect or that the virus may have {{a very short period of}} persistence in pig manure and human waste...|$|R
40|$|Human noroviruses (NoVs) are {{considered}} a worldwide leading cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis. Due {{to a combination of}} prolonged shedding of high virus levels in feces, virus particle shedding during asymptomatic infections, and a high environmental persistence, NoVs are easily transmitted pathogens. Norovirus (NoV) outbreaks have often been reported and tend to affect a lot of people. NoV is spread via feces and vomit, but this NoV spread can occur through several transmission routes. While person-to-person transmission is without a doubt the dominant transmission route, human infective NoV outbreaks are often initiated by contaminated food or water. Zoonotic transmission of NoV has been investigated, but has thus far not been demonstrated. The presented review aims to give an overview of these NoV transmission routes. Regarding NoV person-to-person transmission, the NoV GII. 4 genotype is discussed in the current review as it has been very successful for several decades but reasons for its success have only recently been suggested. Both pre-harvest and post-harvest contamination of food products can lead to NoV food borne illness. Pre-harvest contamination of food products mainly occurs via contact with polluted irrigation water in case of fresh produce or with contaminated harvesting water in case of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> <b>shellfish.</b> On the other hand, an infected food handler is considered as a major cause of post-harvest contamination of food products. Both transmission routes are reviewed by a summary of described NoV food borne outbreaks between 2000 and 2010. A third NoV transmission route occurs via water and the spread of NoV via river water, ground water, and surface water is reviewed. Finally, although zoonotic transmission remains hypothetical, a summary on the bovine and porcine NoV presence observed in animals is given and the presence of human infective NoV in animals is discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

40|$|Escherichia coli is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} indicator of the sanitary quality of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> <b>shellfish</b> sold for human consumption. However, it is now well documented that shellfish that meet the E. coli standards for human consumption may contain human enteric viruses that cause gastroenteritis and hepatitis. In this study we investigated using F-specific RNA bacteriophage (FRNA bacteriophage) to indicate the likely presence of such viruses in shellfish sold for consumption. FRNA bacteriophage and E. coli levels were determined over a 2 -year period for oysters (Crassostrea gigas) harvested from four commercial sites chosen to represent various degrees of sewage pollution. Three sites were classified as category B sites under the relevant European Community (EC) Directive (91 / 492), which required purification (depuration) of oysters from these sites before sale. One site was classified as a category A site, and oysters from this site could be sold directly without further processing. Samples were tested {{at the point of}} sale following commercial processing and packaging. All of the shellfish complied with the mandatory EC E. coli standard (less than 230 per 100 g of shellfish flesh), and the levels of contamination for more than 90 % of the shellfish were at or below the level of sensitivity of the assay (20 E. coli MPN per 100 g), which indicated good quality based on this criterion. In contrast, FRNA bacteriophage were frequently detected at levels that exceeded 1, 000 PFU per 100 g. High levels of FRNA bacteriophage contamination were strongly associated with harvest area fecal pollution and with shellfish-associated disease outbreaks. Interestingly, FRNA bacteriophage contamination exhibited a marked seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of oyster-associated gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom. The correlation between FRNA bacteriophage contamination and health risk was investigated further by using a reverse transcription-PCR assay for Norwalk-like virus (NLV). NLV contamination of oysters was detected only at the most polluted site and also exhibited a seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of FRNA bacteriophage contamination and with the incidence of disease. The {{results of this study suggest}} that FRNA bacteriophage could be used as viral indicators for market-ready oysters...|$|R

40|$|In many areas, coastal {{residents}} and others oppose establishment of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> aquaculture projects {{on the basis}} of perceived negative environmental impacts. Often overlooked are positive environmental impacts of shellfish aquaculture that can potentially mitigate the impacts of other anthropogenic activities. Filter feeding by populations of bivalve mollusks is reviewed with respect to their ability to act as an estuarine filter, increase clarity of coastal waters and facilitate the removal of nitrogen and other nutrients from eutrophic coastal waters. Most species of cultured bivalve mollusks clear particles from waters at rates of 1 to 4 L/h, and populations of shellfish in healthy assemblages can filter a substantial fraction of the water in coastal estuaries on a daily basis. Actively growing shellfish incorporate nitrogen and other nutrients into their tissues as they grow. On average, 16. 8 g of nitrogen is removed from estuaries for every kilogram of shellfish meats harvested. In addition to removal of nutrients through shellfisheries and <b>molluscan</b> aquaculture, <b>shellfish</b> beds may act to promote removal of nitrogen from estuaries by increasing organic nitrogen deposition to the sediments that stimulate denitrification processes.

40|$|<b>Bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> <b>shellfish</b> (BMS), such as oysters, when {{grown in}} waters {{impacted}} by human wastewater may bioaccumulate human enteric viruses such as Norovirus (NoV). NoV {{is the leading}} agent of foodborne viral gastroenteritis worldwide. A wide variety of different genotypes of NoV are believed to circulate in the community. This research project involved the quantification and identification of NoV genotypes in wastewater, oysters and in NoV outbreak related faecal samples. The overall aim {{of the project was}} to establish a link between NoV genotypes circulating in the community (through analysis of municipal wastewater) and their uptake in oysters. This link was further related to the risk to consumers by investigating NoV concentrations and genotypes in oysters and faecal samples related to two outbreaks of gastroenteritis. During the initial part of this study, NoV concentrations and genotypes were determined in oyster samples collected monthly over a 2 -year period from a commercial harvest area. Despite ongoing E. coli analysis indicating a category B classification under EU regulations, the area was closed for harvesting because of previous implication in a number of NoV related outbreaks. Total NoV (GI and GII) concentrations in oysters ranged from <LOQ to 20, 080 genome copies g(- 1) of digestive tissue (DT) and displayed a strong seasonal trend, greater concentrations occurring from October to March and correlated with the known increased seasonal prevalence of NoV illness in the population. Multiple NoV genotypes were identified in oysters from the harvest area; NoV GI. 4, GI. 3, GI. 2, GII. 4, GII. b, GII. 2, GII. 12, and GII. e. This study demonstrated that E. coli monitoring alone is not sufficient to assess the NoV contamination of shellfish harvesting area. Moreover, NoV genotypes changed over the study period, and unexpectedly high concentrations of NoV GI were present. The application of the nested RT-PCR targeting the part of the RNA-depended RNA polymerase (RdRp) was suitable for genotyping, but its usefulness was insuffiecint to distinguish between all GII. 4 variants. To determine the pathway of NoV strains present in the community and those subsequently accumulated in oysters, weekly samples of influent, secondary treated effluent, and oysters adjacent to a wastewater treatment (WWT) outfall were collected during the peak period of NoV community infections during 2010. A nested RT-PCR assay for NoV was used for phylogenetic analysis of NoV strains based on the N/S capsid domain of the genome. Over a 13 week study period, a total of 931 laboratory-confirmed cases of NoV GII infection were recorded in comparison to 16 cases of NoV GI. Despite the few cases of NoV GI reported, concentrations of NoV GI were similar to NoV GII detected in influent and effluent wastewater, and subsequently in oysters. The dominant strain implicated in NoV outbreaks in Ireland at this time was NoV GII. 4 variant 2010. However, in addition to detecting NoV GII. 4 variant 2010, multiple genotypes of NoV GI (GI. 1, GI. 4, GI. 5, GI. 6, and GI. 7), NoV GII (GII. 3, GII. 4, GII. 6, GII. 7, GII. 12, GII. 13, and GII. 17), and four putative NoV recombinant strains were identified in the wastewater and oyster samples. Different NoV genotype profiles were observed in influent, effluent and oysters possibly indicating differing survival characteristics or selective bioaccumulation by oysters of different NoV strains. This study demonstrated that a wide variety of NoV GI and GII strains is present in effluent wastewaters and may be potentially accumulated by oysters, highlighting that the role of oysters as a vector of multiple NoV GI and GII strains, including recombinants. In addition, it was demonstrated that the nested RT-PCR targeting the N/S domain of NoV genome allowed for better discrimination between strains, including GII. 4 variants, and the recombinant identification than the nested RT-PCR targeting the part of RdRp gene. Finally, the RT-qPCR and genotyping procedures previously implemented into the laboratory were used to investigate two separate oyster-related NoV outbreaks that occurred in Ireland in 2010 and 2012. In both outbreaks, NoV concentration in oysters exceeded 1000 genome copies g- 1 DT. In addition, highly similar or identical NoV sequences were detected in the faeces of individuals with gastroenteritis and in oysters that were served in restaurants and directly associated with illness. In faecal samples, GII. 13 was the only genotype implicated in outbreak 1, detected using direct sequencing, whereas multiple genotypes were detected in outbreak 2, following the application of cloning procedures. This study demonstrated that various genotypes are present in oyster samples containing high NoV concentrations, and therefore, cloning of faecal samples is vital to fully characterise the causative NoV genotype in outbreak investigations. Overall the findings from this thesis demonstrate that NoV genotypes detected in oysters can change over time, and in general are reflective of strains circulating in community. NoV genotype profiles detected in the influent, effluent and oyster samples varied indicating differing survival characteristics through the treatment process or preferential accumulation of some genotypes in oysters. Phylogenetic analysis of NoV sequences {{can be used as a}} supportive tool in tracking the origin of NoV oyster-related outbreaks. However, cloning of nested PCR products is recommended prior to sequencing of the NoV-positive faecal samples since multiple NoV GI and GII genotypes can be identified in the faeces of individuals. Oysters containing NoV concentrations in excess of 1000 genome copies g- 1 DT were responsible for both gastroenteritis outbreaks investigated in this study. Concentrations of NoV in the closed harvest area frequently exceeded these values and would probably have made people ill if consumed. Therefore, NoV monitoring using RT-qPCR can be used to monitor NoV contamination within shellfish harvesting areas at risk of human wastewater pollution and be used for risk management purposes...|$|R

One of the most persistent issues in the field of invertebrate pathology is the variability in terminology and definition, which has led to confusion in scientific communication. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of the pathological basis of bivalve disease (defensive, regressive and progressive phenomena) and contribute to the standardised terminology for <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscan</b> disease in the context of comparative pathology...|$|R
