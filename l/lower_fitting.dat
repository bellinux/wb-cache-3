The relationship used between tortuosity and porosity for stacked spheres results in five characteristic impedance models that require not more than two adjustable parameters.

Data for 12 of 26 grassland sites and for three beech wood sites are fitted better by hard-backed-layer models. Parameter values obtained by fitting slit-pore and phenomenological models to data for relatively low flow resistivity grounds, such as forest floors, porous asphalt, and gravel, are consistent with values that have been obtained non-acoustically. Three impedance models yield reasonable fits to a narrow band excess attenuation spectrum measured at short range over railway ballast but, if extended reaction is taken into account, the hard-backed- layer version of the slit-pore model gives the most reasonable parameter values...|$|E

40|$|Polymeric {{material}} such as {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) {{has been}} used for decades as insulating material. Any polymeric material will experience degradation after prolonged application of high electrical stresses. Deeper understanding of the long term electrical degradation of the insulating material is necessary to predict the life of high voltage cable. Electroluminescence method (EL) is used to detect the breakdown voltages of thin film LDPE. This method utilizes a Peltier cooled electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera to detect the breakdown of the sample. Statistical distribution of the AC breakdown voltages of 100 µm virgin and aged LDPE has been analysed. Comparison for the best fitted distribution was made for Weibull distribution and Johnson SB distribution using Anderson-Darling (A 2) goodness-of-fit and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (D) goodness-of-fit (GOF). Johnson SB is rarely used in high voltage engineering application. The probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative density function (CDF) for both distributions are defined in this article. The statistical parameters used are estimated based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for both distributions. Based on the statistical analysis, it is observed that Johnson SB provide better fitting than Weibull distribution with <b>lower</b> <b>fitting</b> error and that 3 -parameter Weibull is much better fitting than 2 -parameter Weibull distribution for most cases.

40|$|Supplemental damping {{can be used}} as a {{cost-effective}} method to reduce structural vibrations. In particular, passive systems are now widely accepted and have numerous applications in the field. However, they are typically tuned to specific excitations and their performances are bandwidth-limited. A solution is to use semi-active devices, which have shown to be capable of substantially enhanced mitigation performance. The authors have recently proposed a new type of semi-active device, which consists of a variable friction mechanism based on a vehicle duo-servo drum brake, a mechanically robust and reliable technology. The theoretical performance of the proposed device has been previously demonstrated via numerical simulations. In this paper, we further the understanding of the device, termed Modified Friction Device (MFD) by fabricating a small scale prototype and characterizing its dynamic behavior. While the dynamics of friction is well understood for automotive braking technology, we investigate for the first time the dynamic behavior of this friction mechanism at low displacements and velocities, in both forward and backward directions, under various hydraulic pressures. A modified 3 -stage dynamic model is introduced. A LuGre friction model is used to characterize the friction zone (Stage 1), and two pure stiffness regions to characterize the dynamics of the MFD once the rotation is reversed and the braking shoes are sticking to the drum (Stage 2) and the rapid build up of forces once the shoes are held by the anchor pin (Stage 3). The proposed model is identified experimentally by subjecting the prototype to harmonic excitations. It is found that the proposed model can be used to characterize the dynamics of the MFD, and that the largest fitting error arises at low velocity under low pressure input. The model is then verified by subjecting the MFD to two different earthquake excitations under different pressure inputs. The model is capable of tracking the device׳s response, despite a <b>lower</b> <b>fitting</b> performance under low pressure and small force output, as it was found in the harmonic tests due to the possible nonlinearity in Stage 2 of the model...|$|E
