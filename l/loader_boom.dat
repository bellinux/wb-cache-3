40|$|A {{circuit of}} the {{front-end}} loader hydraulic drive {{has been developed}} and {{it is based on}} a counterbalance valve, which provides load fixation in a certain position, proportional speed control and energy saving due to the load lowering under its own weight. Mathematical models of the <b>loader</b> <b>boom</b> hydraulic drive has been elaborated and the solutions have been obtained in MATLAB Simulink environment. The mathematical model takes into account pressure losses of the counterbalance valve, the results of computer simulation of the <b>loader</b> <b>boom</b> inertia moment and hydrodynamic force at the main spool of the counter-balance valve, calculated using Autodesk software product. Optimization criterion has been developed and optimal design parameters are found...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes the}} 5 T <b>loader</b> <b>boom</b> as the {{research}} object. Firstly, the static {{analysis of the}} boom loader is carried out under the typical working conditions. The weak part of the welding seam is found, and then the welding deformation of the boom is analyzed for the weak welding part. Further, the deformation trends of the welding arm are studied. It is found that the weak part of the welding seam is at the welding arc of the boom plate and the beam. Besides, the deformation of the arm plate is about 30 mm inward in the welding process due to the welding stress, and the residual stress of the boom. This work can provide theoretical and data support for the processing and deformation correction of the boom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Optimal {{control of}} a wheel loader {{operating}} in the short loading cycle is studied in order to investigate the potentials for fuel consumption reduction while maintaining acceptable production rates. The wheel loader is modeled as a system with five states and three control inputs including torque converter nonlinearities. The torque converter is modeled with no lockup enabling power transmission in both directions. The geometry of the wheel <b>loader</b> <b>boom</b> and the demanded force in the lift cylinders during lifting are used {{to ensure that the}} in-cylinder pressure remains below component’s limits. The lift-transport section of the short loading cycle is divided into four phases due to discontinuities in the gearbox ratios and fuel consumption is calculated in each phase. Time optimal and fuel optimal transients of the system and the power consumption in each and every component is presented showing the dominance of the torque converter losses compared to the other components especially in the time optimal solutions. It is shown that introducing path constraints on the maximum lifting speed of the bucket due to limitations in hydraulic pumping speed moves the diesel engine operation towards higher speeds {{in order to maintain the}} lifting speed. Trade-off between fuel optimal and time optimal transients is calculated which is found to be in agreement with the results of experimental studies...|$|E

The {{town and}} surrounding area {{is also home}} to an ATV dealership, two restaurants, three bars, two liquor stores, a K-12 school, two gas stations and several parks, one of which offers camping.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between {{the front of the}} wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a <b>loader</b> the single <b>boom</b> (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000 lb (2.2ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400 lb (225 kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000 lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000 lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70°. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines with are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a Telehandler and small crane.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{purposes}} of the paper are to discuss designing problems of machines used in underground mining and investigation of its reasons based on cracked boom of underground mine machine. Design/methodology/approach: Numerical and experimental approach was considered. The finite element method was used for numerical simulation. Fractographic and microscopic evaluation, chemical analysis, hardness tests were used to perform material evaluations. The objectives are achieved by numerical simulation of cracked <b>loader</b> <b>boom,</b> material evaluations of specimens and comparison of results achieved from both approaches. These were determined through a numerical experiment, based on a discrete model of the jib boom and predefined boundary conditions. The finite element analysis for the jib boom provided information about stress distribution for extreme load conditions. The study included macroscopic and fractographic inspection, microscopic evaluation as well as hardness tests of the material used for the jib boom. Conclusions from both approaches were drawn then. Findings: The causes of damage of a loader jib boom used at an underground copper mine were found. Practical implications: The study provides practical implication into designing process of mentioned objects by wider view of relationships between theoretical design and manufacturing process. Originality/value: The paper provides information backed by evaluation and test results, stating the nexus of causes of the boom failure. The experimental and numerical approaches show relationship between designing and manufacturing process of machines. This can be helpful for the designers and researchers looking for reasons, methods of investigations or how to prevent failures of similar machines...|$|E
