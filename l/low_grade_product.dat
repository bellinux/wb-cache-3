Recently, Karakul and Chan [Karakul, M., Chan, L., 2008. Analytical and managerial implications of integrating product substitutability {{in the joint}} pricing and procurement problem. European Journal of Operational Research 190, 179 - 204] considered this problem for two one-way substitutable products. Authors model the demands for each product in the well known additive form, where the mean demands are linear functions {{of the price of}} the high grade new product plus an additive stochastic noise term. By assuming that the noise term for the low grade existing product follows a general discrete distribution and the noise term for the high grade product follows a general continuous distribution, authors are able to show the unimodality of the expected profit function with respect to the procurement quantities and the price of the new product. In this paper, we extend this result to the case where the noise term in the demand of the <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>product</b> follows a general continuous distribution as well.

40|$|The steel {{industry}} in the United States generates about 30 million tons of by-products each year, including 6 million tons of desulfurization and BOF/BOP slag. The recycling of BF (blast furnace) slag has made significant progress in past years {{with much of the}} material being utilized as construction aggregate and in cementitious applications. However, the recycling of desulfurization and BOF/BOP slags still faces many technical, economic, and environmental challenges. Previous efforts have focused on in-plant recycling of the by-products, achieving only limited success. As a result, large amounts of by-products of various qualities have been stockpiled at steel mills or disposed into landfills. After more than 50 years of stockpiling and landfilling, available mill site space has diminished and environmental constraints have increased. The prospect of conventionally landfilling of the material is a high cost option, a waste of true national resources, and an eternal material liability issue. The research effort has demonstrated that major inroads have been made in establishing the viability of recycling and reuse of the steelmaking slags. The research identified key components in the slags, developed technologies to separate the iron units and produce marketable products from the separation processes. Three products are generated from the technology developed in this research, including a high <b>grade</b> iron <b>product</b> containing about 90 %Fe, a medium <b>grade</b> iron <b>product</b> containing about 60 % Fe, and a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> iron <b>product</b> containing less than 10 % Fe. The high <b>grade</b> iron <b>product</b> contains primarily metallic iron and can be marketed as a replacement of pig iron or DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) for steel mills. The medium <b>grade</b> iron <b>product</b> contains both iron oxide and metallic iron and can be utilized as a substitute for the iron ore in the blast furnace. The <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> iron <b>product</b> is rich in calcium, magnesium and iron oxides and silicates. It has a sufficient lime value and can be utilized for acid mine drainage treatment. Economic analysis from this research demonstrates that the results are favorable. The strong demand and the increase of price of the DRI and pig iron in recent years are particularly beneficial to the economics. The favorable economics has brought commercial interests. ICAN Global has obtained license agreement on the technology from Michigan Tech. This right was later transferred to the Westwood Land, Inc. A demonstration pilot plant is under construction to evaluate the technology. Steel industry will benefit from the new supply of the iron units once the commercial plants are constructed. Environmental benefits to the public and the {{steel industry}} will be tremendous. Not only the old piles of the slag will be removed, but also the federal responsible abandoned mines from the old mining activities can be remediated with the favorable product generated from the process. Cost can be reduced {{and there will be no}} lime required, which can avoid the release of carbon dioxide from lime production process...|$|R

40|$|In Scandinavia, sawlogs are {{typically}} sorted upon {{arrival at the}} sawmill. Presorting of sawlogs according to dimension, e. g., using an optical three-dimensional (3 D) scanner, is {{used to make the}} sawing process more efficient. However, since wood is a biological material with large variability, there will be large differences in the quality of wood sawn from different logs of similar size. For some dimensions of sawn goods, wood quality is very important and <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>products</b> will be difficult to sell, while for other dimensions, grade is less important. This means that if the quality of the sawn goods may be predicted before actual sawing takes place, the production of off-grade products, i. e., products not meeting customer demands, may be reduced. Some quality information may be obtained using the outer shape information from a 3 D scanner and more detailed information on the internal quality of the log can be obtained using an X-ray log scanner. Today, the use of X-ray log scanners is becoming increasingly common and most sawmills installing an X-ray scanner already have a 3 D scanner present. This raises the question of possible benefits from combining the X-ray and 3 D scanning techniques. In this thesis, a method has been developed where the log shape measured by the 3 D scanner is utilized to estimate the X-ray path lengths through the wood. This allows the calculation of green density profiles of the log, which may in turn be used to calculate quality variables such as heartwood content and heartwood density. The hypothesis of this project has been that the precision in these variables will be improved by the 3 D path length compensation of the X-ray data. The method has been tested on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sawlogs, using both simulated and industrial log scanner data. Scanners with one and two X-ray directions have been used. The most important conclusions from the project are that: - Heartwood diameter predictions are significantly improved by the combination of 3 D and X-ray data. - Dry and green heartwood densities can be calculated with improved precision relative to scanning using X-ray only. - The method was found suitable for application with both one- and two-directional X-ray scanners. - For a sawmill already using both 3 D and X-ray scanners, there is a large improvement potential available using existing equipment. For sawmills thinking about investing in an X-ray scanner, the possibility of connecting it to the 3 D scanner should make the rate of return of the equipment higher and encourage more sawmills to make this investment.

40|$|Wraps are an unleavened, flat, and {{circular}} {{bread that}} is 1 - 2 mm thick. White bread flour made from wheat is extensively {{used in the}} manufacture of wraps in South Africa. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> flour is a by product of milling and {{can be used as a}} cheaper alternative to white bread flour. Its high phenolic content and associated antioxidant activity may offer potential health benefits such as reduction in the risk of lifestyle diseases related to oxidative stress. In addition, its relatively higher dietary fibre content offers potential anti-diabetic properties unlike white bread flour which has a high glycaemic index. However the weak gluten quality of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour can compromise the dough rheological properties and quality of wraps. Xanthan gum can improve weak gluten quality by mimicking the viscoelastic properties of gluten. Xanthan is also known to improve the quality of baked products. The objective of this research was to produce a health beneficial wrap of good quality using <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with added xanthan gum. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> wheat flour was used to manufacture wraps. Xanthan gum (0. 5 % and 0. 25 % (w/w)) was added to <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour. The dough rheological properties of the flour, the quality, and shelf life of the wraps were determined. White bread flour was used as a reference sample in this research. Water absorption, and Farinograph mixing stability of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour increased with increasing concentration of xanthan gum. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum had similar mixing stability to white bread flour. Mixing tolerance index (MTI) of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour decreased with addition of xanthan gum, and the MTI of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 25 % xanthan gum was similar to white bread flour. At 50 % flour hydration (constant hydration), as well as at flour hydration according to Farinograph water absorption (adapted hydration), the dough tenacity of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour was increased by the addition of xanthan gum, while the dough extensibility was decreased by xanthan gum addition. At adapted hydration, the dough extensibility of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum was similar to the dough extensibility of white bread flour. The P/L ratio expresses the relationship between the dough strength, and the dough extensibility. The P/L ratio of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum had a value of 0. 5 which makes it suitable for bread making. The pasting viscosities of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour increased with the addition of xanthan gum. Wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour did not puff during baking. Xanthan gum addition however did improve puffing in wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour. The puffing of wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum was similar to the puffing of wraps made from white bread flour. Wraps could only be stored for three days before mould growth was visible. Wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 25 % xanthan gum had the lowest rollability score, a lower modulus and higher extensibility over time. On day 0, all wraps exhibited a B-type crystallinity as determined by X-Ray diffractometer. The % crystallinity of all wraps increased over storage time. Percent crystallinity increased from 5 % to 11. 6 % for wraps made from white bread flour; for wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour it increased from 7 % to 11 %; for wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour; with added xanthan gum (0. 25 %) it increased from 7 % to 12 %, and for wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with added xanthan gum (0. 5 %) it increased from 5. 1 % to 13 %. A thermogram peak on the DSC was only visible on day 3 of storage between 95 and 102 ◦C for the wrap made from white bread flour. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour were higher than those of wraps made from white bread flour. Simulated gastro-intestinal digests of the wraps had higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity than the acidified methanol extract. The relatively higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour indicates that they may offer potential health benefits. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> flour however produces a poor quality wrap, with a reduced shelf life. Addition of xanthan gum to <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour improves dough rheology, as well as the quality of wraps. This is possibly due to the interactions which occur between xanthan gum and wheat proteins, as well as between xanthan gum with the amylose of the starch molecule. The wraps with 0. 25 % xanthan gum produce wraps with a better quality. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014. lk 2014 Food ScienceMScUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Aims The {{classification}} of abdominal mucinous neoplasia is a controversial area. In 2010, WHO published a classification which divides pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) into <b>low</b> and high <b>grades.</b> The {{aim of the}} authors was to correlate this classification with the prognosis and site of primary neoplasm. Methods The authors reviewed 274 patients with PMP who had undergone surgery at a single institution and classified them according to WHO criteria. The findings were correlated with clinical information and survival data. Results PMP was <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> in 78 % of patients and high grade in 22 %. The appendix accounted for 94 % of lesions, and the most common primary tumour was a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Colorectal primaries {{were more likely to}} be associated with high grade PMP. There was an excellent correlation between the grade of the PMP and the primary neoplasm; only two cases showed discordant morphology: both were high grade appendiceal adenocarcinomas that were associated with <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> PMP. Nodal metastases were more likely in high grade lesions, but there was no significant difference in the rate of parenchymal organ invasion between <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> and high <b>grade.</b> <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> morphology was associated with significantly longer survival than high grade (overall 5 -year survival of 63 % for <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> and 23 % for high grade).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), a group of proteolytic enzymes with {{a central role in}} extracellular matrix invasion and degradation, in stromal sarcomas. METHODS: 11 endometrial stromal sarcomas (four <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours, seven high grade) were stained for MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and MMP- 9 using immunohistochemical stains. The surgical material consisted of nine hysterectomy specimens and two pelvic recurrences. Three hysterectomy specimens, removed for leiomyomas, were studied as controls. Staining area was evaluated using image analysis. RESULTS: Age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 21 to 67 years. Four of the 11 patients (three with high grade tumours and one with a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumour) died of the disease, six remained free of disease, and one was lost to follow up. Staining for MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and MMP- 9 was more diffuse in high grade tumours than in <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours and controls. Staining for MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 was more pronounced in high <b>grade</b> than in <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours (p = 0. 04; p = 0. 05). Staining for MMP- 9 was significantly greater in all stromal sarcomas than in controls (p < 0. 001 for high grade tumours v controls; p < 0. 01 for <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours v controls). Diffuse staining for MMP- 2, exceeding 90 % of the tumour area, was observed in three of seven high grade tumours but in no <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours. There was no apparent correlation between staining for any of the three enzymes and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Both <b>low</b> and high <b>grade</b> endometrial stromal tumours express matrix metalloproteinases. MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 are expressed more diffusely in high <b>grade</b> than in <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours. In the individual case, diffuse staining for MMP- 2 appears to best characterise the high grade tumours. Thus staining for MMP- 2 may aid in differentiating high <b>grade</b> from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours, and MMP- 9 in differentiating normal endometrial stroma from <b>low</b> and high <b>grade</b> endometrial stromal sarcomas.

In diffuse, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> lymphomas bcl- 2 protein was uniformly expressed by most tumour cells. However, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> lymphomas with a follicular pattern did not express bcl- 2. The diffuse, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> lymphomas were negative for p 53, while occasional larger {{cells in the}} follicular subtype were positive. Both high grade lymphomas were bcl- 2 negative but strongly p 53 positive. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study indicates that there is an inverse correlation between p 53 and bcl- 2 immunostaining in thyroid lymphomas (<b>low</b> <b>grade</b> lymphomas: bcl- 2 positive, p 53 negative; high grade lymphomas: bcl- 2 negative, p 53 positive). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for bcl- 2 and p 53 proteins does not distinguish florid Hashimoto's thyroiditis from diffuse, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> thyroid lymphoma...|$|R
