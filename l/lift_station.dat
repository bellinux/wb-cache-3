6000|$|In {{the course}} of another minute Melville found himself {{on the side of}} the road {{opposite}} the <b>lift</b> <b>station,</b> regarding the ascending car. The boldly trimmed bonnet, vivid, erect, assertive, went gliding upward, a perfect embodiment of sound common sense. His mind was lapsing once again into disorder; he was stunned, as it were, by the vigour of her ladyship's view. Could any one not absolutely right be quite so clear and emphatic? And if so, what became of all that oppression of foreboding, that sinister promise of an escape, that whisper of [...] "other dreams," [...] that had dominated his mind only a short half-hour before? ...|$|E
50|$|Another mode {{of system}} failure can include power outages, which may disable <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> pumps and cause sewage {{overflow}} from the <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> wet well. <b>Lift</b> <b>station</b> mechanical or power failure causes approximately {{ten percent of}} United States SSOs. This type of discharge is uncommon from combined sewers, because the combined volume of sewage and storm water discourages use of lift stations. Broken sewer lines are responsible for approximately ten percent of U.S. SSOs.|$|E
2500|$|Environmental Services' {{network of}} sewer lines and <b>lift</b> <b>stations,</b> {{delivers}} wastewater to the City's award-winning wastewater treatment facility. It {{is made up}} of [...] of sanitary sewer lines with 5200 manholes and 52 <b>lift</b> <b>stations.</b> The facility treats 13 million gallons of wastewater per day and serves approximately 100,000 customers. [...] By-products of the treatment's process are sold in the form of effluent reclaimed water and high-grade pelletized solids for soil conditioning.|$|R

5000|$|Availability of {{reliable}} pumps allows lifting accumulations {{of water into}} gravity sewers from collection sumps in excavations like mines or building foundations; {{but the cost of}} pumping surface runoff discourages use of <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> in storm drains or combined sewers. The capitalized cost of operation and maintenance of <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> and emergency power supplies usually justifies considerable first cost for excavation or tunneling to build a gravity sewer. Sewage treatment is most efficient at centralized locations; and pumping is often required to lift sewage from lower elevations to the sewage treatment plant headworks. Structures called regulators allow overflow into gravity outfall sewers when peak flow in combined sewers exceeds pumping capacity. Sanitary sewers are preferred for cost-effective pumping of sewage when treatment is required. Gravity sewers are preferred where grades are favorable, but <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> often move sewage to sewage treatment plants.|$|R

50|$|Wastewater is {{collected}} from customers and conveyed using gravity sewers, <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> and force mains. The system has 21 <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> to pump wastewater over rises in terrain where gravity flow is not economical. Wastewater ultimately reaches the Osceola Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF), {{which has a}} design capacity of 2.5 e6USgal L per day. At the WWTF, influent wastewater is treated in faculative lagoons {{in accordance with the}} city's NPDES permit administrated by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Water is treated within the lagoons for two to four months before being discharged to the Mississippi River via a pumping station. An industrial pretreatment program has been in effect since 2004.|$|R

50|$|Augedalsbro, {{also called}} Åvedalsbro, {{is an ancient}} place for a bridge that crossed Augedalselva (also known as the Vigga River). There was a <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> there in older times. This was where {{the old and new}} Bergensveien (Bergen road) met and Høgkorsveien (high cross road) went from here and over to Toten. Although the place for a bridge was moved to Rosendal a bit further up the river in the mid-1800s, Augedalsbro {{continued}} to be a <b>lift</b> <b>station.</b> The site was also the meeting place for the municipal council in the old municipality of Brandbu. Nearby is the Old Molstad mill (Molstadkvern mølle) from 1915, today a part of Hadeland Folkemuseum.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, {{the town}} {{constructed}} a central wastewater treatment plant, sanitary sewer collection system and <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> to pump sewage {{to the treatment}} plant. The plant is rated at 40,000 gallons per day, and discharges its treated water to the Greens Fork River.|$|E
5000|$|An area of {{the west}} side of the {{downtown}} and an area near the former Rath Packing facility were impacted, not directly by water coming from the river, but as a result of storm runoff draining towards the river but then being trapped on the back side of the flood levy system. These areas did not have <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> or alternate pumping capacity sufficient to force this water back to the river side of the control system. Areas where <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> had been constructed (Virden Creek and East 7th Street [...] ) to pump this storm runoff into the swollen river remained largely dry (the east and north sides of downtown). Several areas experienced water seeping into basements due to high water-table levels.|$|R

50|$|The boilers began {{operation}} in 1907 and the <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> started to pump {{water from the}} Rio Grande. Wood was used in units of 2 to 3 cords (7 to 11 m³) and a crew of 26 men with teams of mules worked around the clock to keep the boilers fed.|$|E
5000|$|Potable {{water for}} much of Northwest Arkansas is treated by Beaver Water District's water {{treatment}} plant, located in eastern Lowell near Beaver Lake. Wastewater is collected by gravity sewer and sent to a <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> near the Monroe Avenue exit on I-49. It is then pumped south, eventually being treated at the Springdale Wastewater Treatment Plant.|$|E
50|$|As {{the need}} for the pumping of {{difficult}} media expanded to other industries, so did the use of the chopper pump in both dry and submersible applications and in various industries, including meat, paper and food processing, as well as the automobile industry, biogas, chemical plants, municipal wastewater and prison <b>lift</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|Mount Seymour {{has three}} weather stations: {{one at the}} bottom of the Mystery Peak Chairlift, one near tower 9 of the Mystery Peak Chairlift, and one just below Brockton Point which is the top <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> of the Brockton Chairlift. Except for the unusually warm winter of 2004-2005, there is usually a snow depth of 500 cm or more at the Brockton weather station.|$|E
5000|$|... === Force mains === Pumps may be {{necessary}} where gravity sewers serve areas at lower elevations than the sewage treatment plant, or distant areas at similar elevations. A <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> is a sewer sump that lifts accumulated sewage to a higher elevation. The pump may discharge to another gravity sewer at that location or may discharge through a pressurized force main to some distant location.|$|E
50|$|The {{engineers}} of Quarry Park studied polders extensively, {{which are}} low-lying areas near water and {{often found in}} the Netherlands and other seaside countries. Based on the engineering of polders, Quarry Park was built with an insulated, reinforced riprap berm designed to withstand a one-in-100 year flood event. Other precautions were also taken including a stormwater <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> to discharge rainwater into the Bow River, and overland canals to divert and filter water.|$|E
50|$|Wastewater {{collection}} systems {{consist of}} a set of lines, junctions and <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> to convey sewage to a wastewater treatment plant. When these Herr lines are compromised by rupture, cracking or tree root invasion, infiltration/inflow of stormwater often occurs. This circumstance can lead to a sanitary sewer overflow, or discharge of untreated sewage to the environment.|$|R
50|$|Fayetteville owns its own {{wastewater}} operation, {{including a}} network of pipes and <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> which convey wastewater to the city's two wastewater treatment plants. Both plants are operated by CH2M and regulated by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Historically, all sewage {{was sent to the}} Paul R. Noland Wastewater Treatment Plant (Noland WWTP) {{on the east side of}} town. However, development on the city's west side as well as the expense of pumping wastewater over East Mountain led the city to build the West Side WWTP in 2008. In addition to these two facilities, Fayetteville also operates 39 <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> to pump wastewater over steep elevation rises in order to utilize gravity flow toward the WWTPs. Fayetteville also maintains a biosolids management program, in which biosolids, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, are land applied to provide nutrients to soil on which crops are grown.|$|R
50|$|Wastewater {{is treated}} at a {{facility}} on Lake Macatawa near the BPW's James DeYoung power plant. The plant spans {{both sides of}} River Avenue. Over 180 mi of pipe and 36 <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> are used on pipes up to 36 in in diameter. Wastewater is collected from the City of Holland and portions of neighboring townships (Park, Laketown, Fillmore and Holland Charter).|$|R
