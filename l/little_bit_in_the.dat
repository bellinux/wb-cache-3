25|$|The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regular season—finishing 53–29 {{and losing}} their Midwest Division {{title to the}} Denver Nuggets—but it was another {{successful}} year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, {{but in the end}} the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E
500|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the riders started in reverse order of the general classification, so Pinot was the last one to start. The riders went off the {{starting}} ramp in two minutes increments. Cancellara got on course early, as he was the seventh man to start. He clocked a time of 48' 55", which would stay a reference for most of the day. He was followed out of the starting area by Matthias Brändle (IAM Cycling) who came in 2' 28" [...] after Cancellara, somewhat surprisingly as he is a time trial specialist too. Malori set the best time at the [...] intermediate point but faded a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, coming to the finish line only 15 seconds off Cancellara's time. The Swiss would stay as a reference for a while now that some time trial specialists had finished their effort and failed to beat him. Damien Gaudin (Ag2r-La Mondiale) clocked in a time of 50' 46" [...] which put him in sixth position.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong told Bloody Disgusting {{reviewer}} Mike Pereira that {{he thinks}} [...] "visually" [...] Saw VI might be his favorite, saying [...] "We're kind of pulling back a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> color palette. It's {{going to be more}} suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like III and IV. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On Saw V, I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more." [...] He commented that the [...] "steam room" [...] trap was the [...] "best looking" [...] of them all. [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex Saw. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing." [...] Commenting on the [...] "carousel room" [...] trap Armstrong said: [...] "It's very carnival, playground-like. It's just nasty. [...] spinning red lights in there. It's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning." [...] Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine Fangoria that the [...] "carousel room" [...] was, to date, the [...] "longest trap scene ever". He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel, but it was ultimately scaled down to six, to [...] "tie in to the [...] title".

He once again led from the start, then turned back a brief {{challenge}} by Meadow Star down the stretch to win by [...] lengths. [...] "I just tightened him up a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stretch and let him cruise on home," [...] said Smith. [...] "I felt no pressure at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it felt as though I was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E

5000|$|Badna {{is celebrated}} when the {{planting}} of paddy crops is completed. They celebrate {{it as the}} festival named “Sohrai”. This festival is celebrated among many communities, like -kole, munda, kora etc., but is celebrated a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Santhal community because their animal helps them to grow crops in field. Therefore, they are acknowledging them by this [...] "Badna" [...] festival.|$|R

60|$|That {{made her}} flush, {{and as the}} men crowded round her for dances she looked magnificent. She filled up all her dances except three, and those she left blank. Mrs. Hauksbee caught her eye once; {{and she knew it}} was war--real war-- between them. She started {{handicapped}} in the struggle, for she had ordered Bremmil about just the least <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world too much; and he was beginning to resent it. Moreover, he had never seen his wife look so lovely.|$|E
60|$|Dicky Hatt {{was kidnapped}} in his early, early youth--neither by landlady's daughter, housemaid, barmaid, nor cook, {{but by a}} girl so nearly of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just the least <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world below it. This {{happened}} a month before he came out to India, and five days after his one-and-twentieth birthday. The girl was nineteen--six years older than Dicky in the things of this world, that is to say--and, for the time, twice as foolish as he.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, Tera filled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vocal. One {{thing that}} they never had {{suspected}} was that Tera's high pitched voice was actually too high the technology that time. Even when the microphone was a good quality one, and Tera had {{tried so hard to}} keep a proper distance during the recording, her vocal still off peak every time the songs got intensified. So she had to hold her vocal a <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> <b>In</b> Crossing <b>the</b> Railroad album she put a lot of influence from Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin and Alanis Morissette.|$|R

60|$|Neither Ralph nor {{his sister}} nor {{either of the}} Drane ladies had the least {{reason to believe that}} Dora minded the news {{contained}} in Miriam's note, except that it had given her a heartfelt delight and joy, and that it had made her unable to wait a single moment longer than was necessary to come and tell them all how earnestly she congratulated them, and what a capital good thing she thought it was. She caught Ralph by himself and spoke to him so much like a sympathetic sister that he was a little, just the least <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, pained.|$|E
6000|$|When he sailed, he {{was very}} full of a great plan to prove himself several hundred times better than any one had given him credit for--to work like a horse, and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter. He had many good points besides his good looks; his only fault being that he was weak, the least <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world weak. He had as much notion of economy as the Morning Sun; and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item, and say: [...] "Herein Phil Garron is extravagant or reckless." [...] Nor could you point out any {{particular}} vice in his character; but he was [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] and as workable as putty.|$|E
6000|$|Under the new Post Office, one evening, Mrs. Landys-Haggert {{turned on}} him, and spoke her mind shortly and without warning.

[...] This seems to support, by the way, the theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found out. Hannasyde was taken off his guard. His defence never was a strong one, because he was always thinking of himself, and he blurted out, before {{he knew what he was}} saying, this inexpedient answer, [...] "No more I do." ...|$|E
5000|$|This was not {{the first}} time the Patriots had seen the tuck rule invoked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001 NFL season.
