5|$|When Ohno {{was very}} young, his father meticulously {{researched}} childcare providers {{to care for}} his son during his long work hours. As he grew older, his father became concerned his son would become a <b>latchkey</b> kid, so he got his son involved with competitive swimming and quad-speed roller skating at age 6. He later switched from the instruction of Benton Redford, a National Champion, to a team in Federal Way, WA called Pattisons Team Extreme and became a national inline speedskating champion and record holder himself. His father used Inline Speedskating to fill his spare time. Ohno's days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.|$|E

60|$|In the {{selection}} of occupations we were governed {{by a variety of}} considerations, such as personal fitness, inclination, and so forth. My mother opened a select private school for instruction in the art of changing the spots upon leopard-skin rugs; my eldest brother, George Henry, who had a turn for music, became a bugler in a neighboring asylum for deaf mutes; my sister, Mary Maria, took orders for Professor Pumpernickel's Essence of <b>Latchkeys</b> for flavoring mineral springs, and I set up as an adjuster and gilder of crossbeams for gibbets. The other children, too young for labor, continued to steal small articles exposed in front of shops, as they had been taught.|$|R
25|$|As Williams' {{mother worked}} several jobs to support them, Williams was a <b>latchkey</b> kid and often engaged in {{mischief}} on the streets. Williams recalled that, as a child, he would {{hang out in}} abandoned houses and vacant lots around his neighborhood in South Central where he would watch adults get drunk, abuse drugs, gamble and engage in pit bull fights. Williams stated that after the adults finished the dog fighting they would make the children fight each other. Williams participated in these street fights regularly as a child where adults would bet on him and give him part of the proceeds for winning his fights. Williams was often the target of older bullies in his neighborhood and, {{by the age of}} twelve, he began carrying a switchblade in order to protect himself against older street thugs.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from November 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Will and John are prosperous young businessmen and close friends. Will has {{an apartment in the}} city, while John lives in the suburbs. When Will goes to the country on his vacation he leaves the <b>latchkey</b> of his apartment with his chum, telling him to make himself at home. The landlady in the house in which Will lives is seized with a bright idea that she can sublet his apartment during his absence. May and Belle, two pretty girls who are in business, decide to try their hand at housekeeping. They rent Will's apartment and settle down in their new quarters. John decides to take advantage of his friend's invitation and make use of his rooms. He lets himself in with the <b>latchkey,</b> and is amazed to find the two girls sound asleep. Believing him to be a burglar the girls threaten him with annihilation. John thinks the joke too good to spoil, so does not try to square himself, but pleads for mercy. May secures his promise that he will never 'burgle' again, and allows him to escape. Unknown to John, May has been engaged by his partner as a typist, and when she enters the office the following morning and finds John opening the safe, she decides that once again her burglar has been caught red-handed. She calls for help, and is greatly chagrined when her supposed burglar is introduced as her employer. Amid explanations, the 'burglar' and the lady shake hands and become good friends." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and <b>latchkey</b> kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E
6000|$|I'm {{right with}} you on the {{question}} of the [...] "home-like" [...] system of having fun. I think we'll all agree beautifully on that. I've had all the cheap bohemia that I want. I can tell you, none of the [...] "climbers" [...] and the cocktail crowd are going to bring their vaporings into my house. It's for the clean, merry life, with your best friends in the game and a general concentration of energies and aims. I am having a cedarwood club cut from the mountains with knots on it, and I am going to stand in my hallway (when I have one) and edit with it the cards of all callers. You and Mrs. will have <b>latchkeys,</b> of course.|$|R
60|$|While he {{was away}} his mother and sisters--Lady Agnes now {{sometimes}} wrote to him--returned to London for a month, and before he was again established in Rosedale Road they went back for a third course of Broadwood. After they had been there five days--and this was the salt of the whole feast--Julia took herself off to Harsh, leaving them in undisturbed possession. They had remained so--they wouldn't come up to town till after Easter. The trick was played, and Biddy, as I have mentioned, was now very content. Her brother presently learned, however, that the reason of this was not wholly {{the success of the}} trick; unless indeed her further ground were only a continuation of it. She was not in London as a forerunner of her mother; she was not even as yet in Calcutta Gardens. She had come to spend a week with Florry Tressilian, who had lately taken the dearest little flat in a charming new place, just put up, {{on the other side of}} the Park, with all kinds of lifts and tubes and electricities. Florry had been awfully nice to her--had been with them ever so long at Broadwood while the flat was being painted and prepared--and mamma had then let her, let Biddy, promise to come to her, when everything was ready, so that they might have a happy old maids' (for they were, old maids now!) house-warming together. If Florry could by this time do without a chaperon--she had two <b>latchkeys</b> and went alone on the top of omnibuses, and her name was in the Red Book--she was enough of a duenna for another girl. Biddy referred with sweet cynical eyes to the fine happy stride she had thus taken in the direction of enlightened spinsterhood; and Nick hung his head, immensely abashed and humiliated, for, modern as he had fatuously supposed himself, there were evidently currents more modern yet.|$|R

2500|$|Rall's 1990s work {{focused on}} the issues and {{concerns}} surrounding twentysomethings and Generation X, terms coined in the late 1980s to describe people born in the 1960s. While living in San Francisco Rall met Dave Eggers, who hired him as a contributing editor and writer for Might magazine, a publication Eggers edited and co-founded. Among other essays, Rall authored two seminal essays for Might, [...] "Confessions of an Investment Banker" [...] and [...] "College is for Suckers." [...] He wrote op/ed columns for The New York Times, including [...] "Why I Will Not Vote" [...] (1994), which justified apathy among Generation Xers who saw neither Democrats nor Republicans responding to their concerns. In 1998 Rall published [...] "Revenge of the <b>Latchkey</b> Kids", a compendium of essays and cartoons that criticized the Baby Boomer-dominated media for ignoring and ridiculing young adults and their achievements.|$|E
60|$|Getting back to facts, Stickney {{rang the}} {{doorbell}} of 45. He {{had a habit}} of forgetting his <b>latchkey.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} deep in gloomy thought when he {{inserted}} his <b>latchkey</b> {{and opened the}} door of his flat.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} two o'clock {{when he heard}} the sound of her <b>latchkey</b> and went out at once upon the landing.|$|E

60|$|They {{had reached}} her home. It looked very dark and very uninviting. She shivered {{as she took}} her <b>latchkey</b> from the bag which she was carrying.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly an idea {{occurred}} to him. Slipping his <b>latchkey</b> {{into his pocket}} he {{went out of the}} house and closed the door softly. Then he rang the bell.|$|E
60|$|Small {{objects of}} no value have {{the secret of}} {{sticking}} {{to a man in}} an astonishing way. I had nearly lost my liberty and even my life, I had lost my ship, a money-belt full of gold, I had lost my companions, had parted from my friend; my occupation, my only link with life, my touch with the sea, my cap and jacket were gone—but a small penknife and a <b>latchkey</b> had never parted company with me. With the <b>latchkey</b> I opened the door of refuge. The hall wore its deaf-and-dumb air, its black-and-white stillness.|$|E

60|$|On {{reaching}} home, {{and entering}} the little lighted hall with his <b>latchkey,</b> {{the first thing}} that caught his eye was his wife's gold-mounted umbrella lying on the rug chest. Flinging off his fur coat, he hurried to the drawing-room.|$|E
