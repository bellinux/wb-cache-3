2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E
5000|$|... 525e / 528e: The 525e (called 528e in North America and Japan) uses a 2.7-litre 6-cylinder M20 {{petrol engine}} which is tuned to provide torque at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> {{rather than the}} {{traditional}} high revving characteristics of BMW straight-6 engines. According to BMW, the 525e is more fuel efficient than the 520i, which has the same rated power of 92 kW. In Austria, a power reduced 525e with 88 kW was sold.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{exchange}} in the pressure-wave supercharger occurs at sound velocity, resulting in good response even at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> a common downfall of turbocharged engines. It combines {{the advantages of}} mechanical and exhaust gas supercharging.|$|R

50|$|A {{new arrival}} is the Belgian D-Motor LF26, a compact 2.7-litre {{flat-four}} aero-engine that has direct {{drive to a}} propeller, rather than a reduction gearbox. As the engine was designed to produce peak power of 90 bhp at only 2800 rpm, this very <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> meant the designers could dispense with the complexity of an ohv valvetrain. The resulting simplicity, lightness, compactness and reliability are ideal in an aero-engine. D-Motor has developed a 125 bhp 6-cylinder version, the D-Motor LF39.|$|E
50|$|Early large {{displacement}} motorcycles provided riders with {{a manual}} control for this when kick starters were used while later models linked {{them to the}} kick lever through a cable for automatic operation. Though it only uses electric start, not kick start, the 2012 Ducati 1199 uses a compression release, which is automatically activated at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> by a centrifugal flyweight on each exhaust cam. This reduces the work of cranking the high 12.5:1 compression ratio engine, allowing a smaller battery and smaller starter motor, for a total weight savings of 3.3 kg.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1971 the H2 was {{a direct}} result of the success of the 500 cc Kawasaki H1 Mach III {{introduced}} in 1969. The H2 engine was a 3-cylinder two-stroke with an engine displacement of [...] which produced [...] at 6,800 rpm, a power-to-weight ratio of [...] to every 5.7 lb of weight. This was an entirely new engine and not a bored-out 500. Unlike the H1 500, the 750 had much more <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> torque, with a strong burst of power starting at 3,500 rpm to the 7,500 rpm red line.|$|E
50|$|Ski {{bikes are}} also used in the Freestyle {{category}} however this requires further structural changes to the size and motor, allowing the Ski to become considerably shorter in length, lighter in weight and able to perform better at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... i-VTEC is {{the acronym}} for {{intelligent}} VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control), an evolution of Honda's VTEC engine. The i-VTEC engine works by controlling {{the timing and}} lifting of the camshafts depending on <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The valves open a small amount during <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. The valves will open wider at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve higher performance.|$|R
50|$|The engine's Variable-length Intake Manifold (VIM) {{switches}} {{between a}} long intake manifold at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{and a short}} intake manifold at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Proton cars use a longer intake manifold to achieve slower air flow; as {{it was found that}} promotes better mixing with fuel. The short intake manifold allows more air in faster. This is beneficial at high RPMs.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, {{fuel-efficient}} highway cruising with <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> was in {{some cases}} enabled on cars equipped with 3- or 4-speed transmissions {{by means of a}} separate overdrive unit in or behind the rear housing of the transmission. This was actuated either manually while in high gear by throwing a switch or pressing a button on the gearstick knob or on the steering column, or automatically by momentarily lifting the foot from the accelerator with the car travelling above a certain road speed. Automatic overdrives were disengaged by flooring the accelerator, and a lockout control was provided to enable the driver to disable overdrive and operate the transmission as a normal (non-overdrive) transmission.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the ESL {{produced}} 194 PS (143 kW) {{in accordance}} with the German and French insurance category limits in force at the time for engines under 3 litres.(The BMW 2.8 and Audi 2.8 produced the same figure circa 194 PS.) In 2000, Porsche retuned the Peugeot/Citroën version of the engine introducing variable valve timing on the intake camshafts varying between 0 and 40 degrees, improving fuel consumption, <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> flexibility for the introduction of the Peugeot 607 and Citroën C5. This iteration, called ES9 J4S, can now achieve 207 PS (152 kW). In 2005, Peugeot/Citroën slightly upgraded the power to 211 PS (155 kW). This version is not used by Renault who is now focusing on Nissan-developed V6.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{intake valve}} closing (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> high vacuum conditions is by closing the intake valve earlier than normal. This involves closing the intake valve midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake valve closing greatly reduces pumping losses. [...] Studies have shown early intake valve closing reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early intake valve closing is that it significantly lowers {{the temperature of the}} combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{modification}} depends greatly {{on the degree}} of performance enhancement desired, budget, and the characteristics of the engine to be modified. Intake, exhaust, and chip upgrades are usually amongst the first modifications made as they are the cheapest, make reasonably general improvements, whereas a different camshaft, for instance, requires trading off smoothness at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> for improvements at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R

50|$|Appearing in the 1989-1998 Dodge Ram pickup truck, {{it became}} a popular {{alternative}} to the large V8 gasoline engines normally used in full-size pickup trucks, since it produced the torque at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> and significantly better fuel mileage.

50|$|Swirl: Variable {{geometry}} {{can create}} a beneficial air swirl pattern, or turbulence in the combustion chamber. The swirling helps distribute the fuel and form a homogeneous air-fuel mixture - this aids the initiation of the combustion process, helps minimise engine knocking, and helps facilitate complete combustion. At low revolutions per minute (rpm), {{the speed of the}} airflow is increased by directing the air through a longer path with limited capacity (i.e., cross-sectional area) - and this assists in improving <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> torque. At high rpms, the shorter and larger path opens when the load increases, so that a greater amount of air with least resistance can enter the chamber - this helps maximise 'top-end' power. In double overhead camshaft (DOHC) designs, the air paths may sometimes be connected to separate intake valves so the shorter path can be excluded by de-activating the intake valve itself.|$|E
5000|$|All 645 engines utilize {{either a}} Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}} for cylinder scavenging. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design {{that uses a}} gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine.

50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} the <b>speed</b> of the <b>engine.</b> This means that at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> the steering would naturally operate faster than at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the pump's output back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches {{the end of its}} stroke.|$|R
25|$|Throttle lag {{occurs because}} turbochargers {{rely on the}} buildup of exhaust gas {{pressure}} to drive the turbine. In variable output systems such as automobile engines, exhaust gas pressure at idle, <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> or <b>low</b> throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine. Only when the <b>engine</b> reaches sufficient <b>speed</b> does the turbine section start to spool up, or spin fast enough to produce intake pressure above atmospheric pressure.|$|R
50|$|Although {{an inline}} six-cylinder engine {{can also be}} timed for {{inherent}} primary and secondary balance, a straight-eight develops more power strokes per revolution and, as a result, will run more smoothly under load than an inline six. Also, due to the even number of power strokes per revolution, a straight-eight does not produce unpleasant odd-order harmonic vibration in the vehicle's driveline at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Engine {{efficiency}} {{varies with}} speed and torque. For driving {{at a steady}} speed one cannot choose any operating point for the engine—rather there is a specific amount of power needed to maintain the chosen speed. A manual transmission lets the driver choose between several points along the powerband. For a turbo diesel too low a gear will move the engine into a high-rpm, low-torque region in which the efficiency drops off rapidly, and thus best efficiency is achieved near the higher gear. In a gasoline engine, efficiency typically drops off more rapidly than in a diesel because of throttling losses. Because cruising at an efficient speed uses {{much less than the}} maximum power of the engine, the optimum operating point for cruising at low power is typically at very <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> around or below 1000 rpm. This explains the usefulness of very high [...] "overdrive" [...] gears for highway cruising. For instance, a small car might need only [...] to cruise at 60 mi/h km/h. It is likely to be geared for 2500 rpm or so at that speed, yet for maximum efficiency the engine should be running at about 1000 rpm to generate that power as efficiently as possible for that engine (although the actual figures will vary by engine and vehicle).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the two earlier engines, {{which could}} use either a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}, the 710 engine is offered only with turbocharging. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design {{that uses a}} gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor. This system acts as a centrifugal blower, during <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine.

But, unlike the earlier 645 and 567, which offered both Roots-blown and turbocharging, EMD's turbo-compressor {{is an integral part}} of all 710 models, therefore this 50 percent increase is already incorporated into the maximum rated power of all 710 models. The putative horsepower of an otherwise equivalent displacement, but Roots-blown (i.e., [...] "supercharged") 710, may be approximated by multiplying the turbocharged horsepower by 0.67.|$|E

Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED 9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU.

40|$|Partially {{premixed}} combustion has {{the potential}} of high efficiency and simultaneous low soot and NOx emissions. Running the engine in partially premixed combustion mode with high octane number fuels has the advantage of a longer premix period of fuel and air which reduces soot emissions, even at higher loads. The problem is the ignitability at low load and idle operating conditions. The objective is to investigate different multiple-injection strategies in order to further expand the low load limit and reduce the dependency on negative valve overlap in order to increase efficiency. The question is, what is the minimum attainable load for a given setting of negative valve overlap and fuel injection strategy. The experimental engine is a light duty diesel engine equipped with a fully flexible valve train system. The engine is run without boost at engine speed 800 rpm. The fuel is 87 RON gasoline. A turbocharger is typically used to increase the boost pressure, but at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and load the available boost is expected to be limited. The in-cylinder pressure and temperature around top-dead-center will then be too low to ignite high octane number fuels. A negative valve overlap can be used to extend the <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and load operating region. But {{one of the problems with}} negative valve overlap is the decrease in gas-exchange efficiency due to heat-losses from recompression of the residual gases. Also, the potential temperature increase from the trapped hot residual gases is limited at low load due to the low exhaust gas temperature. In order to expand the low load operating region further, more advanced injection strategies are investigated...|$|E
