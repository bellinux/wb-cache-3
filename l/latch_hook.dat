5000|$|Ewing was a {{self-described}} [...] "latch hook maven." [...] She used collage, printmaking, <b>latch</b> <b>hook,</b> {{and other media}} to create her pieces. Her work explores issues of race, gender, sexuality, beauty, and identity. Her <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> tapestries utilize traditionally erotic poses and powerful gazes to refute common stereotypes of Black women in media. Ewing's feminism {{played a major role}} in her art. Her art uses feminist form and content to [...] "subvert stereotypical images of women." [...] Mainstream media often shows Black women in a negative light by sexualizing and objectifying their bodies. It was Ewing's goal to transform those portrayals into positive ones. Her art depicts Black women as [...] "self-assured" [...] and confident.|$|E

50|$|Traditional rug hooking is a {{craft in}} which rugs {{are made by}} pulling loops of yarn or fabric through a stiff woven base such as burlap, linen, rug warp or monks cloth. The loops are pulled through the backing {{material}} by using a <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> mounted in a handle (usually wood) for leverage.|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} Low Impact Docking System (iLIDS) {{provides a}} structural arrangement {{that allows for}} visiting vehicles to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) (Fig 1). The iLIDS docking units are mechanically joined together {{by a series of}} active and passive <b>latch</b> <b>hooks.</b> In order to preserve docking capability at the existing Russian docking interfaces, the iLIDS <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> are required to conform to the existing Russian design. The <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> are classified as being fail-safe. Since the <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> are fail-safe, the hooks are not fracture critical and a fatigue based service life assessment will satisfy the structural integrity requirements. Constant amplitude fatigue testing to failure on four sets of active/passive iLIDS <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> was performed at load magnitudes of 10, 11, and 12 kips. Failure analysis of the hook fatigue failures identified multi-site fatigue initiation that was effectively centered about the hook mid-plane (consistent with the 3 D model results). The fatigue crack initiation distribution implies that the fatigue damage accumulation effectively results in a very low aspect ratio surface crack (which can be simulated as thru-thickness crack). Fatigue damage progression resulted in numerous close proximity fatigue crack initiation sites. It was not possible to determine if fatigue crack coalescence occurs during cyclic loading or as result of the fast fracture response. The presence of multiple fatigue crack initiation sites on different planes will result in the formation of ratchet marks as the cracks coalesce. Once the stable fatigue crack becomes unstable and the fast fracture advances across the remaining ligament and the plane stress condition at a free-surface will result in failure along a 45 deg. shear plane (slant fracture) and the resulting inclined edge is called a shear lip. The hook thickness on the plane of fatigue crack initiation is 0. 787 ". The distance between the shear lips on this plane was on the order of 0. 48 " and it was effectively centered about the mid-plane of the section. The numerous ratchet marks between the shear lips on the fracture initiation plane are indicative of multiple fatigue initiation sites within this region. The distribution of the fatigue damage about the centerline of the hook is consistent with the analytical results that demonstrate peak stress/strain response at the mid-plane that decreases {{in the direction of the}} hook outer surfaces. Scanning electron microscope images of the failed sections detected fatigue crack striations in close proximity to the free surface of the hook radius. These findings were documented at three locations on the fracture surface : 1) adjacent to the left shear lip, 2) adjacent to the right shear lip, and 3) near the centerline of the section. The features of the titanium fracture surface did not allow for a determination of a critical crack size via identification of the region where the fatigue crack propagation became unstable. The fracture based service life projections where benchmarked with strain-life analyses. The strainrange response in the hook radius was defined via the correlated finite element models and the modified method of universal slopes was incorporated to define the strain-life equation for the titanium alloy. The strain-life assessment confirmed that the fracture based projections were reasonable for the loading range of interest. Based upon the analysis and component level fatigue test data a preliminary service life capability for the iLIDS active and passive hooks of 2 lifetimes is projected (includes a scatter factor of 4) ...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1930s, latch-hooked wool rugs {{became popular}} and written {{guidelines}} helped standardise the craft. The heyday of latch-hooking with yarn in Britain {{was just after}} the second World War and dominated by several companies based near the textile mills {{in the north of}} England. <b>Latch</b> <b>hooking</b> was one of the activities available to convalescing soldiers, hospital patients and care home residents. Women's Institutes got discounts on bulk-buys and made rugs for sale. In the 1970s and 1980s, synthetic yarns and wool/synthetic blends became popular, but rug-making was entering a decline due to the availability of cheap imported rugs and to decreasing leisure time. In Britain, the best-known latch-hook company was Readicut (their rug kits were marketed through Shillcraft in North America). Patons and Baldwin invented the rotary [...] "Patwin" [...] wool cutter, but Readicut went a stage further and sold their yarn in pre-cut bundles.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> tool traces {{its origin}} to the {{invention}} of the latch needle. Invented in 1847, the latch needle was part of a knitting machine that wrapped yarn around the latch and pushed through a canvas before pulling it through and knotting the yarn to the canvas. In the 1920s, the tool was created by combining the hand hook with the latch.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> is {{both the}} tool and the textile art of latch hooking. Latch hooking differs from {{traditional}} rug hooking and locker hooking by the physical knotting of the yarn to canvas. <b>Latch</b> <b>hook</b> was invented {{in the nineteenth century}} with the latch needle, in the twentieth century the latch needle underwent numerous variations including the hand tool used by artisans and crafters to produce <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> rugs. While rug hooking uses a base fabric of burlap or hessian, latch hooking uses specially woven rug canvas. Rug canvases range from 3.3 holes per inch (hpi) to 5 hpi. The pattern may be stencilled onto the canvas or worked from a chart similar to a needlepoint pattern. <b>Latch</b> <b>hook</b> yarns may be bough pre-cut (usually 2.5 inch lengths) or in skeins and cut to the desired length.In his book [...] "The Hooked Rug," [...] published in 1930, American writer William Winthrop Kent describes a form of rugmaking [...] "A canvas is used like cross-stitch canvas only coarser, which has every third mesh a large one. It is held on the knee or on a table. The pieces of wool yarn are cut exactly the same length by a gauge. The hook used has a catch or latch on it and is inserted in one hole and out the next in the next row, as follows: The wool is held in the left hand and above the canvas, then doubled and the double end is slipped over the hook, the catch being up or open. The hook is then drawn out through the canvas toward the worker, the cut ends being kept in the left hand. The catch by this action drops down and secures the wool. The tool is next pushed forward through the wool loop and catches the two ends held in the left hand, then the loop is held in the left hand and has the two ends pulled through it with the hook. To pull out hook and draw tight the two cut ends finishes the knot. This is really a pile fabric and is known as a Turkey Rug but sprang from the hooking process as the earlier hook used was of the crochet hook form." ...|$|E

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the locking pins, making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R
40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller.

50|$|While crochet braids are {{a hybrid}} of {{traditional}} braids, they're considered to be more similar to weaves. The natural hair can be twisted or braided, but is most commonly styled into cornrows before affixing the synthetic hair. Using a <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> or crochet hook, the synthetic hair (in the form of loose bulk) is then attached.

Uxbridge, an early mill town, had industries, gristmills, sawmills, forges, distilleries, and more than 20 local textile mills. In 1855, 560 local workers made 2.5 million yards of cloth. Entrepreneurs here innovated the first power looms for woolens, satinet, wool-nylon serge, and other wool synthetic blends, 'wash and wear' fabrics, and <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> yarn kits. Local factories further refined manufacturing processes and efficiencies which kept textiles alive and thriving, well beyond the great depression period.|$|E

40|$|Ply-split {{braiding}} is a textile-making {{technique that}} involves separating the plies of one cord with a <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> or similar tool, catching a second cord and pulling {{it through the}} gap between the plies of the first. The technique has been most fully developed by the men of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, who use ply-split braiding, generally of 4 -ply cords of goat hair or cotton, to make girths and other paraphernalia for their camels (Harvey 1976; Quick and Stein 1982). Peter Collingwood (1998) provided the fullest description of traditional textiles made by ply-split braiding and of the techniques used to make them. In the decade following the publication of his book, fiber artists in several countries – including Collingwood himself – explored the use of ply-split braiding for novel creations, many of which were three-dimensional, in contrast with the one- and two-dimensional straps and braids more typical of traditional work in Rajasthan. Ply-split braiding has been usefully divided into three structural types, depending on the sequence and placement of cord splittings. In plain oblique twining (POT) each cord alternately splits and is split by cords that it meets along its path. In single-course oblique twining (SCOT) a cord may split or be split by several cords consecutively. In both POT and SCOT a cord typically has plie...|$|E

50|$|Seed {{dispersal}} {{is often}} done by passing animals; the grains' <b>hooks</b> <b>latch</b> on to fur or hair, or to clothes. Others are wind or gravity dispersed. Several herbivores feed on lovegrass, including invertebrates {{such as the}} caterpillars of the Zabulon skipper (Poanes zabulon) and vertebrates. The extinct bluebuck (Hippotragus leucophaeus) was known to graze these grasses. The dense bunches also provide cover for small animals such as the rare Botteri's sparrow (Aimophila botterii). Lovegrasses may be important groundcover on oceanic islands like Laysan, where other plants are rare.|$|R
5000|$|The {{control bar}} {{is a solid}} metal or {{composite}} bar which attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this bar and controls the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a chicken loop from the control bar {{is attached to a}} <b>latch</b> or <b>hook</b> on a spreader bar on the rider's harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite's angle of attack. While kite control bars are made intentionally light, they must also be very strong, and so are usually heavier than water; [...] "bar floats" [...] made of foam are generally fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water.
