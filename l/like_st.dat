5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. <b>Like</b> <b>St.</b> Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the Lady Chapel are at {{the east}} end of the outer north and south aisles respectively, and contain 20 of the 28 stone heads carved by Thomas Earp of Lambeth in 1878–1880, mostly {{depicting}} biblical characters such as Salome and John the Baptist, or historical figures <b>like</b> <b>St</b> Helen and Martin Luther. Ten are paired {{on opposite sides of the}} five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle, and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels. The corbels of the north, west and south doors bear six more heads, those by the west door depicting Queen Victoria and Archbishop Tait; and Jesus and Moses are higher on the corbels of the west window. The clerestory and the wooden roofs of the nave and south inner aisle are 15th century, but the rest of the lead-clad roofing dates from the Victorian rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2014, {{the network}} was {{approved}} by New York City's Franchise and Concession Review Committee. Installation of two stations on Third Avenue—at 15th and 17th Streets—began on December 28, 2015, followed by other Links on Third Avenue below 58th Street, {{as well as on}} Eighth Avenue. After some delays, the first Links went online in January 2016. The public network was announced in February 2016. Locations <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> George, Jamaica, South Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue were prioritized for LinkNYC kiosk installations, with these places receiving Links by the end of 2016. By mid-July 2016, the planned roll-out of 500 hubs throughout New York City was to occur, though the actual installation proceeded at a slower rate. , there were 400 hubs in three boroughs (most of which were in Manhattan along lower Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Eighth Avenue, upper Amsterdam Avenue, Lafayette Street, parts of Broadway, and the Bowery; at least 25 along Grand Concourse and in Fordham in the Bronx; and some along Queens Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in Queens). In November 2016, the first two Links were installed in Brooklyn, along Fulton Street in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, with plans to install nine more Links in various places around Brooklyn before year's end, especially around Prospect Park and LIU Brooklyn. Around this time, Staten Island also received its first Links, which were installed in New Dorp. The Links were being installed at an average pace of ten per day throughout the boroughs with a projected goal of 500 hubs by the end of 2016. , there were 920 Links installed across the city.|$|E

25|$|Alongside inhumation, it {{was common}} for early Anglo-Saxons to cremate their dead by burning the corpses and then burying the cremated remains within an urn. Cremation rites {{declined}} in the seventh century, but throughout that century remained a viable form of burial at sites <b>like</b> <b>St</b> Mary's Stadium in Southampton.|$|E
25|$|As {{with early}} Christianity in the Roman Empire, {{it is assumed}} that the initial {{converts}} were largely Jewish proselytes among the Cochin Jews who are believed to have arrived in India around 562 BC, after the destruction of the First Temple. Many of these Jews presumably spoke Aramaic <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Thomas, also a Jew by birth, who is credited by tradition with evangelising India.|$|E

25|$|Spanish colonies {{began to}} form {{as early as}} 1565 in places <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Augustine, Florida, and later in Santa Fe, New Mexico; San Antonio, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. English colonies like Jamestown began to form as early as 1607. The {{connection}} between the American colonies and Europe, with shipping as its only conduit, would continue to grow unhindered for almost two hundred years.|$|E
25|$|St. Michael's {{is located}} {{at the top of the}} High Street and <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Peter's in nearby Southease it has a round tower (with a {{shingled}} spire). Its length runs along the street rather than away from it and the cemetery is separated from the High Street by stone walls with iron railings on top. Next to it is a building which is used upstairs as a Sunday School.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{dedicated}} enthusiast of automobile travel, Fisher {{was aware that}} wealthy vacationers in those days often preferred to cross the long distances to southeastern Florida by railroad, a tradition begun by some families years earlier with Henry M. Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) and the resorts he established at places <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Augustine and Palm Beach, and eventually Miami, the southern terminus of the FEC, where he built the famous Royal Palm Hotel.|$|E
60|$|It was his mother's name, {{and this}} little {{creature}} had more resemblance to his tenderly-cherished vision {{of his young}} mother than any description Dixon could have given.

50|$|Tolkien's fantasy {{writings}} contain several named weapons <b>like</b> <b>Sting,</b> Glamdring, Narsil, Orcrist, and Gurthang.

25|$|St. Aurelian {{follows the}} same {{tradition}} in his Rule Ad virgines, but he imposes twelve psalms at each {{hour on the}} monks. St. Columbanus, St. Fructuosus, and St. Isidore adopt the system of three psalms. <b>Like</b> <b>St.</b> Benedict, most of these authors include hymns, the capitulum or short lesson, a versicle, and an oratio. In the 9th and 10th centuries we find some additions made to the Office of Nones, in particular litanies, collects, etc.|$|E
25|$|By 1983 matters {{had been}} resolved, {{one way or}} another. Eventually, the Anglican diocese decided to help by {{building}} new boarding facilities at Daramombe, a mission school that, <b>like</b> <b>St</b> Philip's, had been closed down during the war. The St Philip's boys could thus be moved en masse and the Anglican diocese expressed their thanks to the Springvale board for permitting St Philip's to stay at Springvale until the Daramombe facilities were ready {{in the course of}} 1983.|$|E
25|$|It's <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E

50|$|It {{is known}} that Amanda Austin was buried in August 1928 in St. Thomas, Ontario, but unclear whether she {{or any of the}} rest of the family had been living in the town at the time.

6000|$|... 'It {{seems that}} it was on St. Barnabas Day that, after Holy Communion, we walked up here last year and chose {{the site of the}} house. The people have of their own accord taken to call the place St. Barnabas; and as this suits the Eton feeling also, and you and others never <b>liked</b> <b>St.</b> Andrew's, don't you think we may adopt the new name?

25|$|In 2003, Metalheadz signees Dylan and Robyn Chaos (aka Faith In Chaos) {{pushed the}} harder sound of drum and bass by {{founding}} the Freak Recordings label and sublabels Obscene and Tech Freak, together with artists like Technical Itch, Limewax, Counterstrike, SPL, Current Value, and many others, {{leading to the}} creation of the Therapy Sessions drum and bass festivals in London. The Therapy Sessions franchise quickly expanded worldwide with greater repercussion on Eastern Europe with an attendance of more than 10.000 fans in cities <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Petesburg.|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} outline of these {{buildings}}, with steeply pitched roofs, lower chancels and small bellcotes are easily recognisable, the form varies from tiny buildings <b>like</b> <b>St</b> Mark's Greendale, (1848) to the somewhat larger cruciform St Michael's, Wollongong, (1858). Even {{at a church}} as remote as St Mark's, which was surrounded by fields and forest, and had neither village nor full-time priest, {{the details of the}} design commanded Blacket's care, the little building having an elegant gable over its fluted doorway, and floral bosses, long since destroyed, at the ends of its drip moulding.|$|E
25|$|The major {{indigenous}} form {{of music}} is the scratch band (also called Fungi band in the British Virgin Islands), which use improvised instruments like gourds and washboards to make a kind of music called Quelbe. A Virgin Island folk song called cariso is also popular, as well as St. Thomas' bamboula. The quadrille is the traditional folk dance of the islands, and include varieties <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Croix's Imperial Quadrille and St. Thomas' Flat German Quadrille. The Heritage Dancers are a respected dance troupe that perform traditional folk dances from the Virgin Islands and beyond.|$|E

50|$|Despite his {{contract}} being under WCW, Jeff Jarrett {{was fired by}} Vince McMahon upon his acquisition of WCW, having no interest in Jarrett. After WCW closed its doors, Jarrett alongside his father Jerry Jarrett would later find success as wrestling promoters after opening their own promotion, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. The promotion would bring {{a new generation of}} wrestlers that would later find their success in WWE while also gaining the attention of past WCW wrestlers <b>like</b> <b>Sting</b> and Scott Steiner.|$|R
25|$|Ancient {{circular}} or polygonal {{churches are}} comparatively rare. A small number, {{such as the}} Temple Church, London were built during the Crusades in imitation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as isolated examples in England, France and Spain. In Denmark such churches in the Romanesque style are much more numerous. In parts of Eastern Europe there are also round tower-like churches of the Romanesque period but they are generally vernacular architecture and of small scale. Others, <b>like</b> <b>St</b> Martin's Rotunda at Vishegrad, in the Czech Republic, are finely detailed.|$|E
25|$|The lantern {{at the top}} of the Medici Chapel is {{made out}} of marble and has an “….unusual {{polyhedron}} mounted on the peak of the conical roof,”. The orb that is on top of the lantern has seventy-two facets and is about two feet in diameter. The orb and cross, that is on top of the orb, are traditional symbols of the Roman and Christian power, and recalls the similar orbs on central dome plan churches <b>like</b> <b>St.</b> Maria del Fiore and St. Peter’s. But because it is on a private mausoleum, the Medici family is promoting their own personal power with the orb and cross, laurel wreath and lion heads, which are all symbols of status and power.|$|E
25|$|When Henry {{tried to}} divorce Queen Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter. As such, he {{appeared}} on the Queen's behalf in the legates' court, where he startled the audience by the directness of his language and by declaring that, <b>like</b> <b>St</b> John the Baptist, {{he was ready to}} die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by it that he composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared the royal anger. The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher's personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave him for what he had done.|$|E
