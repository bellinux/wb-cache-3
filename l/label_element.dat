40|$|Labeling as a {{marketing}} tool of food products: limits and opportunities related with the propensity of consumers towards food labels - Food labels {{are a source of}} information and most often the first means for directly connecting with a consumer but its potential is not always well exploited. Labels may be an instrument for establishing product differentiation, differentiation across food categories and within a specific category. The objectives for this study are to quantify the extent of consumer awareness, knowledge and behaviour in relation to food labelling, in order to analyse if labelling is a valid tool of direct shopping aid and what are the limits of labelling effects. To collect data a questionnaire was administered to a sample of 400 consumers living in Campania.

30|$|Most {{cosmetic}} products contain fragrances, {{many of which}} are sensitizers [11 – 14]. It seems to be rather difficult to produce scented personal care products with fragrances that are not labelled. I found that out of 111 fragrances frequently applied in cosmetics and washing and cleansing products 106 were classified in the C&L Inventory. Most of them are skin sensitizers or eye irritants. Also natural substances can be sensitizers and irritants, e.g. essential oils. Some products consist of a large fraction of fragrances, for example aftershave lotion contains 10 % fragrances. Normally, mixtures which are not classified as sensitizing but contain at least one sensitizing substance in a concentration equal or greater than 0.1 % must bear the supplemental label EUH 208 ‘Contains (name of sensitizing substance) … May produce an allergic reaction.’ ([1] Annex II Part 2 2.8) Table 1 (C). This supplemental <b>label</b> <b>element</b> would be relevant for most {{cosmetic products}}, but it is again not applied to them because they are excluded from the CLP Regulation in general.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{effects of}} {{reduction}} and reoxidation of octahedral Fe 3 + on {{the exchange of}} structural hydrogen in nontronite were determined using tritium (all) as a <b>label</b> <b>element.</b> The uptake of H from the surrounding solution of nontronite suspensions increased as the reduction of structural Fe 3 + increased. Similarly, the loss of H from the structure increased as the reduction i creased. The results are generally consistent with a reduction mechanism involving the loss of structural OH, leaving the affected Fe sites with less than six-fold coordination. The attenuation of increased negative charge on the clay layer, however, was less than predicted by such a mechanism. During the reoxidation of reduced nontronite in suspension, {{about one-third of the}} H remaining as part of the structure following reduction was lost, whereas twice that amount of H was incorporated into the structure from the surrounding solution. A reoxidation mechanism is proposed whereby H 20 from the surrounding solution is incorporated into the mineral structure followed by the elimination of a hydrogen ion, returning the Fe to six-fold coordination. This mechanism i plies the reversibility of Fe reduction i nontronite...|$|E
40|$|Polymers with an ordered {{molecular}} structure {{can be applied}} in optical systems for e. g. data transport, data storage and displays. Patterned UV photo-polymerization is used to prepare polymer gratings from a mixture of two acrylate monomers. A 3 MeV proton microprobe is used to study these gratings, prepared from two different monomers, each containing a different easily detectable <b>label</b> <b>element,</b> e. g. Cl, Si or F. During the preparation process, the difference in reactivity and mobility of these two monomers in combination with polymer–monomer interaction results in diffusion of monomers. Since this diffusion process takes place on length scales of micrometers, a scanning ion microprobe is {{a powerful tool for}} the quantitative analysis of the polymer films, obtained after complete polymerization. The microprobe is equipped with PIXE, PIGE and RBS, to quantify both the label elements and C and O. This makes it possible to determine the concentration of monomer units as a function of position and thus to study the diffusion process. Two combinations of different monomers are studied. In the case of a 0. 5 : 1 mixture of a monofunctional and a difunctional monomer, both monomers migrate to the illuminated areas and large thickness variations are observed. When a 1 : 1 mixture of two difunctional monomers is used, opposite migration of the two monomers is observed, while the film shows no variation in thickness...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesChemical hazard {{communication}} {{is intended to}} alert users of the potential hazards of chemicals. Apart {{from the fact that}} hazard information should be understood, it is also important that it should be recalled. Recall of {{hazard communication}} is critical when the written form of the information is not available at the time it is required. A cross-sectional study investigating predictors of the recall of chemical safety information on labels and safety data sheets amongst 315 workers (industry, transport and agriculture sectors) and 87 consumers in two provinces of South Africa was conducted. The recall of participants was tested using two modules (module 2 which relates to the demographics, and module 3 which relates to the recall of the participants) from the Hazard Communication Comprehensibility Testing (CT) Tool developed by the Centre for Environmental and Occupational Health at the University of Cape Town. Respondents were predominantly male (67. 7 %), the median age was 37 years (IQR: 30 - 46 years) and {{less than half of the}} participants completed high school (47. 5 %). The majority of participants were blue collar workers outside of industry (55. 5 %). The skull and crossbones symbol was the <b>label</b> <b>element</b> most recalled, both unprompted (79. 6 %) and prompted (94. 8 %), and the first aid and treatment measures the least frequently recalled (6. 0 %- 29. 9 %). Multivariate analysis showed the predictors that were found to increase the recall of all the label elements were, industrial sector, transport sector, agriculture sector, gender, home language English and Afrikaans, reading English and Afrikaans, completing high school and non-industry white collar occupations. The predictors that were found to decrease recall were further education, not wearing glasses and non-industry blue collar occupations. This study found demographic factors to influence the recall of hazard information. Policy should ensure the implementation of procedures that promote the recall of hazard information to protect workers from hazardous exposures...|$|E

40|$|A digital {{equivalent}} dat{{a system}} (DEDS) {{is a system}} for identifying objects {{by means of the}} x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra of <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> that are encased in or deposited on the objects. As such, a DEDS is a revolutionary new major subsystem of an XRF system. A DEDS embodies the means for converting the spectral data output of an XRF scanner to an ASCII alphanumeric or barcode label {{that can be used to}} identify (or verify the assumed or apparent identity of) an XRF-scanned object. A typical XRF spectrum of interest contains peaks at photon energies associated with specific elements on the Periodic Table (see figure). The height of each spectral peak above the local background spectral intensity is proportional to the relative abundance of the corresponding element. Alphanumeric values are assigned to the relative abundances of the elements. Hence, if an object contained <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> in suitably chosen proportions, an alphanumeric representation of the object could be extracted from its XRF spectrum. The mixture of <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> and for reading the XRF spectrum would be compatible with one of the labeling conventions now used for bar codes and binary matrix patterns (essentially, two-dimensional bar codes that resemble checkerboards). A further benefit of such compatibility is that it would enable the conversion of the XRF spectral output to a bar or matrix-coded label, if needed. In short, a process previously used only for material composition analysis has been reapplied to the world of identification. This new level of verification is now being used for "authentication. ...|$|R
40|$|Systems for {{identifying}} objects {{by means of}} x-ray fluorescence (XRF) of encased <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> have been developed. The XRF spectra of objects so labeled would be analogous to the external bar code labels now used to track objects in everyday commerce. In conjunction with computer-based tracking systems, databases, and labeling conventions, the XRF labels {{could be used in}} essentially the same manner as that of bar codes to track inventories and to record and process commercial transactions. In addition, as summarized briefly below, embedded XRF labels could be used to verify the authenticity of products, thereby helping to deter counterfeiting and fraud. A system, as described above, is called an encased core product identification and authentication system (ECPIAS). The ECPIAS concept is a modified version of that of a related recently initiated commercial development of handheld XRF spectral scanners that would identify alloys or detect <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> deposited on the surfaces of objects. In contrast, an ECPIAS would utilize <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> encased within the objects of interest. The basic ECPIAS concept is best illustrated by means of an example of one of several potential applications: labeling of cultured pearls by labeling the seed particles implanted in oysters to grow the pearls. Each pearl farmer would be assigned a unique mixture of <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> that could be distinguished from the corresponding mixtures of other farmers. The mixture would be either incorporated into or applied to the surfaces of the seed prior to implantation in the oyster. If necessary, the labeled seed would be further coated to make it nontoxic to the oyster. After implantation, the growth of layers of mother of pearl on the seed would encase the XRF labels, making these labels integral, permanent parts of the pearls that could not be removed without destroying the pearls themselves. The XRF labels would be read by use of XRF scanners, the spectral data outputs of which would be converted to alphanumeric data in a digital equivalent data system (DEDS), which is the subject of the previous article. These alphanumeric data would be used to track the pearls through all stages of commerce, from the farmer to the retail customer...|$|R

In this paper, we dedicated to find out such relationship. We proposed a SentiPairSequence basedspatiotemporal visual sentiment ontology, which forms the midlevel representations for GIFsentiment. The establishment process of SentiPair contains two steps.

40|$|Purpose – The present paper {{focuses on}} the level of {{attention}} and comprehension that Greek schoolchildren have of food labels. Three different age groups (8 th, 10 th and 12 th years of age) are examined. A large dataset from various districts in the wider Athens region has been used. Design/methodology/approach – The British Food Standards Agency questionnaire used for the same purpose in the UK was adopted and adapted to the local circumstances. Findings – The sampled schoolchildren pay attention at certain food <b>labels</b> <b>elements</b> only, and they may do so only when they purchase a product for the first time. There is an associated lack of understanding, and medium to high levels of erroneous interpretation for some food label related information. No major differences are found to exist between age groups.
