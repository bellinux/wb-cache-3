40|$|Much of the {{research}} that concerns the impacts of management measures in the eastern Baltic cod fishery has focused on fish stock rather than understanding fishermen's attitudes towards regulations. Hence, there is little information available on fishermen's responses although {{they are the ones}} whom the regulations affect most profoundly. This study analyses the views of fishermen towards management measures with an emphasis on fishing closures (marine protected areas, MPAs). Swedish log-book data from 1996 to 2005 were used to describe MPA induced fishing effort displacements. Fishermen argued that MPAs have been inefficient in conservation of cod stock. The enlargement of Bornholm MPA in 2005 caused substantial effort displacement towards areas dominated by smaller sized fish. This contributed to the increased discarding of juvenile cod. Enlarged MPAs also intensified competition between different fleet segments and reallocated fishing areas. To reduce fishing mortality, fishermen suggested days-at-sea (effort) regulation and an effective <b>landings</b> <b>control</b> system for all fleets that exploit cod stocks in the Baltic Sea Main Basin. These measures would better motivate fishermen for mutual rule compliance, which is a prerequisite for a sustainable cod fishery.

The water landing experiments were made by simulating paraglider and parachute letdowns with two 1 / 6 - scale model configurations.

The paraglider landings at horizontal speeds of 63 feet per second (19. 8 m/sec) {{which resulted in a}} noseover or tumbling shortly after initial water contact. The maximum longitudinal acceleration of the model in calm water was about 14 g units, and the maximum angular acceleration was 66 radians per second squared. In the parachute landings with the heat shield forward, the model skidded along the water surface on the heat shield. Parachute landings with the small end forward resulted in behavior {{similar to that of the}} paraglider landings. The ground-surface landings were made with a 1 / 3 -scale model by simulating a parachute letdown with braking rockets, which were fired prior to touchdown to dissipate vertical velocity.

To test whether toad forelimb orientation varies with landing conditions, we used high-speed video to collect forelimb and body kinematic data from six animals hopping off platforms of different heights (0, 5 and 9  cm). We found that toads do align forelimbs with the impact angle. Further, toads align forelimbs with the instantaneous velocity vector well before landing and then track its changes until touchdown. This suggests that toads may be prepared to land well before they hit the ground rather than preparing for impact at a specific moment, and that they may use a motor control strategy that allows them to perform <b>controlled</b> <b>landings</b> without the need to predict impact time...|$|R

40|$|The highly {{seasonal}} Norwegian cod fisheries {{give rise to}} problems downstream in the value chain and the authorities have introduced several schemes to counter the strong incentives for seasonal harvesting. This paper studies how the trawler delivery obligation (TDO) regime influences aspects of the harvesting pattern, focusing on the temporal and geographic distribution of landings. The analysis shows that the trawlers as a group have far less seasonal variations in their cod landings compared to the coastal fleet. While the Norwegian fleet lands about 75 % during the first half-year, the corresponding share for trawlers is about 50 %. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the independent trawlers fished the most off-season; about 57 % of their total <b>landings.</b> Trawlers <b>controlled</b> by vertically integrated firms landed considerably less (about 45 %) and independently owned trawlers with landing obligations fell between these two strategic groups (about 50 %).

40|$|There are {{consequences}} of moving quickly in this world. Here we investigate how {{two very different}} species, mantis shrimp (Odontodactylus scyllarus) and cane toads (Bufo marinus), negotiate forces that result from moving rapidly in different environments. To study the mechanical principles and fluid dynamics of ultrafast power-amplified systems, we built Ninjabot, a physical model of the extremely fast mantis shrimp. While mantis shrimp produce damaging cavitation upon impact with their prey, they do not cavitate during the forward portion of their strike despite extreme speeds. In order to study cavitation onset in non-linear flows common during the mantis shrimp strike, we used Ninjabot to produce strikes of varying kinematics and measured cavitation presence or absence. We found that in rotating and accelerating biological conditions, cavitation inception is best explained only by maximum linear velocity. Thus, studies of cavitation onset in biological conditions only {{need to focus on}} maximum velocity. On land, moving quickly requires avoiding or preparing for impact with other objects, often the ground. Within anurans (frogs and toads), a group well known for jumping, cane toads are known to perform particularly <b>controlled</b> <b>landings</b> in which the forelimbs are used to decelerate and balance the body after impact as the hind limbs are lowered to the ground. Here I explore whether and how toads modulate landing preparation depending on hopping and landing conditions and what this can tell us about how they utilize sensory information to help them perform <b>controlled</b> <b>landings.</b> We found that toads modulate three components of impact preparation to specific hop conditions: 1) They position the forelimbs to hit the ground first by protracting and abducting the humeri, 2) They prepare and brace for impact by extending the elbows and activating underlying musculature to stiffen the joint and 3) they control torques during the landing by retracting the hind limbs and rotating the forelimbs to align with the impact angle. By perturbing landing conditions we found that toads tune these components to specific landing conditions with a combination of passive and active control and toads do so by primarily relying on non-visual sensory feedback...|$|R

50|$|The Torva 15 was {{designed}} as a reasonably priced single seater glider, with reasonable performance, suitable for club and competition flying. Two versions were designed; one with flaps, retractable main-wheel and provision for water ballast named Sport, and one with fixed undercarriage covered by a fairing, called Sprite. Construction of the Torva 15 gliders was of glassfibre with foam filling and plywood frames ribs and re-inforcement. The specially modified Wortmann aerofoil section endowed the Torva 15's with good climb performance in typical British weak thermals and reduced the stalling speed to allow easy field landings. The smooth lines of the fuselage were unbroken by the one-piece canopy, which hinged to the side to allow easy access to the comfortable cockpit, with the tail section, integral with the rear fuselage, supporting a cruciform style tail assembly. Large airbrakes in the wings allowed for accurate <b>landings</b> and approach <b>control</b> as well as limiting the maximum speed attainable.

The insect metaphor also reflected the ship's position in relation to the Alliance, the all-powerful government in the series. The main method of propulsion was developed from the idea of using a fusion explosion behind the ship to propel it at greater speeds than normal. This justified causing the ship's tail to glow like a firefly before the explosion caused the ship to rocket away. For secondary propulsion, to allow such a large object to fly gracefully in atmosphere and perform <b>controlled</b> <b>landings,</b> the group added two engines, each on a stubby wing. The engines rotate, giving Serenity VTOL capability, and would fold down and in like a bird's wings when the ship was inactive.

40|$|An {{important}} function of skeletal muscle is deceleration via active muscle fascicle lengthening, which dissipates movement energy. The mechanical interplay between muscle contraction and tendon elasticity is critical when muscles produce energy. However, {{the role of}} tendon elasticity during muscular energy dissipation remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that tendon elasticity functions as a mechanical buffer, preventing high (and probably damaging) velocities and powers during active muscle fascicle lengthening. We directly measured lateral gastrocnemius muscle force and length in wild turkeys during <b>controlled</b> <b>landings</b> requiring rapid energy dissipation. Muscle-tendon unit (MTU) strain was measured via video kinematics, independent of muscle fascicle strain (measured via sonomicrometry). We found that rapid MTU lengthening immediately following impact involved little or no muscle fascicle lengthening. Therefore, joint flexion had to be accommodated by tendon stretch. After the early contact period, muscle fascicles lengthened and absorbed energy. This late lengthening occurred after most of the joint flexion, and was thus mainly driven by tendon recoil. Temporary tendon energy storage led to {{a significant reduction in}} muscle fascicle lengthening velocity and the rate of energy absorption. We conclude that tendons function as power attenuators that probably protect muscles against damage from rapid and forceful lengthening during energy dissipation...|$|R
