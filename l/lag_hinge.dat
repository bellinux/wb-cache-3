40|$|AbstractThree rigid-body motion DOFs are {{introduced}} for {{the motion of}} the flap, <b>lag</b> <b>hinge</b> and pitch bearing. The rotor blade is discretized using a five-nodes, 15 DOFs beam finite element. The dynamic coupling effect between the rigid motion of the blade and the nonlinear elastic deflections is taken into account. Utilizing the constitutive law of the curvilinear coordinate system, the typical moderate deflection beam theory is reformulated. In addition, the Leishman and Beddoes unsteady and dynamic stall model is incorporated and the inflow is evaluated with the free wake analysis. The derived nonlinear ordinary differential equations with time-dependent coefficients of the rotor blade are given {{in the sense of the}} generalized forces. The sectional loads of the blade and the equations of motion are solved simultaneously in the physical space. The blade vibratory loads predicted by present analysis show generally fair agreement with the flight test data of the SA 349 / 2 Gazelle helicopter...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a helicopter dynamic model that captures the fuselage vibrations for an accelerated main rotor. Some rotor parameters are modified {{with the purpose}} of study their impact on the rotorcraft. Being this, a tool that allows to predict vibrations on the helicopter. The rotorcraft model has been built up by using VehicleSim, software specialized in modelling mechanical systems composed by rigid bodies. The rotors are articulated, the main rotor takes into account flap, lag and feather degrees of freedom for each of the equispaced blades and their dynamic couplings. The dynamic performance and the control action are embedded in a single code, thereby VehicleSim does not require external connection to other software package. This generates some advantages such as to reduce the compilation time. The control methodology makes use of PID controllers (Proportional, Integral, Derivative), which allows to use VehicleSim commands exclusively. The state space matrices have been obtained in order to analysis the uncoupled main rotor flap and lag modes. The detection of vibrations from the offset flap hinge as well as the <b>lag</b> <b>hinge</b> are not straightforward tasks and this helicopter model provides an accurate tool to study these. A short time Fourier transform processing is used to analysis the vibrations and these have shown to agree with the expected behaviour...|$|E
50|$|An {{articulated}} rotorhead {{system is}} one where the individual blades are free to flap, lag and change pitch. This is done by mounting the blades on flapping and <b>lagging</b> <b>hinges</b> and pitch change bearings.|$|R
50|$|A rigid rotorhead has no {{flapping}} or <b>lag</b> <b>hinges</b> {{but does}} have pitch change bearings. The flapping and lagging movement is accommodated by flexible sections (commonly elastomeric bearings) at the blade root or blade attachment. When using composite blades, the blades can also flex {{to provide a}} flapping motion.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} with a 1. 62 m diameter hingeless rotor in a wind tunnel to investigate flap-lag stability of isolated rotors in forward flight. The three-bladed rotor model closely approaches the simple theoretical concept of a hingeless rotor {{as a set of}} rigid, articulated flap-lag blades with offset and spring restrained flap and <b>lag</b> <b>hinges.</b> <b>Lag</b> regressing mode stability data was obtained for advance ratios as high as 0. 55 for various combinations of collective pitch and shaft angle. The prediction includes quasi-steady stall effects on rotor trim and Floquet stability analyses. Correlation between data and prediction is presented and is compared with that of an earlier study based on a linear theory without stall effects. While the results with stall effects show marked differences from the linear theory results, the stall theory still falls short of adequate agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} articulated {{rotor blade}} has mechanical flap and <b>lag</b> <b>hinges,</b> a <b>lag</b> damper, and a pitch bearing. In connection {{with an interest}} in designs of greater mechanical simplicity and increased maintainability, hingeless and bearingless rotors have been developed. A hingeless blade lacks the hinges and is cantilevered at the hub. It does have a pitch bearing for pitch control. A bearingless design eliminates the hinges and the pitch bearing as well. In the present investigation of bearingless rotor blade characteristics, finite element analysis has been successfully applied to determine the solutions of the nonlinear trim equations and the linearized flutter equations of multiple-load-path blades. The employed formulation is based on Hamilton's principle. The spatial dependence of the equations of motion is discretized by dividing the flexbeams, the torque tube, and the outboard into a number of elements...|$|R
