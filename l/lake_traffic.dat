By 1886 he and his brother William had established the irrigation colonies of Etiwanda, Ontario, and Upland, which were extremely successful, {{thanks in large part to}} innovative features such as hydroelectric systems using mountain water, mutual water companies which eliminated disputes over water, and a college endowed by the Chaffeys. His innovative electrical system at Etiwanda led Los Angeles to hire him to install its first street lights. He eventually became president and engineer of the Los Angeles Electric Company.|$|R

Brothers Charles and Ernest Tiedtke, who grew up farming in what is today Toledo's east side, opened a grocery store at Summit and Monroe {{downtown}} (near present-day Fifth Third Field). With Toledo an important lake port, their primary business was <b>lake</b> <b>traffic,</b> delivering groceries and supplies to the freighters that would pass through on the Maumee River. Soon, business was brisk enough for them to expand and carry dry goods, as well as require a fleet of horse-and-buggies to handle the demand.|$|E
50|$|The Ile Parisienne Light Station was {{established}} {{on the southern}} tip of the Ile Parisienne in 1911 after construction of the Soo Locks increased upper Great Lakes shipping traffic and the need for navigational aids. The white tower is a well-known landmark to <b>lake</b> <b>traffic</b> and pleasure craft. The tower's cast-in place concrete, hexagonal structure was built with 6 tapered exterior wall buttresses, flared ribs at the platform, a gable roofed entrance, small windows, and a prominent, 10-sided, red lantern topped with a beaver weathervane. It is considered a good example of early modern, functional design.|$|E
50|$|The lake has rocky shores and is {{relatively}} calm {{throughout most of}} the summer.

5000|$|The {{original}} Porter locomotives {{reached the}} end of their lives in 1948, and were sold to a collector, Cameron Peck of Chicago, and finally came to rest at the Harold Warp Pioneer Village in Minden, Nebraska. They were replaced by two much larger engines, one coal and one oil-fired, originally built by Montreal Locomotive Works in 1926. The [...] oil-fired engine proved to be too heavy and was put into storage. The coal-fired Engine 1 gave the train its new name, Portage Flier.

50|$|The village {{economy was}} based on agriculture, mostly grain and vineyards. Then, in the 18th and 19th Century, the silk {{industry}} entered the village. Thanks to the views over Lake Lugano, Paradiso became a popular holiday resort after {{the opening of the}} Gotthard Railway in 1882. The funicular railway up Monte San Salvatore opened in 1890. The funicular and increasing <b>lake</b> <b>traffic</b> contributed to the further development of the hotel and tourism industry in Paradiso. At the same time, the population grew. The construction of the highway along the municipal border with Lugano in 1966 began to change the character of the municipality. At the beginning of the 21st Century, tourism began to decline and Paradiso began to develop into a residential community with many luxury buildings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} a {{lighthouse}} between Passage Island and Isle Royale was recognized {{as early as the}} 1860s, as <b>lake</b> <b>traffic</b> increased dramatically due to the upsurge in mining in the Upper Peninsula. [...] However, it took until 1875 before Congress authorized funds {{for the construction of a}} lighthouse. [...] However, because of Congress's desire to bring political pressure to bear on the Canadian government to force them to build a lighthouse in Lake Erie, the appropriated $18,000 for Pasage Light was not released until 1880. [...] Construction began in 1881, and the light was completed the following year. [...] A fog signal was added in 1884, and in 1894 a new flashing white lens manufactured by Barbier, Benard & Turenne of Paris was installed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{its primary}} purpose is as a water supply reservoir, Richland-Chambers Reservoir is {{a venue for}} outdoor recreation, {{including}} fishing, boating, and swimming.

QNSX also hauls Wabush <b>Lake</b> Railway <b>traffic</b> from the interchange at Wabush to Arnaud Jct., Quebec, near Sept-Îles, where it interchanges to the Arnaud Railway, which then completes the journey around Sept-Îles Harbour to Wabush Mining Co. port facilities at Point Noire, Quebec.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{lighthouse}} was built partially for ornamental purposes, {{it has also}} served as an active lighthouse. In its earliest years, it operated in a standard lighthouse role between April and November under a license from the U.S. Coast Guard. Grand Lake St. Marys was built to provide water for the Miami and Erie Canal; although the canal had ceased operations by 1923, there was still sufficient <b>lake</b> <b>traffic</b> to warrant {{the use of a}} lighthouse on this peninsula, which protrudes into the northern shore of the lake. [...] Today, it is one of three lighthouses on Grand Lake St. Marys: the Celina Rotary Club erected an operating lighthouse in 1986, at the lake's northwestern corner, and a third lighthouse was completed on the lake's southern shore in 2003. Unlike the other two lighthouses, the Northwoods Lighthouse is not easily accessible by land.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built about 1790 by Gideon Hawley, one of Ferrisburgh's first settlers. At the time, there were no roads in the area, and {{commerce}} on the lake was of vital importance. Hawley began operating a ferry across the lake about that time, which operated until about 1830. By then, roads had been built, to which much commerce moved, and the orientation of <b>lake</b> <b>traffic</b> became more north-south. Macdonough Point was an important militia muster site during the War of 1812 {{in advance of the}} important Battle of Plattsburgh. The building was used for many years as a farmhouse by local families, and was converted for use as a girls summer camp called Ecole Champlain about 1924.

50|$|Between {{the county}} line and Interstate 15, State Route 138 {{traverses}} very mountainous and scenic terrain and it connects with State Route 2 {{that leads to}} winter resort areas in the San Gabriel Mountains used largely by residents of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

From Interstate 15 to State Route 173, near {{the northwest corner of}} Silverwood <b>Lake,</b> <b>traffic</b> on State Route 138 is rather sparse. The remaining road past Silverwood Lake is mountainous, narrow, and twisting, and not a prime mountain route to the San Bernardino Mountain resorts. The entire segment from Interstate 15 to the eastern terminus of State Route 138 at Mount Anderson Junction is known the El Cajon-Skyline Forest Highway. State Route 138 and 18 overlap each other in opposing termini, as SR 18's northwest most endpoint is in Llano with SR 138, while SR 138's southmost point is in Crestline with SR 18.|$|E
