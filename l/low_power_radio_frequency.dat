25|$|The Paradigm system {{consists}} of two basic parts: an insulin pump and an optional glucose sensor CGM worn for up to 3 days. The disposable sensor is subcutaneously-placed to make glucose measurements in interstitial fluid every 5 minutes and transmit the reading via <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (ISM band) to the pump for realtime display. However, insulin therapy may be conducted without CGM and although there is not yet an automated insulin-regulation feedback mechanism between measure and infusion to control the amount and timing of insulin, {{this is clearly a}} future objective. So any change in basal or bolus is patient-driven by programming the pump using the Bolus WizardTM. The latest model pumps are the MiniMed Paradigm 522 and 722 which differ in reservoir size, 176 versus 300 units, respectively. In 2007 the FDA approved a pediatric model for patients 7 to 17 years old.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Abattery-free nano-power buck {{converter}} with a pro-posed dynamic on/off time (DOOT) control can achieve high con-version efficiency {{over a wide}} load range. The DOOT control can predict the on/off time at different input voltages without a power consuming zero current detection (ZCD) circuit, as well as sup-press static power in idle periods. To adapt to the fluctuations in a harvesting system, the proposed-calibration scheme guaran-tees accurate ZCD over process, voltage variation, and tempera-ture (PVT) in the DOOT to improve power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the adaptive phase lead (APL) mechanism can im-prove inherent propagation delay attributable to low-power and non-ideal comparator, thus improving load regulation by a max-imum of 30 mV. The test chip was implemented in 0. 25 - m CMOS process with a die area of 0. 39 mm.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science The {{focus of}} this {{research}} has been {{the development of a}} <b>low</b> <b>power,</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> transmitter architecture. Specifically, a technique for in service automatic calibration of a modulated phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer has been developed. Phase/frequency modulation is ac-complished by modulating the feedback divide value in a phase locked loop frequency synthesizer. A digital precompensation filter is used to extend the modulation bandwidth by canceling the low-pass transfer function of the PLL. The automatic calibration circuit maintains accurate matching between the digital precompensation filter and the analog PLL transfer function across process and temperature variations. The automatic calibration circuit, which is the main contribution of this thesis, operates while the transmitter is in service. This online calibration eliminates the need for production calibration and periodic down time for calibration cycles. In addition the calibration circuitry provides greater accuracy in the modulation than what is possible via offline methods of calibration.

30|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of wireless communication, flexible, complex, and diversified wireless communication applications are required. However, {{the difficulty of}} enabling new wireless communication applications {{is the lack of}} <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) transmission devices, especially the RF receiver. In order to alleviate this problem, an RF low power subsampling architecture for wireless communication applications is proposed in this paper. This subsampling architecture adopts a single-ended to differential configured balun low noise amplifier (balun-LNA), a subsampling mixer with high sampling ratio and a finite input response (FIR) filter and infinite impulse response (IIR) filter achieving frequency down-conversion, avoiding using high power-hungry blocks. Based on a subsampling theory, an optimum sampling frequency for the subsampling architecture is necessary to relax the complexity of the system. For the application of internet of things (IoT) wireless communication, the paper provides the implementation of the subsampling receiver solutions to get a tradeoff between power consumption, gain, noise, and sensitivity. It can achieve − 85  dBm sensitivity for an amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation at the data rate of 1  Mbps with the clock sampling frequency of 40  MHz. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the performance of the subsampling architecture has several advantages over others.|$|E

40|$|Space-based radiometric {{observations}} of key hydrological parameters (e. g., soil moisture) at the {{spatial and temporal}} scales required in the post- 2002 era face significant technological challenges. These measurements are based on relatively low frequency thermal microwave emission (at 1. 4 GHz for soil moisture and salinity, 10 GHz and up for precipitation, and 19 and 37 GHz for snow). The long wavelengths at these frequencies coupled with the high spatial and radiometric resolutions required by the various global hydrology communities necessitate the use of very large apertures (e. g., greater than 20 m at 1. 4 GHz) and highly integrated stable RF electronics on orbit. Radio-interferometric techniques such as Synthetic Thinned Array Radiometry (STAR), using silicon germanium (SiGe) <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> integrated circuits (RFIC), {{is one of the}} most promising technologies to enable very large non-rotating apertures in space.

40|$|Abstract — Short-range <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> {{systems such}} as Bluetooth and UWB enable the {{deployment}} of wireless personal area networks (WPAN). A WPAN can interface to larger networks to provide broader network access and Internet connectivity. We evaluate the performance of TCP over an integrated WLAN and WPAN system using a real network testbed. The end-to-end throughput is found to increase, when the window size is increased. However, for large window sizes, measurement results revealed that {{a wide range of}} round trip times (RTTs) is experienced. With small window sizes, the variability in the RTT is smaller. The measurements showed that in an integrated network long RTT delays and frequent duplicate acknowledgements lead to {{an increase in the number}} of packets transmitted unnecessarily. We study the effect of the number of active short-range devices (Bluetooth in this case) in a piconet. The results show that as the number of active slaves present in the WPAN increases, the bandwidth received by slaves exchanging data decreases. This behaviour is attributed to the Bluetooth scheduling mechanism which uses the round robin polling method. The main finding of our experiments is that for Bluetooth to be successful in enabling WPAN, the time slot allocation scheme should be efficient and fair. Finally, the issue of fair bandwidth allocation among multiple TCP streams is also investigated. The results show that for small number of TCP connections, the bandwidth is fairly distributed. However, as the number of simultaneous TCP connections increases, bandwidth distribution seems to become somewhat less fair.

Nowadays, the surveillance of the plague is done using tramps placed near the palm trees, and one person comes to the tramp and counts manually the number of weevils into the tramp. This project is aimed to improve the actual surveillance method. To realize it we have been created a Wireless Sensor Network and different nodes able to obtain the number of weevils into the tramp and they must transmit this data to a mobile node that collect all the data for processing. These sensor units are placed into the tramps, so they measure the weight of the weevils, and the number of them. The sensors are Strain Gauges and the signal conditioning system. This signal obtained from the gauges is processed into the Arduino board. To this microcontroller we can add one shield in order to conect communication devices, in our case, Xbees.

40|$|M. Tech. (Electrical Engineering) For {{securing}} {{food production}} {{it is essential}} that every possible method should be investigated. This study is about utilising <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) energy signals from leaky transmission lines for the benefit of plant growth and production in hydroponic systems. Using these lines eliminates common problems like radiation interference and licence application protocols. Plant cell walls are covered with tightly-bonded, positively-charged calcium ions that affect the inflow of nutrients into the cell. As calcium ions have a mass twice that of the potassium ion, the fundamental harmonic of calcium is equal to the first harmonic of potassium (32 Hz). Thousands (10 k : 1) fewer positive potassium ions also exist around the cell wall and when stimulated at their resonance frequency (16 Hz), they will bounce against the tightly bonded calcium ions so these calcium ions become dislodged from the cell wall. If this happens more nutrients can enter the cell causing acceleration in plant growth. A suitable electromagnetic wave for such an action is the amplitude modulated wave especially if it is modulated near the cyclotron resonance frequency of potassium (16 Hz) or its even-harmonics of 32, 64 Hz etc. Applying sufficient energy in the lower modulated frequency when it {{is the same as the}} vibration frequency of the potassium ions surrounding the cell wall, these ions will then acquire some energy from the electrical wave. Controlling the process is important because if too many calcium ions are released it would cause plant stress and plant structure breakdown. The amplitude modulated wave will allow sufficient time for the calcium ions to return to the cell wall during the period without energy. To apply radio energy to a plant in the form of amplitude modulated signals requires a medium. One such medium is the use of transmitting energy into two leaky transmission lines to cause worse case standing waves, which could then be absorbed by the plants that are placed in between these transmission lines. The energy from the radio waves is then used to create window periods during which the calcium ions are dislodged allowing additional nutrients to enter the plant cell, enhancing plant growth and production...|$|E
