5|$|Animals used by <b>laboratories</b> {{are largely}} {{supplied}} by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most <b>laboratories</b> breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River <b>Laboratories</b> who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the <b>laboratories</b> directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E

The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college <b>laboratories</b> would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford. A link between one of the college science lecturers and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) led to 17 students joining ICI between the two World Wars, some, such as John Rose, reaching senior levels in the company. The <b>laboratories</b> became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students; they were closed in 1947.|$|E

5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (nihonium, moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson) being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in <b>laboratories</b> before being found in nature. Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in <b>laboratories</b> or nuclear reactors. Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued.
