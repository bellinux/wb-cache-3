[...] She complains that the book is marketed as a diet book when that is not its sole focus: [...] "This isn't so much a diet book as a propaganda pamphlet for veganism… it moves effortlessly from being potty-mouthed {{advice on how to}} adopt a fat-busting healthy diet, into a diatribe against eating meat." [...] She also said: [...] "These pampered LA princesses work hard to make us feel guilty for trying to make our <b>lives</b> a <b>bit</b> easier...

5000|$|Garner said, in 1985, {{that writing}} novels was like [...] "trying {{to make a}} {{patchwork}} quilt look seamless.

In an interview in 1999, she said that [...] "My initial reason for writing is that I need to shape things so I can make them bearable or comprehensible to myself.

Papamoa (situated at Papamoa Beach) can be split into two areas: Papamoa East and Papamoa West. Legally speaking Domain Road separates Papamoa West from Papamoa East, although to many locals Papamoa East starts on the Eastern side of Parton Road.

5000|$|In the show's first season, episodes {{began with}} a cold open pre-taped sketch, were {{followed}} by the opening titles, and a personal monologue delivered by Holmes. After the first commercial break, a remote segment or another sketch was shown, or a <b>live</b> comedy <b>bit</b> was performed. The third segment was a short interview, usually with another comedian. The show would close with another short comedy piece. The show's second run featured a less formal structure, relying more heavily on pre-taped interviews. Most notably, the final episode entirely lacked a monologue, and was closed with the show's only musical performance ("Poke" [...] by Frightened Rabbit). Unlike most late-night talk shows, (including its lead-in, Conan) The Pete Holmes Show had a half-hour format.|$|R

Ironically, a month ago I saw more kangaroos (a mob of 14) on Red Hill in the centre of Canberra than I saw subsequently during the entirety of a 16-day tour of the Red Centre.

25|$|Sidewinders have an {{extraordinarily}} accelerated lifecycle, with natural life expectancies of females {{of about five}} years. Males may <b>live</b> quite a <b>bit</b> longer (maximum known natural lifespan of 13 years). Sidewinders can live more than 20 years when well fed in captivity (even females). Thus, energetics apparently factor heavily into natural female mortality, whereas predation might be the primary pressure on males. In the wild, females often die of exhaustion after giving birth, but the lives of sidewinders are also cut short by predation, diseases, and vehicle encounters.|$|R

50|$|The battle {{lasted for}} several days with heavy {{casualties}} on both sides. Many of its citizens were forced to flee the former capital world of the New Republic while {{those who did not}} manage to escape were forced to flee into the city-planet's lower levels. Many Senators, fearing for their <b>lives,</b> commandeered <b>bits</b> of the fleet and escaped to their sectors as the battle progressed. The New Republic navy was somewhat diminished as a result. Some think that if this had not happened, then the New Republic might have won the battle. The third wave was a biotoxin in the form of green algae released by the Yuuzhan Von which devoured many of the buildings, including dead bodies, and the algae also left behind black spots. Coralskipper and yorik-vec squadrons bombed the devastated city world causing damage to the defenders. The Yuuzhan Vong eventually captured Coruscant and had it terraformed and renamed Yuuzhan'tar after their primordial homeworld. Overall, the Yuuzhan Vong won because of their utter ruthlessness.|$|R

30|$|Automated {{self-help}} BITs are {{scalable to}} reach {{hundreds of thousands}} of people worldwide (Muñoz 2010). They can be used repeatedly without losing their therapeutic power to help additional people and they can transcend space, time, culture, and language because they can be used simultaneously anywhere in the world, at a time of the person’s choosing. BITs can engage and empower participants to take charge of their own well-being; they can stimulate self-management skills by providing participants with tools to guide their behaviour, thoughts, and interactions (Bolier 2015). While this also applies to self-help books, BITs have several additional advantages. They can help in translating acquired insights into real life and provide support to users in devoting the time and effort required for sustainable behavioural change (McGonical 2011). BITs can be deeply integrated into people’s daily <b>lives.</b> As <b>BITs</b> are provided on devices that people access and carry throughout their day (such as computers, tablets, smartphones, and wearable computing), they can increase the user’s awareness in times, places, and situations to help cope with their daily issues (Schueller et al. 2013).|$|R
