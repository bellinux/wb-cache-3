5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, <b>light</b> <b>or</b> heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E

5|$|Avery Point <b>Light</b> <b>or</b> Avery Point Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} in Groton, Connecticut, United States, on the Avery Point Campus of the University of Connecticut. Although construction {{was completed in}} March 1943, the lighthouse was not lit until May 1944 due to concerns of possible enemy invasion. Its original light consisted of eight 200-watt bulbs that were later replaced by a flashing green light in 1960. It was deactivated on June 25, 1967, when the United States Coast Guard Training Station moved to Governors Island. It is officially listed as the last lighthouse built in the state; the only other claimant is the replica Mystic Seaport Light.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>or</b> chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit <b>light</b> <b>or</b> interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Ginko {{faces the}} Tokoyami {{itself in the}} {{writings}} warehouse, while Tama and Koro try to remove the Tokoyami by bloodletting. The newly healed Tanyu accompanies Tama and Koro to the warehouse, where they find a collapsed Ginko. Tanyu begins to remove the writings from Ginko's body and reattach them to the parchments. After Tanyu removes the writings, Ginko awakens and continues on with Koro. The pair finds the rainbow-like Mushi. After this, they part ways, and Koro {{goes back to his}} hometown to build bridges. Ginko faces a Tokoyami-possessed Nui and carries her to the River of <b>Light</b> (<b>or</b> Koumyaku), a stream of glittering Mushi called Kouki—the origin of Mushi life.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to <b>light,</b> <b>or</b> {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

Thơ was thrown into a crowded cell with several other prisoners that had no <b>light</b> <b>or</b> toilet and filled with their own excrement. One of his cellmates was Dương Văn Minh, then a junior officer in the French military forces with whom he would work {{over the next two}} decades. Thơ was released first and lobbied to have Minh released as well and the pair remained close friends.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using <b>light</b> <b>or</b> scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use <b>light</b> <b>or</b> some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate <b>light</b> <b>or</b> loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red <b>light,</b> <b>or</b> jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces <b>light</b> <b>or</b> grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E
