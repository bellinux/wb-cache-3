25|$|Westernbank lending {{policies}} and practices focused mainly on mortgage residential loans rather than commercial and construction loans because, although commercial and construction loans offer a much higher rate of return, mortgage loans offer a much smaller risk of default. However, in 1994, after a revision of state bank laws, the company decided to diversify its <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> and services by changing its charter to become a full-service commercial bank. This allowed the bank to experience significant increases in customers, bank branches, loans (which now included commercial and construction loans), and ultimately revenue, doubling its financial size every {{two and a half}} years without the need of consolidations or mergers during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Buenaventura became central bank governor, over fifteen {{percent of the}} total <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> of the entire banking sector was {{considered}} non-performing loans. Within the next year, this peaked at seventeen percent. The need to unload these bad loans before they collapsed the industry spurred the BSP-led lobby for the Special Purpose Vehicles Act, a law that would allow banks to sell their bad loans at a discount to companies that specialized in taking over bad loans and turning them around. Carefully orchestrating the lobby before both houses of Congress, Buenaventura led the efforts for the passage of the law, telling lawmakers that the banking industry needed the flexibility since the government did not have the resources to launch its own rescue efforts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of bank lending in the monetary transmission process in Germany. We follow a sectoral approach by distinguishing corporate lending and household lending. We find that banks respond to a monetary contraction by adjusting their securities holdings, rather than reducing their <b>loans</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Most lending categories even show an increase following a monetary tightening. The main implication of our results is that a bank lending channel is not an important transmission mechanism. On the contrary, by insulating their <b>loans</b> <b>portfolio</b> from monetary shocks, banks {{are more likely to}} weaken than to strengthen the impact of monetary policy. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{second and}} more serious problem, {{unacknowledged}} by bank management, the financial regulator and the Irish government, is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to domestic {{problems in the}} crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio.</b> These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had propped up demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land at an average value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, {{the plan to}} recapitalize the bank for €5 billion was announced; the bank also planned to {{securitize}} the entire bad <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> for a target of €9.2 billion, which had a net book value of €10.2 billion as at 31 March 2016. The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed €1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for €1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for €1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market {{with some of them}} being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for €6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers. In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine tranche (for €1.171 billion) was added—to be underwritten by the bank itself.|$|E
25|$|After being {{promoted}} by the Catholic Church in the 1940s to assist the poor in Latin America, credit unions expanded rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Bolivia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Peru. The Regional Confederation of Latin American Credit Unions (COLAC) was formed and with funding by the Inter-American Development Bank credit unions in the regions grew rapidly throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s. In 1988 COLAC credit unions represented 4 million members across 17 countries with a <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> of circa half a billion US dollars. However, from the late 1970s onwards many Latin American credit unions struggled with inflation, stagnating membership and serious loan recovery problems. In the 1980s donor agencies such as USAID attempted to rehabilitate Latin American credit unions by providing technical assistance and focusing credit unions' efforts on mobilising deposits from the local population. In 1987 the regional financial crisis caused a run on credit unions. Significant withdrawals and high default rates caused liquidity problems for many credit unions in the region.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, {{the credit}} crunch has {{prompted}} buyout firms to pursue {{a new group of}} transactions in order to deploy their massive investment funds.
