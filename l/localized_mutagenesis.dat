However, the oxrB 8 mutation is pleiotropic and also affects the expression of hyd, pepT, and chiC, whereas a mutation in ntrA does not. Insertional inactivation with TnWO and <b>localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> permitted the definition and partial characterization of two new genes, fdhS and fdhR, which appear {{to be involved in}} the positive regulation of fdhF expression. Both genes were mapped to the 71 - to 72 -min region of the S. typhimurium chromosome with the gene order fdhS-crp-fdhR-rpsL. Mutations in fdhS specifically affect fdhF expression without affecting the expression of the other anaerobically induced genes or enzymes that were tested, including hyd, pepT, chiC, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, and trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase. Both fdhR and fdhS may be involved infdhF regulation vis-a-vis oxygen, since <b>localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> produced alleles of both genes that permitted the aerobic expression offdhF. However,fdhR may more directly interact withfdhF, since insertional inactivation of fdhS does not abolish aerobic expression of fdhF in fdhR mutant strains.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system of}} inducible insertional mutagenesis based on the Ac-Ds family of transposons for targeted tagging in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this system, the Ac and Ds elements are carried within the same T-DNA and a heat shock-inducible transposase fusion is utilized to control the levels of transposase gene expression, generating transpositions that can be subsequently stabilized without requiring crossing or segregation. We have mapped 40 single-copy lines by thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR, {{which can be used}} as potential launch pads for heat shock mutagenesis. Using a starter line selected for detailed analysis, the efficiency of tagging over a 50 -kb region in the genome was examined.

Subsequently, apidaecin derivatives produced by <b>localized</b> random <b>mutagenesis</b> were screened with this IPTG concentration-controlled in vivo system by monitoring the growth inhibition patterns of the transformant cells. One mutant apidaecin (P 9 L) that had reduced activity was purified and isolated from the periplasmic fraction of an E. coli transformant.

One such mutation, 2859 mis, has been mapped inside the ribosomal protein gene cluster at 72 minutes on the Escherichia coli chromosome and cotransduces at 98 % with rpsE (S 5). The 2869 mis mutation leads to thermosensitivity and impaired assembly in vivo of 50 S ribosomal particles at 42 °C. The strain carrying the mutation has an altered L 24 ribosomal protein which at 42 °C shows weaker affinity for 23 S RNA than the wild-type protein. The mutational alteration involves a replacement of glycine by aspartic acid in protein L 24 from the mutant.

These fadR superrepressor mutants [fadR(S) ] had greatly reduced levels of the beta-oxidative enzymes required for growth on fatty acids. The fadR(S) mutants reverted to Fad+ at a high frequency (10 (- 5], and the resulting Fad+ revertants were constitutive for expression of the fad enzymes (fadR).

By <b>localized</b> random <b>mutagenesis</b> of residues chosen {{on the basis}} of a modelled active site, we obtained several PoxB enzymes that had a markedly decreased activity with the natural substrate, pyruvate, but retained full activity with 2 -oxobutanoate. In each of these mutant proteins Val- 380 had been replaced with a smaller residue, namely alanine, glycine or serine. One of these, PoxB V 380 A/L 253 F, was shown to lack detectable {{pyruvate oxidase}} activity in vivo; this protein was purified, studied and found to have a 6 -fold increase in K(m) for pyruvate and a 10 -fold lower V(max) with this substrate. In contrast, the mutant had essentially normal kinetic constants with 2 -oxobutanoate. The altered substrate specificity was reflected in a decreased rate of pyruvate binding to the latent conformer of the mutant protein owing to the V 380 A mutation. The L 253 F mutation alone had no effect on PoxB activity, although it increased the activity of proteins carrying substitutions at residue 380, as it did that of the wild-type protein.

Until now, genes encoding a bacterial sodium-type flagellar motor have not been defined. A gene, motY, encoding one component of the sodium-type flagellar motor of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was cloned by complementation of a Mot- mutant strain. Sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 879 nucleotides in which a transposon conferring a motility defect mapped. Overexpression of motY in Escherichia coli allowed identification of a product 33 kDa in apparent size on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This size correlated well with the predicted molecular mass of 33, 385 Da. Unlike mot genes identified in other bacteria, <b>localized</b> transposon <b>mutagenesis</b> suggested that the locus was not an extended region containing multiple genes required for swimming motility. Sequencing upstream and downstream of motY confirmed that the gene maps alone and placed it within a locus homologous to the E. coli rnt locus. Although data bank searches failed to reveal significant similarity to known motility components, the carboxyl terminus of MotY showed extensive homology to a number of outer membrane proteins known to interact with peptidoglycan, including OmpA and peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins.

We have used this method to isolate many different temperature-sensitive mutations in genes of unknown function in particular regions of the chromosome. Since the method is very simple, {{it can be used to}} saturate any region of the map with mutations in essential genes, or for various types of genetic manipulations.

Site-specific approaches require {{a high level}} of knowledge at both the DNA and protein levels to implement highly specified genetic changes, while untargeted approaches require more extensive characterization after a desired mutant phenotype is screened or selected from a pool of randomly generated mutants. <b>Localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> techniques, such as error-prone PCR, have been developed to confine mutation to a specific region of DNA and offer an attractive compromise between untargeted and site-specific methods. However, inefficiencies in cloning, transformation, and library construction can make such approaches time consuming. We have developed a system for tunable mutagenesis localized to plasmid vectors based on the controlled overexpression of error-prone DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) in growing Escherichia coli cells. We showed that mutation is elevated and confined to a target vector in our system due to co-expression of a DNA nickase and placement of its recognition site on target vectors. We provide evidence that this system's mechanism involves error-prone replication by Pol IV during the homologous recombination repair process, a mechanism previously proposed for stationary phase Pol IV-dependent mutation. In addition to providing mechanistic understanding, experiments with our system in diverse strain backgrounds helped to identify polB and mutS deletion backgrounds in which mutation was elevated, and confirmed the requirement for a toxin-antitoxin system encoded by the yafNOP genes, located downstream of chromosomal dinB, encoding Pol IV. We also examined the effects of different numbers of nickase recognition sites and the addition of chi sites to our target vectors, leading to increased mutation rates. Finally, we employed another <b>localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> technique to optimize our Pol IV and nickase overexpression system, showing that optimal mutation rates are achieved at lower copy numbers when the expression system is plasmid-borne.

These mapped in a group of loci which we have designated aggR 1, aggR 2, aggR 3, and aggR 4. Temperature-sensitive mutants having a different terminal phenotype were not liked to aggR. A search through a group of nonconditional rough mutants indicated that a much lower proportion of these (1 of 35) mapped in aggR. Thus, aggR is probably only one of many sites which can lead to the rough phenotype when mutated. <b>Localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> {{was used to}} isolate nine additional aggR mutants. All mapped within aggR 1, aggR 2, or aggR 3, and none was found outside this region. Thus, we have characterized a cluster of developmental genes which are needed for aggregation in M. xanthus. The localization of a Tn 5 insert adjacent to this region makes possible further manipulation of these genes...|$|E
40|$|A mutant {{affected}} in the b subunit (coded by the uncF gene) of the F 1 F 0 -ATPase in Escherichia coli was isolated by a <b>localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> procedure {{in which a}} plasmid carrying the unc genes was mutagenized in vivo. The biochemical properties of cells carrying the uncF 515 allele were examined in a strain carrying the allele on a multicopy plasmid and a mutator-induced polar unc mutation on the chromosome. The strain carrying the mutant unc allele was uncoupled with respect to oxidative phosphorylation. Membrane-bound ATPase activity was very low or absent, and membranes were somewhat proton permeable. It was concluded that the F 0 sector was assembled. Determination of the DNA sequence of the uncF 515 allele showed it differed from wild type in that a G [...] A substitution occurred at position 392, resulting in glycine being replaced by aspartate at position 131. Genetic complementation tests indicated that the uncF 515 allele complemented the uncF 476 allele (Gly 9 [...] Asp). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of membrane preparations indicated that the uncF 515 and uncF 476 alleles interrupted assembly of the F 1 F 0 -ATPase at different stages...|$|E
40|$|A pLAFR 3 cosmid clone {{designated}} pVir 2 {{containing a}} 25 -kilobase (kb) DNA insert was isolated from a wild-type Pseudomonas solanacearum GMI 1000 genomic library. This cosmid {{was shown to}} complement {{all but one of}} the nine Tn 5 -induced mutants which have been isolated after random mutagenesis and which have lost both pathogenicity toward tomato and ability to induce hypersensitive reaction (HR) on tobacco (hrp mutants). The insert is colinear with the genome and provides restoration of the HR-inducing ability when transferred into several Tn 5 -induced hrp mutants, but failed to complement deletion mutants extending on both sides of the pVir 2 region. <b>Localized</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> demonstrated that the hrp genes are clustered within a 17. 5 -kb region of pVir 2 and that this cluster probably extends on the genomic region adjacent to the pVir 2 insert. A 3 -kb region adjacent to the hrp cluster modulates aggressiveness toward tomato but does not control HR-inducing ability. Sequences within the hrp cluster of pVir 2 have homology with the genomic DNA of Xanthomonas campestris strains representing eight different pathovars, suggesting that a set of common pathogenicity functions could be shared by P. solanacearum and X. campestris...|$|E
40|$|Coronaviruses {{have evolved}} diverse {{mechanisms}} to recognize different receptors for their cross-species transmission and host-range expansion. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike protein as its receptor-binding domain. Here we present the crystal structure of MHV NTD complexed with its receptor murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related {{cell adhesion molecule}} 1 a (mCEACAM 1 a). Unexpectedly, MHV NTD contains a core structure that has the same β-sandwich fold as human galectins (S-lectins) and additional structural motifs that bind to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of mCEACAM 1 a. Despite its galectin fold, MHV NTD does not bind sugars, but instead binds mCEACAM 1 a through exclusive protein–protein interactions. Critical contacts at the interface have been confirmed by mutagenesis, providing a structural basis for viral and host specificities of coronavirus/CEACAM 1 interactions. Sugar-binding assays reveal that galectin-like NTDs of some coronaviruses such as human coronavirus OC 43 and bovine coronavirus bind sugars. Structural analysis and <b>mutagenesis</b> <b>localize</b> the sugar-binding site in coronavirus NTDs to be above the β-sandwich core. We propose that coronavirus NTDs originated from a host galectin and retained sugar-binding functions in some contemporary coronaviruses, but evolved new structural features in MHV for mCEACAM 1 a binding...|$|R
40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC- 1 is {{distinct}} from other RAD 6 homologues in possessing a C-terminal tail 40 amino acid residues long [Leggett, Jones and Candido (1995) DNA Cell Biol. 14, 883 - 891]. Such extensions from the core catalytic domain {{have been found in}} a subset of known conjugating enzymes, where they have been shown to have diverse roles including target recognition, membrane attachment and sporulation. In the present study we used mutagenesis in vitro to examine the role of the tail in specific aspects of UBC- 1 structure and activity. Cross-linking experiments with purified recombinant UBC- 1 reveal that it forms dimers and probably tetramers. The acidic tail of UBC- 1 has an important role in this interaction because deletions of the tail significantly decrease, but do not abolish, this self-association. Ubiquitin conjugation assays show that, in addition to accepting a thiol-bound ubiquitin at its active site, UBC- 1 is stably mono-ubiquitinated. Deletion analysis and site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> <b>localize</b> the site of ubiquitination to Lys- 162 in the tail. These findings demonstrate that the C-terminal tail of UBC- 1 is important both for its quaternary structure and post-translational modification in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Inversion of the 4. 2 -kb C segment {{flanked by}} 0. 6 -kb {{inverted}} repeats on the bacteriophage P 1 genome is {{mediated by the}} P 1 -encoded site-specific cin recombinase. The cin gene lies adjacent to the C segment and the C inversion cross-over sites cixL and cixR are at the external ends of the inverted repeats. We have sequenced the DNA containing the cin gene and these cix sites. The cin structural gene consists of 561 nucleotides and terminates at the inverted repeat end where the cixL site is located. Only two nucleotides in the cixL region differ {{from those in the}} cixR and they are within the cin TAA stop codon. The cin promoter was <b>localized</b> by transposon <b>mutagenesis</b> within a 0. 1 -kb segment, which contains probable promoter sequences overlapping with a 'pseudo-cix' sequence cixPp. In a particular mutant, integration of an IS 1 -flanked transposon into the cin control region promoted weak expression of the cin gene. The cin and cix sequences show homology with corresponding, functionally related sequences for H inversion in Salmonella and with cross-over sites for G inversion in phage Mu. Based on a comparison of the DNA sequences and of the gene organizations, a possible evolutionary relationship between these three inversion systems and the possible significance of the cixPp sequence in the cin promoter are discussed...|$|R
