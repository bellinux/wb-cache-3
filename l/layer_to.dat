5|$|Geastrum welwitschii {{also has}} similar {{morphological}} characters to G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E

In order to enable deep learning on Grassmann manifolds, this paper proposes a deep network architecture by generalizing the Euclidean network paradigm to Grassmann manifolds. In particular, we design full rank mapping <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> transform input Grassmannian data to more desirable ones, exploit re-orthonormalization <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> normalize the resulting matrices, study projection pooling <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> reduce the model complexity in the Grassmannian context, and devise projection mapping <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> respect Grassmannian geometry and meanwhile achieve Euclidean forms for regular output <b>layers.</b> <b>To</b> train the Grassmann networks, we exploit a stochastic gradient descent setting on manifolds of the connection weights, and study a matrix generalization of backpropagation to update the structured data. The evaluations on three visual recognition tasks show that our Grassmann networks have clear advantages over existing Grassmann learning methods, and achieve results comparable with state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R

Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{developed}} the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern Mediterranean cultures by analysing {{the origin of}} artifacts (for example, items from Crete, mainland Greece, Cyprus or Canaan) found in each archaeological layer. If an artifact's origin can be accurately dated, it gives a reference date for the layer {{in which it is}} found. If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with Late Cycladic I (LCI) and Late Helladic I (LHI) cultures, but predates Peloponnesian LHI. Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro-Palestinian Middle Bronze II (MBII) gypsum vessels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} week of September, a strong {{tropical}} wave began to emerge off the coast of Africa. It was well-organized from the start, and on September 11, even before it emerged off the coast, the National Hurricane Center predicted that it could quickly develop into a tropical depression. That is indeed what happened, and it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12. The enormous size of the depression made it fairly slow to develop, combined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and influence of the Saharan Air <b>Layer</b> <b>to</b> the north as it tracked south of the Cape Verde islands. Convection was also slow to build in, with little banding at first. The initial strengthening was delayed as a result. However, on September 13, the organization improved as banding became better defined, and that evening, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E

5|$|Jakobsson {{served as}} the game's artist, designer, and programmer. His levels are made by hand in a {{standalone}} level editor. The designer brushes recurring, cloned elements, such as plants and chains, onto the map. The software combines and processes to add shadow. At one point, Rain World included a multiplayer mode, and separate story and custom modes. Primate, who {{is also known as}} James Therrien, wrote Rain World soundtrack, handled the indie studio's business, and designed levels. Primate first found the game on an indie game Internet forum and sent Jakobsson 12 tracks as a successful pitch. He originally composed a chiptune-style soundtrack with his musician partner Lydia Esrig, but turned to field recordings of litter for otherworldly sounds. Rain World music is low-fi and electronic. Primate wanted the music to approximate the game's eclectic visuals, which mix industrial, science fiction, jungle, and various architectural elements. In lieu of traditional character dialogue and narration, Rain World story was partly communicated through its soundtrack. The early game sound is primitive and based on the Slugcat's feelings of fear and hunger, and eventually builds to describe new areas. Rain World has over 3.5 hours of recorded music across 160 tracks. At any given time, between eight and twelve tracks will simultaneously <b>layer</b> <b>to</b> create ambiance and respond to the Slugcat's in-game context. The development team successfully crowdfunded some development costs via Kickstarter in early 2014.
