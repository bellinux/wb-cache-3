50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, potters such as Josiah Wedgwood {{introduced}} industrial processes that made it practical to mass-produce glazed pottery containers capable of withstanding the heat of the oven, at relatively low prices. Following a suggestion by Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1786, Wedgwood started making game pie dishes with an inner liner to hold the contents and an ornamental cover. These were a useful alternative to the traditional pastry coffin, since there were endemic shortages of wheat at this time caused by the early industrial revolution coupled with the disruption of trade during the Napoleonic warsWedgwood's dishes often had raised bas-relief ornaments of dead game and vine leaves, and a <b>lid</b> <b>handle</b> often modeled on a hare or root vegetable. Some designs gave the illusion of a pastry coffin and lid. William Jesse in his 1844 biography of Beau Brummel says this design was introduced in 1800 when the royal household prohibited the use of flour for pastry in their kitchens, using rice instead.|$|E

50|$|On April 6, 1932 Jean René Guauguin leapt off a ten-meter {{diving board}} into the {{gigantic}} swimming pool {{of the resort}} town of Havested. This was a fitting way to inaugurate his largest work ever 'Sea Horse'. An enormeous stoneware structure built in this studios of Bing § Grondahl 'Sea Horse' was a remarkable undertaking. Inspired by the myths of Europa and Poseiden it dominated a massive public swimming pool where it suffered the ignoimous fate of being totally destroyed by a falling scaffoloding on 14 June 1952. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, his work continued to alternate between two principal mediums, bronze and stoneware. On the one hand he produced stylized athletes and animals cast in bronze. Alongside these he expressed his fascination with the sea and it's myths and it's monsters creating a fascinating ceramic opus of tritons, nereids, underwater creatures, octopusses, and unusual depictions of the horses of Poseidon. The production pieces he created for Bing § Grondahl were executed in polychrome glazed stoneware or porcelain for the smaller figures. Expressive monkeys, water buffaloes, tigers and lions in ceramic form also populated his universe. In his studio pieces he often opted for rough surfaced unglazed stoneware, witness his impressive urns with Chinese inspired temple dogs as <b>lid</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|R

The facial features tend to be formed by molding with the clay that is part of the formed lid, though with lids of the grotesque style applying more clay to the surface. Attention was paid most notably to the face lids, secondly to the exterior of the coffin, which was smoothed down and compressed back into itself. And lastly the interior was left rough and undefined with coils still notable. Some times handles can be found along the sides of the coffins, used for carrying as well as adapted and molded into representing the facial features on the <b>lids.</b> <b>Handles</b> seem to be one of the local variations that coffin sport; they are found in Transjordan and Beth-shan. The formations of the arms sculpted thinly along the edge of the lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.

40|$|Immersion is the {{ultimate}} goal of head-mounted displays (HMD) for Virtual Reality (VR) in order to produce a convincing user expe-rience. Two important aspects in this context are motion sickness, often due to imprecise calibration, and the integration of a reliable eye tracking. We propose an affordable hard- and software solution for drift-free eye-tracking and user-friendly lens calibration within an HMD. The use of dichroic mirrors leads to a lean design that provides the full field-of-view (FOV) while using commodity cam-eras for eye tracking. Our prototype supports personalizable lens positioning to accommodate for different interocular distances. On the software side, a model-based calibration procedure adjusts the eye tracking system and gaze estimation to varying lens positions. Challenges such as partial occlusions due to the lens holders and eye <b>lids</b> are <b>handled</b> by a novel robust monocular pupil-tracking approach.

40|$|Temperature {{programmed}} reaction (TPR) {{technique was}} performed on LiOH powders and LiD single crystals previously exposed to different moisture levels. Our {{results show that the}} LiOH decomposition process has an activation energy barrier of 30 to 33. 1 kcal/mol. The LiOH structure is stable even if kept at 320 K for 100 years. However, LiOH structures formed on the surface of LiD during moisture exposure at low dosages may have multiple activation energy barriers, some of which may be much lower than 30 kcal/mol. We attribute the lowering of the activation energy barrier for the LiOH decomposition to the existence of dangling bonds, cracks, and other long range disorders in the LiOH structures formed at low levels of moisture exposure. These defective LiOH structures may decompose significantly over the next 100 years of storage even at room temperature. At high moisture exposure levels, LiOH. H{sub 2 }O formation is observed. The release of H{sub 2 }O molecules from LiOH. H{sub 2 }O structure has small activation energy barriers in the range of 13. 8 kcal/mol to 16. 0 kcal/mol.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a thesis performed by two students at Jönköping University {{in the field}} of Mechanical Engineering, Product Development and Design. The task has been carried out on the behalf of the company NPB Automation. The task aims to develop a new generation of marker to the industry for <b>lid</b> <b>handling</b> with respect to beverage can-related products. Materials selection, design of marker and the electronic circuit has been the main focus of the work. The industry of today regarding automation is a growing industry where development and efficiency is constantly happening. This work has contributed to increase the efficiency of handling the substantial number of lids that are being processed today. The report addresses a further development from the already existing marker of the company which is used when two different types of beverage can lids are changed. The work was initiated with a pilot study which contained gathering data by performing literature research. The pilot study was done to identify important parameters for the products design. These parameters were the foundation for generating different concepts where an elimination matrix later was used for choosing a winning concept. The final decision of the concept was done in consultation with NPB Automation. This concept underwent some changes throughout the process of the report but the main focus was to design the electronic circuit so that it fits in the marker without much change of its original dimensions. At the end of the work with NPB Automation a design proposal on the marker had been developed using CAD-modeling as well as manufacturing documentation with blueprints and a BOM-list.

40|$|Figure 1 : Nonlinear beam tracing on a GPU. This scene {{contains}} a mirror teapot reflecting complex objects in fully dynamic motions. Such kinds of scenes {{are difficult to}} render efficiently via ray tracing but easy for our polygon rasterization based approach. See Section 5 for detailed performance statistics. Furthermore, the image quality generated by our approach is comparable to ray tracing; for each pair of images the ray tracing result {{is on the left}} while our result is on the right. The small images are close-ups around high curvature areas, including teapot spout, <b>lid,</b> and <b>handle,</b> rendered under different view points. Beam tracing [Heckbert and Hanrahan 1984] combines the flexibil-ity of ray tracing and the coherence and speed of polygon rasteri-zation. However, beam tracing so far only handles linear transfor-mations; thus, it is only applicable to linear effects such as planar mirror reflections but not to nonlinear effects such as curved mirror reflection, refraction, caustics, and shadows. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear beam tracing to render these nonlinear global illumination effects. Nonlinear beam trac-ing is highly challenging because commodity graphics hardware supports only linear vertex transformation and triangle rasteriza-tion. We overcome this difficulty by designing a nonlinear graphics pipeline and implementing it on top of a commodity GPU. This al-lows beams to be nonlinear where rays within the same beam {{do not have to be}} parallel or intersect at a single point. A major strength of our algorithm is that it naturally supports fully dynamic scenes as it does not rely on acceleration data structures required for ray trac-ing. Utilizing our approach, nonlinear global illumination effects can be rendered in real-time on a commodity GPU under a unified framework...|$|R
