50|$|The {{architect}} of the City Hall, Matthew Layens of Leuven, was called to draw up plans. It {{was to be a}} building in Gothic style, but it seems that the plan (which was not found) was not completed, including the abandonment of the second floor, which was still intended for construction. The Renaissance campanile was added in the 18th century. It contains a bell dating from 1390, the Bancloque, and carries a <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> overlooking the Grand Place and a <b>light</b> <b>clock.</b> The 19th century saw various modifications of the façade, the removal of stone mullions to the floor and various stone ornaments.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>clock</b> and <b>dials</b> were {{designed}} by Augustus Pugin. The <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> are set in an iron frame [...] in diameter, supporting 312 pieces of opal glass, rather like a stained-glass window. Some of the glass pieces may be removed for inspection of the hands. The surround of the dials is gilded. At the base of each <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> in gilt letters is the Latin inscription: ...|$|R

50|$|Gameplay {{involves}} pressing buttons in {{time with}} music. Symbols for buttons are arranged in a circle, resembling a <b>clock</b> <b>dial.</b> A pointer sweeps around the dial, indicating when to press each button.|$|R
50|$|On {{top of the}} {{building}} is a 245-foot tall clock tower with four <b>clock</b> <b>dials,</b> each 22 feet in diameter, which {{can be seen from}} Market Street, a main thoroughfare of the city.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> did not {{indicate}} minutes and seconds. A <b>clock</b> with a <b>dial</b> indicating minutes was illustrated in a 1475 manuscript by Paulus Almanus, and some 15th-century clocks in Germany indicated minutes and seconds.An early record of a seconds hand on a clock dates back to about 1560 on a clock now in the Fremersdorf collection.|$|R
50|$|User-settable {{mechanical}} {{alarm clocks}} date {{back at least}} to 15th-century Europe. These early alarm clocks had a ring of holes in the <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> and were set by placing a pin in the appropriate hole.|$|R
50|$|On 15 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz, the Courtyard gates were {{destroyed}} by a direct bomb hit. The wall above the Gate Clock collapsed, and the <b>clock's</b> <b>dial</b> was damaged. The damage was repaired after the war.|$|R
50|$|The façade of the {{building}} is adorned with a clock, constructed and installed in 1701, near the top. The <b>clock’s</b> <b>dial</b> was created in Paris, engraved by Paul Labrosse and gilded by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre-Dame.|$|R
50|$|The <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> (faces) {{were painted}} iron. They were {{produced}} with varying complexity, {{in accord with}} the price of the model. For the economical, it was relatively unadorned. For the most expensive types, the dial featured artistic paintings from recognized Bostonian artists.|$|R
5000|$|Clockworks: Replace clock {{operating}} {{mechanisms and}} hands: Provide new master clock controller, new timepieces with new hands (hands shall match historic originals from photographs and with {{review and approval}} from architect), replace <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> and exterior wood trim (ensure weather tight installation.) ...|$|R
50|$|On January 24, 2003, {{with its}} American Design Series, the US Postal Service issued a {{commemorative}} 10 cent stamp {{which features a}} Banjo clock, thus remembering Simon Willard. The stamp featured {{an image of a}} Banjo <b>Clock's</b> <b>dial,</b> drawn by the artist Lou Nolan.|$|R
5000|$|In 1753 Thomas Stretch {{erected a}} large <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> and masonry <b>clock</b> {{case at the}} west end of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. That equipment, which resembled a giant tall clock (grandfather clock), had been removed in about 1830. The <b>clock’s</b> <b>dials</b> were mounted at the east and west ends of the main {{building}} connected by rods to the clock movement {{in the middle of the}} building. [...] The western end had a masonry structure designed to look like the clock case. The acquisition of the original clock and bell by the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly is closely related to the acquisition of the Liberty Bell. By mid-1753, the clock had been installed in the State House attic, but six years were to elapse before Thomas Stretch received any pay for it.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} in four stages with angle buttresses. It has a west doorway, above {{which is a}} pair of tiered windows. The third stage has <b>clock</b> <b>dials,</b> and in the top stage are three-light bell openings. On the summit are crocketed pinnacles at the corners and at the {{midpoint}} on each side.|$|R
50|$|Biere became {{well known}} in Europe and Australia where he toured. His most well known tricks were the Egg Bag, <b>Clock</b> <b>Dial</b> and the Ten-Ichi Thumb Tie. He also {{performed}} the vanishing bird cage act and in the 1920s gave stage illusions at the St. George's Hall. He died in London on August 6, 1934.|$|R
5000|$|... 1783 Designed the apple-shaped (aiguilles à pomme) hands, {{known as}} 'Breguet' hands. These hollow, {{eccentric}} [...] "moon" [...] tip hands are {{a variant of}} the hands first used by Jean-Antoine Lépine, {{the only difference is that}} Lépine's hands were not eccentric. Since their invention, Breguet hands have graced watch and <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> alike until today.|$|R
50|$|Everyday {{examples}} of phosphorescent materials are the glow-in-the-dark toys, stickers, paint, and <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> that glow {{for some time}} after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light. Typically, the glow slowly fades out, sometimes {{within a few minutes}} or up to a few hours in a dark room.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bottom of}} the tide <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> (6 o-clock position) is marked [...] "low tide" [...] {{and the top of}} the tide <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> (12 o’clock position) is marked [...] "high tide." [...] The left side of the dial is marked [...] "hours until high tide" [...] and has a count-down of hours from 5 to 1. There is one hand on the clock face, and along the left side it points to the number of hours [...] "until" [...] the (lunar) high tide. The right hand side of the clock is marked [...] "hours until low tide" [...] and has a count-down of hours from 5 to 1. The number pointed to by the hand gives the time [...] "until" [...] the (lunar) low tide. Some tide clocks {{incorporate}} time (using standard quartz movement) and even humidity and temperature in the same instrument.|$|R

25|$|The {{building}} is 145 m long, 30–50 m wide and 55 m tall {{from the earth}} level to the star on the clock tower. The tower is separated from the main building and features a clock of 5 m diameter. The <b>clock's</b> <b>dial</b> is encircled by the zodiac signs; their sequence is unusual, and Dushkin did not leave a clue to his arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The Kremlin Clock (Кремлёвские часы; Kremlyovskiye chasy) or Kremlin Chimes (Кремлёвские куранты; Kremlyovskiye kuranty), {{also known}} colloquially in the West as Moscow Clock Tower, is a {{historic}} clock on the Spasskaya Tower of Moscow Kremlin. The <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> is above the main gates to Red Square. For decades, the chimes have rung on the quarter-hour, with bells tolling for each full hour.|$|R
50|$|The south facing two {{storeyed}} entrance front {{has seven}} bays, {{two of which}} are set within each of the gabled projections to the east and west. The entrance porch supported by four classical columns sits within the western projection. A recessed wing of seven bays adjoins to the west. The rear domestic wing carries an octagonal bell turret and <b>clock</b> <b>dial.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thomas Stretch (March 30, 1697 - October 19, 1765) was an American clockmaker and {{a founder}} and first Governor of the Colony in Schuylkill, later known as The State in Schuylkill, or Schuylkill Fishing Company. In 1753 he erected the first clock at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, a large <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> and masonry <b>clock</b> {{case at the}} west end of the structure.|$|R
5|$|The <b>clock</b> <b>dial</b> {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|R
25|$|On 10 May 1941, a German bombing raid damaged {{two of the}} <b>clock's</b> <b>dials</b> and {{sections}} of the tower's stepped roof and destroyed the House of Commons chamber. Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott designed a new five-floor block. Two floors are occupied by the current chamber, which {{was used for the}} first time on 26 October 1950. The clock ran accurately and chimed throughout the Blitz.|$|R
2500|$|The Tower was renovated in 1905 due to weather-erosion of the Portland stone. The <b>clock</b> <b>dials</b> were {{converted}} to white opal glass. [...] Three of the dials were illuminated by gas, but the seaward-facing dial was not, being disallowed by the Admiralty. The worn stone pillars were to be rotated by 180° to hide the worn areas, and builders A.S. Ingleton and J. Masters were hired.|$|R
