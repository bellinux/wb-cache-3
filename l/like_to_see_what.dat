500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it's {{like to do it}} for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
2500|$|Asked in mid-2008 {{if he gets}} [...] "sick {{of playing}} it every night," [...] Secor responded: [...] "I don't mind playing it every night. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it does to people, and it's nice to have {{something}} that’s guaranteed, especially when you're shuffling through new material." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. No. I've done my accounts, and I thought I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> you're doing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll go, of course,' said John; 'and perhaps Miss Garland would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> {{doing there}} to-day? Everybody is gone or going; {{the road is}} like a fair.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it is. Suppose we go up? My sister can get me cards.... I tell you, Dare, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> {{going on}} in that bunch. I've heard a lot and seen some things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mateusz Skutnik said on Patreon, [...] "So {{at the end}} we {{left the}} infamous town, right? Right? Even if so, wouldn't you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> beyond its walls? What's beyond the fog/mist? What kind of world spawned such town in the first place? Are the {{citizens}} of Daymare indigenous, or just creatures that stumbled upon deserted city structures? Am I saying too much already?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Olive Chancellor," [...] Miss Birdseye murmured. [...] "I don't want to stay, though I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{you will}} see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Dave, let's go up {{a little}} farther," [...] pleaded Phil. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> this brook looks like beyond the falls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you please," [...] said Harry; [...] "but Flora {{seems to}} want us, and I should rather <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> sort of company she keeps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, <b>like</b> you, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> we can't," [...] said St. Clare. [...] "How comes it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I should <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I have said. You {{know about}} things, {{and if it}} is too much or too little, you can tell me." [...] Then he read her letter, which ran as follows.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{his life}} Erdős showed a {{particular}} fascination with inequalities for constrained polynomials. One {{of his favorite}} type of polynomial inequalities was Markov- and Bernstein-type inequalities. For Erdős, Markov- and Bernstein-type inequalities had their own intrinsic interest. He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happened when the polynomials are restricted in certain ways. Markov- and Bernstein-type inequalities for classes of polynomials under various constraints have attracted a number of authors. In a short paper in 1940 Erdős [E 40] has found a class of restricted polynomials for which the Markov factor n 2 improves to cn. He proved {{that there is an}} absolute constant c such that |p′(x) | ≤ mi...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm afraid it'll be {{troublesome}} to {{you getting}} it out, sister," [...] said Mrs. Tulliver; [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{sort of a}} crown she's made you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll just {{go down to}} Robin Hill," [...] said James, {{spluttering}} out {{his words}} very quick; [...] "the horses want exercise, and I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they've been doing down there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{so many of}} {{our young}} nobles went into Germany and Hungary, you were pleased in your wisdom to say that you would <b>like</b> well <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> reports they sent home to their friends; also what news was sent out from the court to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Many, {{many thanks}} to you and dear little Awkey for your present. I have set it up like a picture, and much do I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> look at it, and guess who chose the colours and who are the hunters. I am sure the fat man in the red coat is the admiral. It makes the place seem <b>like</b> home <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> tells so plainly of you and baby.|$|R
500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, [...] "I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|R
60|$|I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> age and adventures {{have done}} upon him. I {{recollect}} him a very handsome, plausible man. Of all good breeding, {{that of a}} swindler (of good education, be it understood) is the most perfect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I can do {{among the}} natives. Then {{there is a}} {{construction}} train over at the junction, and I {{know a lot of}} the fellows. I guess some of 'em would like to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now if you'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I'm after at {{the present}} moment," [...] said Cruttendon, putting a canvas before Jacob. [...] "There. That's it. That's more like it. That's ..." [...] he squirmed his thumb in a circle round a lamp globe painted white.|$|E
6000|$|And yet, I've been {{thinking}} I'd so <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] If <b>what</b> goes on behind HER, goes on behind ME! [...] And then, goodness gracious! what fun {{it would be}} [...] For us BOTH as we sit by our window! ...|$|R
60|$|He has {{not been}} {{successful}} in life--few are who are uncompromising in their manner of life. When I speak of life, I include art, which is life to him. I should <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a wonder of light and colour and space and breathable air, he put into his Venus rising from the sea--refused on the ground of nudity at the Paris Exhibition this summer. The loss will be great to him, I fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity we have {{to sleep}} when {{there is so much}} to see," [...] was Dave's comment, as, after having passed through Cincinnati, it grew time to retire. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> very much <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> this section of the country looks like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! it is {{too soon}} to think of marrying her at all," [...] replied the earl with a smile; [...] "but, somehow, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> my {{reception}} in the world will be as plain Mr. Denbigh, unprovided for and unknown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{my father}} will have a feast, indeed,' thought he. 'What a fool my brother was not to take more heed! Now he is in disgrace, and we know him no more. Well, I will watch till the bird comes. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> manner of bird it is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, sir," [...] he said, [...] "what's this? Tired today? Not feeling well? You aren't boxing like yourself, {{not at all}} you aren't. There's no weight behind 'em. You're tapping. What's {{the matter}} with your feet, too? You aren't getting about as quickly as I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>What</b> {{have you been doing}} to yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Creditable to her brother, and creditable to herself," [...] said Sir Patrick. [...] "Taking her odd {{character}} into consideration, I {{understand her}} <b>liking</b> it <b>to</b> be <b>seen.</b> <b>What</b> puzzles me, is her letting lodgings with {{an income of}} her own to live on." ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of online}} {{language}} resources for L 2 text production purposes {{is a recent}} phenomenon and {{has not yet been}} studied in depth. Increasing availability of new online resources seems to be changing the very nature of L 2 text production. The traditional dictionary, hitherto a default resource to help with language doubts, is being left behind while online resources are taking the lead. What are these resources? Do students need any specific training on how to use them? At what moment of L 2 text production do students wish to resort to resources? Rather than analysing the usefulness of a specific kind of resource, this paper focuses on the students’ perceived needs. In particular, we would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent our students are open to using language resources, if they are willing to master their use and, finally, if they use resources properly, which is with cognitive implication behind...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' he may {{send the}} barons naked home {{as he did}} the King's soldiers," [...] laughed Bertrade de Montfort. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this fellow; <b>what</b> may he look like--from the {{appearance}} of yourself, Sir John, and many of your men-at-arms, {{there should be no}} few here but have met him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mara, you and I {{have been}} {{together}} so much, I can't tell. We don't notice what goes on before us every day. I really should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Moses Pennel will think when he sees you. At any rate, he can't order you about with such a grand air {{as he used to}} when you were younger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] replied Marizano, who {{was very}} merry by this time under the {{influence}} of the beer, as, indeed, were also his men and their entertainers. [...] "Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> our guns can do?" [...] asked the half-caste. [...] "If you will permit me, I shall let you hear and see them in use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No trouble now," [...] said Fortescue. [...] "We did have. But {{the public}} is getting educated up to it. Our law now allows us to knock the side out of a house when {{we feel that we}} would really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is in it.

5000|$|Code {{troubles}} W+K: {{collection of}} code bugs. [...] "Basically it was Flash and Director experiments {{that had gone}} wrong.

6000|$|... "That's right, get mad," [...] he approved. [...] "I {{like you}} for that, too. You've got spunk an' fight. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. It's <b>what</b> a man needs in his wife--and not these fat cows of women. They're the dead ones. Now you're a live one, all wool, a yard long and a yard wide." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kovacs's first paid {{entertainment}} {{work was}} during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He {{spent the next}} nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things <b>like</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be {{run over by a}} train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it [...] "Kovacs Unlimited".|$|R
