50|$|Another {{important}} feud from 1996 to 1997 {{was between}} Hart and Shawn Michaels, who had <b>legitimate</b> <b>issues</b> {{with one another}} outside of wrestling. The conflict behind the scenes spilled out into their on-screen story line, with both men making pointed personal remarks in interviews that were often rooted in these issues.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, resolving {{labor and}} work {{environment}} issues {{is essential for}} enhanced legitimacy, particularly cognitive legitimacy. Although the concerns addressed above are <b>legitimate,</b> <b>issues</b> about work environments apply not only to sharing economy. As shown by Uber’s case, companies which neglect fair work environments and fail to avoid scandal face serious backlash.|$|R
5|$|Kenilworth Castle was {{valued at}} £10,401 in 1588, when Leicester died without <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue</b> and heavily in debt. In {{accordance}} with his will, the castle passed first {{to his brother}} Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, and after the latter's death in 1590, to his illegitimate son, Sir Robert Dudley.|$|E
5|$|In February 1685, King Charles II died without <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue,</b> and George's father-in-law, the Roman Catholic Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George was {{appointed}} to the Privy Council and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions. William of Orange refused to attend James's coronation largely because George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, George was also the son and brother of a king and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of Charles II without <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue</b> in February 1685, the Duke of York became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. Mary was playing cards when her husband {{informed}} her of her father's accession, {{and that she was}} heir presumptive. When Charles's illegitimate son Monmouth assembled an invasion force at Amsterdam, and sailed for Britain, William informed James of Monmouth's departure, and ordered English regiments in the Low Countries to return to Britain. To William's relief, Monmouth was defeated, captured and executed, but both he and Mary were dismayed by James's subsequent actions.|$|E

5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue,</b> William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the people, who saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.|$|E
5|$|William {{was part}} of the first {{generation}} to grow to maturity under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which forbade descendants of George II from marrying unless they either obtained the monarch's consent or, if over the age of 25, gave twelve months' notice to the Privy Council. Several of George III's sons, including William, chose to cohabit with the women they loved, rather than seek a wife. Having <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue</b> was not a primary concern for William, as {{he was one of the}} younger sons of George III, he was not expected to figure in the succession, which was considered secure once the Prince of Wales married and had a daughter, Princess Charlotte, second-in-line to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Seeing little {{prospect}} of the Queen giving in and receiving her daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty living within their means in Britain, {{and the cost of}} living was much lower in Germany. Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives. In 1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he stayed with his eldest brother, who in 1820 succeeded to the British and Hanoverian thrones as George IV. George III's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, died six days before his father, but left a daughter, Princess Victoria of Kent. With the death of George III, Ernest became fourth in line to the British throne, following the Duke of York (who would die without <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue</b> in 1827), the Duke of Clarence, and Princess Victoria.|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} text, we describe how the Catholic Church attempts to legitimate {{problems in the}} agenda-setting process in the Czech Republic. We introduce a number of theoretical concepts and terms related to agenda setting that we apply {{to the case of}} the Catholic Church in the Czech Republic. We based our empirical analysis on semi-structured interviews; we spoke with eight respondents from different strata of the Church structure and with Catholic politicians. We describe two kinds of strategies the Church would like to use, which we call: (1) the media strategy, whereby the Czech Catholic Church aims to <b>legitimate</b> <b>issues</b> in the media arena, and (2) the vertical strategy, whereby the Czech Catholic Church aims to <b>legitimate</b> <b>issues</b> through the laity active {{at the top of the}} political hierarchy. We discuss these strategies in connection with the individuals engaged in their implementation. We conclude by questioning these proposed strategies that are based on the principle of inspiration. We also suggest there is a need to revise the strategies and base them on the principle of personal effort instead...|$|R

5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, {{not going to}} bed herself {{for more than ten}} days. William IV died {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue,</b> the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E
5|$|In 1745 the Jacobite rising {{known as}} The 'Forty-Five began. Charles Edward Stuart, {{son of the}} Old Pretender, often {{referred}} to as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed on the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Several clans unenthusiastically joined him. At the outset he was successful, taking Edinburgh and then defeating the only government army in Scotland at the Battle of Prestonpans. The Jacobite army marched into England, took Carlisle and advanced as far as south as Derby. However, it became increasingly evident that England would not support a Roman Catholic Stuart monarch. The Jacobite leadership had a crisis of confidence and they retreated to Scotland as two English armies closed in and Hanoverian troops began to return from the continent. Charles' position in Scotland began to deteriorate as the Whig supporters rallied and regained control of Edinburgh. After an unsuccessful attempt on Stirling, he retreated north towards Inverness. He was pursued by the Duke of Cumberland and gave battle with an exhausted army at Culloden on 16 April 1746, where the Jacobite cause was crushed. Charles hid in Scotland with the aid of Highlanders until September 1746, when he escaped back to France. There were bloody reprisals against his supporters and foreign powers abandoned the Jacobite cause, with the court in exile forced to leave France. The Old Pretender died in 1760 and the Young Pretender, without <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue,</b> in 1788. When his brother, Henry, Cardinal of York, died in 1807, the Jacobite cause was at an end.|$|E

Brainquake was {{a criticism of}} the Boobquake event, which Bashi argued was an unhelpful and inappropriate way of drawing attention to <b>legitimate</b> <b>issues.</b> The issue at hand was a statement by Tehran's leader in Friday Prayer, saying that women who wear immodest clothing and behaved promiscuously caused earthquakes. Bashi and Brainquake advocates argued that instead of highlighting one's physical differences, women should show off their CVs and lists of accomplishments.|$|R

25|$|Frederick {{was married}} three times, but {{produced}} no <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue.</b> The {{fact that he}} reached middle age without producing an heir meant that his uncle Prince Christian of Glücksburg (1818–1906), the paternal descendant of King Christian III, and an 8th cousin of his father Christian VIII was chosen as his heir-presumptive in 1852. When Frederick died in 1863, Christian took the throne as Christian IX.|$|E
25|$|His only {{legitimate}} son, {{the future}} Frederick VII (1808–1863) was married three times, but produced no <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue.</b> Since he was apparently unlikely to beget heirs, Christian wished {{to avert a}} succession crisis. Christian commenced arrangements to secure the succession in Denmark. The result was {{the selection of the}} future Christian IX as hereditary prince, the choice made official by a new law enacted on 31 July 1853 after an international treaty made in London.|$|E

He’s not out there defying rules handed down by elites to control what we say. All Trump’s defying is common decency.|$|R
25|$|By 1945, ten {{districts in}} Brunswick had a student {{population}} of 313 between first and ninth grades. Due to the added expenses of small districts (in an era becoming increasingly {{dominated by the}} automobile) and sometimes crumbling school facilities, the idea of consolidating smaller districts into one larger district (centralization) became a <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue.</b> By 1953, fourteen districts in Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown, and Poestenkill were proposed for centralization. Eight of the districts were serviced by one-room schoolhouses with no running water.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, with George IV {{dead and}} the new king, William IV, over 60 and still without <b>legitimate</b> <b>issue,</b> the young princess's status as heir {{presumptive}} and the Duchess's prospective place as regent led to major increases in British state income for the Kents.
