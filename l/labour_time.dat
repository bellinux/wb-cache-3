[...] This relationship was probably first quantified in 1936 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the United States, where {{it was determined that}} every time total aircraft production doubled, the required <b>labour</b> <b>time</b> decreased by 10 to 15 percent. Subsequent empirical studies from other industries have yielded different values ranging from only a couple of percentages up to 30%, but in most cases it is a constant percentage: It did not vary at different scales of operation. The Learning Curve model posits that for each doubling of the total quantity of items produced, costs decrease by a fixed proportion.|$|E

5000|$|Mirowski (1989) {{for example}} accuses Marx of vacillating between a field theory (labour-time {{currently}} socially necessary) and a substance theory of value (embodied labour-time). This kind of criticism {{is due to}} a confusion of the process of labour in general (adding use to a product, which under capitalism equates adding value to a commodity) with the task of quantifying the exchange value added. The general process affixes <b>labour</b> <b>time</b> to a commodity, and providing the commodity functions as such the quantity of <b>labour</b> <b>time</b> is immaterial—an abstract unknown, so to speak—and can be expressed in many ways, e.g. [...] "embodied in", [...] "attached to", [...] "associated with", etc. Quantifying the amount of <b>labour</b> <b>time</b> associated with commodities requires focus on the social, shifting character of socially necessary labour, and specifically recognition that the quantities are 'current' i.e. incessantly changing. Today's value is different from yesterday's and tomorrow's, and the amount of value can only be determined numerically {{on the basis of a}} given point in time at which values are realized simultaneously at specific prices.Thus Marx's theory is best interpreted as a field theory, but for the reasons just stated, modelling the determination of value by socially necessary <b>labour</b> <b>time</b> mathematically is a difficult exercise if not probably impossible.|$|E

5000|$|Socialists view {{creativity}} as {{an essential}} aspect of human nature, and define freedom as a state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions.
