40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} fetal and neonatal deaths among patients with maternal near miss and the factors associated with this fatal outcome. MethodsThe authors conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, analyzing medical records of patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary obstetric Recife (Brazil), between January 2007 and December 2010, who {{had at least one}} criterion of near miss defined by WHO. Statistical analysis was performed with Epi-Info 3. 3. 2, using chi-square and Fisher's exact test, considering a significance level of 5 %. For multivariate analysis was constructed as a hierarchical model with the response variable fetal and neonatal deaths. ResultsWe included 246 cases of maternal near miss. Among women in the study, hypertensive disorders occurred in 62. 7 % to 41. 2 % in HELLP syndrome and the <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> for near miss in 59. 6 %. There were 48 (19. 5 %) stillbirths and 19 (7. 7 %) neonatal deaths. After analyzing the variables that remained statistically associated with fetal and neonatal deaths were: severe preeclampsia, placental abruption, endometritis, cesarean delivery, prematurity and the <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> for maternal near miss.

40|$|A {{debate on}} {{updating}} the <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was recently opened in view {{to lower the}} risk of over diagnosis of the syndrome. Based on data related to thrombotic APS, it proposes the exclusion of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-beta 2 -glycoprotein 1 (a-beta 2 -GPI) IgM detection. Here, we examine this possibility in a study which focuses on obstetrical APS (OAPS). We report new data on a prospective multicenter European cohort of 109 pregnant women having APS. Among them, 73 had purely obstetrical APS, not associated to autoimmune diseases or thrombosis. Isolated antibodies and isolated aCL positivity were present in 50 / 109 (46 %) and in 34 / 109 (31 %) of the women, respectively. An isolated a-beta 2 -GPI IgM was present in three women. These results suggest that aCL and a-beta 2 -GPI IgM cannot be dropped for the diagnosis and classification of OAPS. The low level of some antibodies associated with severe obstetrical complications raise the issue of keeping or not the same <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> for OAPS and for thrombotic APS and whether additional criteria after large prospective studies could further improve diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective To {{evaluate}} Infecton scintigraphy, with technetium- 99 m-radiolabeled ciprofloxacin, as a {{means to}} detect bone infection, in comparison with other conventional scintigraphic and radiologic methods. Methods Forty—five patients with known or suspected bone infection underwent 50 scans with Infecton. Almost all were also subjected to a three—phase 99 mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan and most of them to a 99 mTc-human polyclonal immunoglobulin scan as well as to a gallium- 67 -citrate scan, plus computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or both. Clinical <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> for the presence of osteomyelitis were based on the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Based on the CDC clinical <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> as well as on conventional scan results, Infecton was characterized in 35 studies as ‘true positive’, in eight as ‘true negative’, in two as ‘false positive’, in one as ‘false negative’, and in four as ‘indeterminate’.

Objectives: A pilot efficacy and tolerability trial of suppressive metronidazole vaginal gel in reducing recurrent symptomatic relapses of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Study design: A prospective open labeled study. Women with recurrent BV were assigned to metronidazole gel 3 times monthly for 24 weeks. The mean episodes of relapses of recurrence of BV after metronidazole suppression was compared to historical mean obtained from the same participants by a paired-sample T test. An exit interview was used to record patient satisfaction. Results: The mean symptomatic relapses of BV was 0. 44 (SD 1. 09).
