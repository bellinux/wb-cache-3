2500|$|Through the 1970s the {{hand-held}} electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot {{of power}} and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and {{there was a great deal}} of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY" [...] calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 (a.k.a. P500), Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic <b>light</b> <b>guide,</b> which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.|$|E

In {{order to reduce the}} space of backlight, the <b>light</b> <b>guiding</b> plate is based on double-side microstructures by using MEMS and hot-embossing technologies. From the experimental results, the minimal illumination is 355 lux and the average illumination is 368. 1 lux, the uniformity of illumination is 0. 08. The novel integrated <b>light</b> <b>guiding</b> plate is achieved a uniformity of distribution, without any optics sheets.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{results of the}} {{technology}} process development for the microstructured fiber <b>light</b> <b>guides.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>guides</b> {{with one or two}} cycles of the openings, processed by two-phase technology were created during carried out research. The use of two cycles makes it possible to decrease attenuation to 0. 5 dB/m on excitation wavelength. The experiments show that effluence efficiency correlates with thickness of depressed cover – the more is thickness of a cover, the less are losses. The basic technology of perforated fiber <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> creation from quartz glass with four cycles of the openings, based on twophase process was developed. Unlike perforated <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> with a single-element core in the developed systems with equal diameters of a core the step of structures is two and three times less. It gives the possibility to receive big resistance of radiation to indignations of a light-guide path. At a problem definition of receiving the microstructured fiber with small value of the relation of an opening diameter of a constructional cover to a step of structure and/or with rather small step of structure single-stage process as in this case in initial assembly it is possible to use capillaries with small size internal diameter. Researches were conducted to search technological conditions for minimum attenuation of a certain type radiation in the microstructured <b>light</b> <b>guides.</b> The main way to receive answers about influence of the technological scheme on radiation attenuation is comparison of one - and two-phase methods of microstructured <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> creation.

40|$|We {{built a new}} {{experiment}} using cold atoms {{interacting with}} the <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> by an optical nanofiber. We first developed a nanofiber manufacturing bench. By heating and stretching a commercial optical fiber, a silica cylinder of 400 nm diameter is obtained. The <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> in these nanofibers is strongly focused over the whole length and exhibits strong evanescent fields. We then prepared a vacuum chamber and the laser system necessary for the manipulation of cold atoms. After inserting a nanofiber amid a cloud of cold atoms, we observed the phenomenon of slow light under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency: the <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> by the fiber is slowed down to a speed 3000 times smaller than its usual speed. We also stored the <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> by an optical fiber. After several microseconds, the information stored as a collective atomic excitation could be retrieved in the fiber. We have shown that this optical memory works for light pulses containing less than one photon on average. This system may therefore {{be used as a}} quantum memory, an essential tool for future quantum communication networks. Finally, we trapped atoms in an array {{in the vicinity of the}} nanofiber thanks to the <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> by the latter. Compared to our first set of experiments, the resulting cloud has a longer lifetime (25 ms) and interacts more strongly with the <b>guided</b> <b>light</b> (OD ~ 100).
