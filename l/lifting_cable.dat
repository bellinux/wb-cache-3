50|$|Operation {{is entirely}} automatic: The {{presence}} {{and number of}} passengers are detected by a system combining electronic balance scales mounted in the cabin floor, and radar in the stations. A computer determines the cabin's departure, indicated with a display board in the cabin. According {{to the amount of}} passenger traffic, it chooses between the two possible operating speeds, 2 m/s or 3.5 m/s. For safety, the platform edge doors open only when a cabin is present, as on the Paris Métro Line 14 and some stations on London's Jubilee line. On 7 December 2006 at 5.50 pm, a cabin crashed down the slope during a brake system test by the RATP. The terminal of the <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> broke.

50|$|Deployment usually starts by {{lowering}} the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, {{through a set of}} sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. Deployment of the bell is by a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads prevent it from rotating on the deployment cable, which would put twist into the umbilical and risk loops or snagging. The clump weight cables therefore act as guidelines or rails along which the bell is lowered to the workplace, and raised back to the platform. If the lifting winch or cable fails, and the bell ballast is released, a positively buoyant bell can float up and the cables will guide it to the surface to a position where it can be recovered relatively easily. The clump weight cable can also be used as an emergency recovery system, in which case both bell and weight are lifted together. An alternative system for preventing rotation on the <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> is the use of a cross-haul system, which may also be used as a means of adjusting the lateral position of the bell at working depth, and as an emergency recovery system.|$|E

50|$|Before Ajax arrived divers {{had already}} dug a tunnel under O-5's bow for Ajax's <b>lifting</b> <b>cables.</b> Ajax arrived around midnight. Drives {{completed}} the cable install under the sub by early morning. Sheppard J. Shreaves was the {{supervisor of the}} salvage crew. Sheppard was a qualified diver, had been working himself all throughout the night helping to dig the tunnel under the submarine. Ajax was hooked to the cables run under the sub and worked to hoist the sub up. But the <b>lift</b> <b>cables</b> broke. Shreaves and his crew installed another cable under the bow. Shreaves and his men had been in their diving suits nearly 24 hours working on the rescue. The next <b>lift</b> the <b>cable</b> broke again. Near midnight on the 29th Ajax did its third lift, this lift worked as the divers has pumped air into the sub's flooded Engine Room. The bow of the O-5 broke the surface. The salvage team opened the torpedo room hatch, and two trapped sailors, Henry Breault and Lawrence T. Brown emerged.|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} instrument {{has been developed}} as a prototype of a portable crane-load contact sensor. Such a sensor could be helpful in an application in which the load rests on a base in a horizontal position determined by vertical alignment pins (see Figure 1). If the crane is not positioned to lift the load precisely vertically, then the load {{can be expected to}} swing once it has been lifted clear of the pins. If the load is especially heavy, large, and/or fragile, it could hurt workers and/or damage itself and nearby objects. By indicating whether the load remains in contact with the pins when it has been lifted a fraction of the length of the pins, the crane-load contact sensor helps the crane operator determine whether it is safe to lift the load clear of the pins: If there is contact, then the load is resting against the sides of the pins and, hence, it may not be safe to lift; if contact is occasionally broken, then the load is probably not resting against the pins, so it should be safe to lift. It is assumed that the load and base, or at least the pins and the surfaces of the alignment holes in the load, are electrically conductive, so the instrument can use electrical contact to indicate mechanical contact. However, DC resistance cannot be used as an indicator of contact for the following reasons: The load and the base are both electrically grounded through cables (the load is grounded through the <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> of the crane) to prevent discharge of static electricity. In other words, the DC resistance between the load and the pins is always low, as though they were always in direct contact. Therefore, instead of DC resistance, the instrument utilizes the AC electrical impedance between the pins and the load. The signal frequency used in the measurement is high enough (. 1 MHz) that the impedance contributed by the cables and the electrical ground network of the building in which the crane and the base are situated is significantly greater than the contact impedance between the pins and the load. The instrument includes a signal generator and voltage-measuring circuitry, and is connected to the load and the base as shown in Figure 2. The output of the signal generator (typically having amplitude of the order of a volt) is applied to the load via a 50 -resistor, and the voltage between the load and the pins is measured. When the load and the pins are not in contact, the impedance between them is relatively high, causing the measured voltage to exceed a threshold value. When the load and the pins are in contact, the impedance between them falls to a much lower value, causing the voltage to fall below the threshold value. The voltage-measuring circuitry turns on a red light-emitting diode (LED) to indicate the lower-voltage/ contact condition. Whenever the contact has been broken and the non-contact/higher-voltage condition has lasted for more than 2 ms, the voltage-measuring circuitry indicates this condition by blinking a green LED...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} measure the storage in the granary, the measuring instrument {{has to be}} in the position high above the top of packed paddy while in operation. Therefore, the measuring instrument needs to set on the platform, using climbing mechanism to carry it up. After the measuring instrument has collected the necessary spatial coordinates of the profile of packed paddy, the storage can be estimated. Since the instrument is expensive and delicate, the climbing mechanism has to carry the instrument more safely and more stably. In the market, the available climbing mechanisms do not fulfill our requirements in regard to lift, mobility and accommodation. Therefore, the first objective of this research is to design a climbing mechanism to meet the requirements for measurement. The measuring instrument with the climbing mechanism we had designed can efficiently collect coordinate data and precisely estimate the volume of packed paddy. The velocity of lifting during carrying measuring instruments may cause some damage to the instrument. This may further lead to incorrect measurement. Therefore, the second objective {{of this study is to}} devise a velocity control strategy for this climbing mechanism. The speed of <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> can be maintained according to the setting speed in lifting operation. Using system identification methodology we had set up the motion model of this climbing mechanism, and then written a graphical program with LabVIEW software to control the lifting velocity. According to the experimental results, applying the lifting speed control strategy with different carrying loads, the system could track the setting speed in an average error of 0. 0014 m/s. The results were quite satisfactory. This also showed the application of system identification on our model set up was appropriate. The system identification approach can be used in modeling a complex system such as our climbing mechanism. 為能夠精確的量測公糧穀堆體積，需將量測儀器裝載在爬升機構，利用爬升機構升降功能搭配量測儀器收集穀堆外觀之空間座標點，進而換算體積完成公糧體積監控。升降設備須仰賴爬升機構，量測儀器大多貴重，爬升機構的穩定性與結構安全在量測穀堆時是相當重要。在市面上的升降機構高度、機動性、便利性，皆不符目前穀堆量測之需求，因此本研究設計一爬升機構符合量測時所需之條件，以利完成準確座標數據之收集，進而精密估算公糧穀堆之體積。 貴重的量測儀器安裝於升降機構上，在爬升運送過程中鋼索收捲時會產生升降速度不一致，導致量測儀器容易毀損與數據採集不準確的情形發生。因此本研究設計一控制策略，使鋼索收捲時能依目標速度做升降之動作。利用系統識別推估此爬升機構之運動模型，進而利用LabVIEW圖控軟體撰寫控制程式，以完成本研究。 此機構在速度控制策略下，裝載不同之負載，都能追逐著所設定之目標速度，平均速度誤差為 0. 0014 。應用系統識別推估其模型所得之結果是相當符合預期，此方法有助於複雜系統之模型推估。摘要 [...] .

50|$|The <b>cable</b> <b>lift</b> {{utilizes}} a <b>cable</b> loop {{in place}} of the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains chain dog.

5000|$|Riders {{first step}} onto a scissor lift, {{where they are}} raised into the loading position. Operators then hook the riders onto a cable that brings the riders {{to the top of}} the tower and a cable that holds the riders during the free-fall. Once the riders are {{securely}} attached to the cable and the operators say it is safe to operate, the scissor lift is brought down and the riders are pulled {{to the top of the}} tower. Once the riders reach the top, they must wait until the operator at the bottom says to [...] "pull the cord". The operator will usually say [...] "tower one / two: 3, 2, 1, fly." [...] At this point, the rider at the far right (unless there is a single rider) must pull the cord releasing them from the <b>lift</b> <b>cable.</b> During the first drop, riders experience about 3 to 4 seconds of free-falling. After about 10 swings, an operator will <b>lift</b> a hydraulic <b>cable</b> with a loop at the top which then a rider will have to grab and hold on to. After grabbing the cable, the riders will come to a stop just above the scissor lift. The next riders will step onto the lift where the previous riders will be unloaded and they will be attached to the <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> where the cycle begins again. One cycle can last anywhere between 3 and 5 minutes.|$|R
