5|$|Zinc {{white is}} used as a pigment in paints and is more opaque than <b>lithopone,</b> but less opaque than {{titanium}} dioxide. It is also used in coatings for paper. Chinese white is a special grade of zinc white used in artists' pigments. The use of zinc white (zinc oxide) as a pigment in oil painting started in the middle of 18th century. It has partly replaced the poisonous lead white and was used by painters such as Böcklin, Van Gogh, Manet, Munch and others. It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup (CI 77947).|$|E
500|$|Barium sulfate {{has a low}} {{toxicity}} and relatively high density of ca. 4.5 g·cm−3 (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it {{is used as a}} radiocontrast agent in X-ray imaging of the digestive system ("barium meals" [...] and [...] "barium enemas"). <b>Lithopone,</b> a pigment that contains barium sulfate and zinc sulfide, is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lithopone</b> is {{not highly}} poisonous, {{reflecting}} the insolubility of the components. Barium sulfate is used widely in medicine as a radiocontrast agent. <b>Lithopone</b> {{is allowed to}} be in contact with foodstuffs in the US and Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lithopone</b> und Permanentweißfabrik Schöningen AG ("The Schöningen <b>Lithopone</b> and Permanent White Manufactory Corporation") {{was founded}} in 1878 for the {{production}} of a new white paint base on a zinc sulfide/barium sulfate basis. The fledgling company achieved success against competing products only after numerous technical and chemical problems had been overcome, a process in which the young chemist, Rudolf Sachtleben, played a decisive role. <b>Lithopone,</b> the world's first genuinely durable white paint base, then quickly began to replace the toxic white lead previously used.|$|E
50|$|Zinc sulfide is {{a common}} pigment, {{sometimes}} called sachtolith. When combined with barium sulfate, zinc sulfide forms <b>lithopone.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lithopone</b> is {{produced}} by coprecipitation of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide. Most commonly coprecipitation is effected by combining equimolar amounts of zinc sulfate and barium sulfide: ...|$|E
50|$|Rudolf Sachtleben {{took over}} {{management}} of the company in 1883, becoming a partner in Sachtleben & Co. <b>Lithopone</b> Fabrik ("Sachtleben & Co. <b>Lithopone</b> Manufactory"), in Schöningen. The success of the new product, coupled with low-cost recovery of zinc by means of chlorinating roasting of iron pyrites from Meggen, in Germany's hilly Sauerland region, {{paved the way for}} rapid expansion. Sachtleben & Co. <b>Lithopone</b> Fabrik thus relocated to Duisburg in 1892, since the Rhine and the nearby Ruhr industrial region even then offered optimum locational conditions in terms of labor, transportation, and supplies of energy and water. By 1906, production had multiplied sixfold, and a second production plant had been constructed. Sachtleben, its workforce and its facilities also suffered from the effects of inflation and the global economic crises during the First World War, the immediate post-war period and the subsequent occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian troops in 1923.|$|E
50|$|Pigments: {{the common}} colors of road lines are yellow and white. White {{pigments}} are mainly titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and <b>lithopone,</b> while yellow pigment is mainly heat-resistant yellow lead.|$|E
5000|$|The hydrates, {{especially}} the heptahydrate, {{are the primary}} forms used commercially. The main application is as a coagulant {{in the production of}} rayon. It is also a precursor to the pigment <b>lithopone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Henrik Johannes Krebs (June 27, 1847 October 7, 1929), {{sometimes}} called Henry J. Krebs, was an American immigrant from Denmark {{who started the}} Krebs Pigments and Chemical Company to manufacture the pigment <b>lithopone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sachtleben Aktiengesellschaft für Bergbau und chemische Industrie ("Sachtleben Joint Stock Mining and Chemicals Corporation") was {{nonetheless}} founded in 1926, with a {{paid up capital}} stock of twelve million marks and registered offices in Cologne. Production of <b>Lithopone</b> grew significantly up to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, while new technologies helped to greatly expand the range of products. <b>Lithopone</b> was needed in Germany during the Second World War both for civil applications and for camouflage paints. Production ground to a halt following severe air-raids in 1944, however, and could be restarted only in 1946, after the repair of war-related damage. The superiority of the properties of titanium dioxide over those of <b>Lithopone</b> in many applications became apparent as early as the mid-1950s. For this reason, Sachtleben and DuPont de Nemours, of Wilmington, Delaware, USA, started a joint venture, Pigment Chemie GmbH, in 1959. Planning and construction of a titanium dioxide and a sulfuric acid plant started in 1960. Sachtleben subsequently began producing titanium dioxide using the sulfate-route process in Duisburg in 1962; annual production of titanium dioxide reached 18,000 tonnes the following year, and is now around 100,000 tonnes each at the Duisburg and Krefeld locations, plus some 130,000 tonnes at Pori, in Finland.|$|E
5000|$|Barium sulfide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula BaS. BaS {{is an important}} precursor to other barium compounds including BaCO3 and the pigment <b>lithopone,</b> ZnS/BaSO4. Like other chalcogenides of the alkaline earth metals, BaS is a short wavelength emitter for electronic displays. [...] It is colorless, although like many sulfides, it is commonly obtained in impure colored forms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lithopone,</b> C.I. Pigment White 5, is {{a mixture}} of {{inorganic}} compounds, widely used as a white pigment powder. It is composed of a mixture of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide. These insoluble compounds blend well with organic compounds and confer opacity. It was made popular by the cheap production costs, greater coverage. Related white pigments include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide ("zinc white"), and zinc sulfide.|$|E
5000|$|The Thermoplastic marking coating sets quickly. The melt {{adhesion}} of {{a synthetic}} resin makes hot-melt paint adhere strongly {{to the road}} surface. [...] in the coating paint increases the coating plasticity, improving the anti-settling, anti-pollution, anti-tarnish. Thermoplastic marking paint is most commonly produced in yellow and white. The white marking paint mainly contains titanium white, zinc oxide, <b>lithopone,</b> while the yellow paint is mainly heat-yellowing lead.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lithopone</b> was {{discovered}} in the 1870s by DuPont. It was manufactured by Krebs Pigments and Chemical Company and other companies. The material came in different [...] "seals", which varied {{in the content of}} zinc sulfide. Gold seal and Bronze seals contain 40-50% zinc sulfide, offering more hiding power and strength. Although its popularity peaked around 1920, approximately 223,352 tons were produced in 1990. It is mainly used in paints, putty, and in plastics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of synthetic barium sulfate {{is used as}} a component of white pigment for paints. In oil paint, barium sulfate is almost transparent, and {{is used as a}} filler or to modify consistency. One major manufacturer of artists' oil paint sells [...] "permanent white" [...] that contains a mixture of titanium white pigment (TiO2) and barium sulfate. The combination of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide (ZnS) is the inorganic pigment called <b>lithopone.</b> In photography it is used as a coating for certain photographic papers.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{before the}} First World War National Lead Company in US told its {{stockholders}} it now took special care of it's workers. Only men were employed no women or children, free laundry was provided and respirators. Shower baths were provided and the workmen {{were encouraged to}} wash before eating. It became generally recognised [...] "lead has no business in the human body". Zinc oxides began {{to be used for}} white paints. Many countries banned the use of lead paints inside buildings. By the early 1930s <b>lithopone</b> titanium and zinc oxides were being marketed as non-poisonous.|$|E
30|$|The Zn/Ba correlation, in {{the four}} black labeled paints (Fig.  6 b), {{suggests}} the association of zinc and barium either as a mixture or as <b>lithopone</b> (co-precipitate of BaSO 4 and ZnS). Until 1945, <b>lithopone</b> was a strong competitor for the still developing titanium white pigments in the United States [5]. While the present data cannot differentiate between a mixture of zinc white and barium sulfate or the pigment <b>lithopone,</b> XRD of another sample from a different van Bohemen painting from 1966 indicates the presence of <b>lithopone,</b> placing the pigment on the artist’s pallet. Interestingly, investigating a subset, not necessarily requiring PCA, provides information about a paint composition (ZnO[*]+[*]BaSO 4 or <b>lithopone)</b> not noticeable in the full dataset (Fig.  4). This highlights the possible benefit of doing further investigation of the data in the future.|$|E
30|$|While both zinc and barium {{are both}} present in white paint layers, the barium exists as large {{discrete}} particles {{and not as}} an intimate co-precipitate with the zinc, {{as would be expected}} for the presence of <b>lithopone,</b> which is ZnS co-precipitated with BaSO 4 rather than ZnO. Furthermore, the Raman spectra collected in the white paint layers do not show evidence of <b>lithopone</b> peaks. Barium white has Raman bands at 453, 461, 616, 647, and 988  cm− 1. Zinc white has Raman bands at 331, 383, and 438  cm− 1. <b>Lithopone</b> has bands at 216, 276, and 342  cm− 1 that were not observed in the white paint spectra. As a result, both from a morphological and spectroscopic perspective, <b>lithopone</b> is not present in the white paints of The Blue Room.|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{have found}} that Tibetan artists used not only {{traditional}} mineral pigments but also many artificially synthetic pigments, i.e. Ultramarine blue, emerald green, chrome yellow and <b>lithopone.</b>|$|E
30|$|One yellow pigment (Sample DZ 5) {{yielded the}} {{spectrum}} of chrome yellow (PbCrO 4) (Figure 2 C), yet coexisting with bands of <b>lithopone.</b> Another yellow pigment (DZ 13) found here was orpiment (As 2 S 3) (Figure 2 D).|$|E
30|$|The white {{ground layer}} yielded the {{characteristic}} Raman bands of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), which {{was found in}} every sample except DZ 12, DZ 13, DZ 14. Magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3) was detected in DZ 2, DZ 3, DZ 8, DZ 15. Meanwhile, <b>lithopone</b> (ZnS and BaSO 4) appeared in DZ 5.|$|E
30|$|In this project, fifteen pigment {{samples taken}} from the wall {{painting}} on the pilgrimage-corridor at the Jokhang Monastery in Tibet were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, XRF, PLM, and SEM-EDS. The results show that azurite, malachite, red lead, cinnabar, mars red, orpiment, gold, calcite, magnesium carbonate, barium white, especially modern synthetic Ultramarine blue, emerald green, chrome yellow and <b>lithopone</b> were applied as single or mixture pigments.|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} dating, using comparative analytical techniques, of an icon {{which is}} neither dated nor signed was undertaken. This icon is not attributed to any known painter; therefore one should {{rely on the}} pigment palette applied for dating. The icon under study is located in Saint Abanoub church in Samanoud, in Egyptian Delta, representing the equestrian Saint George fighting a dragon. The analytical instruments chosen for this study were; optical microscopy, Raman microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Optical microscopy was used to study the layered structure of the icon which comprised a wooden panel, an imprimatura layer underneath some paint areas, multiple paint layers and a varnish layer. The absence of both the canvas and the white ground layer was apparent. The pigment palette was determined by means of Raman microscopy and the identified pigments were Prussian blue, ultramarine blue, vermilion, chrome yellow, lead white, <b>lithopone</b> and carbon black. These pigments were used solely or combined in complex mixtures to reveal the desired paint shades. The FTIR {{was used to determine}} the protected varnish layer as well as the paint medium applied. The identification of chrome yellow and <b>lithopone</b> was the keynote in dating this icon...|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} the techniques and materials of thirteenth century Byzantine Cypriot wall {{paintings in the}} Church of the Transfiguration at Sotera. The analysis of the paintings based on materials characterization techniques follows a multi-scale and multi-analytical approach combining non-invasive and non-destructive techniques including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS), scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectromicroscopy (μRS). Results have indicated the use of local inorganic mineral pigments applied in a multilayered structure following conventions of Byzantine traditions. Findings include chromium-bearing compounds, as well as <b>lithopone</b> and lead-containing pigments, applied in post-Byzantine painting programs...|$|E
30|$|Lead {{chromate}} {{was first}} synthesized by French Chemist Vauquelin in 1809. Germany began the industrial production of chrome yellow in 1818, America in 1900 and China in 1924 [9]. Chrome yellow {{began to be}} widely used as a pigment in watercolors, coach paintings and oil paintings {{in the second quarter}} of the 19 th century [10]. <b>Lithopone</b> was invented in early 19 th century [11] and gained popularity in the 1870 s [12]. Emerald green, which was first formulated in Germany in 1814 as stated by the famous Chinese Artist Fei'an Yu, was widely used in China as watercolor in pith paper works and in scroll paintings from the 1850 s onwards [13].|$|E
30|$|Knowledge about {{pigments}} {{applied in}} ancient wall paintings {{is of great}} importance in art conservation and art history. In this study, fifteen pigment samples from the wall painting on the pilgrimage-corridor at the Jokhang Monastery in Lhasa, Tibet were analyzed, using different techniques, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman microspectroscopy (Raman), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS). It is found that azurite, malachite, red lead, cinnabar, mars red, orpiment, gold, calcite, magnesium carbonate, barium white, especially modern synthetic Ultramarine blue, emerald green, chrome yellow and <b>lithopone</b> were used as colorants on plaster. This result suggests that the wall painting may have been executed after the 1850 s, mostly in about the 1900 s.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine quantitatively the effect of pigmentation on the film properties of ethocel lacquer. This study was confined to the determination of tensile strength, percentage elongation at failure, softening and melting points of the films. Pigments were ground in the ethocel lacquer containing three parts ethocel, one part 276 V- 9 Dow resin and sixteen parts solvent by weight. Softening and melting points of the films were determined and were found to increase uniformly with increasing amounts of the pigments. The tensile strength of ethocel film with titanium dioxide as a pigment increased from 317 Kgm/Cm 2 to 425 Kgm/Cm 2 by adding 2 percent followed by a decrease. Similar but less marked results were observed with <b>lithopone,</b> barytes and dicalite...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} collect field data of rotary kilns for {{detailed}} analysis before {{automatic control system}} were designed and implemented, a simple data acquisition software for serial devices {{on the basis of}} Excel VBA was introduced in this paper. The serial communication module was coded with MSComm control. Data were presented both in tables and curves by the charting tools of Excel. A modified 53 H algorithm was presented for online abnormal value detection while several data filtering functions were provided. Organized workbooks and worksheets were used as storage structures rather than a database system. Its application in a <b>Lithopone</b> rotary kiln proved its effectiveness in data acquisition, storage, query and preprocessing. This kind of simple data acquisition software has advantages in economical efficiency and simplicity, and is suitable for data acquisition applications with low sampling rates...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose an {{integrated}} approach, based on synchrotron analysis with micrometric spatial resolution and sub-ppm sensitivity and m-Raman mapping, for investigating impurities and heterogeneous inclusions in historical samples of Zn-based white pigments. Analysis was {{performed at the}} LUCIA beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility for the simultaneous detection of the elemental distribution in suitably prepared pigment samples using micro-X-ray fluorescence (m-XRF) mapping and for the investigation of oxidation states and coordination of metals using micro-X-ray near edge absorption (m-XANES) spectroscopy. The identification of specific molecular signatures and the detection of their spatial distribution throughout samples by m-Raman measurements supported and complemented X-ray analysis, allowing the identification of Cr- and Fe-based inclusions in historical samples. In ZnO pigments, common impurities are due to the production process and include Fe and, depending on samples, Cd, Cl and Pb. In one of the Zn-containing pigments, identified as <b>Lithopone,</b> m-XRF mapping revealed the presence of Co, both as highly concentrated micrometric inclusions and as impurities throughout the pigment...|$|E
