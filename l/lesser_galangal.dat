5000|$|K. galanga is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} galangals {{by the absence}} of stem and dark brown, rounded rhizomes, while the other varieties all have stems and pale rosebrown rhizomes. It is also sometimes called <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> which properly refers to Alpinia officinarum.|$|E
50|$|Boesenbergia rotunda, {{commonly}} known as Chinese keys, fingerroot, <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal</b> or Chinese ginger, is a medicinal and culinary herb from China and Southeast Asia. In English, the root has traditionally been called fingerroot, because {{the shape of the}} rhizome resembles that of fingers growing out of a center piece.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the Pa Then grew rice, maize, cassava, sesame, cassava, taro, lettuce, calabash, luffa, colocynth, sweet gourd, beans, and Chinese peas as food crops. The Pa Then also planted various spices such as basil, shallot, spring onion, garlic, ginger, crocus, red pepper, <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> citronella, eryngium, perilla, and marjoram. Sugarcane {{was also}} planted {{as well as}} fruit trees such as tangerine, guava, banana, grapefruit, lychee, longan, jackfruit, orange, and papaya.|$|E
50|$|Alpinia officinarum, {{known as}} <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> is {{a plant in}} the ginger family, {{cultivated}} in Southeast Asia. It originated in China, where its name ultimately derives. It can grow several feet high, with long leaves and reddish-white flowers. The rhizomes, known as galangal, are valued for their sweet spicy flavor and aromatic scent. These are used throughout Asia in curries and perfumes, and were previously used widely in Europe. They are also used as an herbal remedy.|$|E
5000|$|Two of the {{favorite}} satay in Bali are sate lilit, and sate ikan (fish satay). Although there are fish sate lilit made with minced fish, sate ikan is using chunk of fish meat instead. The authentic Balinese sate lilit and sate ikan {{are rich in}} bumbu, a mixture of spices and herbs. In Bali, almost every dish is flavored with bumbu megenep — a mix of spices and herbs ranging from lime leaves, to coconut milk, garlic, shallots, blue galangal, coriander, <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> turmeric and chili pepper.|$|E
50|$|This {{herbaceous}} plant can {{grow up to}} ten feet in height, though three to five feet is more common. The leaves are lanceolate (long and thin), and the flowers are white with streaks of red, growing from a spike at the top. The plant's rhizomes, the part known as galangal, are thin and tough, {{and they are the}} principal reason the plant is cultivated. They have orange flesh with a brown coating, and have an aromatic odor and a sweet flavor. These are smaller than greater galangal which have a stronger peppery pine-like bite that is lacking in the sweeter rhizomes of <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kroeung (គ្រឿង, [...] ) is {{the generic}} Cambodian {{word for a}} number of spice/herb pastes that make up the base flavors of many Khmer dishes. Such dishes are often dubbed with the [...] "-kroeung" [...] suffix. Kroeung is {{traditionally}} made by finely chopping the ingredients and grinding them together using a heavy mortar and pestle although mechanical food processors can be used in modern kitchens. The resulting paste is similar in form and function to Thai curry pastes. Various ingredients, depending on the dish and the taste of the cook, can be pounded into kroeung. The eight most commonly used are Lemon grass, Magrut lime zest and leaves, Galangal, Turmeric, Garlic, Shallots, Dried Red Chillies and various Rhizomes (<b>Lesser</b> <b>Galangal,</b> Boesenbergia rotunda (ខ្ជាយ), Kaempferia galanga, etc.).This herbal paste is essential for preparing Khmer dishes in order to create the authentic flavour.|$|E

The medicinal plants from India provide a diverse source for health care moieties in order to prevent different pathological states. Alpinia officinarum, known as <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> is a world-renowned botanical, which has been used since ages because of its rich medicinal diversity. Alpinia officinarum, a plant from ginger family, originated in China and cultivated in Southeast Asia. The plant grows several feet high, with long leaves and reddish-white flowers alongwith spicy and aromatic rhizomes. Numerous studies reported Alpinia officinarum to possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer, chemoprotective, antibacterial, antifungal and diuretic properties associated with Phyllanthus amarus. The present review articles critically abridges about various phytochemicals associated with the plant alongwith numerous pleiotropic properties exhibited by the plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{effects of}} a range of plant extracts and oils were studied in a series of in vitro experiments against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolated from black pepper (Piper nigrum L.). Spore germination of the fungus was completely inhibited by cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume.) oils as well as by water or ethanol extracts from galangal (Alpinia galanga L. Willd.) rhizomes and cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum Maton.) leaves. Ethanol extracts were more efficient in inhibiting spore germination than water extracts. Phytotoxicity symptoms were not observed or were minimal on pepper leaves and berries or red pepper fruits when treated with cardamom extract and galangal extract and a group of oils of cardamom, Eucalyptus, <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> lemon grass, lemon myrtle, neem, pepper black and tea-tree, but were pronounced with cinnamon oils. Cardamon oil was non toxic, but was required in higher concentrations to completely inhibit germination...|$|E
40|$|Since long times, human employs {{medicinal}} plants to treat illnesses, using frequently oily or aqueous preparations. Such uses {{are one of}} the most important principles of green chemistry which called „green solvents‟. Within the context of clean and green pharmaceutical industry, ethnopharmacological preparations must to be investigated to reduce toxicity of chemicals and solvents. „Dawilou ‟ is an ancient preparation used in Constantine as an Algerian Traditional Medicine (ATM); it is an aqueous herbal mixture of four spices: <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal</b> rhizome, ginger rhizome, cinnamon bark and clove buds. It is used to prevent or treat cold disease and to give some energy to workers in ancient times. The decoction was studied for its qualitative chemical composition using phytochemical screening; it was found that the extract is rich in chemical constituents: phenolics, terpenoids and alkaloids. Biological activity of „Dawilou ‟ against clinical isolated bacteria was investigated also and found to have moderate activity in vitro because of bacterial nature. So, the in vivo study is necessary to complete the study and evaluate immunostimulating activity of the extract which is empirically proved...|$|E
40|$|Three {{samples of}} {{fermented}} bamboo shoot {{taken from a}} village in Amphur Kokpho, Pattani Province, were microbiologically examined. Total viable count was between at 104 - 105 cfu/ml while pH range was between 3. 4 - 4. 4. Isolation and identification of film yeast on surface of fermented liquid revealed Saccharomyces cerevisiae J 1, Candida krusei J 2 and Candida krusei J 3. When film yeast was cultivated in liquid culture with different NaCl concentrations (0, 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 % (w/v)), all species tolerated 2. 5 % NaCl addition. However, growth decreased depending on NaCl concentration. S. cerevisiae J 1 grew faster than C. krusei J 2 and C. krusei J 3. The cultivation of film yeast in medium with different agar concentrations (0. 3, 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 % (w/v)) within 24 h showed that 0. 3 % was the optimal agar concentration. Seasoning plants (garlic, ginger, galangal, lemon grass, <b>lesser</b> <b>galangal,</b> clove, kaffir lime, garcinia and shallot) were extracted with water (3 % (w/v)) and tested for growth inhibition. Results showed the clove extract inhibited all yeast strains within 12 h and after that the efficiency of inhibition was decreased. At low concentration of 0. 75 % (w/v) clove extract could inhibit film yeast in fermented bamboo shoot...|$|E
