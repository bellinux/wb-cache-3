5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing <b>losers</b> <b>in</b> general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{responded with}} a career-high 33 points in 2006–07. He notched a personal-best three assists in one game {{late in the season}} in a 3–2 win against the Los Angeles Kings on 27 March 2007. San Jose were once again <b>losers</b> <b>in</b> {{the second round of the}} playoffs, being {{eliminated}} by the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Ehrhoff had two assists in 11 post-season games. His regular season production decreased to 22 points in the 2007–08 season. On 28 December 2007, Ehrhoff was awarded a penalty shot during a game against the St. Louis Blues; he missed against Manny Legace, though the Sharks nonetheless still won, 1–0. Later in the season, Ehrhoff missed four games due to a lower body injury, suffered on 6 April 2008. After finishing as the second seed in the West, San Jose were defeated in the second round against the Dallas Stars. Ehrhoff notched five assists in ten playoff games.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{nations were}} {{entered in the}} tandem competition, {{and in the first}} round, they were drawn with Germany and South Africa, who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom Shardelow and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The Australians made their move too early and led at the ringing of the bell {{at the start of the}} last lap, but they were {{overhauled}} well before the line as they faded in the final straight. Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day. The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance, but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish. This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated, however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle, resulting in a heavy pile-up. Neither teams finished the race, but the Soviets were hospitalised. The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the <b>losers</b> <b>in</b> the previous repechages to qualify. This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve.|$|E

25|$|That same year, Roth {{published}} his first young adult novel, Never Mind the Goldbergs, through Scholastic's PUSH imprint. While {{the book was}} written in six months, it took two years to edit, and Roth encountered difficulty finding a publisher for the book due to its unusual tone and subject matter. Upon release, the book garnered mixed reception but received the American Library Association Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults award and the New York Public Library Best Book for the Teen Age award. A release party was held on January 20, 2005 at La Tazza 108 in Philadelphia with musical performances by Juez and E.D. Sedgwick. Roth subsequently published two more young adult novels, Candy in Action in 2007 and <b>Losers</b> <b>in</b> 2008, on PUSH and Soft Skull Press, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and <b>Losers</b> <b>in</b> a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal {{won over}} most of the minor Oscan-speaking socii of {{southern}} Italy: Bruttii and Lucani, as well as the minority of the Greek city-states. The adherence of much of southern Italy gave Hannibal a relatively stable power-base that sustained his military presence in Italy for 13 years after Cannae. The Samnites, Bruttii and Lucani were, as demonstrated above, the biggest <b>losers</b> <b>in</b> Rome's territorial expansion. Of the Greek cities of the Ionian Sea, Tarentum would certainly have defected immediately after Cannae if it hadn't been under the control of a Roman garrison, placed there in 218 BC to prevent precisely such an event. The Tarentines eventually succeeded in allowing in Hannibal's army in 212, although the Romans continued to hold the citadel, which reduced the value of the gain for Hannibal. Thurii, Heraclea, Metapontum, Locri and Croton did defect after Cannae. But even in the South, defections to Hannibal were by no means universal. Apart from the Arpini in the north of Apulia, the rest of the Apulians and the Messapii mostly remained loyal to Rome, as they had done during the Pyrrhic invasion and for the same reason: fear of Tarentine expansionism. The Greek cities on the Tyrrhenian Sea — Rhegium and Neapolis — also refused to defect and remained staunchly loyal to Rome after Cannae. The Neapolitans had an intense rivalry with the Campanians, while the Rhegians had long struggled for survival against Hannibal's Bruttian allies. Also, for both cities, Tarentine hegemony was anathema. Neapolis was the main seaport of Campania, which in turn was the principal theatre of war. Rhegium controlled one shore of the Strait of Messina and thus hindered Hannibal's communications with Carthaginian forces in Sicily. For these reasons, Hannibal's failure to take these two strategic ports greatly complicated the reinforcement and resupply of his army from Africa. Finally, all four of the major Samnite tribes, ,, refused to join their minor compatriots' revolt.|$|E
