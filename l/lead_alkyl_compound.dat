40|$|A {{systematic}} and comprehensive semiempirical, Hartree-Fock (HF) ab initio, and B 3 LYP density functional theory (DFT) {{study was conducted}} on the relative thermodynamic properties of various linear and branched perfluorinated and perhydrogenated <b>alkyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> The semiempirical AM 1, PM 3, and PM 6 methods all consistently and accurately predict that branched <b>alkyl</b> <b>compounds</b> will generally be more thermodynamically stable than their linear counterparts. In contrast, HF and B 3 LYP calculations with the 6 - 31 G(d,p), 6 - 31 ++G(d,p), and 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basis sets predict that linear isomers will be more stable than branched analogs. These different linear versus branched perfluoroalkyl/perhydroalkyl thermodynamic property trends between semiempirical and ab initio/DFT methods were evident in both gas and aqueous phase calculations. Comparison of experimentally determined thermodynamic properties for several classes of linear and branched alkanes and alcohols with values calculated at the PM 6 and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) levels of theory supported the well known findings that such DFT and HF approaches incorrectly predict branched <b>alkyl</b> <b>compounds</b> will be less thermodynamically stable than linear isomers. Calculations at the MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) //B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) and M 05 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) levels of theory on a representative subset of the linear and branched perfluorinated compounds supported the thermodynamic conclusions from the PM 6 method. Strong agreement between PM 6 estimated thermodynamic properties and available experimental data supports use of this computational method for accurately calculating the well established higher thermodynamic stability of branched <b>alkyl</b> <b>compounds.</b> Branched perfluoroalkyl compounds are thus expected to be more thermodynamically stable than their linear analogs...|$|R

A fully automated system for performing the analysis is described. This system enables cost-efficient application of the analysis to a large number of samples, such as may be obtained when mapping out a site. Principal component analysis of the data obtained from a set of highly evaporated fuels is shown to yield distinct clusters for each fuel, regardless of the degree of evaporation, when the multielement data is included in the analysis. specific detectors whenever possible (4).

The petrochemical industry uses benzene as a raw ma-terial for styrene, alkyl benzene, and caprolactam. Moreover, aromatic compounds are added to gas-oline {{as a substitute for}} <b>alkyl</b> <b>lead</b> <b>compounds.</b> Al-though atmospheric lead pollution is reduced, the concentration of benzene released into the air is increased. Because benzene is widely used in indus-try, exposure of workers to benzene is a health concern that deserves attention. 1, 2 During the late 19 th century, it was found that continuous exposure to benzene can lead to aplastic anemia and leukemia. There were also cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia reported during this period. 3 This association brought attention to the toxicity of benzene to the bone marrow. Additional studies in Italy and Turkey showed that the stan-dardized mortality ratio of leukemia among work-ers exposed to benzene is higher than that of non-exposed civilians. 4 The threshold limit values for benzene have become more stringent. Threshold limit values refer to airborne concentrations of sub-stances and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be exposed on a daily basis without adverse health effects. The Department of Occupational Disease in Tri-Service General Hospital was established in 1994. Its goal is “to find and identify patients with occupational diseases, and to perform research in occupational medicine. ” The patient prompting this case report came to our hospital with benzene-induced myelodysplastic syndrome in 1996.
