An experimental loop is designed and built with a single heat <b>transfer</b> <b>element</b> to analyze the heat transfer and flow characteristics. In this research, the influence of the size of a three-layer thimble-type heat <b>transfer</b> <b>element</b> on the heat transfer rate is analyzed. Two methods are used to obtain the heat transfer rate, and a difference of results between methods is approximately 5 %. The gas gap width between the thimble and the bayonet has a large effect on the heat transfer rate. As the gas gap width increases from 1. 0  mm to 11. 0  mm, the heat transfer rate decreases from 5. 2  kW to 1. 6  kW. In addition, a natural circulation startup process is described in this paper. Finally, flashing natural circulation instability has been observed in this thimble-type heat <b>transfer</b> <b>element...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we linearize a convection-diffusion model inspired from wave-models, in the case of vanishing diffusion. We obtain a <b>linear</b> <b>transfer</b> model which is explicitly parameterized with the usual column's operating parameters. This model consists in gains and pure delays only. It is derived from an unusual asymptotic expansion (Laurent series with exponentially precise terms) versus the diffusion coefficient.

40|$|Investigations of antibiotic-resistance gene <b>transfer</b> <b>elements</b> in Bacteroides {{species have}} {{generated}} some {{new insights into}} how bacteria transfer resistance genes and what environmental conditions foster gene transfer. Integrated gene <b>transfer</b> <b>elements,</b> called conjugative transposons, appear {{to be responsible for}} much of the transfer of resistance genes among Bacteroides species. Conjugative transposons not only transfer themselves but also mobilize coresident plasmids and excise and mobilize unlinked integrated elements. Less is known about resistance gene <b>transfer</b> <b>elements</b> of the gram-positive anaerobes, but there are some indications that similar elements may be found in them as well. An unusual feature of the Bacteroides conjugative transposons is that transfer of many of them is stimulated considerably by low concentrations of antibiotics. Thus, antibiotics not only select for resistant strains but also can stimulate transfer of the resistance gene in the first place. This finding raises questions about whether use of low-dose tetracycline therapy may have a greater effect on the resident microftora than had been previously thought. Finally, investigations of resis-tance genes in Bacteroides species and other genera of bacteria have begun to provide evidence that the resident microftora of the human body does indeed act as a reservoir for resistance genes, which may be acquired from and passed on to transient colonizers of the site...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} system identification techniques and robust control strategies to a pneumatic muscle actuator system. Due to the inherent nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of this system, {{it is difficult to}} achieve excellent performance using conventional control methods. Therefore, we apply identification techniques to model the system as <b>linear</b> <b>transfer</b> functions and regard the un-modeled dynamics as system uncertainties. Because robust control is well-known for its capability in dealing with system uncertainties, we then apply robust control strategies to guarantee system stability and performance for the system. This work is carried out in three parts. First, the pneumatic muscle actuator system was modeled as <b>linear</b> <b>transfer</b> functions. Second, robust control theorem were utilized to design a H robust controller to deal with system uncertainties and performance requirements. Finally, the designed controller was implemented for experimental verifications and compared with a conventional PID controller.
