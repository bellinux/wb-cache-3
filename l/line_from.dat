40|$|Gamma-ray <b>line</b> {{emission}} <b>from</b> the Sun {{results from}} the nuclear interactions of energetic protons and nuclei with the solar atmosphere. These interactions produce gamma-ray <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> neutron capture, positron annihilation, and nuclear deexcitation. Observation of such gamma-rays can provide unique information on high energy processes at the Sun. Details of solar gamma-ray spectroscopy are discussed along with the galactic center 0. 511 MeV line. The richness of astronomy at 0. 511 MeV is indicated by the great variety of astrophysical positron production mechanisms and by the many astrophysical sites where such mechanisms could operate. Attention is also given to <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> gamma-ray transients, and the prospects for gamma-ray line detections, taking into account gamma-ray <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> processes of nucleosynthesis and <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> low-energy cosmic ray interactions...|$|R
40|$|Models for stellar nucleosynthesis, age {{determinations}} for {{stars in}} the Milky Way 2 ̆ 7 s galactic halo, and stellar chemical abundance determinations are dependent upon accurate atomic spectroscopic data to allow the correct interpretation of stellar absorption and emission spectra. It {{is well known that}} calculations of many astrophysically important atomic parameters are limited due to line blending, insufficient spectral resolution of some key spectral lines, and also the complicated electronic structure of the important heavy elements. Astrophysicists have therefore looked to laboratory astrophysics experiments to provide accurate atomic data to help resolve these limiting issues. In this dissertation, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been employed {{for the first time on}} a large scale as a spectroscopic technique for the rapid and convenient production of atomic and ionic plasmas as sources of atomic emission in order to determine radiative properties in astrophysically relevant lanthanides (Gd, Nd, Pr and Sm) and transition metals (Cu and Fe). Nanosecond laser pulses incident on pure elemental targets in a rarified argon environment were used to create high-temperature plasmas. The resulting spontaneous emission from the high-temperature micro-plasmas was dispersed in a spectrally-corrected high-resolution broadband Échelle spectrometer, and detected with a high-sensitivity intensified CCD camera which allowed the simultaneous determination of the relative intensities of thousands of decay branches from hundreds of excited energy levels and multiple ionization states. These experimentally measured relative emission intensities were combined with previously obtained atomic lifetimes to calculate transition probabiliites and oscillator strengths. In two transition metals, emission intensities have been measured for 192 transitions from 108 excited states in neutral copper and 27 emission <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 108 excited states in singly-ionized copper as well as 776 emission <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 108 excited states in neutral iron and 1453 emission <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 108 excited states in singly-ionized iron. In four important lanthanide elements, emission intensities have been measured for 587 lines of 113 excited states in neutral gadolinium, 480 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 43 excited states of singly-ionized gadolinium, and 40 lines in 6 states of doubly-ionized gadolinium; 121 emission <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 93 excited states in neutral neodymium, 368 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 46 excited states in singly-ionized neodymium, and two <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> a single excited level of doubly-ionized neodymium; 19 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 19 excited levels of neutral praseodymium, 367 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 41 excited states in singly-ionized praseodymium, and 359 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 7 excited levels of doubly-ionized praseodymium; 137 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 70 excited states in neutral samarium, 713 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 115 excited states in singly-ionized samarium, and 49 <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> 17 excited levels of doubly-ionized samarium.
