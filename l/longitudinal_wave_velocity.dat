The interplay of these two sets results in a pattern of nascent frequencies that at first glance seems irregular. For example, in a 3/4 inch (19mm) thick steel plate having longitudinal and shear velocities of 5890 m/s and 3260 m/s respectively, the nascent frequencies of the antisymmetric modes a1 and a2 are 86 kHz and 310 kHz respectively, while the nascent frequencies of the symmetric modes s1, s2 and s3 are 155 kHz, 172 kHz and 343 kHz respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Figure 1 {{illustration}} depicts {{three important}} details worth discussing. The {{first is the}} Rayleigh line, the peak which has been suppressed at 0 cm-1. This peak {{is a result of}} Rayleigh scattering, a form of elastic scattering from the incident photons and the sample. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the induced polarization of the atoms, resulting from the incident photons, does not couple with possible vibrational modes of the atoms. The resulting emitted radiation has the same energy as the incident radiation, meaning no wavenumber shift is observed. This peak is generally quite intense and is not of direct interest for Brillouin spectroscopy. In an experiment the incident light is most often a high power laser. This results in a very intense Rayleigh peak which has the ability to wash out the Brillouin peaks of interest. In order to adjust for this, most spectrum are plotted with the Rayleigh peak either filtered out or suppressed. The second noteworthy aspect of Figure 1 is the distinction between Brillouin and Raman peaks. As previously mentioned, Brillouin peaks range from 0.1 cm-1 to approximately 6 cm-1 while Raman scattering wavenumbers ranges from 10-10000 cm¬-1 (Polian, 2003). As Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy probe two fundamentally different interaction regimes this is not too large of an inconvenience. The fact that Brillouin interactions are such low frequency however creates technical challenges when performing experiments for which a Fabry-Perot interferometer must be used in order to overcome. A Raman spectroscopy system is generally less technically complicated and can be performed with a diffraction grating spectrometer.Figure 1 also highlights the difference between Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. Stokes scattering, positive photon creation, is displayed as a positive shift in wavenumber. Anti-Stokes scattering, negative photon annihilation, is displayed as a negative shift in wavenumber. The locations of peaks are symmetric about the Rayleigh line because they correspond to the same energy level transition but of a different sign (Muller et al., 2005). In practice six Brillouin lines, of interest, are generally seen in a Brillouin spectrum. Acoustic waves have three polarization directions one longitudinal and two transverse directions each being orthogonal to the others, Figure 2. Solids can be considered nearly incompressible, within an appropriate pressure regime, as a result longitudinal waves, which are transmitted via compression parallel to the propagation direction, can transmit their energy through the material easily and thus travel quickly. The motion of transverse waves, on the other hand, is perpendicular to the propagation direction and is thus less easily propagated through the medium. As a result, longitudinal waves travel more quickly through solids than transverse waves. An example of this can be seen in quartz with an approximate acoustic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>velocity</b> of 5965 m/s and transverse wave velocity of 3750 m/s. Interestingly, fluids cannot support transverse waves. As a result, transverse wave signals are not found in Brillouin spectra of fluids. Equation 3 shows the relationship between acoustic wave velocity, V, and phonon wavenumber, Ω (Polian, 2003).|$|E

30|$|Construction of {{engineered}} projects, such as underground spaces, tunnels, machine halls etc. {{is connected}} with variations in stress-state and deformations of large volumes of rock mass. Latter can results in damage of rocks, their collapse into underground space, danger for equipment and risk for human life. To avoid such consequences different in situ geotechnical and geophysical monitoring is carried out during construction and exploitation of underground structures. Geophysical monitoring is based on observations for behavior of elastic shear- and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>velocities</b> (Vs and Vp, respectively) and microseismic activity. Behavior of the elastic velocities during deforming of the rock depends on type of the future failure that, in turn, is defined by structure and properties of medium and characteristics of stress state σ 3 /σ 1 and hydrostatic pressure. These velocity variations are defined by difference in effective parameters of forming microfractures, whose geometry is distinguished at different modes of stress-state. At that character of interaction between microfractures determines type of the macrofailure. We studied behavior of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>velocities</b> during loading of rock samples, large blocks and underground opening orienting measurements along maximum (σ 1) and minimum (σ 3) stresses. It is shown that velocity variations along maximum stress is more informative at elastic phase of rock deformations (velocity increases), whereas velocity variations along axis of minimum stress is more informative at the stage of nonlinear deformation of rock (velocity begin decrease). These regularities are well appeared at deforming of large blocks and unloading of rock mass in underground openings. This knowledge should be used at planning and performing of monitoring of stability of underground structures.|$|R
