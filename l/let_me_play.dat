25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
500|$|According to Wong, she {{was instead}} offered {{the part of}} Lotus, a {{deceitful}} song girl who helps to destroy the family and seduces the family's oldest son. Wong refused the role, telling MGM head of production Irving Thalberg, [...] "If you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> O-lan, I will be very glad. But you're asking me– with Chinese blood– to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters." [...] The role Wong hoped for went to Luise Rainer, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong's sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film {{in the role of}} the Little Bride. MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as [...] "one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s".|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E

Mamma got right up and found him. And what do you think! He was only a poor hungry man. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and {{afterward}} she got him work to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Moreno is a Christian. Moreno {{has spoken}} about his faith {{after he was}} caught crying after [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] before a game saying, [...] "During the anthem it's always quiet and still, so I take in the moment and say a little prayer... I thank the Lord for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> the game. I thank Him for everything. I run through my whole life right there at that moment. Even the bad stuff." ...|$|R
5000|$|IGN's Steve Butts {{gave the}} game a 7.4 out of 10 saying [...] "I like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, but I don't love {{it as much}} as I've loved {{previous}} games in the series. It definitely delivers on the promise of <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> with charmingly realized versions of many of my favorite DC heroes and villains, and it even presents a setting with lots of great surprises, challenges, and systems that promote variety. As a longtime DC fan, I do wish it had given me the chance to dig into more locations and plot elements from the comics, but the biggest hurdle for me to clear is the bizarre cameos." ...|$|R
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R love song, {{built on}} a finger-clicking beat. The song is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 95 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Derulo's vocal range spanning from the note of E4 to the note of B5. According to Rap-Up, the song's lyrics find Derulo as the male protagonist singing praises of [...] "a lovely lady", comparing her to his [...] "greatest hit". [...] "It Girl" [...] opens with a whistling intro and an acoustic guitar melody. In the first verse, he chants about how he searched all over and finally found the girl of his dreams. He also affirms that the girl means {{much more than a}} Grammy Award to him. Its hook, which forms part of the chorus, contains the lyrics: [...] "You could be my it girl / Baby, you're the shit girl / Lovin; you could be a crime / Crazy how we fit, girl / This is it, girl / Gimme 25 to life / I just wanna rock all night long and put you {{in the middle of my}} spotlight / You could be my it girl / You're my biggest hit, girl / <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> it loud." [...] Scott Shelter from Pop Crush noted that the song uses the [...] "oh-oh-oh-oh" [...] vocal chants after the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|Though Hopper gave {{critically}} acclaimed performances in Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983) and Sam Peckinpah's The Osterman Weekend (1983), {{it was not}} until he portrayed the gas-huffing, obscenity-screaming iconic villain Frank Booth in David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986) that his career truly revived. On reading the script Hopper said to Lynch: [...] "You have to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> Frank Booth. Because I am Frank Booth!" [...] He won critical acclaim and several awards for this role, and in the same year received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an alcoholic assistant basketball coach in Hoosiers.|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E

25|$|During the play's run he {{appeared}} as a worried parent in a thriller, The Yellow Balloon (1953). He was in another Hollywood-financed film, Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go (1953), <b>playing</b> a colleague of Clark Gable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rollo, I {{would not}} mind. If it does rain, I will ask {{my father to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> stay and <b>play</b> with you to-day, and {{we can have a}} fine time up in your little room." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Not alone, don't go alone, Dr. MacTavish,' said Merton; 'Mr. Macrae {{will need}} his telegraphic {{operator}} probably. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> you a hundred up at billiards.' ...|$|E
5000|$|I want {{to thank}} my parents for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> {{baseball}}, and I'm thankful I had baseball knuckles and couldn't become a dentist. Casey Stengel Uncertain of whether he would be successful as a baseball player, Stengel attended Western Dental College in the 1910-1911 offseason. He would later tell stories of his woes as a left-handed would-be dentist using right-handed equipment. The Blues sold Stengel to the Aurora Blues of the Class C Wisconsin-Illinois League. He led the league with a [...]352 batting average. Brooklyn Dodgers scout Larry Sutton took a trip from Chicago to nearby Aurora, noticed Stengel, and the Dodgers purchased his contract on September 1, 1911. Zach Wheat later claimed credit for tipping off Sutton that Stengel was worth signing. Stengel finished the season with Aurora and returned to dental school for the offseason.|$|R
6000|$|... "Spoiling Sylvie's garden," [...] was all {{the answer}} Bruno would give at first. But, as he went on tearing up the flowers, he muttered to himself [...] "The nasty cross thing wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>play</b> this morning,--said I must finish my lessons first--lessons, indeed! I'll vex her finely, though!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Havisham beckoned {{her to come}} close, {{and took}} up a jewel from the table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair.

6000|$|... "But, anyway, {{you will}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> with {{you here in}} New York as much as I can? Oh, come on, let's go for a walk--let's--let's go to a show." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, go on dancing, young people! Don't let me spoil sport, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>play</b> for you," [...] {{said the}} Countess; and she sate {{down to the}} {{instrument}} and played.|$|E

5000|$|Skiba {{heard the}} song and wrote the second verse, singing the vocal take in one pass. Barker's {{drumming}} on the verses was inspired by drum and bass music. [...] "John would be like, 'Trav, do some of that weird shit you play with EDM or rap artists.' And I'd be like, 'OK,'" [...] he said on the recording process. At one point, Barker told Feldmann, [...] "Why don't you give me one minute of click and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>play</b> whatever the fuck I want?" [...] His improvisational section became the song's conclusion.|$|R
5000|$|I {{came up for}} [...] "Bird Song", {{and after}} the set was over, I said, 'Thanks for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>play,</b> guys.' And they're like, 'No, no, stay! Play {{the second half of}} the show. We'll do [...] "Dark Star".' That had no {{significance}} to me. I'm like, '"Dark Star"? Okay. What is it?' 'Oh, you're gonna love it. It's free, it's out.' 'Great, I can play out.' They start playing that lick, and the audience goes fucking bananas. Later, I started getting these phone calls on my private number: 'Man, you were great last night. Thanks for getting them to play [...] "Dark Star". They haven't played it in six months.' I'm like, 'Who are these people?'...There was almost nothing Grateful Deadcouldn't play—and make the shit sound authentic. When they played a song by the Band or Bob Dylan, they played it with the same spirit as the Band or Dylan. They didn't feel the need to write their own arrangement of it. They were all listeners. There is a point where musicians who establish themselves stop listening to music and start listening to their own rhetoric. The Dead didn't do that. It was obvious in the way they approached a song.

50|$|Guitarist Mike McCready on {{the songs}} lead guitar work:Thats {{more of a}} Stevie Vaughan rip-off, with <b>me</b> <b>playing</b> little flowing things.
