5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham</b> (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E

50|$|Crawford was {{the lone}} {{dissenter}} in a case involving Senator-Military Judge-Colonel <b>Lindsey</b> O. <b>Graham.</b> In 2006, {{by a vote of}} 4-1, the CAAF found unconstitutional the dual role of <b>Lindsey</b> O. <b>Graham</b> as a senator (Republican from South Carolina) and as a reserve officer sitting as a military judge on the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. Crawford, in dissent, contended that there was no constitutional error in Senator Graham’s role, and that, even if there were, it was harmless. In the case in point, the military appellant Airman Lane had been unable to show he suffered any “actual prejudice.” She also said that, if Congress thought there were a constitutional problem in Sen. Graham’s service, it would have been free to take action, and it has not.|$|R

5000|$|Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) {{sought to}} balance Senator <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham's</b> {{selected}} anonymous statements decrying about Sotomayor's temperament, by reading positive reviews from fellow lawyers and judges. Cardin also raised the Voting Rights Act, and inquired Sotomayor's {{opinion on the}} right of the public to participate in voting. Sotomayor stated that voting is a fundamental right, and that the Congress {{has done a good job}} in regard to protecting the right to vote. Cardin recognized Sotomayor's achievements at Princeton University, and asked of her opinion of hearing different voices in public schools, as well as steps the federal government could take to further recognize diversity. Sotomayor cited the example of the University of Michigan, which promoted [...] "as much diversity as possible." [...] She also referenced the Equal Protection Clause under the law. In closing his statement, Cardin finally asked about Sotomayor's opinion on privacy, in terms of technology, and how it should be interpreted under the Constitution, which was [...] "written in the eighteenth century." [...] Sotomayor made it clear that privacy is specifically protected under the Constitution.|$|R

25|$|In 2003 Wyden {{joined with}} Senators <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham</b> (R-SC) and Trent Lott (R-MS) to help pass the Bush Administration's Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act.

The bill has been criticized as favoring pharmaceutical companies, as it prohibits the federal government from negotiating prescription drug rates.|$|E
25|$|Senator <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham,</b> as {{a popular}} Republican {{incumbent}} in strongly conservative South Carolina, has been considered unlikely to be vulnerable to a Democratic challenge. Graham's support for a compromise immigration bill, however, drew an angry response from many South Carolina conservatives, who recruited Buddy Witherspoon, a former South Carolina Republican Party leader, to challenge Graham for the nomination. Graham easily bested Witherspoon in the June 10 primary.|$|E

25|$|United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham,</b> and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King {{suggested}} that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, {{should be tried}} as an unlawful enemy combatant {{rather than as a}} criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.|$|E

40|$|Eighteen {{months of}} long hours work is now {{contained}} into this tome. It was fulfilled {{with the support}} of people involved with it either directly, or indirectly. They are those to whom I dedicate this thesis. My thanks and gratitude to my thesis advisor, Dr. Susan Krumdieck. You helped me with the scientific work, and have always been there to solve issues related to my course study and experimental work. I was impressed by your knowledge, sense of humour and diplomacy. Hope you are pleased with the amount of work done during this period and its quality. Thank you for organising the research and for insuring the funds required to finalise my bit of work. Regards to my course lecturers Dr. Alan Tucker and Dr. Pat Jordan. I will remember what you’ve taught me, not just thermodynamics and fluid dynamics principles. My old friend Leo Markus. Thank you for the help during my most difficult period here. Thank you for helping me to crack-down on the analytical models. I’ve learned from you great deal of scientific things, and what real life and friendly support are about. I have to thank my family, my patience wife and children that spent an impressive amount of time without me around. You had to wait me coming late at night, after long days of struggle with theoretical flow dynamics and vacuum theory concepts, or stubborn experiments. You always trusted me, and can see now that your trust wasn’t in vane. The laboratory technicians and workshop tradesmen, thanks for helping me making things work. To my friends Gwenda, <b>Graham,</b> <b>Lindsey</b> and Mary Ellen. Thank you for the help durin...|$|R
25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham</b> and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|As the 2004–2005 {{term of the}} Supreme Court ended, {{there was}} a flurry of rumors that Rehnquist, who was {{undergoing}} treatment for thyroid cancer, would soon retire. On June 27, 2005, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) suggested that the next appointment to the Court should come from outside the judiciary. Reid suggested the appointment of one of four Republican Senators, none of whom possessed previous judicial experience: Mel Martinez of Florida, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Mike Crapo of Idaho and <b>Lindsey</b> <b>Graham</b> of South Carolina. The list {{did not include the}} name of Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a former justice on the Texas Supreme Court. Reid declined to address the omission.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, 2016, Obama {{nominated}} Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, {{to replace}} Antonin Scalia.

500|$|During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama {{promised to}} abandon the Yucca Mountain project. As a result, Senator Reid moved the Nevada primary to help Obama's campaign.
