Juliana's mother, Queen Wilhelmina, {{had spent}} most of the 1930s looking for a {{suitable}} husband for Juliana. As a Protestant of royal rank (the Lippe-Biesterfelds were a sovereign house in the German Empire), Bernhard was acceptable for the devoutly religious Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina left nothing to chance, and had her <b>lawyers</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> very detailed prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what Bernhard could and could not do. The couple's engagement was announced in 1936, and they were married at The Hague on 7 January 1937.

His appropriateness as consort of the future Queen would later become a matter of some public debate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other issue}} {{to keep in}} mind is that the delay in {{responding}} may not amount to a significant amount of damages and someone who has had their material removed by the § 512 procedure late may be more than satisfied with the result; it is much less expensive than filing a copyright infringement suit in federal court that might revolve around a minor technicality of the law. Indeed, one of the purposes of this section was to remove a large number of potential infringement suits from the courts when the facts revolving around infringement were basically undisputed and the damages could be minimized within a short period without the intervention of a US federal district court judge.

[...] Goodall herself was in Africa at the time, and the Jane Goodall Institute thought this was in bad taste, and had their <b>lawyers</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> letter to Larson and his distribution syndicate, in which they described the cartoon as an [...] "atrocity." [...] They were stymied by Goodall herself when she returned and saw the cartoon, as she stated that she found the cartoon amusing. Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to The Far Side Gallery 5, detailing her version of the controversy, and the Institute's letter was included next to the cartoon in the complete Far Side collection. She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behaviour of humans and animals. In 1988, Larson visited Gombe where he was attacked by a chimpanzee named Frodo.|$|R

50|$|As noted above, essay {{questions}} {{are the most}} variable component of the bar exam. States emphasize different areas of law in their essay questions depending upon their respective histories and public policy priorities. For example, unlike Texas and Alta California, Louisiana did not convert to common law when it was acquired by the United States, so its essay questions require knowledge of the state's unique civil law system. Several states whose law descends from Spanish and Mexican civil law, like Texas and California, require all bar exam applicants to demonstrate knowledge of community property law. Pennsylvania, {{with a history of}} federal tax evasion (e.g., the Whiskey Rebellion), tests federal income tax law, while New Jersey, with a history of discriminatory zoning (resulting in the controversial Mount Laurel doctrine), tests zoning and planning law. Washington, South Dakota, and New Mexico each test Indian law, because of their relatively large populations of Native Americans and large numbers of Indian reservations. Most states test knowledge of the law of negotiable instruments and secured transactions (Articles 3 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code), but Alaska, California, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania do not; they have recognized {{that the vast majority of}} criminal, personal injury, and family <b>lawyers</b> will never <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> promissory note or litigate the validity of a security interest.|$|R

40|$|Taking some typical {{international}} practice situations, we can {{highlight the}} basic professional competence questions posed: (1) ABC Company, located in California, wants {{to establish a}} manufacturing facility in Mexico, (2) ABC asks <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> to <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> sales agency agreement that it will use in dealing with a French distributor. The lawyer has previously prepared such an agreement for this client for use with respect to distributorships in the United States. These hypothetical situations raise the following professional competence questions: (1) What are the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s professional responsibilities if the lawyer undertakes sole representation of this client in the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s home jurisdiction, for example California, and this representation involves advising on foreign law? In this example, {{sometimes referred to as}} the “self-help” option, the lawyer independently, and without foreign expert assistance, counsels the client. (2) What are the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s professional responsibilities if the lawyer undertakes representation of the client in the foreign country? For example, given the facts above, is the lawyer somehow professionally restricted from going abroad to France or Mexico and doing legal work for a client in those countries? Which country 2 ̆ 7 s professional standards would apply to the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s activities? (3) If the lawyer decides {{that he or she is}} not competent to advise on foreign law, what are that lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities with respect to selecting competent local counsel and to selecting competent counsel who resides and practices in a foreign country? (4) Once the lawyer selects counsel competent to advise on foreign law matters, what are the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s professional obligations as to the counsel 2 ̆ 7 s activities? What problems is the lawyer likely to encounter, and how can they best be handled? The following sections will address these concerns and hopefully offer guidance to the U. S. lawyer engaged in international practice. They will also offer suggestions regarding lawyer-client and U. S. lawyer-foreign lawyer communications, and liability for foreign lawyer legal opinions, both of which are relevant to the use and selection of foreign counsel...|$|R
