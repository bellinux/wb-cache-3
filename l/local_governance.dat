40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. The first task is to develop a {{conceptual}} framework for thinking about <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance.</b> Once that framework is developed, specific indicators will be proposed to monitor the quality of key features or characteristics of a process of <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance.</b> The indicators will be “actionable ” and can be used to guide CDD operations and track progress in strengthening <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance.</b> In order to address these topics, the next section discusses the meaning of <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance.</b> That is followed by a discussion of why <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance</b> is important. The following section then turns to a discussion of the formal and informal arrangements which combine to produce a vibrant process of <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance.</b> The final section proposes actionable indicators for measuring different dimensions of the process of <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance.</b> Initial Discussion Draft 1 of 47 NOT TO BE QUOTED OR DISTRIBUTEDWhat do we mean by <b>local</b> democratic <b>governance...</b>|$|R

5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in <b>local</b> <b>governance.</b> To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E
40|$|There is {{an absence}} of {{knowledge}} about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different <b>local</b> tourism <b>governance</b> approaches. Consequently, experimenting with different modes of <b>local</b> tourism <b>governance</b> is increasingly common. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the ways in which three different <b>local</b> tourism <b>governance</b> networks operate, and the effects of this <b>governance</b> on <b>local</b> tourism policy. The three local tourism networks examined are a council-led network governance structure, a participant-led community network governance structure and a local tourism organisation (LTO) -led industry network governance structure. The study found that these governance arrangements were underpinned by four key trade-offs and that these tended to shape the effectiveness of <b>local</b> tourism <b>governance.</b> The significance of this paper is that it opens up discussion about <b>local</b> tourism <b>governance,</b> highlights the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and reflects on their relevance to sustainable tourism management. The findings can inform local councils interested in improving their local organisation of tourism, and spur further research...|$|R

5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of <b>local</b> <b>governance</b> that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the five}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Rhode Island is tied with Hawaii for having the second-lowest number of counties of any U.S. state (only Delaware has fewer, with three counties). Although Rhode Island is divided into counties, it does not have any local government at the county level. Instead, <b>local</b> <b>governance</b> is provided by the eight cities and thirty-one towns. Counties in Rhode Island have had no governmental functions since 1846 other than as court administrative and sheriff corrections boundaries which are part of state government.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader and}} cabinet model of decision-making, {{adopted by the}} city council under the Local Government Act 2000, is similar to {{national}} government. The council appoints the Leader (usually {{a member of the}} group with the political majority) and he or she appoints up to nine other councillors to serve on the cabinet. The cabinet members, one of whom is appointed Deputy Leader, assume responsibility for different key areas of <b>local</b> <b>governance.</b> The full council meets around ten times a year. There are decisions that only full council can make, these include setting budgets and spending programmes, setting council tax levels and approving major policies and priorities. In addition to the Leader of the Council, the council also appoints the Mayor of Peterborough, the Deputy Mayor, committee chairmen and the chief executive. The cabinet and committees report to, and are accountable to, council.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{formation}} and transformation of <b>local</b> entrepreneurial <b>governances</b> {{can be understood as}} a process of local responses to challenges presented by global economic restructuring. Two kinds of local responses are theoretically identified. At the structure level, <b>local</b> entrepreneurial <b>governances</b> happen when places are embedded in the situation of competition between cities and regions. At the agent level, the emergence of <b>local</b> entrepreneurial <b>governances</b> requires <b>local</b> actors who pursue their own political and economic interests. The theoretical framework, what I term 'territorial restructuring process', is empirically explained by the context of the West and China. Copyright 2008 The Author.

5000|$|A 1997 report {{observed}} a global consensus that sustainable development implementation {{should be based}} on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities. Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental <b>governance</b> at the <b>local</b> level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control” and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that <b>local</b> level <b>governance</b> encompasses. <b>Local</b> level <b>governance</b> shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. <b>Local</b> level <b>governance</b> is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. <b>Local</b> level <b>governance</b> is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.

5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The {{redistribution of wealth}} supported by the new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the <b>local</b> <b>governance,</b> which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.|$|E
5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good <b>local</b> <b>governance,</b> and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 1272, Edward I reestablished royal power, overhauling {{the royal}} finances and {{appealing to the}} broader English elite by using Parliament to authorise the raising of new taxes and to hear petitions concerning abuses of <b>local</b> <b>governance.</b> This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s. Edward III restored order once more {{with the help of}} a majority of the nobility, exercising power through the exchequer, the common bench and the royal household. This government was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before, and by the 14th century the king's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up permanent residence in Westminster. Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration, to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France. The royal lands—and incomes from them—had diminished over the years, and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives. Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood. The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century, reflected in the growth of knightly orders (including the Order of the Garter), grand tournaments and round table events.|$|E

40|$|Seasonal forest {{pools in}} the northeastern USA are unique {{ecosystems}} whose functions are intimately associated with adjacent upland habitats. This connection, coupled with their small size and ephemeral surface water, has made conservation of pool resources challenging. Seasonal pools provide optimal breeding habitat for animals adapted to temporary waters including ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma spp.), wood frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte), and some invertebrates and plants. To date, wetland conservation efforts have been primarily limited to 2 pathways: land use regulation and pres-ervation. Although both of these pathways {{have the potential to}} conserve some pool resources, they are often insufficient to maintain an array of pools in the landscape that support local population dynamics of amphibians. We propose a third pathway – local land-use planning – that can complement regulatory and preservation efforts. This suite of strategies, embodied in our Best Development Practices (BDPs), recognizes that not all pools will be conserved; <b>local</b> <b>governances</b> will need to develop priorities for conservation. The BDPs encourage <b>local</b> <b>governances</b> to (1) proactively identify their pool resources, (2) rank those pools according to their relative ecological value, and (3) establish management procedures and apply recommended guidelines in accordance with the relative rankings. We recommend that pool...|$|R
