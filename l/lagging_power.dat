2500|$|Induction {{machines}} {{are some of}} the most common types of loads in the electric power system today. These machines use inductors, or large coils of wire to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a voltage is initially placed across the coil, the inductor strongly resists this change in current and magnetic field, which causes a time delay for the current to reach its maximum value. This causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase. Inductors are said to [...] "sink" [...] reactive power, and thus to cause a <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor. Induction generators can source or sink reactive power, and provide a measure of control to system operators over reactive power flow and thus voltage. Because these devices have opposite effects on the phase angle between voltage and current, they can be used to [...] "cancel out" [...] each other's effects. This usually takes the form of capacitor banks being used to counteract the <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor caused by induction motors.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{difference}} between a lagging and leading power factor. The terms refer to whether the phase of the current is leading or lagging the phase of the voltage. A <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor signifies that the load is inductive, as the load will “consume” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component [...] is positive as reactive power travels through the circuit and is “consumed” by the inductive load. A leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive, as the load “supplies” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component [...] is negative as reactive power is being supplied to the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Distortion of the {{electric}} current by loads is measured in several ways. [...] Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. [...] A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. [...] For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. [...] This {{can lead to a}} significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.|$|E
40|$|A {{synchronous}} condenser is a synchronous machine that generates reactive power that leads real power by 90 {degrees} in phase. The leading reactive power {{generated by the}} condenser offsets or cancels the normal <b>lagging</b> reactive <b>power</b> consumed by inductive and nonlinear loads at the accelerator complex. The quality of SLAC`s utility power is improved {{with the addition of}} the condenser. The inertia of the condenser`s 35, 000 pound rotor damps and smoothes voltage excursions on two 12 kilovolt master substation buses, improving voltage regulation site wide. The condenser absorbs high frequency transients and noise in effect ``scrubbing`` the electric system power at its primary distribution source. In addition, the condenser produces a substantial savings in power costs. Federal and investor owned utilities that supply electric power to SLAC levy a monthly penalty for <b>lagging</b> reactive <b>power</b> delivered to the site. For the 1993 fiscal year this totaled over $ 285, 000 in added costs for the year. By generating leading reactive power on site, thereby reducing total <b>lagging</b> reactive <b>power</b> requirements, a substantial savings in electric utility bills is achieved. Actual savings of $ 150, 000 or more a year are possible depending on experimental operations...|$|R

40|$|The phenomenal {{increase}} in vehicular ownership and transport demand {{during the past}} two decades have made the transport sector become the major source of air and noise pollution in many cities in the Republic of Korea. Consequently, environmental sustainability has become a major issue of concern in transport development. Various policy instruments and other measures have been applied or are under consideration to contain transport demand and greenhouse gas emissions to promote sustainable transport development in the Republic of Korea. Evaluating the effectiveness of a policy measure is important in deciding its relevance. A framework has been developed in this paper which can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures. In this paper, we estimate the indicators related to transport and the environment in the Republic of Korea up to 2020. A forecast of vehicle ownership was made since it was the most important parameter for estimating road travel and energy demand in the transport sector.

50|$|For {{the same}} {{mechanical}} load, the armature current varies with field excitation {{over a wide}} range and so causes the power factor also to vary accordingly. When over-excited, the motor runs with leading power factor (and supplies vars to the grid) and when under-excited with <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor (and absorbs vars from the grid). In between, the power factor is unity. The minimum armature current corresponds to the point of unity power factor (voltage and current in phase).|$|E
5000|$|In {{transmission}} applications, the SVC is used {{to regulate}} the grid voltage. If the power system's reactive load is capacitive (leading), the SVC will use thyristor controlled reactors to consume VARs from the system, lowering the system voltage. Under inductive (lagging) conditions, the capacitor banks are automatically switched in, thus providing a higher system voltage. By connecting the thyristor-controlled reactor, which is continuously variable, along with a capacitor bank step, {{the net result is}} continuously variable leading or <b>lagging</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{statistical}} {{scaling of}} structural attributes of two millimeter scale rock samples, Estaillades limestone and Bentheimer sandstone. The two samples have different connected porosities and pore structures. The pore-space geometry of each sample is reconstructed via X-ray micro-tomography at micrometer resolution. Directional distributions of porosity and specific surface area (SSA), which are key Minkowski functionals (geometric observables) employed {{to describe the}} pore-space structure, are calculated from the images, and scaling of associated order- sample structure functions of absolute incremental values is analyzed. Increments of porosity and SSA tend to be statistically dependent and persistent (tendency for large and small values to alternate mildly) in space.

50|$|If {{the station}} becomes {{completely}} {{isolated from the}} grid system, the gas turbines are used to restart any main units that are shut down. This process {{is known as a}} black start and is tested annually. Each gas turbine unit consists of an English Electric type EA 3,000 r.p.m. expansion turbine employing two Rolls-Royce Avon type RA29 Stage 6A (1533-51) engines as gas generators, and is directly coupled to the alternator. The alternators, made by English Electric are rated at 11 Kv, 21.9 MVA, 0.8 <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor and have a frequency range of 40 to 51 cycles per second.

50|$|This {{ability to}} {{selectively}} control power factor can be exploited for {{power factor correction}} of the power system to which the motor is connected.

Such power-factor correction is usually {{a side effect of}} motors already present in the system to provide mechanical work, although motors can be run without mechanical load simply to provide power-factor correction. In large industrial plants such as factories the interaction between synchronous motors and other, lagging, loads may be an explicit consideration in the plant's electrical design.|$|E

50|$|One use {{for this}} type of motor is its use in a power factor {{correction}} scheme. They are referred to as synchronous condensers. This exploits a feature of the machine where it consumes power at a leading power factor when its rotor is over excited. It thus appears to the supply to be a capacitor, and could thus be used to correct the <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor that is usually presented to the electric supply by inductive loads. The excitation is adjusted until a near unity power factor is obtained (often automatically). Machines used for this purpose are easily identified as they have no shaft extensions. Synchronous motors are valued in any case because their power factor is much better than that of induction motors, making them preferred for very high power applications.|$|E
50|$|An {{inductive}} load {{consists of an}} iron-core reactive element which, when {{used in conjunction with}} a resistive load bank, creates a <b>lagging</b> <b>power</b> factor load. Typically, the {{inductive load}} will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductive load is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc. With a resistive-inductive load bank, full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment.|$|E
