5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E
25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> and acid sulphurous fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E

40|$|Lead {{silicate}} glass samples {{with varying}} <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> content were prepared in this study, and their luminescent properties were examined and analyzed. It {{was found that}} with increasing <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> content, the maximum phonon energies of the glass samples decreased, while their spontaneous transition probabilities first increased and then decreased. The influence of the spontaneous transition rate, A(10), and the multi-phonon relaxation rate, W- 10, on the sample luminescent properties was analyzed using rate equations. As a result, {{it was found that}} with increasing <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> content, W- 10 /A(10) decreased, while the quantum efficiency increased. Thus, the luminescent intensity at similar to 2 mu m increased in the glass samples with increased <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> content. The high luminescent intensity and long lifetime indicate that silicate glasses containing high levels of <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> could potentially be used in similar to 2 mu m lasers.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{developed}} a simple and effective method to fabricate <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> plate films by electrochemical deposition.

50|$|The oxygen {{flow rate}} during blowing for a three tonne {{capacity}} furnace is 20-30 Nm3/h. Zinc is initially oxidized to form a zinc oxide dross {{on the surface of}} the charge, but as lead oxide subsequently forms, a fluid slag of zinc and <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> is created. Most of the copper is removed at the same time as the lead. The final removal of copper to a level of 0.04% is undertaken at the end of the process by further additions of lead to collect the copper.|$|E
50|$|The {{lead from}} the blast furnace, called lead bullion, then {{undergoes}} the drossing process. The bullion is agitated in kettles then cooled to 700-800 degrees. This process results in molten lead and dross. Dross refers to the <b>lead</b> <b>oxides,</b> copper, antimony and other elements that float {{to the top of}} the lead. Dross is usually skimmed off and sent to a dross furnace to recover the non-lead components which are sold to other metal manufacturers.

At room temperature massicot forms soft (Mohs hardness of 2) yellow to reddish-yellow, earthy, scaley masses which are very dense, with a specific gravity of 9.64. Massicot can be found as a natural mineral, though it is only found in minor quantities. In bygone centuries it was mined.

50|$|There is {{some debate}} over how, when, and why Ravenscroft was {{inspired}} to use lead {{in the production of}} glass.

The use of lead in glass was known in Italy as proved by 12% lead being discovered in the white cameo layer of The Portland Vase, a famous Roman artefact in the British Museum Whatever the origin of the idea, Ravenscroft believed that he had a unique product to offer the English market, so he applied to King Charles II for a patent in 1674 to establish his right to be sole manufacturer of lead crystal glass in England. He produced lead crystal glass for a period of only five years, dissolving his manufacturing business in 1679. His patent expired in 1681.|$|E
