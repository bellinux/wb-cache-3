50|$|With larger engines, the {{linkages}} involved in controlling cutoff and direction grew progressively heavier {{and there was}} a need for power assistance in adjusting them. Steam (or later, compressed air) powered reversing gear was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Typically, the operator worked a valve that admitted steam to {{one side or the other}} of a cylinder connected to the reversing mechanism until the indicator showed the intended position. A second mechanism, usually a piston in an oil-filled cylinder held in position by closing a control cock, was required to keep {{the linkages}} in place. The first locomotive engineer to fit such a device was James Stirling of the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1873. Several engineers then tried them, including William Dean of the GWR and Vincent Raven of the North Eastern Railway, but they found them little to their liking, mainly because of maintenance difficulties: any oil leakage from the <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder,</b> either through the piston gland or the cock, allowed the mechanism to creep, or worse “nose-dive”, into full forward gear while running. Stirling moved to the South Eastern Railway and Harry Smith Wainwright, his successor with that company, incorporated them into most of his designs, which were in production about thirty years after Stirling’s innovation. Later still the forward-looking Southern Railway engineer Oliver Bulleid fitted them to his famous Merchant Navy Class of locomotives, but they were mostly removed at rebuild.|$|E
40|$|DE 102006047939 A 1 UPAB: 20080501 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> (3) that is formed for {{bidirectional}} data exchange by radio. A {{wireless access point}} (2 a) is formed for bidirectional data exchange per radio with the cylinder and a central management unit (1) i. e. personal computer. The unit is connected with the point for the bidirectional data exchange. An association request signal is transmitted from the cylinder. Association response signals are transmitted from the point in a radio range after receiving the request signal. The point is connected with the cylinder over the radio based on the received response signal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for integrating a <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a network. USE - Keying system {{for use in a}} network e. g. Ethernet, wireless LAN, and home phoneline networking alliance (RTM: Not defined). ADVANTAGE - The design of the system enables automatic connection of the <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> with the keying system in a network in a simple manner, theoretical unlimitation of an automatic enhancement of the keying system about the additional <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a simple manner, prevention of non-authorized <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be connected with the network components, and facilitates a simple and flexible data transmission to the individual <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The number of the locking cylinders controlled by radio are monitored, configured and programmed in a simple manner. Manual contacts for the configuration of the cylinder and manual administration processes are eliminated...|$|E
5000|$|An {{escutcheon}} {{can also}} refer to {{an item of}} door furniture. In this case, it is an architectural item that surrounds a keyhole or <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and is often part of a lockset. Escutcheons help to protect a <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> from being drilled out or snapped, {{and to protect the}} surrounding area from damage and wear {{from the end of the}} key when it misses the keyhole.|$|R
50|$|For {{high-quality}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks</b> and <b>locking</b> systems, <b>cylinder</b> cores {{are made}} from wear-resistant cupronickel.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{changes for}} 1991 also {{included}} the Alpha Tech ignition <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which incorporated a dual-bit key that was larger and thicker in size {{in comparison to}} the old single-bit <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> system that had been used for years. The lock system was intended to be a stronger deterrent to vehicle theft, but constant problems were reported with the lock jamming. It was dropped after an improved dual-bit single key system was introduced for the 1995 model year and redesign.|$|R
50|$|The Gatling gun {{operated}} by a hand-crank mechanism, with six barrels revolving around a central shaft (although some models had as many as ten). Each barrel fires once per revolution {{at about the same}} position. The barrels, a carrier, and a <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft, mounted on an oblong fixed frame. Turning the crank rotated the shaft. The carrier was grooved and the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels.|$|R
5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks,</b> lever locks, and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R

5000|$|Slide hammer puller {{to break}} into the door <b>locks</b> and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The casing was partitioned, {{and through}} this opening the barrel shaft was journaled. In {{front of the}} casing was a cam with spiral surfaces. The cam {{imparted}} a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated. Also in the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun. Each barrel had a single lock, working in the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> on a line with the barrel. The <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> was encased and joined to the frame. Early models had a fibrous matting stuffed in among the barrels, which could be soaked with water to cool the barrels down. Later models eliminated the matting-filled barrels as being unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{standardised}} cross-sectional profiles for <b>lock</b> <b>cylinders</b> that may vary in length - for example to suit different door thicknesses. These profiles include the europrofile (or DIN standard), the British oval profile and the Swiss profile ...|$|R
50|$|A typical trapped-key {{interlock}} device {{consists of a}} <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> which operates a sliding bolt through a cam. The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple <b>lock</b> <b>cylinders</b> on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.|$|R
50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock {{normally}} contains {{a set of}} bottom pins {{and a set of}} driver pins. The bottom pins move within pin channels inside the cylinder assembly and are cut at different lengths corresponding to the lock keying. The driver pins are installed in the lock housing and spring pressure forces them to penetrate the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> and prevent it from turning. If the wrong key is inserted, it will variously push the bottom pins either too high or not high enough, and the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> can not turn. When the bottom pins are correctly aligned by the key, the top pins are exactly aligned with the barrel of the cylinder, and it may freely turn.|$|R
50|$|A larger radiator, {{heater core}} inlets and hoses were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance. Door <b>lock</b> <b>cylinders</b> and ignition <b>lock</b> switches were also revised for greater theft protection. The standard 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 engine got a slight detuning for better fuel economy, while the 7.5 L V8 soldiered on {{for one more}} year.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{pin tumbler}} lock alone is {{vulnerable}} to several lock picking methods and attacks, the most common being lock bumping and snap guns. To combat this, many higher security cylinders incorporate the use of specialised pins known as security pins which are designed to catch in the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> if a snap gun or bump key is used.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a tubular lock {{is similar to the}} pin tumbler lock, in that there are several stacks of pins. The key is a {{cylinder}} shape with notches cut around the outer or (rarely) inner edge. Each of these notches depresses a single pin inside the lock to a specific height allowing the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> to turn freely.|$|R
50|$|The keys for Knox KeySecure are {{the same}} {{throughout}} a district (the extent of which depends on the district). At the February 2013 RSA Conference, a researcher publicized a possible exploit, claiming that he had successfully ordered a box, disassembled it, and used the information from disassembling the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> to create his own master key.|$|R
50|$|Architectural Ironmongery or (Architectural Hardware) is a {{term used}} for the {{manufacture}} and wholesale distributor of items made from iron, steel, brass, aluminium or other metals, including plastics, for use in all types of buildings.

40|$|Shield {{sections}} {{change their}} configuration to suit mining mode. Articulation cylinders raise rear shield to advance position, and <b>locking</b> <b>cylinders</b> hold it there. To change to retreat position articulation <b>cylinders</b> lower shield. <b>Locking</b> pins at edge of outermost shield plate latch shield to chock base. Shield accommodates roof heights ranging from 36 to 60 inches (0. 9 to 1. 52 meters) ...|$|R
5000|$|Linus Yale, Jr. {{introduced}} {{some combination}} safe <b>locks</b> and key-operated <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks</b> around 1862. Then in 1868, he and Henry Robinson Towne founded the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company in the South End to produce <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks.</b> Yale died later that year. The Yale & Towne lock company manufactured locks there (giving Stamford its early nickname, [...] "Lock City"). And other manufacturing businesses were sited there.|$|R
50|$|Lock {{snapping}} is {{a method}} of forced entry that only affects certain types of <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC doors in Europe. Lock snapping involves applying a strong torque force to the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder,</b> usually {{with a pair of}} locking pliers, thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.|$|R
50|$|Kale Endüstri Holding is a Turkish {{holding company}} which was {{established}} in 1986. It operates in production, distribution, sale and export in the sectors of safety <b>locks,</b> <b>cylinders,</b> electronic <b>locks,</b> screws, steel doors, safe boxes, fire doors and window systems. The locomotive of the holding is Kale Kilit, the leading company of Turkey in its sector, {{also one of the}} prominent companies, as integrated plant, in the global safety lock market.|$|R
50|$|To rekey a lock {{you have}} to first remove the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> from any housing it rests in. The <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> must be disassembled, and the plug removed. Use a plug {{follower}} to avoid dropping master-wafers, top pins and springs. The plug has cylindrical chambers spaced according to manufacturer specifications. Pins are contained in these chambers where they are pushed down by springs or raised by a key. Each cut sits under a chamber of its own, each pin sits on a cut of its own. Place the correct pins in each chamber, bringing {{the top of each}} new pin flush with the shear-line. Check the upper chambers using a master-follower for old unused master wafers and remove any. If any springs are noticeably weak or the lock was especially dirty replace the springs. If the old pins are rounded from use or otherwise show excessive wear replace springs. Reinsert the plug taking care not to drop top pins into any unused chamber. Test key, make slight adjustments if needed and reassemble.|$|R
50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a spring bolt lock because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> with the key. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{a series}} of grooves {{on either side of}} the key's blade limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock through the keyway, the wards align with the grooves in the key's profile to allow or deny entry into the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Although this is not {{commonly}} recognized when discussing warded locks, it is more applicable to current locksmithing applications such as pin-tumbler or wafer-tumbler locks.|$|R
50|$|An {{optional}} Illuminated Entry System—a timed (25-second) interior {{courtesy light}} illumination system with lighted door <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> rings (activated by lifting either exterior door handle)—also {{made its debut}} for 1977. This feature would {{set the stage for}} Ford's exclusive and popular Illuminated/Keyless Entry System (with driver's door belt molding mounted keypad), which would first be seen on the then newly downsized Continental/Mark VI and Thunderbird/Cougar XR-7 beginning in the 1980 model year.|$|R
50|$|Locks {{that have}} trap pins that engage when a pin {{does not support}} them will jam a <b>lock's</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Another {{countermeasure}} is shallow drilling, in which {{one or more of}} the pin stacks is drilled slightly shallower than the others. If an attempt is made on a lock that has shallow drilled pin stacks, the bump key will be unable to bump the shallow drilled pins because they are too high for the bump key to engage.|$|R
50|$|A {{key blank}} (sometimes spelled keyblank) {{is a key}} {{that has not been}} cut to a {{specific}} bitting. The blank has a specific cross-sectional profile to match the keyway in a corresponding <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Key blanks can be stamped with a manufacturer name, end-user logo or with a phrase, the most commonly seen being 'Do not duplicate'. Blanks are typically stocked by locksmiths for duplicating keys. The profile of the key bow, or the large, flat end, is often characteristic of an individual manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{feature is}} the locking system, which uses two {{hydraulic}} cylinders for redundancy (in case one fails) {{rather than relying on}} the older ratchet design. While a ratchet-based restraint locks at one of several positions that can be too loose or uncomfortably tight, the hydraulic system allows the restraints to be pulled down and locked in any position to better match a rider's body dimensions. In the extremely unlikely case where both <b>locking</b> <b>cylinders</b> fail, the restraints are still held down by a seat belt.|$|R
50|$|The Officer's tool (or A tool) is forcible entry tool used by firefighters. It {{consists}} of a rounded steel handle approximately 18 inches long, with one end tapering to a flattened tip for prying or punching and the other terminated with a perpendicular steel head. the head is four inches long and has a steel forked end opposite a striking end. The Officer's tool, like the smaller K-tool is used to remove the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinders,</b> such as used on rim locks, police locks, dead-bolts, or key-in-the-knob locks.|$|R
50|$|ASSA ABLOY is {{represented}} on both mature and emerging markets worldwide, with leading positions {{in much of}} Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. ASSA ABLOY {{is divided into three}} regional and two global divisions. The regional divisions, Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, manufacture and sell mechanical and electromechanical locks, digital door <b>locks,</b> <b>cylinders</b> and security doors adapted to the local market’s standards and security requirements. The global divisions, Global Technologies and Entrance Systems, manufacture and sell electronic access control, identification products and entrance automation on the global market.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{automobiles}} have keys with transponders {{hidden inside}} the plastic {{head of the}} key. The user of the car {{may not even be}} aware that the transponder is there, because there are no buttons to press. When a key is inserted into the ignition <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> and turned, the car's computer sends a radio signal to the transponder. Unless the transponder replies with a valid code, the computer will not allow the engine to be started. Transponder keys have no battery; they are energized by the radio signal itself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of reverse gear, instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet reversing gear, and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, <b>locking</b> <b>cylinders</b> remained in use. The Hadfield reversing gear, patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet reversing gear with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} lock pick uses trial-and-error {{methods to}} find the correct alignment of the locking pins. The snap gun uses a primary law of physics, the transfer of energy, to momentarily burst all of the driver pins out of the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> without sending the bottom pins up into it. The snap gun strikes all of the bottom pins at once with a strong impact, and then withdraws again. The bottom pins transfer their kinetic energy to the top pins and come to a complete stop without penetrating the lock housing. The driver pins are {{thrown out of the}} cylinder body entirely up into the lock housing. Until the springs force the driver pins back into the <b>cylinder,</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> is momentarily unobstructed. The physical effect of the impact is similar to the game of billiards, where the cue stick first strikes the cue ball, transferring kinetic energy into the cue ball. The cue ball then strikes a target ball. Since the two balls are very elastic, and since the target ball is free to move, the cue ball (representing a bottom pin) comes to a complete stop at the point of impact and the target ball (representing a driver pin) continues moving with most of the kinetic energy that was formerly in the cue ball.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{automotive}} {{manufacturers have}} been equipping vehicles with a push button start ignition switch {{that takes the}} place of a traditional key cylinder. On some vehicles the system is integrated into the entire vehicle entry system and other times not. This feature first appeared in highline vehicles and soon will be “trickling down” to even economy minded vehicles. Whether the vehicle is propelled by internal combustion engine, electricity or hybrid, the days of the keyed <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> appear numbered. This presentation was given in July at NACAT 2009 in North Carolina and explains basic operation on three specific vehicles...|$|R
50|$|Unskilled use of {{the tool}} will often detach the lock rods, leaving the lock {{inoperable}} even with the key. This is often a clue that someone has attempted to break into a car. Newer cars have also incorporated internal defenses against this tool such as barrier blocks {{on the bottom of}} the window, preventing entry, and also shrouding the operating rods and the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder</b> to prevent manipulation of internal linkages. Others have designed the operating rods to be easily disconnected when engaged with a lateral force - as is often created by the lifting action of the tool.|$|R
