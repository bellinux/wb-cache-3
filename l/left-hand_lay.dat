50|$|Twisted Pair (TP) {{conductor}} (sometimes {{called by}} the trade-names T-2 or VR) has the two sub-conductors twisted (usually with a <b>left-hand</b> <b>lay)</b> about one another generally with a lay length of approximately three meters (nine feet).|$|E
5000|$|Lay of a {{conductor}} {{is determined by}} four extended fingers; [...] "right" [...] or [...] "left" [...] direction of the lay is determined depending if it matches finger direction from right hand or left hand respectively. Overhead aluminium (AAC, AAAC, ACAR) and ACSR conductors in the USA are always manufactured with the outer conductor layer with a right-hand lay. Going toward the center each layer has alternating lays. Some conductor types (e.g. copper overhead conductor, OPGW, steel EHS) are different and have <b>left-hand</b> <b>lay</b> on the outer conductor. Some South American countries specify <b>left-hand</b> <b>lay</b> for the outer conductor layer on their ACSR, so those are wound differently than those used in the USA.|$|E
50|$|Rick Mount's father, Pete, {{was an avid}} {{basketball}} player who intended Rick to learn the game as well. He cut out {{the bottom of a}} peanut can so Rick could shoot tennis balls through it. Rick's first time playing with an official basketball goal was during the fourth grade. He was known to beat 8th and 9th graders. However, {{when it was time to}} try out for the school basketball team, he wasn't able to make a standard <b>left-hand</b> <b>lay</b> up, which was a requirement for making the roster. That very night he practiced for hours until he had it down, and on the next day of tryouts, he made the team.|$|E
60|$|On {{either side}} of the porch was a seat, and here a {{somewhat}} remarkable sight would have been revealed to any inquisitive eye peering through the aforesaid keyhole. Upon the <b>left-hand</b> seat <b>lay</b> seven dolls, upon the right-hand seat lay six; and so varied were the expressions of their countenances, owing to fractures, dirt, age, and other afflictions, that one would very naturally have thought this a doll's hospital, and these the patients waiting for their tea.|$|R
40|$|C. Jol ieoeur) This paper {{presents}} an elegant way {{to extend a}} strand model into a wire rope model. The present writer has appreciated very much the basic principle of this work which consists in {{the replacement of the}} individual wires by structures that have a more complex behavior than wires and that need an increased number of parameters todescribe this behavior in the rope. This is an approach that is related to the homogeniza-tion methods. The author used Costello's model (1990) as a starting point, and has extended it to incorporate the added parameters. He could probably have used another model, but this choice is a reasonable one since Costello's model has proven very reliable for strand modeling (Jolicoeur and Cardou, 1991). The equa-tions provided in the paper for the case of a linear strand should then give identical results with Costello's model. This was not demonstrated in the paper and the present writer has attempted to verify this. In so doing, some flaws have appeared in the formulation of the equations, hence the present discussion. The main problem identified is {{in the use of the}} term x/ 1 + k 2 (where k = tan a) in Eqs. (39) and (53). As formu-lated, when doing the summation for as, for example, the terms corresponding to layers that have a <b>left-hand</b> <b>lay</b> (i. e., a> 90) take a negative value, leading to an incorrect result for a~. In other models, use is rather made of sin a and cos a and, in fact, the following identity 1 cosa = ~/ 1 + tan 2 a is valid for a 90 deg, a sign error occurs, leading to the aforementioned problem. To correct he error, it is recommended to replace ~/ 1 + k ~ by 1 /cos at in Eqs. (39) and (53). For the case of a linear strand, Eqs. (53) would be rewritten a...|$|E
