5|$|In 1687, William Penn {{published}} The Excellent Privilege of <b>Liberty</b> <b>and</b> Property: {{being the}} birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England, which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed on American soil.

The colonists drew on English law books, leading them to an anachronistic interpretation of Magna Carta, believing that it guaranteed trial by jury and habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a flurry of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious <b>liberty,</b> <b>and</b> Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E

5|$|The book recounts {{an opinion}} written by Brandeis and joined by Holmes in the 1927 case of Whitney v.

5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for <b>liberty</b> <b>and</b> human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today.

5|$|Walsingham {{advocated}} {{direct intervention}} in the Netherlands {{in support of the}} Protestant revolt against Spain, on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of religious <b>liberty</b> <b>and</b> freedom were not. Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy of mediation, a policy that Elizabeth endorsed. Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578, to sound out a potential peace deal and gather military intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of <b>liberty,</b> <b>and</b> it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{classify}} and explain democracies in the 47 Muslim countries between the years 1998 and 2008 by using <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> elections as independent variables. Specifically focusing on the context of the Muslim world, this study examines the performance of civil <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> elections, variation of democracy practised the most, the elections, civil <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> democratic transitions and patterns that followed. Based on the quantitative data primarily collected from Freedom House, this study demonstrates the following aggregate findings: first, the “not free not fair” elections, the “limited” civil <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> the “Illiberal Partial Democracy” were the dominant feature of elections, civil <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> democracy practised in the Muslim world; second, a total of 413 Muslim regimes out of 470 (47 regimes x 10 years) remained the same as their democratic origin points, without any transitions to a better or worse level of democracy, throughout these 10 years; and third, a slow, yet steady positive transition of both elections <b>and</b> civil <b>liberties</b> occurred in the Muslim world with changes in the nature of elections becoming much more progressive compared to the civil liberties’ transitions. <br /...|$|R
