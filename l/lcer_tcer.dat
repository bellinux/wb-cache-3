40|$|The Milan {{conference of}} the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has {{established}} two types of emission offsets under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), valid for afforestation and reforestation activities. In order {{to account for the}} non-permanent nature of carbon storage in forests, these credits expire after a predefined periods, after which the buyer needs to replace them. The present article assesses their market value in relation to "permanent" credits, identifies their specific risks and proposes how to mitigate and manage them. It analyzes strengths and weaknesses of expiring credits for sellers and buyers. Taking the example of the EU emissions trading system, the authors discuss how expiring credits could reach fungibility with permanent emission allowances on domestic markets.

40|$|Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, forest {{projects}} {{can receive}} returns for carbon sequestration via two credit instruments: temporary (tCERs) or long-term certified emission reductions (lCERs). This article develops a theoretical model of optimal harvesting strategies that compares private optimal harvest decision under these two instruments. We find that risk neutral landowners {{are likely to}} prefer instituting <b>lCERs</b> over <b>tCERs</b> to maximize surplus. A particular type of early harvest penalty implemented under the lCERs is critical in determining the length of rotation intervals and the carbon credit supply. When this penalty is an increasing function {{of the difference in}} biomass before and after harvesting across verification periods, the landowner may choose longer or shorter rotation intervals compared to the Faustmann rotation. The resulting supply curve may have a backward bending region over a range of carbon prices. forest rotation, long term certified emission reductions (lCERs), carbon sequestration, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 2, Q 54, Q 23,...|$|R
