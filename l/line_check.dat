5000|$|The {{fuel system}} of a hit-and-miss engine {{consists}} of a fuel tank, fuel <b>line,</b> <b>check</b> valve and fuel mixer. The fuel tank most typically holds gasoline but many users would start the engines with gasoline and then switch over to a cheaper fuel such as kerosene or diesel [...] The fuel line connects the fuel tank to the mixer. Along the fuel line, a check valve keeps the fuel from running back to the tank between combustion strokes. The mixer creates the correct fuel-air mixture {{by means of a}} needle valve attached to a weighted or spring-loaded piston usually in conjunction with an oil-damped dashpot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first issue}} has been widely {{dismissed}} {{by many in the}} power industry. Line workers are already constantly exposed to unexpectedly live wires in the course of normal events (i.e. is a house blacked out because it has no power, or because they pulled the main breaker inside?). Normal operating procedures under hot-line rules or dead-line rules require line workers to test for power as a matter of course, and it has been calculated that active islands would add a negligible risk.
