5|$|Because of its Red <b>Line</b> <b>connection,</b> Porter Square {{can serve}} as a {{temporary}} inbound terminus for the Fitchburg Line service when commuter rail service is disrupted between Porter and Boston's North Station.

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight <b>line</b> <b>connection</b> from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the Culver Ramp, also {{referred}} to as the Culver <b>Line</b> <b>Connection,</b> between the Church Avenue and Ditmas Avenue stations began in June 1941, and was expected to be completed {{by the end of the}} year. The ramp was expected to cost $2 million, and along with new signals, and rehabilitation of the Culver elevated and lengthening of its stations to IND standards, the total cost of the project was estimated at over $11 million. 170 subway cars were purchased for $8,500,000 for the extension of IND service. Two substations, a signal tower, a fourth track at Ditmas Avenue, and an additional stairway at Ditmas Avenue were all completed as part of the project. McDonald Avenue was also widened between Avenue C and Cortelyou Road to facilitate the ramp. Though the ramp was nearly complete, including rails and signal work, construction was halted later that year because of America's entrance into World War II. When the project was restarted in 1946, completion was delayed further due to continued material shortages and a lack of rolling stock to facilitate the new service. On October 30, 1954, the connection between the IND Brooklyn Line at Church Avenue and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue opened. This allowed IND trains to operate all the way to the Coney Islandâ€“Stillwell Avenue terminal.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{original}} infrastructure has either been removed, damaged, rotted or undermined, though some rails, wooden ties, electrical towers and even de-electrified third rails can still be found in some sections, with much of it dating from 1908 or earlier, when the line was originally electrified. The failure to reactivate the northern portion of the line had been attributed to the potential high costs of connecting it to the Queens Boulevard Line, and capacity issues on the line which persist to day, making the Fulton <b>line</b> <b>connection</b> more feasible. There are proposals for rail service and a rail trail on this right-of-way. One proposal juxtaposes both plans.|$|E

Additionally, flight rules which required a 72-hour separation between dockings at the International Space Station threatened to delay the launch by at least a day due to the delayed launch of the ESA's unmanned Johannes Kepler ATV supply craft. Managers instead decided to press ahead with the countdown allowing for a possible standdown; had docking issues arisen with the ATV, STS-133 would have stood down for 48 hours.

25|$|Early {{programming}} often featured live musical {{performances by}} a band composed of Westinghouse employees. The station provided its first remote broadcast on January 2, 1921, airing a religious service from Calvary Episcopal Church. The Calvary services {{soon became a}} regular Sunday evening offering, and were continued until 1962. On January 15, 1921, at 8 p.m., KDKA broadcast a speech on European relief by Herbert Hoover from the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh, that was carried ten miles (sixteen kilometers) by a telephone <b>line</b> <b>connection</b> to Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh Works. On July 2, 1921, an announcer repeated the ringside commentary, sent by telegraph, from the Jack Dempsey - Georges Carpentier fight in New Jersey. On August 5, 1921, KDKA became the first radio station to broadcast a major league professional baseball game, when announcer Harold W. Arlin called the Pittsburgh Pirates-Philadelphia Phillies game from Forbes Field. In the fall of that year, the station became the first to broadcast a college football game. In 1922, KDKA hosted political humorist Will Rogers in his first radio appearance.|$|E
25|$|As the {{popularity}} of the motorcar increased, train services were severely cut back {{due to the lack of}} patronage, and the number of services passing through Tunbridge Wells West declined as one line after another was closed from the 1950s onwards. First, the East Grinstead to Lewes line closed in 1958, then the Cuckoo Line in 1965, the Three Bridges to Groombridge in 1967, and finally the Wealden Line in 1969. Tunbridge Wells West was itself listed for closure in 1966, only to be subsequently reprieved. The line to Tunbridge Wells West remained open, although in its latter years passenger services were mainly confined to a shuttle service between Tonbridge (via the single <b>line</b> <b>connection</b> to Tunbridge Wells Central - now plain Tunbridge Wells) and Eridge with a few through trains to Uckfield; however there was a depot at the station which housed rolling stock for services on the Uckfield and East Grinstead - London (via East Croydon) lines, and there were plenty of empty stock moves early and late in the day.|$|E

25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and <b>line</b> <b>connections,</b> both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two <b>line</b> <b>connections,</b> each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between <b>line</b> <b>connections</b> each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|R

500|$|None {{of these}} options came to pass, and the 63rd Street Line was opened in 1989 {{after more than}} a decade of delays, its {{terminal}} station at 21st Street, rendering the once-grandiosely-planned line a [...] "useless subway to nowhere". In 1990, a modified version of the Queens Boulevard <b>Line</b> <b>connection</b> was selected, with connections to both the local and express Queens Boulevard tracks. In 2001, the 63rd Street Connection was completed between the Queens stub of the 63rd Street Line at 29th Street and the 36th Street station of the Queens Boulevard line, allowing service from both Queens Boulevard local and express trains to serve the line. The connection cost $645 million and resulted in several major service changes (see below). Under the 1985 connector plans, the , [...] (which operated on Queens Boulevard until 1987), [...] (then called the QB), and a resurrected K Sixth Avenue route, were among the routes to be extended along Queens Boulevard or a bypass route via 63rd Street, while the F would have retained its routing via 53rd Street.
