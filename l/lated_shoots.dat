50|$|Sekulović {{started his}} career in the <b>late</b> 1940s, <b>shooting</b> {{newsreels}} commissioned by the Yugoslav People's Army. His first experience with filmmaking came in 1947, when he was assistant to cinematographer Žorž Skrigin during the making of the war drama Slavica (directed by Vjekoslav Afrić). The following year Sekulović shot his first feature film, Immortal Youth (Besmrtna mladost). He went on to shoot some 20 feature films in a prolific career which spanned almost three decades and which earned him four Golden Arena for Best Cinematography awards at the Pula Film Festival, the Yugoslav national film awards festival.|$|R

When he accuses Dell, she pretends it is true in order to protect her sister. Furious and drunk, Bob goes back to Vic's place. Dell chases after him, but is too <b>late.</b> Bob <b>shoots</b> and kills Vic in the elevator. The siblings quickly leave the scene.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{launched}} in April 2015 with a formal ceremony marking the beginning of production.

25|$|On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White {{was trying}} {{to break up a}} group of <b>late</b> revelers <b>shooting</b> at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. He {{attempted}} to confiscate the pistol of Curly Bill Brocius and was shot in the abdomen. Wyatt Earp buffaloed Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and had not noticed that Brocius' pistol was already on the ground. The pistol contained only one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. White died two days after his shooting, changing Brocius' charge to murder.|$|R

Shoots first begin to the appear in spring, following bud break, accelerating growth till the flowering stage and usually slowly {{by the time that}} the vine begins veraison.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced in mid-2008, and {{the film}} was mostly shot in Mumbai. During a <b>late</b> night <b>shoot</b> for a scene in Pune, Chopra received minor injuries. Chopra was supposed to ride a motorcycle with Kapoor seated on the pillion seat. Both fell off the motorcycle as it skidded on mud. Kapoor was unhurt but Chopra received scratch marks and bruises. It was reported that Kapoor suffered from several injuries while shooting. During filming, Chopra became hoarse because she had to scream her lines; {{an essential part of}} her role as an [...] "extremely vocal Maharashtrian girl." [...] Some important railway sequences were shot at Wadi Bunder Yard near Sandhurst Road. Kapoor found filming for both of his characters at nearly the same time very difficult; he would shoot them on alternate days.|$|R
40|$|Salinity is a {{well-known}} stressor of Phragmites australis (common reed), leading to reduced success in brackish and salt marshes. Although saline, many remaining salt marshes in New England are changing in structure and function due to tidal restrictions and rapid proliferation of P. australis. The poor reputation of this native plant (its dominance is used {{as an indicator of}} marsh degradation) has stimulated management and research using natural stressors for control. Our field study associated natural variability in soil salinity levels over time and space with vigor and spread rates of P. australis. Over 2 years, salinity was measured 15 times from three depth intervals (5 – 20, 35 – 50, and 65 – 80 cm) at five stations established in six colonies of P. australis. Our results indicated that salinity in tidal marshes varied temporally due to the extent of tidal flooding (salinity was greater during spring tides compared with neap tides) and regional freshwater runoff (salinity was lower in the spring). If the growing season is split into early (May–July) and late (August–October) periods, interesting patterns emerged (salinity increased with depth early, but decreased with depth <b>late).</b> <b>Shoot</b> height, cover, and expansion rate of the six colonies were measured twice over 3 years. In general, the stands of P. australis were expanding into salt marsh at 0. 35 m per year, and increasing in cover (8 % per year), even though the canopy height decreased at all but two of the sites over the study period. Salinity was lower in marshes where tides were artificially restricted (11 – 16 ppt compared with 19 – 24 ppt for the natural marshes), and one of these sites exhibited rapid P. australis expansion. At sites with natural hydrology, P. australis appeared to be expanding more slowly, shading out marsh species, and perhaps avoiding salinity stress by accessing natural sources of fresher water at different soil depths during different seasons...|$|R

Annals of Applied Biology, 149 (3), 337 - 345. When grown in Europe, Miscanthus genotypes often produce yields lower than their potential due to <b>late</b> emergence of <b>shoots</b> {{in the spring}} or to damage from <b>late</b> frosts when <b>shoots</b> emerge too early. Here, we investigate genotypic {{variation in}} the base temperature (Tb) for shoot emergence and in the lethal temperature for shoots (LT 50) in four Miscanthus genotypes. In all genotypes, lowering temperature increased the time to shoot emergence, with Tb ranging from 8. 6 ?C in Sac- 5 to 6 ?C in Sin-H 9. Frost treatments below ? 8 ?C resulted in a marked reduction in growth in all four genotypes. Sin-H 9 was the most frost tolerant with an LT 50 of ? 9. 3 ?C. There was little variation found in leaf osmotic potential, but leaf moisture content was significantly lower in Sin-H 9 than in the other genotypes. The lower thermal requirement for emergence and lower LT 50 seen in Sin-H 9 was incorporated into a model of Miscanthus production. The model showed an extended growing season that was predicted to increase yields by up to 25 %. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the vulnerability of selected silver fir populations to damage from late frost in the climatic conditions of south-eastern Poland. To determine the vulnerability of apical and lateral shoots to damage caused by late frosts, we observed four test plots in 2009 and 2014, each containing progenies of selected seed stands. Our statistical analyses were based on a model incorporating the following variables: site, year, type of frost damage, population as well as the possible interaction between these variables. Significant differences between the populations were found in terms of their sensitivity to damage from low temperature occurring during the growth period. Furthermore, we indirectly demonstrated differences in the severity of late frost on the experimental plots and the intensity variability of <b>late</b> frost <b>shoot</b> damage. Based on these results, we divided the studied populations into two groups of low (EF, KRA 1 and NAR) and high (LES 2 and BAL 2) sensitivity to late frost damage. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
50|$|Later, {{the girls}} were greeted by Chris who {{told them that they}} would be {{starring}} in a new music video for Opshop. The girls learned the choreography and put it to use posing elegantly in wind. Then, they were told that three girls would be selected to stay <b>late</b> and <b>shoot</b> more of the video underwater. Lara, Elza and Danielle were picked and Nellie was chosen as a fourth girl because the director liked the idea of having twins so he could get double the takes. The girls performed in the cold pool until 5 in the morning. Back in the model house, the unselected girls Dakota, Courtenay and Michaela were having dinner until Dakota decided to speak ill of Lara and her figure. Michaela found Dakota's negativity irritating thus telling her to grow up and feeling the need to punch her. Dakota said she was just being realistic and encouraged Michaela to start a fight with her.|$|R
