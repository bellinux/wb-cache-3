The episode is unique in that it was intentionally crafted to feature Martin Landau alone.

It was inferred that Crael had served his sentence, but remained {{out of a sense of}} duty to act as defence counsel for the inmates. More dialogue about the rights of the imprisoned was also excised; (3) A sequence in the security ward was removed where, faced with Fraser's threat of attack, the Entrans view Koenig's knowledge of Earth warfare. <b>Library</b> <b>footage</b> would have depicted the history of war from marching Roman legions to the Hiroshima atomic bomb ...|$|E

5000|$|Filming used {{conventional}} Super 16mm film, {{which was}} then processed and edited in England. The cinematographer, David Higgs, had been keen to try the new Red One high resolution digital camera. However, the team were concerned by the potentially limited contrast ratio using digital - a serious consideration in strong Mediterranean light - and that its potential bulkiness might inhibit Kosminsky's trademark hand-held cameras following the action. It was also felt that relying on comparatively simple well-known technology would be sensible operating so far from home. Ironically, however, the reliance on film led {{to a number of}} scenes having to be re-mounted after fogging went undetected for a week when it was impossible to get daily film rushes back to London because of the air travel disruption caused by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. [...] Extensive use was also made of CGI and digital post-production, including for the café explosion, the destruction at the King David Hotel, and the refugee ship of would-be immigrants. [...] A particular challenge was how to realise the events at Bergen-Belsen. The film-makers considered and rejected a number of options, including live-action and CGI, before reluctantly deciding to fall back on black-and-white <b>library</b> <b>footage</b> from the Imperial War Museum in London, only to come to the view that the resulting sequence had more artistic and moral power than anything they {{might have been able to}} create.|$|E

Future developments Whereas the amount and nature of <b>library</b> <b>footage</b> {{being used in the}} programme in the future is unlikely to change significantly, the method of retrieving it will probably alter radically. Greater user access to the Elstree VT Library catalogue and collection will undoubtedly occur. In the near future reporters are {{likely to be able to}} call up the catalogue on their terminals in the Newsroom. In time, the actuai pictures themselves will probably be available on-line as well, thanks to digital technology. The new generation of computer literate, multi-skilled journalists will come to expect such sophisticated systems. Newsroom South East will almost certainly start using digital cameras when it moves to its new base in central London in 1997. This may well act as the catalyst towards a fully digital library service, with consequent far reaching implications for the Elstree VT Library staff and users. References 1. Lee, David.
