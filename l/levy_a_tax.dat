25|$|In {{addition}} to the taxes mentioned above, the cantons are free to introduce others. Several cantons levy an inheritance tax (Erbschaftssteuer / Imposta di successione) and a gift tax (Schenkungssteuer / Imposta di donazione), {{although there is a}} trend towards abolishing those. Moreover, the cantons are required by federal law to <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on the profit from the sale of real estate (Grundstückgewinnsteuer / impôt sur les gains immobiliers / Imposta sugli utili immobiliari). Most also <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on the value of the property sold (Handänderungssteuer / impôt sur les mutations / Tassa di mutazione) so as to discourage speculation in real estate. Taxes are also frequently levied on the ownership of dogs and motor vehicles, on lotteries, on the sale of tickets to public entertainments, or on overnight stays in certain tourist destinations.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{the school}} was {{supported}} by tuition payments. But gradually the State began to assume {{a share of the}} financial responsibility. In 1820, a law authorized townships to <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> to pay the tuition of poor students. By 1828, townships had the power to tax for general school purposes. The State itself began to contribute money in 1830, and in 1846 every township was required to raise as much money each year for schools as the State itself contributed. The last tuition assessment for residents occurred in 1861, and thereafter the Columbia School was entirely supported by public taxation.|$|E
25|$|In 1637, Grandmaster Giovanni Paolo Lascaris {{set out to}} <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of 50,000 scudi on the Maltese for the {{construction}} of the Floriana Lines. The Grandmaster ignored a protest against the tax by the Maltese clergy, lodged with Pope Urban VIII. The Pope sided with the Order against the laity and the clergy, and the Grandmaster ordered taxmen to start their collections. The tax collectors met immediately with opposition and an uprising began in September in Żejtun, the first village where collection was attempted. The leaders hoped to assemble the people at Marsa, then to march on Valletta as a procession with a cross or some statue of a saint. The parish priest of Żejtun was alarmed at these preparations, particularly the suggestions to bear arms in the protest, and informed Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa. The Bishop sent the priest to the inquisitor, Fabio Chigi, later Pope Alexander VII, who ordered him to report everything to the grandmaster. The latter imprisoned the lay leaders of the revolt. Acting on Chigi's advice, the grandmaster did not arrest local priests, even if there were suspicions they were involved in the revolt.|$|E

25|$|Willem Kieft was {{appointed}} Director of New Netherland by the Dutch West India Company in 1639, {{with one of}} his orders to increase profits from pelts for the fur trade at Achter Kol and its port at Pavonia. Kieft attempted to <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on the Tappan but was ignored. The payment of tribute was common among the tribes, and the British had forced upon it the Pequots. In February 1643, the Mahicans attacked Wappinger encampments in order to collect overdue payment. At first they fled to New Amsterdam, but after 14 days, fearing their for their safety they scattered themselves among the Hackensack and Tappan at Communipaw and to Corlears Hook. Kieft ordered they be attacked on February 25, 1643. The initial strike was a slaughter: 129 Dutch soldiers killed approximately 120 people (including women and children): eighty at Pavonia and thirty at Corlear's Hook (Lower East Side). Overcoming their other rivalries in face of a common enemy, the indigenous populations united and retaliated in October of the same year, attacking the plantations at Pavonia, with survivors fleeing to the fort at the tip of Manhattan. The brewery at Hoebuk survived, its roof not being made of thatch. De Vries, with interest in and better contact with the local population, was able to negotiate temporarily holding off attacks at his farm and the Achter Kol Colony, from which settlers were evacuated. In August 1643, Oratam (representing his people and other groups), agreed to a truce with the New Netherlanders. Unfortunately the peace did not hold and {{for the next two years}} the whole of the province was at war. It was not until August 30, 1645 that a treaty to cease hostilities was finally concluded.|$|E
500|$|The village {{assembly}} {{was responsible}} for collecting government land taxes. Land revenue was called Siddhaya and included the original assessment (Kula) plus various cesses. Taxes were levied on professions, marriages, goods in transit on chariots or carriages, and domesticated animals. Taxes on commodities (gold, precious stones, perfumes, sandalwood, ropes, yarn, housing, hearths, shops, cattle pans, sugarcane presses) as well as produce [...] (black pepper, betel leaves, ghee, paddy, spices, palm leaves, coconuts, sugar) are noted in village records. The village assembly could <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> for a specific purpose such as construction of a water tank.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{placed a}} limit upon the westward {{expansion}} of the American colonies. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida). The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings {{and the possibility of}} French incursions. The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to [...] "no taxation without representation". In 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.|$|E

2500|$|The state's general {{sales tax}} rate is 4%. Sales tax rates for cities and {{counties}} are also added to purchases. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% {{and there is an}} additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal. , sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is one of seven states that <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on food {{at the same rate as}} other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families.

2500|$|Due to this restriction, {{application}} of the income tax to income derived from real estate and specifically income {{in the form of}} dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states; that is to say, there was no guarantee that a State with 10% of the country's population paid 10% of those income taxes collected, because Congress had not fixed an amount of money to be raised and apportioned it between the States according to their respective shares of the national population. [...] To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on income [...] "from whatever source derived" [...] without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Laws of Oléron the whalemen of Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and {{the rest}} of the French Basque country were exempt from taxation, {{although}} they voluntarily gave the whales' tongues to the church as a gift. It wasn't until the kings of England, acting as the Dukes of Guyenne, that charges began to be enacted against them. In 1197, the future King John of England (r. 1199–1216) gave Vital de Biole and his heirs and successors the right to <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of 50 angevin livres on the first two whales taken annually at Biarritz, in exchange for the rent of the fishery at Guernsey. In 1257, William Lavielle gave the bishop and chapter of Bayonne a tithe of the whales caught by the men of the same port. This was paid until 1498. In 1261, an act of the Abbey of Honce announced, as a continuation of the tradition of giving the tongue as a gift to the church, a tithe was to be paid on the whales landed at Bayonne. Under a 1324 edict known as De Praerogativa Regis (The Royal Prerogative), Edward II (r. 1307–27) collected a duty on the whales caught in British waters, which included the French Basque coast. His successor, Edward III (r. 1327–77), continued this tradition by collecting a £6 tax for each whale taken and landed at Biarritz. In 1338, this was relinquished to Peter de Puyanne, admiral of the English fleet stationed at Bayonne.|$|E

6000|$|The {{kings and}} princes disliked this {{alienation}} of property very greatly. In the place of feudal lords capable of military support, they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns. And these lands were really under foreign dominion.

If that power rested with the Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions.

[...] "The only hope is in the Holy Father," [...] who should appoint an episcopal commission of visitation. For about forty years prelates have been alienating Church lands illegally, and churches and monasteries, by the avarice of those placed in charge, are crumbling to decay.
