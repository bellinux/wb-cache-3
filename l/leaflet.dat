5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) <b>leaflet</b> is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) <b>leaflet</b> is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E

5|$|Arad's local newspaper, Kidod, was {{published}} by the entrepreneurs Eli and Rochale Ziv, early founders of Arad. Kidod started as a small <b>leaflet</b> in December 1966 and grew to a become a full paper. At its peak, it was circulated, free of charge, in groceries, kiosks, etc., in 3,000 copies each week.

5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single <b>leaflet</b> need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external <b>leaflet.</b> Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E

5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one <b>leaflet</b> from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Antoine posted an {{advertisement}} in the Spiritist journal The Messenger (Le Messager), seeking doctors who would associate with him, but the attempt {{did not meet}} with success.

In 1905, he consultated up to 400 patients per day. Around the same time, he published a four-page <b>leaflet</b> which commented passages of the Gospels without reference to Spiritism.|$|E
5|$|In April {{and early}} May, ethnic {{tensions}} in Zadar and northern Dalmatia escalated after increased sabotage activities targeting communications, the power distribution grid and other property.

The news incited riots in Zadar that day, with crowds marching through the city centre demanding weapons to confront the Croatian Serbs and smashing the windows of shops owned by Serbian companies and Serbs living in the city. Croat-owned businesses in Knin were destroyed in retaliation during the night of 7–8 May. The JNA took an active role in events in nearby Benkovac on 19 May, distributing a <b>leaflet</b> with the names of 41 Croats targeted for immediate execution and providing weapons to SAO Krajina forces in the area. In late May, the conflict gradually escalated to exchanges of mortar fire.|$|E

5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, after three estate managers were murdered {{by members of}} the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Australian involvement began in June 1950, when in response to a British request, six Lincolns from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force (FEAF). The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as paratroop and <b>leaflet</b> drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist (CT) jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation Termite, five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps, killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing. Based at RAAF Base Butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the second}} series, Tom starts a brief {{relationship}} with Vicky Westbrook (Natasha Little), which he ends due to her behaviour after an EERIE (Extreme Emergency Response Initiative Exercise) in the fifth episode. In the following episode, Vicky retaliates by posting his phone number in Soho telephone boxes and clubs, garnering him unwanted attention. While Tom has Sam Buxton (Shauna Macdonald) find and destroy every <b>leaflet,</b> CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds) makes Vicky stop the harassment. At {{the end of the}} episode, he starts a relationship with Dale, which superior Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) disapproves of, demanding that he end it. In later episodes, a shift in consciousness starts to interfere with Tom's work, such as when he goes undercover to stop a renegade British Army major. In the series two finale, he learns from Dale that an American assassin, Mickey Karharias, is visiting the UK. It is later revealed Karharias was actually killed, and the entire operation was orchestrated by supposedly dead CIA agent Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana), who is seeking revenge on Tom for ruining his daughter's life when Tom recruited her. Joyce frames Tom for assassinating the Chief of the Defence Staff. While Tom attempts to prove his innocence, Harry corners him, forcing Tom to wound Harry and escape into the North Sea. At the end of the episode, the team assumes he drowned.|$|E

There {{are a number of}} popular readability formulas and tools that have been successfully used to assess the readability of health-related information in several languages. However, there is limited work on the readability assessment of health-related information, specifically medicine information <b>leaflets</b> in Arabic. We describe the design of a tool that uses machine learning to assess the readability of medicine information <b>leaflets.</b> We utilize a corpus comprising 1112 medicine information <b>leaflets</b> annotated with three difficulty levels. Based on a study of existing literature, we selected a number of features influencing text difficulty. The tool will help specialized organizations in medicine information <b>leaflets</b> production to produce the <b>leaflets</b> at appropriate level of reading for the majority of <b>leaflets</b> consumers...|$|R
