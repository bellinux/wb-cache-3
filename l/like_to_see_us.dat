500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E
2500|$|Pulitzer Prize-winning Korean War {{correspondent}} Marguerite Higgins was the staunchest pro-Diệm {{journalist in}} the Saigon press corps, frequently clashing with her younger male colleagues such as Neil Sheehan, Peter Arnett, and Halberstam. She claimed they had ulterior motives, saying [...] "reporters here would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> lose {{the war to}} prove they're right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Governor of New Mexico and 2012 Libertarian Party presidential {{candidate}} Gary Johnson visited Occupy Wall Street in October 2011 and expressed support, stating [...] "This {{country is not}} equal. We don't treat everyone equally. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> focus on the root cause, which is in my estimation politicians that are getting paid off. That's the corporatism and the outrage." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} who had charge of the place seemed glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how much we liked it, as is natural enough, for {{everybody}} <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> pleased with the particular things they have on hand.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Michelle would reunite Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) {{in the aftermath of the}} upcoming mini bus crash storyline. It was also confirmed that Michelle and Steve would be the next Weatherfield couple to tie the knot. Speaking of this Marsh said; [...] "I'm delighted, absolutely delighted. It'll be weird after being Michelle Connor for nearly nine years, but it totally makes sense for us as characters. Simon and I love working together, and nobody <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> broken up." [...] It was also revealed that Michelle would get [...] "feisty" [...] again when her Steve is blamed for the mini-bus crash.|$|R
60|$|We {{sent for}} the doctor, {{but he could}} not do {{anything}} really. It had been a death-blow, though the illness lasted a full week. He knew <b>us</b> generally, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> but he always had the sense that something dreadful had happened to us; and he would stroke my hand or Jaquetta's, and pity us. He was haunted, too, by the sense that he ought to do something for us which he could not do. We thought he meant to make a will, securing us something, but he was never in a condition in which my brother would have felt justified in getting him to sign it. Indeed there was so little disease about him, and we thought he would get better, if only we could keep him free from distress and excitement; so we made his room as quiet as possible, and discouraged his talking or thinking.|$|R
2500|$|When {{to trigger}} Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, {{formally}} beginning {{the process of}} withdrawal from the European Union by the UK. May and Gove both stated {{that they would not}} invoke Article 50 before 2017. Leadsom called for a quick invocation of Article 50 and short negotiations, although she did not put forward a specific timeframe. Fox put forward a specific date, saying: [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> leaving the EU on January 1, 2019. That means we will have to activate the Article 50 process {{by the end of this}} year." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it easier {{for you to go}} and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warne {{played down}} his achievement, commenting that [...] "I {{was just trying}} to tie up an end and I got a bit lucky", while his skipper noted that [...] "Shane is like the West Indian bowlers – when he gets on top he gets all over you". Atherton was unhappy at the post-match press conference. [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> lie down and die," [...] he said, {{referring}} to his decision to have Alec Stewart bat in the second innings despite a broken finger, but he admitted that [...] "we got walloped in the first two Tests... We've got some good players [...] we're not playing especially well at the moment." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald was less charitable towards England's performances to date, with Patrick Smith claiming that [...] "Wisden should count England wickets as just a half", and deploring Atherton's lack of aggression in the field. He also derided Gooch, Gatting and Hick, and picked out the way that the visitors' batsmen got themselves out so readily.|$|E
5000|$|Dexter wrote that, when Holt {{drowned in}} December 1967, the {{advantages}} that the Council for Aboriginal Affairs {{had hoped for}} by {{being part of the}} Prime Minister's Department did not eventuate. The next Prime Minister John Gorton was not interested in Aboriginal affairs, and his department was unfriendly. Gorton subsequently appointed W.C. Wentworth as Minister-in-charge. Later when William McMahon became Prime Minister, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs became part of what Dexter called [...] "an improbable creation", the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. Dexter wrote that Wentworth [...] "would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> dissolved" [...] but despite strong opposition from some parts of the Government, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs succeeded in developing an evolving stance on Aboriginal development, landownership and identity politics, its relationship with successive departments, ministers and prime ministers and also emerging indigenous bodies. The Council had a deep and complicated involvement in indigenous policy formation.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2007, the Des Moines Register {{found that}} among Republicans [...] "one-half of likely {{participants}} in the party’s caucuses would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rice, the <b>U.S.</b> secretary of state, campaign for president", a greater portion than for Fred Thompson or Newt Gingrich.|$|R
50|$|The tenth house, {{of which}} the cusp is often (but not always) the Midheaven, refers to our careers, vocations, {{creative}} output, and how we would <b>like</b> the world <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us.</b> For Ptolemy, it also was the house where our children's impact can be seen.|$|R

6000|$|... "To a sane {{point of}} view {{concerning}} the holiness of the aristocracy," [...] Lucille answered. [...] "I am afraid though that I have made very little impression. In his heart I believe Mr. Brott would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> all working for our living, school-teachers and dressmakers, {{and that sort of}} thing, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't do {{anything}} about that claim now. Our claim is established by law, and he is nothing but an escaped jailbird. But I agree he may give us lots of trouble in other directions. I presume he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> all hung for the way we got ahead {{of him and his}} tools." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant". She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that you have the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in <b>US</b> law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|R
6000|$|On Tuesday morning, the [...] "Tigris" [...] {{made her}} {{appearance}} on time, and Mr. Cholott and our good landlady came down <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> off. The yellow-legged party also came down, but not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> off. They, too, {{were going to}} Nassau.|$|R
6000|$|... "He can <b>see</b> <b>us</b> if he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us," [...] remarked Davidson. Then {{he had an}} afterthought: [...] "I say! I hope he won't think I am intruding, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At length, as we {{were passing}} a humble and solitary dwelling, the gentleman said to me, 'There is a young woman sick in this house; should {{you like to go}} in and see her?' 'Yes sir' said I, 'very much. She can have very few visiters I think, in this lonely place, and if you think she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> I should like to go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|We all moved silently to {{the lee of}} {{the outer}} wall, so that our voices might not carry up to the sick woman lying there under the eaves, almost within hand reach. [...] "Yes, sir." [...] "No, sir." [...] "Yes, ma'am." [...] This, and the constant, unforgettable supplication of his eyes, was all that came from him; yet he seemed loath to let us go, as though he thought we had some mysterious power to help him--the magic, perhaps, of money, {{to those who have}} none. Grateful at our promise of another doctor, a specialist, he yet seemed with his eyes to say that he knew that such were only embroideries of Fate. And when we had wrung his hand and gone, we heard him coming after us: His wife had said she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> please. Would we come up? ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is useless}} their {{telling us that}} when we die we are {{instantly}} judged and packed straight off to some region where we are destined to spend an eternity. We know better. Nature, our own hearts, have taught us differently. Furthermore, we {{have heard of the}} resurrection--that the dead will rise again at the last day; and with all our willingness to believe what our masters tell us, we know that even a dead man can't be in two places at the same time. Our dead are here where we laid them; sleeping, no doubt, but not so soundly sleeping, we imagine, as not to see and hear us when we visit and speak to them. And being villagers still though dead, they <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> often, whenever we have a few spare minutes to call round and exchange a few words with them.|$|E

6000|$|... [September 20?]--Yesterday, Wordsworth, his son [nephew[466]] and daughter, came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> {{and we went}} up to Yarrow. The {{eldest son}} of Lord Ravensworth also came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us,</b> with his {{accomplished}} lady.

5000|$|Regarding {{deregulation}} of the financial services industry, Toomey said in 1999: [...] "The trend in deregulation, {{beginning in the early}} 1980s, {{is one of the biggest}} reasons for the sustained economic expansion. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>us</b> continue to deregulate on many fronts, including the financial services industry." ...|$|E
