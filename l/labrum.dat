5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs {{from the top of}} the head downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The <b>labrum</b> is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in the centre of the <b>labrum</b> with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 2015 it was {{announced}} Davis would undergo surgery to repair a torn hip <b>labrum,</b> ending his season.|$|E
5|$|After the season, Kemp {{underwent}} {{surgery on his}} sore shoulder to repair a torn <b>labrum</b> and some minor damage to his rotator cuff. He {{was told that he}} wouldn't be able to swing a bat again until January.|$|E
5|$|The body becomes wider {{towards the}} head, {{which has a}} {{conspicuous}} mandibular groove. It also bears a pair of stalked compound eyes, {{as well as a}} sessile median eye, two pairs of antennae, and the mouthparts. The mouthparts comprise a <b>labrum,</b> directed backwards over the mouth and pairs of mandibles, paragnatha, maxillules and vestigial maxillae.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} {{the season with}} a 4–2 record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list. His final start occurred on June 14. He was initially placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 19, but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. In August, he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial tears in his <b>labrum.</b> He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation.|$|E
5|$|On June 3, 2013, it was {{announced}} that Lysacek would compete at one ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating event, the 2013 Skate America. However, on September 30, 2013, it {{was announced}} that he had withdrawn. On December 10, 2013, Lysacek announced on The Today Show that he would not attempt to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, due to the <b>labrum</b> injury which he sustained in September.|$|E
5|$|The larvae have silk glands {{which are}} located on the labium. These glands are {{modified}} salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the <b>labrum</b> are the mandibles. On {{each side of the}} head there are usually six stemmata just above the mandibles. These stemmata are arranged in a semicircle. Below the stemmata there is a small pair of antennae, one on each side.|$|E
5|$|Wake Forest {{began the}} 2006 season on September 2 {{with a home}} game against Big East conference {{opponent}} Syracuse. Wake defeated Syracuse 2010, but starting quarterback Benjamin Mauk suffered a season-ending injury when he fractured his arm, dislocated his shoulder, and suffered a torn <b>labrum.</b> Backup quarterback Riley Skinner replaced Mauk in the game, and would serve as Wake's starting quarterback {{for the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the Canucks' Game 7 loss, Kesler was awarded the Selke Trophy after {{finishing}} as a runner-up the previous two years. He received 1,179 voting points in comparison to runners-up Jonathan Toews' 476 and Pavel Datsyuk's 348. Kesler was also ranked eighth in Hart Memorial Trophy voting as the league's most valuable player. Later in the off-season, Kesler underwent arthroscopic surgery for the torn <b>labrum</b> in his hip. Unrelated to his <b>labrum</b> tear in 2007, he had adopted a program to recuperate from the injury naturally until a specialist advised him to have surgery in late-July 2011. The Canucks announced on August 2 that Kesler had successfully undergone the procedure, while it was also reported {{he would not be}} ready to play until mid-October. On schedule, he returned to the lineup on October 18 against the New York Rangers after missing the first five games of the 2011–12 season. Appearing in 77 contests, Kesler recorded his lowest scoring total in four years with 22 goals, 27 assists and 49 points. On a team basis, the Canucks remained a successful regular season team, winning their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy. They failed to defend their Western Conference playoff title, however, losing in the first round to the Los Angeles Kings in five games. Kesler recorded three assists in the series.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was still {{believed}} to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When {{the pain in his}} hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip <b>labrum</b> and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, Harris was {{diagnosed}} with a torn <b>labrum</b> in her right hip which occurred during a goal kick. Harris did not miss any games following the injury and instead switched to mainly using her left leg and dealt with the pain. Dorrance again employed the two-goalkeeper method, as Harris split time with junior goalkeeper, Anna Rodenbough. The two goalkeepers alternated starts and played for half of each game. Harris played in 19 games and made 9 starts, playing a total of 1120 minutes. She allowed nine goals and recorded 29 saves, giving a 0.763 save percentage. UNC lost their match against Notre Dame in the third round of the 2007 NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament on November 24, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{adapted for}} aerial {{movement}} and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the eyes, the antennae, and the mouthparts (the <b>labrum,</b> labium, mandible, and maxilla {{make up the}} mouthparts). The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; {{the first and third}} segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, some of which may be fused, and with the 3 hindermost segments modified for reproduction.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} 2011 {{season with a}} run in the 150m {{straight}} race at Manchester's Great City Games and timed 14.51 seconds (the second fastest after Bolt's 2009 run). His season's best run of 9.79sec for the 100m came in June in Clermont, Florida and ranked it him as the third fastest {{in the event that}} year. Gay was defeated by Steve Mullings at the adidas Grand Prix in New York – Mullings failed a doping test later that month and was banned for life. A nagging hip injury led to Gay's withdrawal from the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and in July he underwent acetabular <b>labrum</b> surgery; almost a year passed until the next time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn <b>labrum</b> and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E
5|$|After playing 48 {{games in}} the 2006–07 NHL season, Kesler {{suffered}} a torn acetabular <b>labrum</b> and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season, finishing the season with sixteen points. Kesler returned to the Canucks lineup for the first game of their quarterfinal playoff series versus the Dallas Stars. While blocking a shot in the fourth overtime of the game, Kesler was re-injured, suffering a displaced index finger. Despite finishing the game, Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs. In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007. In comparison to his previous contract, facilitated by the Flyers' offer sheet, the deal represented a $150,000 paycut in terms of average annual salary.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn <b>labrum,</b> he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the pain for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped <b>labrum</b> and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 1993, Taylor {{was injured}} while {{defending}} his brother Brenden in a fistfight. The New York Times reported that Brenden confronted {{a man named}} Ron Wilson, who he had fought with in Harlowe, North Carolina. Brenden suffered head lacerations in his fight with Wilson. Once Brien found out his brother had been hurt, he and a cousin went to Wilson's trailer home to confront him. There, Taylor got into an altercation with Jamie Morris, Wilson's friend, and Taylor fell on his shoulder. According to Wilson, Taylor attempted to throw a haymaker at Morris, and missed, which caused the injury. In the hours following the altercation Boras told reporters the injury was a bruise. However, when the Yankees had Taylor visit Dr. Frank Jobe, he called the injury {{one of the worst}} he'd seen. The following week, Jobe repaired a torn capsule and a torn glenoid <b>labrum</b> in Taylor's shoulder, which caused him to miss the 1994 season.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, Harris {{was named}} to a 23-player roster for the 2012 Algarve Cup. While in Portugal, Harris played in a closed-door {{training}} match against China on February 25, splitting halves with Nicole Barnhart. Harris was not named to the roster of 21 players that suited up for the games in the tournament. Harris traveled with the national team in early April to compete at the Women's Kirin Challenge Cup in Japan. Following the tournament, she trained with the national team in Florida from April 18 to 30. During the training camp, Harris injured her left shoulder, sustaining a small tear in her <b>labrum.</b> She still went on to train with the national team in New Jersey from May 10 to 25. However, in early June, she decided to undergo surgery to repair the tear {{in order to prevent}} further damage. The surgery kept her off the pitch for the rest of 2012.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2014, Beckett {{landed on}} the {{disabled}} list with a left hip impingement, an injury he said had gotten worse as the season went on. He returned to the rotation on July 22, but struggled when he returned. In a start on August 3, he was only able to pitch four innings against the Cubs. Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip. An MRI revealed that his hip impingement had resulted in a torn <b>labrum</b> and two cysts, possibly requiring season ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 8. On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Beckett's season was likely over due to his injury. A couple of days later, Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and added that he was also considering retirement. Beckett officially announced his retirement on October 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|With NHL play set {{to resume}} the next season, Morrison re-signed with the Canucks at US$9.6 million over three years. He {{suffered}} a torn <b>labrum</b> in his hip in December 2005, but chose to play through the injury. He finished the season with 19 goals and 56 points over 82 games in 2005–06, as the Canucks failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs. Head Coach Marc Crawford recalled {{that by the end of}} the season, the line of Morrison, Bertuzzi and Näslund had been surpassed as the top unit by Daniel and Henrik Sedin. In the off-season, Morrison underwent surgery for his hip injury and missed two months of workout and conditioning while recovering. Also in the summer, Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers, marking the end of the West Coast Express line.|$|E
5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like <b>labrum,</b> at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2015, Davis {{signed a}} five-year, $145 million {{contract}} extension with the Pelicans. On November 6, he tied his career-high of 43 {{points in a}} loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On December 1, he tied a career-high 9 blocked shots in an offensive off night against the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 20, in a win over the Denver Nuggets, Davis scored a single-quarter career-high 19 first quarter points to finish the game with 27. On January 15, Davis converted an alley oop dunk from Jrue Holiday with 2 seconds remaining to give New Orleans a 109–107 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. On January 28, Davis was named as a reserve for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. He again came close to a five-by-five with a 28-point, 10-rebound, 4-assist, 4-block, 4-steal effort on February 3 against the San Antonio Spurs. The following day, he {{was named to the}} NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge lineup. On February 21, in a win over the Detroit Pistons, Davis scored a franchise-record 59 points and pulled down 20 rebounds. The previous franchise record was 50 points by Jamal Mashburn exactly 13 years earlier against the Memphis Grizzlies. Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Webber as the only NBA players with 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game since 1983. Davis also became just the 20th player in NBA history to score at least 59 points in a game, and became the youngest player in NBA history to score 59 points in a game, and the second youngest (behind Bob McAdoo) to record 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game. The 59 points was an NBA-wide season high at the time. The total was not surpassed until the final night of the season when Kobe Bryant posted 60 in his final career game. Davis posted a third 40-point game (40 points and 13 rebounds) on March 9 against the Charlotte Hornets. On March 20, he was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with a left knee injury and a torn <b>labrum</b> in his left shoulder. Upon being deactivated, Davis claimed that he had been playing through left shoulder pain since his rookie season.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypopharynx}} and the <b>labrum</b> {{are both}} hollow. Saliva with anticoagulant is pumped down the hypopharynx to prevent clotting, and blood is drawn up the <b>labrum.</b>|$|E
25|$|A SLAP (superior <b>labrum</b> {{anterior}} to posterior) tear {{occurs when the}} cartilage of the shoulder (<b>labrum)</b> delaminates from glenoid. This causes an instability of the shoulder, typically in overhead movements.|$|E
25|$|Tritocerebrum, innervating the foregut and the <b>labrum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} {{particularly}} characterized by its double columellar {{processes in the}} apertural dentition, a splendid discriminating character in shell morphology in this group. In addition, the <b>labrum</b> is sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. This may be an overlooked character as {{this has not been}} checked or noticed in other taxa with similar types of shell until the type description of Gulella systemanaturae. Also, sometimes the <b>labrum</b> is very slightly concave where it joins the body whorl on the columellar side.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{view was}} that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the tritocerebrum), a view based partly {{on the fact that}} the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the <b>labrum,</b> which is the tritocerebrum in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in mites and spiders, and neuroanatomy in Limulus. If this is the case, then chelicerates simply have no tritocerebrum, i.e. there is no third supraoesophageal ganglion of the brain; the segment corresponding to it would be the suboesophageal pedipalp one. Such a theory does not, however, immediately account for the same ganglionic innervation of the chelicerae and <b>labrum,</b> although one solution is simply to claim that the <b>labrum</b> itself is not homologous between mandibulates and chelicerates (the view, for example, of Dieter Waloszek and colleagues).|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} small to minute, clavate, {{more or less}} tapering, {{greatest}} width well below the middle, always more than two-and-a-half times as long as wide, transparent when fresh to whitish when worn. The umbilicus is completely closed. The spire is produced, slightly tapering or sides at most subparallel, not convex. The apex is flattened, obtusely conical to mamillate. The shell has from five-and-a-half to just under six hardly convex whorls, that are superficially smooth but under high magnification with faint spiral sculpture and growth lines, growth lines turning to weak costulation behind the <b>labrum.</b> Sutures are somewhat impressed, fairly shallow, simple and filiform. The aperture is subovate, sometimes distinctly squarish at base, peristome slightly incrassate and reflected, aperture not or hardly obstructed by three-fold dentition: a small angular process (usually a mere swelling), somewhat distant from and therefore not connected with apex of <b>labrum</b> {{so that there is}} no sinus; opposite the angular denticle there is an upper labral process {{in the form of a}} thickening of the <b>labrum,</b> which process does not correspond to a depression behind the labrum; finally, a very faint thickening of the lower columella may be interpreted as a columellar process.|$|E
25|$|Because the iliopsoas or hip flexor crosses {{directly}} over the anterior suprior <b>labrum</b> of the hip, an intra-articular hip derangement (i.e. labral tears, hip impingement, loose bodies) can lead to an effusion that subsequently produces internal snapping hip symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Kwan {{underwent}} elective {{arthroscopic surgery}} in August 2006 {{to repair a}} torn <b>labrum</b> in her right hip, an old injury which she traces back to 2002. According to Kwan, the surgery allowed her to skate pain-free {{for the first time}} in four years.|$|E
25|$|Trilobites, in particular, {{possess a}} ventral sclerotised {{plate in the}} head called the hypostome. Whether this is {{homologous}} to the <b>labrum</b> or not is debated; although Waloszek and others have argued that as the phosphatocopines (upper stem-group crustaceans) seem to possess both, it cannot be.|$|E
25|$|Very {{few cases}} recover to {{complete}} mobility without surgical intervention. Some patients {{are able to}} strengthen their shoulders to limit the day to day dull ache, but with limited mobility and function. Surgery reattaches the <b>labrum</b> to the glenoid {{through the use of}} surgical anchors.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 2013, Rodriguez {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} in his hip {{to repair a}} torn <b>labrum.</b> It {{was the second time}} in four years that he had the surgery, although this operation was more serious than before. Rodriguez began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
25|$|Gulella systemanaturae is {{characterized}} by a medium-sized shell with little prominent costulation, seven to seven and three-quarter whorls and fourfold apertural dentition consisting of angular lamella, labral process, and outer and inner columellar processes; <b>labrum</b> sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella.|$|E
25|$|The glenoid <b>labrum</b> is {{the second}} kind of {{cartilage}} in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage. This cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage {{on the ends of}} the ball and socket. Also, this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached.|$|E
