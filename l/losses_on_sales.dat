Therefore the objective of this project was to implement a management control system to improve the performance of the area and to convert strategies into applicable actions, through audits and periodic monitoring of the levels of production control, scrap, productivity, efficiency and compliance program. For the project the information was collected to analyze the causes of the problems in the production line. This information was analyzed and the strategy was designed in conjunction with the organization's human talent. Then, the strategy was transfered to objectives, the strategy map was created and the key indicators were defined in order to monitor and control the achievement of the objectives and to identify new actions for improvement...|$|E
50|$|Many systems allow a {{deduction}} for <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale,</b> exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets.

40|$|Investors in {{depreciable}} assets {{used in a}} trade or business claim depreciation deductions following investment, and upon sale or other disposition of their assets are taxed on gain or loss equal to differences between amounts realized and adjusted basis. The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary income, whereas {{a portion of the}} gain on sales of personal property, and virtually all gains on sales of real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature of sale and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages sales of depreciable business assets on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets it is necessary to tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with unrealized losses on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of {{depreciable assets}} again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature of asset sales implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from sales of depreciable assets...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify nature of {{bookkeeping}} method for merchandise trading. In Japan, many textbook explain two types of entry method. for merchandise trading. One method uses Merchandise a/c and Profit (<b>Loss)</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sales</b> of Merchandise a/c. The other method uses Purchas a/c, Sales a/c and Merchandise Inventory a/c. It is said that it is difficult for accountant to use the first method in practice, because accountant have to calculate cost of sales each time when merchandise is sold. Because income is not observed directly, we have to do calculate to recognize income. Bookkeeping is a place of income calculation. Thus entry method is decided in according to substance of income. Some researchers or accounting rules define income based on net increase/ decrease of cash. Another researchers or rules define income besed on net increase/decrease of net asset.
