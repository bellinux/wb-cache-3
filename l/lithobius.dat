The number of eggs laid ranges from about 10 to 50. Time of {{development}} of the embryo to hatching is highly variable and may take from one to a few months. Time of development to reproductive period is highly variable within and among species. For example, it can take 3 years for S. coleoptrata to achieve adulthood, whereas under the right conditions, lithobiomorph species may reach a reproductive period in 1 year. In addition, centipedes are relatively long-lived when compared to insects. For example, the European <b>Lithobius</b> forficatus may live for 5 to 6 years, and the wide-ranging Scolopendra subspinipes can live for over 10 years. The combination of {{a small number of}} eggs laid, long gestation period, and long time of development to reproduction has led authors to label lithobiomorph centipedes as K-selected.|$|E

5000|$|The genus <b>Lithobius</b> {{was erected}} in 1814 by William Elford Leach, {{in an article}} {{published}} in David Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclopædia.

Leach did not designate a type species, and none was selected until Pierre André Latreille chose Scolopendra forficata Linnaeus, 1758 (now <b>Lithobius</b> forficatus). <b>Lithobius</b> is the name-giving genus for the family Lithobiidae.|$|E

50|$|T. niger has {{a roughly}} {{cylindrical}} shiny black body, with around 100 pairs of contrasting white legs on its 41-56 body segments.

Predators of T. niger include the centipedes <b>Lithobius</b> variegatus and <b>Lithobius</b> forficatus and hedgehogs.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>Lithobius</b> {{species are}} typical {{representatives of the}} family Lithobiidae. They are about 2 - 5 cm long and {{brownish}} in colour.

50|$|<b>Lithobius</b> forficatus, most {{commonly}} known as the brown centipede or stone centipede, is a common European centipede of the family Lithobiidae, although its distribution is not exclusive to Europe.

50|$|Stone centipedes {{are found}} under stones or bark, in soil and {{decaying}} matter.

50|$|L. variegatus can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative <b>Lithobius</b> forficatus {{by the presence of}} conspicuous purple or brown rings around its legs.

Only two of the species originally assigned to the genus remain so: Scolopendra gigantea and S. morsitans; the latter was chosen to be the type species by Opinion 454 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, overruling a previous designation by Pierre André Latreille, in which he chose Linnaeus' Scolopendra forficata (now <b>Lithobius</b> forficatus) as the type species.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to a variety of other European lithobiid centipedes, {{particularly}} the striped centipede, <b>Lithobius</b> variegatus, but L. forficatus does not have stripes on its legs. Like most lithobiids, it is found in the upper layers of soil, particularly under rocks and rotting logs. This species can be fairly easily identified by its reaction to being revealed, which is to run extremely quickly for cover. This is different from many of the other species of large lithobiid, which tend to be less extreme in their evasion behavior.|$|E
50|$|The Algar is {{populated}} by a rich plant tapestry, {{that covers the}} mouth of the cone structure, including various endemic species.

50|$|In 1998 Dennis Lavrov {{along with}} Wesley M Brown and Jeffrey L Boore have proved {{that there is}} a gene {{translocation}} link between insects and crustaceans.

In 2002, the same trio discovered an unusual mtDNA sequence in two species of millipedes and in 2004 have studied vermiform group called Pentastomida. During the 2004 study of 4 species (A. armillatus, S. tulumensis, H. macracantha and A. americanus) it was revealed that the gene arrangements of mtDNA shows that the species belong to Branchiura group.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sets of {{morphological}} {{characters of}} two nominal {{species in the}} genus <b>Lithobius</b> Leach, 1814, <b>Lithobius</b> mutabilis L. Koch, 1862 and <b>Lithobius</b> glacialis Verhoeff, 1937, were studied {{in order to test}} specific dissimilarity. Morphometrics were examined and analysed statistically. In addition, a comparative SEM analysis of external characters was made. Morphometrically significant differences between the species were found concerning body length, the width ratio of the head to the 5 th tergite, the number of antennal articles, and the length/width proportions of certain articles (e. g. the femur) of the 15 th legs of males. Because of these and several additional differences, such as in tergite surface structure, modifications to the 15 th legs of males, the structure of the female gonopod claws, and between the ecological profiles, L. glacialis, which is found in the high Alps at altitudes above timberline (1300 m), can be distinguished clearly from L. mutabilis. This study demonstrates another example for a cryptic species pair, a common phenomenon between lowland and alpine populations of small invertebrates. The combination of morphometrics and SEM offers a powerful methodology for resolving previously uncertain questions in the species-level taxonomy of centipedes...|$|E
