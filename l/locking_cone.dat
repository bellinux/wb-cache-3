50|$|In {{military}} use, rifle musket loading was simplified somewhat {{through the}} use of paper cartridges, which were significantly different from modern metallic cartridges. They typically consisted of rolled-up tubes of paper containing a premeasured amount of black powder and a greased Minié ball. Unlike the smoothbore cartridge, the entire cartridge was not simply shoved into the weapon. Instead, the paper was torn open (typically by the shooter's teeth), the powder was poured down the barrel, the Minié ball was placed into the barrel and rammed down on top of the powder with the ramrod. The paper was discarded. Also differing from a modern cartridge, a separate percussion cap had to be placed onto the percussion <b>lock's</b> <b>cone</b> before the weapon could be fired. The Maynard tape primer system attempted to speed up this last step by using paper strips similar to those used in modern toy cap guns in place of the percussion cap, but this proved to be unreliable in field service and was abandoned on later weapons.|$|R
40|$|Circularly {{polarized}} photons {{are known}} to generate a directional helicity-dependent photocurrent in three-dimensional topological insulators at room temperature. Surprisingly, the phenomenon is readily observed at photon energies that excite electrons to states far above the spin-momentum <b>locked</b> Dirac <b>cone</b> and the underlying mechanism for the helicity-dependent photocurrent is still not understood. We resolve the puzzle through a comprehensive study of the helicity-dependent photocurrent in (Bi,Sb) _ 2 Te_ 3 thin films {{as a function of}} the incidence angle of the optical excitation, its wavelength, and the gate-tuned chemical potential. Our observations allow us to unambiguously identify the circular photo-galvanic effect as the dominant mechanism for the helicity-dependent photocurrent. Additionally, we use an analytical calculation to relate the directional nature of the photocurrent to asymmetric optical transitions between the topological surface states and bulk bands. The insights we obtain are important for engineering opto-spintronic devices that rely on optical steering of spin and charge currents...|$|R
40|$|We present two band {{models for}} free fermion with charge {{conjugation}} symmetry in three dimensions. Without time reversal symmetry (TRS), the weak pairing gapless A-phase is a Majorana fermion p_x+ip_y wave FFLO state while the strong pairing gapped B-phase belongs to topologically trivial Class D. With TRS, {{there is a}} Majorana fermion B-phase belonging to Class DIII with a non-zero Hopf invariant. The TRS A-phase is also a Majorana fermion FFLO state with TRS. The surface states of the TRS B-phase are either a valley-momentum <b>locked</b> Majorana-Dirac <b>cone</b> or a linear-quadratic mixed cone for a specific surface. The surface states of the A-phase on one surface are topologically nontrivial, either having Z or Z_ 2 invariant {{depending on whether the}} system is TRS or not. The edge states of that surface are gapless Majorana modes. The Majorana fermion gapless FFLO states can be realized in critical Weyl semimetals (WSM) in which dual single Weyl nodes form dipoles and are nearly annihilated. The gapped B-phase emerges when Weyl node dipoles are about to be created. The WSM TaAs-family, a type-II WSM series Mo_xW_ 1 -xTe_ 2 -family, possible WSM La/LuBi_ 1 -x Sb_xTe_ 3 and topological crystalline insulators Sn_ 1 -xPb_x(Te,Se) are candidates to be manipulated into these critical states based on Majorana fermion models.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{presence of}} seemingly incompatible properties of solids often provides {{a unique opportunity}} to address questions of fundamental and practical importance. The coexistence of ferroelectric and topological orders is one such example. Ferroelectrics, which have a spontaneous macroscopic polarization switchable by an applied electric field, usually are semiconductors with a well-developed wide band gap with a few exceptions. On the other hand, time-reversal symmetric $Z_ 2 $ topological insulators (TI), characterized by robust metallic surface states protected by the topology of the bulk, usually are narrow-gap semiconductors ($< 0. 7 $ eV) which allow band inversion induced by the spin-orbit interaction. To date, a ferroelectric topological insulator (FETI) has remained elusive, owing to the seemingly contradictory characters of the ferroelectric and topological orders. Here, we report that the FETI can be realized in halide perovskite CsPbI$_ 3 $ under strain. Our first-principles study reveals that a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric structure of CsPbI$_ 3 $ is energetically favored under a wide range of pressures, while maintaining its topological order. The proposed FETI is characterized by switchable polar surfaces with spin-momentum <b>locked</b> Dirac <b>cones,</b> which allows for electric-field control of topological surface states (TSSs) and the surface spin current. Our demonstration of a FETI in a feasible material opens doors for future studies combining ferroelectric and topological orders, and offers a new paradigm for diverse applications in electronics, spintronics, and quantum information...|$|R

40|$|We study {{hexagonal}} spin-channel ("triplet") density waves with commensurate M-point propagation vectors. We {{first show}} that the three Q=M components of the singlet charge density and charge-current density waves can be mapped to multi-component Q= 0 nonzero angular momentum order in three dimensions (3 D) with cubic crystal symmetry. This one-to-one correspondence is exploited to define a symmetry classification for triplet M-point density waves using the standard classification of spin-orbit coupled electronic liquid crystal phases of a cubic crystal. Through this classification we naturally identify a set of non-coplanar spin density and spin-current density waves: the chiral spin density wave and its time-reversal invariant analog. These {{can be thought of}} as 3 D L= 2 and L= 4 spin-orbit coupled isotropic β-phase orders. In contrast, uniaxial spin density waves are shown to correspond to α-phases. The non-coplanar triple-M spin-current density wave realizes a novel 2 D semimetal state with three flavors of four-component spin-momentum <b>locked</b> Dirac <b>cones,</b> protected by a crystal symmetry akin to non-symmorphic symmetry, and sits at the boundary between a trivial and topological insulator. In addition, we point out that a special class of classical spin states, defined as classical spin states respecting all lattice symmetries up to global spin rotation, are naturally obtained from the symmetry classification of electronic triplet density waves. These symmetric classical spin states are the classical long-range ordered limits of chiral spin liquids. Comment: 14 + 4 pages, 5 + 0 figures; published versio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} of various Schiff-base calix[4]arenes {{that may be used}} as supramolecular building blocks. Two different routes to Schiff-base calix[4]arenes have been examined. One explores the reaction of different aminopyridines and p-formylcalix[4]arenes, while the other utilises the reaction between different p-amino-calix[4]arenes with various 2 -hydroxybenzaldehydes. In addition, the amino-pyridines employed in the first route have also been used in a reductive amination procedure with p-formylcalix[4]arene as an alternative synthetic route due Schiff-base product instability. With respect to the 2 -hydroxybenzaldehydes chosen for the second route, different functionality was introduced around the benzene ring in order to obtain a range of ligands that may influence the formation of supramolecular assemblies. This influence could be by hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, halogen-halogen or π- staking interactions for example. Furthermore, this reaction was carried out on two different p-aminocalix[4]arenes. One was flexible (with respect to the movement around the annulus of the calixarene) while the other was <b>locked</b> in the <b>cone</b> conformation by the introduction of lower-rim crown-ether linkages. Several series of pro-ligands have been synthesised and fully characterised where possible. No supramolecular assemblies have been synthesised as yet due to time restrictions...|$|R
40|$|Helical Dirac fermions—charge {{carriers}} that {{behave as}} massless relativistic particles with an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) locked to its translational momentum—are proposed {{to be the}} key to realizing fundamentally new phenomena in condensed matter physics. Prominent examples include the anomalous quantization of magneto-electric coupling, half-fermion states that are their own antiparticle, and charge fractionalization in a Bose– Einstein condensate, all of which are not possible with conventional Dirac fermions of the graphene variety. Helical Dirac fermions have so far remained elusive owing to the lack of necessary spin-sensitive measurements and because such fermions are forbidden to exist in conventional materials harbouring relativistic electrons, such as graphene or bismuth. It has recently been proposed that helical Dirac fermions may exist at the edges of certain types of topologically ordered insulators—materials with a bulk insulating gap of spin–orbit origin and surface states protected against scattering by time-reversal symmetry—and that their peculiar properties may be accessed provided the insulator is tuned into the so-called topological transport regime. However, helical Dirac fermions have not been observed in existing topological insulators. Here we report the realization and characterization of a tunable topological insulator in a bismuthbased class of material by combining spin-imaging and momentum-resolved spectroscopies, bulk charge compensation, Hall transport measurements and surface quantum control. Our results reveal a spin-momentum <b>locked</b> Dirac <b>cone</b> carrying a nontrivial Berry’s phase that is nearly 100 per cent spin-polarized, which exhibits a tunable topological fermion density {{in the vicinity of the}} Kramers point and can be driven to the long-sought topological spin transport regime.

M_x (M_x indicates surface doping or gating control) paves the way for future graphene-like studies of topological insulators, and applications of the observed spinpolarized edge channels in spintronic and computing technologies possibly at room temperature...|$|R

The calixarenes 2 - 4 are {{well-known}} and well-studied cyclic oligomers {{formed by the}} base-induced condensation of formaldehyde with p-terr-butylphenol. They are potentially a very versatile class of host molecules. [...] This thesis describes the syntheses and some properties of the calixnaphthalenes, which are {{a new class of}} cyclic formaldehyde-naphthol tetramers which are analogous with the calixarenes. These calixnaphthalenes were prepared by either one-pot or convergent procedures. [...] Calixnaphthalenes offer some advantages over the calixarenes. For example, since the naphthalene unit is larger than benzene the cavity of "cone conformations" of the corresponding calixnaphthalenes should be deeper. Also, the presence of a B ring in naphthalene provides a site for the addition of different functional groups, which allow calixnaphthalenes to be modified. Furthermore, due to the low symmetry of 1 –naphthol and 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid, some calixnaphthalenes can be inherently chiral. They therefore have potential applications as chiral hosts, or chiral ligands. [...] Calix[4]naphthalenes 10 - 12 were synthesized first by the direct condensation of 1 - naphthol and formaldehyde under basic conditions. Due to the difficulty in the separationand purification of these compounds, a convergent approach was used to synthesize these compounds as well as 13 in larger amounts for further investigations. The calix[4]- naphthalenes are conformationally flexible at room temperature even after their derivatization as tetraester derivatives. [...] In order to synthesize calixnaphthalenes which are closer to calixarenes in the location of the hydroxyl groups within the lower rim of the calixnaphthalene basket, a retrosynthetic analysis of compounds 57 and 62 showed that 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid (9) would be a suitable starting material.

Calix[4]naphthalene 62 produced mono- and diester derivatives 62 a and 62 b, respectively. lH NMR and molecular modeling analyses revealed that 62 b exists preferrentally in the 1, 3 -alternate conformation.

Compound 57 afforded only one somer, 78, having C 2 symmetry as revealed by NOED experiments and confirmed by x- ray analysis. Compound 62 produced two isomers, 81 and 80, having C, and C 2 symmetries, respectively. Mild oxidation of 62 produced one monospirodienone isomer.
