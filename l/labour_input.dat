The paper proposes a solution for the negatives problem that arises when applying the product technology model {{in the case of}} self-employed workers. It also assesses the plausibility of results by showing the effects of homogenising on wage costs and value added per head {{as well as on the}} ranking of industries by education level. The product and the industry technology model yield significantly different results, most particularly for the employment use of wholesale and retail trade. The results of the product technology model are judged to be most plausible. ...|$|R

50|$|But the {{production}} of any commodity generally requires both labour and some previously produced means of production (or capital goods), like tools and materials. The amount of labour so required is called the direct <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> into the commodity. Yet the required capital goods have in their turn been produced (in the past) by labour and other capital goods; and so on for these other capital goods, and so on. The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the indirect <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> into the commodity. Putting together the direct and indirect labour inputs, one finally gets the total <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> into the commodity, which may also be called the total embodied labour in it, or its direct and indirect labour contents.|$|E

The economic growth has been decomposed into the contribution of physical capital, <b>labour</b> <b>inputs,</b> <b>labour</b> composition index (LCI) and TFP. We find that Chinese economic growth was mainly pushed by the growth of physical capital, especially in the fastest growing Coastal region. <b>Labour</b> <b>inputs</b> and TFP growth contribute more in the Interior and West regions. Moreover, the contribution shares of physical capital in labour productivity have been declining for the Coastal region, as the TFP contributions have been increasing over the same period.

Based on the analysis of work time structure and <b>labour</b> <b>inputs</b> and performance of transport means operation, one may clearly state that the work efficiency of the selected means for the transport of the analysed load is very low. The highest <b>labour</b> <b>inputs</b> were incurred for the transport of vegetables with a tractor with a tractor wagon and the lowest for transport of fertilizers with a tractor with a trailer.

40|$|The {{learning}} {{phenomenon has}} proved applicable in various industries, especially {{those associated with}} mass productions, such as aircraft and automobile assembly. The learning process in labour‐intensive industries {{is assumed to be}} more significant in the sense that automated work is constrained by the fact that machines cannot benefit from previous experience and therefore would not ‘learn’ to run any faster or increase the rate of production. Several previous investigations into the applicability of learning curve theory to the construction industry proved the importance of this concept to labour productivity. Nevertheless, a thorough examination of the literature revealed a dearth of research into the effect of learning on the formwork operation of building floors. Consequently, the objective of this research is to explore the influence of recurring building floor configurations on formwork labour productivity. To achieve this objective, formwork <b>labour</b> <b>inputs</b> from 45 multi‐storey in situ reinforced concrete building frames were collected and analysed using the straight‐line learning curve model. The cumulative average input for each cycle, i. e. floor, and its associated cycle number were modelled using the least squares method. According to the learning curve theory, we expect the <b>labour</b> <b>inputs</b> to decrease by a certain percentage, as the cycle number increases. Based on the results obtained, there is very little evidence for that. Formwork, <b>labour</b> <b>inputs,</b> <b>labour</b> productivity, learning curve theory, learning phenomenon,...|$|R
50|$|The {{measure of}} input use {{reflects}} the time, effort and {{skills of the}} workforce. Denominator of the ratio of labour productivity, the input measure {{is the most important}} factor that influences the measure of labour productivity. <b>Labour</b> <b>input</b> is measured either {{by the total number of}} hours worked of all persons employed or total employment (head count). (Freeman 2008,5) There are both advantages and disadvantages associated with the different input measures that are used in the calculation of labour productivity. It is generally accepted that the total number of hours worked is the most appropriate measure of <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> because a simple headcount of employed persons can hide changes in average hours worked and has difficulties accounting for variations in work such as a part-time contract, leave of absence, overtime, or shifts in normal hours. However, the quality of hours-worked estimates is not always clear. In particular, statistical establishment and household surveys are difficult to use because of their varying quality of hours-worked estimates and their varying degree of international comparability.|$|E

The main results confirm the heterogeneity of adjustment costs for permanent employees, and the existence of significant cross-adjustment effects. This latter result implies that marginal adjustment costs from firing permanent production employees can be reduced if temporary workers are hired at the same time.

In addition, although it is axiomatic that socially necessary <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> determines commodity values, precise numerical calculation of such an input {{in relation to the}} value of a given commodity, i.e. the empirical regulation of the values of different types of commodities, is exceedingly difficult, due to incessantly shifting social, physical or technical circumstances affecting the labour process.|$|E

Meanwhile, within milking specifically, the number of cows milked per operator per hour is the best measure of both the performance of the operator and the milking installation (Clough, 1978). This is affected by the following three factors: the milking times of the cows, the number and arrangement of the milking units, and the operator’s work routine (Whipp, 1992). The addition of extra milking units will only increase milking performance if the operator has idle time during milking (Hansen, 1999) ...|$|R

50|$|According to Barone (2001) {{with the}} acronym EPL economists {{refer to the}} entire set of {{regulations}} that place some limits to the faculties of firms to hire and fire workers, {{even if they are}} not grounded primarily in the law, but originate from the collective bargaining of the social partners, or are a consequence of court rulings. In particular, provisions favouring the employment of disadvantaged groups in society, determining the conditions for the use of temporary or fixed-term contracts, or imposing training requirements on the firm, affect hiring policies, while redundancy procedures, mandated pre-notification periods and severance payments, special requirements for collective dismissals and short-time work schemes influence firing decisions. The nature of these restrictions on the firms’ freedom to adjust the <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> is quite similar in all OECD countries, but the actual procedural details and the overall degree of stringency implied by them varies considerably.

40|$|SUMMARYThis article {{presents}} multi–factor productivity (MFP) estimates using experimental measures of quality adjusted <b>labour</b> <b>inputs</b> and utilisation of capital services. Using a growth accounting framework, output growth can be split into the relative contributions of <b>labour</b> and capital <b>inputs,</b> and a residual component which is variously described as ‘disembodied technical change’, the ‘Solow residual’, {{total factor productivity}} or simply as MFP. This approach complements traditional measures of productivity, which focus only on one <b>input,</b> <b>labour,</b> and take account only {{of the volume of}} labour, measured in jobs or hours, and not on changes in the composition of labour over time. Estimates are produced at the market sector and whole economy levels. The article develops the work of Turvey (2009) by extending the back data to 1994 (1995 for the market sector) and forward to 2008, and by providing estimates at an enhanced level of industrial disaggregation, consistent with parallel developments in measuring <b>labour</b> and capital <b>inputs.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|In Indian villages {{a single}} field (normally {{a plot of}} three to five acres) may be farmed collectively by the villagers, who each offer labour as a devotional offering, {{possibly}} {{for one or two}} days per cropping season. The resulting crop belongs to no one individual, and is used as an offering. The <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> is the offering of the peasant in their role as priests. The wealth generated by the sale of the produce belongs to the Gods and hence is Apaurusheya or impersonal. Shrambhakti (labour contributed as devotional offering) is the key instrument for generation of internal resources. The benefits of the harvest are most often redistributed in the village for common good as well as individual need - not as loan or charity, but as divine grace (prasad).
