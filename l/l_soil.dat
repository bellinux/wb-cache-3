40|$|Tall fescue is an {{important}} forage grass which can host systemic fungal endophytes. The association of host grass and endophyte is known to influence herbivore behavior and host plant competition for resources. Establishing legumes into existing tall fescue sods is a desirable means to acquire nitrogen and enhance the nutritive value of forage for livestock production. Competition from existing tall fescue typically must be controlled to ensure interseeding success. We used a soil-on-agar method to determine if soil from intact, living (L), or an herbicide killed (K) tall fescue sward influenced germination and seedling growth of three cultivars of tall fescue (E+, MaxQ, and E−) or legumes (alfalfa, red clover, and white clover). After 30 days, seedlings were larger and present in greater numbers when grown in <b>L</b> <b>soil</b> rather than K soil. Root growth of legumes (especially white clover) and tall fescue (especially MaxQ) were not as vigorous in K soil as <b>L</b> <b>soil.</b> While shoot biomass was similar for all cultivars of tall fescue in <b>L</b> <b>soil,</b> MaxQ produced less herbage when grown in K soil. Our data suggest establishing legumes or fescue cultivars may not be improved by first killing the existing fescue sod and seedling performance can exhibit significant interseasonal variation, related only to soil conditions...|$|E

The cultivar Novosadska rana 5 was sown in a random splitplot design with four replicates at Rimski Šančevi on three sawing dates in 1999 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001. The following variables were evaluated: I – control, II – soilborne inoculum (4 g teliospores/ 1 <b>l</b> <b>soil),</b> III – seedborne inoculum (2 g teliospores/ 1 kg seeds), IV - seedborne inoculum + soilborne inoculum (4 g teliospores/ 1 <b>l</b> <b>soil</b> + 2 g teliospores/ 1 kg seeds).

The frequency of bunt infected spikes depended on the source of Tilletia spp. inoculum, and difference in infection frequencies between variables II and III, as well as III and IV, were determined for the assessed infection parameters. When teliospores are the only source of inoculum in soil, 60 days after sawing (r>+ 0. 52) is a critical period in which temperature influences the development of infection. The highestnumber of plants was infected in the first, while less were infected in the second ten days (decade) after sawing (r> 0. 41), when temperature was the optimal 5. 0 - 6. 0 ºC. The initial 60 days after sawing were also critical for disease development when teliosporeson seeds were the only source of inoculum (r>+ 0. 50).

Soil W displayed greater nitrification rates and nitrate (NO₃⁻) levels than soil L, but was more resistant to nitrite (NO₂⁻) accumulation and produced two to ten times less N₂O than soil L. Genes associated with NO₂⁻oxidation (nxrA) increased substantially in soil W but remained static in soil <b>L.</b> <b>Soil</b> NO₂⁻was strongly correlated with N₂O production, and cumulative (c-) slNH₃ explained 87 % {{of the variance in}} c-NO₂⁻. Differences between soils were explained by greater slNH₃ in soil L which inhibited NO₂⁻oxidization leading to greater NO₂⁻ levels and N₂O production. This is the first study to correlate the dynamics of soil slNH₃, NO₂⁻, N₂O and nitrifier genes, and the first to show how ASC can regulate NO₂⁻ levels and N₂O production. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of farmland to forestland not only changes {{the ecological environment}} but also enriches the soil with organic matter and affects the global carbon cycle. This paper reviews the influence of land use changes on the soil organic carbon sink {{to determine whether the}} Chinese "Grain-for-Green" ({{conversion of}} farmland to forestland) project increased the rate of SOC content during its implementation between 1999 and 2010 in the hilly and gully areas of the Loess Plateau in north-central China. The carbon sink was quantified, and the effects of the main species were assessed. The carbon sink increased from 2. 26 × 106 kg in 1999 to 8. 32 × 106 kg in 2010 with the sustainable growth of the converted areas. The black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa <b>L.)</b> <b>soil</b> increased SOC content in the top soil (0 - 100 cm) in the initial 7 -yr period, while the sequestration occurred later (> 7 yr) in the 100 - 120 cm layer after the "Grain-for-Green" project was implemented. The carbon sink function measured for the afforested land provides evidence that the Grain-for-Green project has successfully excavated the carbon sink potential of the Shaanxi province and served as an important milestone for establishing an effective organic carbon management program...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{nitrogen}} (N) management {{experiments with}} spinach, leaf lettuce, romaine collard and mustard {{were conducted on}} a Casa Grande s. <b>l.</b> <b>soil</b> at the Maricopa Agricultural Center {{in the winter and}} spring of 1990 - 91. The purpose of this N rate experiment was to develop initial Best Management strategies for N fertilizer use for emerging high value crops grown in Arizona using subsurface drip irrigation. Three rates of urea, ammonium nitrate were applied to each cultivar to provide deficient (N 1), adequate (N 2) and supraoptimal real (N 3) levels of N. All cultivars responded dramatically to the application of N. Fresh weight yields in the N 1 and N 2 treatments averaged 45 and 53 % of the N 3 treatment The average N 3 yields recorded in these trials were 23. 1, 12. 8 and 21. 8 tons of marketable produce per acre for greens, spinach and leaf lettuce/romaine crops, respectively. Preliminary plant tissue test results indicated that for all five crops, whole plant total N (TN) levels and midrib + petiole NO₃-N and leaf blade TN concentrations in the youngest mature leaf were responsive to differences in soil N supply and show promise as diagnostic N tissue test procedures. The midrib + petiole NO₃-N test appeared to be the best indicator of plant N status throughout the growing season for all five crops studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of fine root activity of Olea europea L. and Ficus carrica <b>L.</b> of <b>soil</b> in its immediate vicinity (in the so-called rhizosphere zone). The study was conducted on two stations in Northern Algeria: Guendoul and Bouira. Olea europea L. and Ficus carrica L. roots significantly modified some chemical properties of rhizosphere soil. Increases of soil carbon, KNH 4 + and KHNO 3 - were observed in the Olea europea L. and Ficus carrica <b>L</b> rhizosphere <b>soil</b> at both stations. Bulk and rhizosphere soil clay mineralogy was similar. Interstratified illite-smectite, smectite-illite and illite were predominant in the clay fraction. Chlorite and kaolinite were less represented. The decomposition of XRD diffractograms of two soil clay fractions using the Decomp program revealed that Olea europea L. roots promote nK+ storage in interlayer position. Indeed, the lower abscissa position of the gravity center (cg) of the X-ray patterns, the peak displacement of clays populations PCI, I/S, S/I toward illite peak position indicates an increase of “illite-like” layer content in the vicinity of Olea europea L. roots. Olea europea L. roots appeared to have more influence on the rhizosphere soil than Ficus carrica L. roots probably because of its higher root biomass and the greater activity of the tree in winter (contrary to Ficus Carrica L., Olea europea L. keep their leaves in winter). The two species underground activity seems to be well reflected in their respective rhizosphere...|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} of L. kaempferi forest significantly changed the carbon source utilization {{pattern of the}} soil microorganism community in Dalaoling National Forest Park. The use efficiency of some carbon sources in the soil microorganism community in the L. kaempferi forest differed {{from those in the}} P. armandii forest and decreased with the increases in stand age. L. kaempferi also caused significant changes in soil physicochemical properties. Therefore, we concluded that the introduction and cultivation of L. kaempferi in the Dalaoling National Forest Park resulted in a decline in soil quality and soil fertility. The significant relationship between soil pH and AWCD suggested that <b>L.</b> kaempferi influenced <b>soil</b> activity by changing the soil pH. However, the detailed mechanism of {{introduction of}} <b>L.</b> kaempferi on <b>soil</b> microbial diversity and function is worthwhile for further research, such as how the litter affects specifically the composition of microbial community and soil physicochemical properties and the response of composition and structure of microbial community to the litter of exotic species.|$|R
