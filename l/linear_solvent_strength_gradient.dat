40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the selection of}} ion chromatography (IC) columns for use in comprehensive multidimensional ion chromatography (IC×IC). First, a single number was determined {{for a wide range}} of anions (one number for each anion) using the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model. These numbers were then used to compare the column selectivity characteristics for five different columns. Principal component analysis was used to illustrate selectivity differences between columns. Dionex AS 16 and AS 20 columns were selected for use in the development of an IC×IC method for the separation of ten anions. To achieve the required speed of analysis in both the first and second separation dimensions, custom column lengths were packed in-house. The use of an eluent suppressor between the first and second columns permits a relatively low flow ratio regime of only < 1 : 20 in the first and second dimensions, respectively, which reduces dilution effects common in comprehensive multidimensional LC. Selection of the second dimension eluent conditions was aided by the development of a spreadsheet based on the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{optimisation}} of the eluent composition for the separation of anions using Ion Chromatography, specifically using an Iterative Interpretive Optimisation Strategy. Firstly a series of retention models is introduced that are suitable for use in an Interpretive Optimisation strategy. These models include the <b>Linear</b> <b>Solvent</b> <b>Strength</b> model (Dominant Equilibrium and Competing Ion Effective Charge Approaches), Hoover model, Dual Eluent Species model, Kuwamoto model, Extended Dual Eluent Species model, Multiple Species Eluent/Analyte model and the newly developed Empirical End Points model. Also included is the commercially available 3 -point model of DryLab. The theory and mathematics behind these models are also discussed. These models have been critically compared to determine their suitability for use in an Iterative Interpretive Optimisation strategy. This comparison is broken into three parts, non-suppressed ion chromatography, suppressed ion chromatography, and single eluent species ion chromatography. For single eluent species ion chromatography the list of models was reduced to the <b>Linear</b> <b>Solvent</b> <b>Strength</b> model, the Empirical End Points model and the 3 -point model of DryLab, which {{were found to be}} the only models suitable for this type of chromatography. The 3 -point model of DryLab was found to be unsuitable for multiple species eluent ion chromatography. A number of trends were noted across the comparison, the most significant of which were that the Empirical End Points and <b>Linear</b> <b>Solvent</b> <b>Strength</b> models were the only two models that were applicable to the entire data set. The Empirical End Points model was consistently the best performed model while the <b>Linear</b> <b>Solvent</b> <b>Strength</b> model was consistently the worst, and the solution requirements for the Empirical End Points model were found to be the most suitable for an optimisation process. Thus the Empirical End Points model was chosen as the retention model for the optimisation process. Next, a procedure for an Iterative Interpretive Optimisation process was developed and a computer program written to handle the large number of calculations required for the process. The computer program was for the Iterative Interpretive Optimisation process of the eluent concentration only. A case study using a carbonate eluent was conducted to test the program and procedure, resulting in the separation of 20 anions within 12 minutes. Finally, the use of an Artificial Neural Network as a retention model was studied. Artificial Neural Networks were found to require a large amount of training compared with theoretical retention models, but their high level of accuracy and low system knowledge requirements make them a prospect worthy of further evaluation...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} and predictive {{properties of}} the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model and two nonlinear retention-time models, i. e., the quadratic model and the Neue model, were assessed for the separation of small molecules (phenol derivatives), peptides, and intact proteins. Retention-time measurements were conducted in isocratic mode and gradient mode applying different gradient times and elution-strength combinations. The quadratic model provided the most accurate retention-factor predictions for small molecules (average absolute prediction error of 1. 5 %) and peptides separations (with a prediction error of 2. 3 %). An advantage of the Neue model {{is that it can}} provide accurate predictions based on only three gradient scouting runs, making tedious isocratic retention-time measurements obsolete. For peptides, the use of gradient scouting runs in combination with the Neue model resulted in better prediction errors (< 2. 2 %) compared to the use of isocratic runs. The applicability of the quadratic model is limited due to a complex combination of error and exponential functions. For protein separations, only a small elution window could be applied, which is due to the strong effect of the content of organic modifier on retention. Hence, the linear retention-time behavior of intact proteins is well described by the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model. Prediction errors using gradient scouting runs were significantly lower (2. 2 %) than when using isocratic scouting runs (3. 2 %). © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|A chemometric {{challenge}} was proposed during the "Chimiometrie" congress 2016, held in Namur, Belgium, on 17 - 20 January. The {{aim of this}} contest was to challenge the ability of congress participants to build indirect Quantitative Structure-Retention Relationship models (QSRR) using the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) theory of reversed-phase liquid chromatography. QSRR is a very helpful method for the identification of unknown analytes, including the prediction of chromatographic retention time. Because of the potential presence of various isomeric compounds, accurate retention time prediction is particularly important {{in the context of}} steroid identification. In addition, the indirect prediction of retention time using the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) parameters S and log k(w) provides a great advantage for use in any gradient conditions. In the proposed dataset, the experimental values of S and log kw were estimated using Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography separation with two linear gradients (5 - 95 % ACN+ 0. 1 % FA) of 15 and 60 min, respectively. The aim of the {{challenge was}} the accurate estimation of retention time for a 45 min gradient by applying the LSS theory based on the predicted S and log kw values. Molecular descriptors were calculated from a series of reference steroid compounds using the VolSurf + software. By these means, a collection of 128 variables related to molecular shape, volume, polarisability, polar surface area, hydrophobic surface area, lipophilicity, molecular diffusion, and solubility was generated automatically. The dataset (n= 95) included 76 steroid compounds for calibration and 19 for validation. Experimental log kw, S and retention time values were provided for the calibration set only. The results were evaluated according to the smallest RMSEC obtained for the retention time predictions of the validation set with the 45 min gradient using the LSS parameters. Moreover, each individual relative error should not exceed 5 % of the experimental retention time for both the calibration and validation sets.

40|$|The two {{retention}} models, the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model (LSS) and the quadratic relationship, {{in addition}} to artificial neural network (ANN) approach, were compared {{in their ability to}} predict the retention behaviour of common cations (Li, Na, NH 4, K, Mg, and Ca) in isocratic ion chromatography using the methanesulfonic acid (MSA) eluent. Over wide variations in the MSA concentration, the quadratic model shows a quite good prediction power. LSS can be used only for monovalent cations and in the proximity of the experimental design point. ANN fails to predict the retention for the data not included in the training set. To find the optimal conditions in the experimental design, the normalized resolution product as a chromatographic objective function was employed. The optimum MSA concentration in the eluent on a Dionex CS 12 column was found to be 18 mM, with the total analysis time of less than 10 min. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

New technologies in analytical chemistry, such as ultra highpressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), offer {{the possibility of a}} fast and sensitive analysis. Nevertheless, difficulties regarding steroid identification are encountered when considering isotopomeric steroids. Thus, the use of retention times is of great help for the unambiguous identification of steroids. In this context, starting from the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) theory, quantitative structure retention relationship (QSRR) models, based on a dataset composed of 91 endogenous steroids and VolSurf þ descriptors combined with a new dedicated molecular fingerprint, were developed to predict retention times of steroid structures in any gradient mode conditions. Satisfactory performance was obtained during nested cross-validation with a predictive ability (Q 2) of 0. 92. The generalisation ability of the model was further confirmed by an average error of 4. 4 % in external prediction.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential of non-linear gradients in hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), to improve the separation between the different homologous species (drug-toantibody, DAR) of commercial antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). The selectivities between Brentuximab Vedotin species were measured using three different gradient profiles, namely linear, power function based and logarithmic ones. The logarithmic gradient provides the most equidistant retention distribution for the DAR species and offers the best overall separation of cysteine linked ADC in HIC. Another important advantage of the logarithmic gradient, is its peak focusing effect for the DAR 0 species, which is particularly useful to improve the quantitation limit of DAR 0. Finally, the logarithmic behavior of DAR species of ADC in HIC was modelled using two different approaches, based on i) the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> theory (LSS) and two scouting linear gradients and ii) a new derived equation and two logarithmic scouting gradients.

To attain acceptable kinetic performance with mAbs in reversed phase liquid chromatography, {{there is a}} need to work with the last generation of wide-pore sub- 2 m fully porous or core–shell particles stationary phases. In addition, temperature in the range 60 – 90 ◦C was found to be mandatory to limit adsorption phenomenon of mAbs and their fragments. A generic method development strategy was proposed to account for the selectivity, efficiency, recovery, and the possible thermal degradation. This study also demonstrated that the gradient steepness and temperature cannot be optimized using van’t Hoff type linear models. Similarly, the common <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model also generated some error in predicting the retention times. In contrast, when quadratic models were employed, the prediction accuracy of retention times was found to be excellent (relative error between 0. 5 and 1 %) using a reasonable number of experiments (9 or 6 experiments for optimization of gradient time and temperature, which requires between 6 and 8 h).

Extensive experimental retention data were gathered for 21 anions (fluoride, acetate, formate, bromate, chloride, nitrite, methanesulfonate, bromide, chlorate, nitrate, iodide, thiocyanate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, oxalate, tungstate, phthalate, chromate, thiosulfate and phosphate) using hydroxide eluents of varying concentration. Although the purely theoretical LSSM was found to give adequate performance, the EEPM (in which a linear relationship is assumed between the logarithm of retention factor and the logarithm of eluent strength, but the slope is determined empirically) and DryLab performed better, with DryLab giving the best accuracy and precision of the three models.

Statistical comparison of the predicted and experimentally obtained retention factors showed that the performance of the theoretical models improved with the complexity of the model. However the empirical model (in which a linear relationship is assumed between the logarithm of retention factor and the logarithm of eluent strength, but the slope is determined empirically) gave the most consistent performance across the widest range of anions. The empirical end-points model was also shown to be the most satisfactory model due to its low knowledge requirements and easy solution.

The experimental retention data are used to solve a new retention model, called the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model, empirical approach (LSSM-EA), which then enables prediction of retention times for all eluent compositions in the search area. The theoretical development of LSSM-EA and the processes used for solving the equations are discussed.

40|$|The Reversed-phase (RP) {{gradient}} elution chromatography of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), a neuropeptide with many biological effects, has been modeled under linear and non-linear conditions. In {{order to do}} this, the chromatographic behavior has been studied under both linear and nonliner conditions under isocratic mode at different mobile phase compositions—ranging from 16 to 19 % (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) in aqueous trifluoracetic acid (TFA) 0. 1 % (v/v) —on a C- 8 column. Although the range of mobile phase compositions investigated was quite narrow, the retention factor of this relatively small polypeptide (N/OFQ is a heptadecapeptide) {{has been found to}} change by more than 400 %. In these conditions, gradient operation resulted thus to be the optimum approach for non-linear elution. As the available amount of N/OFQ was extremely reduced (only a few milligrams), the adsorption isotherms of the peptide, at the different mobile phase compositions examined, have been measured through the so-called inverse method (IM) on a 5 [*]cm long column. The adsorption data at different mobile phase compositions have been fitted to several models of adsorption. The dependence of the isotherm parameters on the mobile phase composition was modeled by using the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) model and a generalized Langmuir isotherm that includes the mobile phase composition dependence.

An extensive set of experimental retention data obtained for 15 anions (acetate, fluoride, iodate, bromate, chloride, nitrite, bromide, chlorate, nitrate, iodide, oxalate, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate and phosphate) on three columns (Waters IC Pak A, Hamilton PRP-X 100 and Vydac 302 IC) using phthalate eluents of varying concentration and pH was used to evaluate the ability of each model to predict retention factors. Statistical comparison of the predicted retention factors with those obtained experimentally showed that the performance of the theoretical models improved with the complexity of the model, but none of the theoretical models could give sufficiently reliable prediction of retention factors (especially for divalent analyte ions) for the model to be used in optimisation software.

A set of different columns was chosen, covering a broad range of silica types, pore sizes and bonding chemistry. Mobile phases of tetrahydrofuran (THF) combined with water, acetonitrile (ACN) or methanol (MeOH) were used. Although differences between columns were small, a higher selectivity correlated with a lower hydrophobicity parameter from the Galushko column test. The model of Jandera, based on the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> model of Snyder, was used to describe the retention of the oligomers in gradient mode. This gave information about selectivities on different stationary phases similar to the hydrophobicity parameter. Contrary to the stationary phase, the mobile phase had a major influence on the selectivity. The THF–water combination gave much higher selectivities compared to THF combined with MeOH or ACN. Using the aqueous mobile phase even enabled separation of different isomers. Determination of thermodynamic parameters for the model compounds showed that retention of the different isomers was mainly determined by the orientation of the side chains {{at both ends of the}} chain. An additional repeating unit in the middle of the polymer backbone gave a similar contribution to retention, irrespective of the orientation of its side chain. Three model isomers were separated by preparative RP-HPLC and identified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The combination of subsequent preparative size-exclusion chromatography, RP-HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry enabled the identification of the two major oligomeric series in the sample as the regioregular product with one bromine end group and, in smaller amounts, a regioirregular product with two bromine end groups...|$|R

The <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) model relating the retention factor, k to the eluent concentration (log k = a − blog [eluent]), is a well-known and accurate retention model in ion chromatography (IC). In this work, QSRRs for inorganic and small organic anions were used to predict the regression parameters a and b in the LSS model (and hence retention times) for these analytes under {{a wide range of}} eluent conditions, based solely on their chemical structures. This approach was performed on retention data of inorganic and small organic anions from the “Virtual Column” software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). These retention data were recalibrated via a “porting” methodology on three columns (AS 20, AS 19, and AS 11 HC), prior to the QSRR modeling. This provided retention data more applicable on recently produced columns which may exhibit changes of column behavior due to batch-to-batch variability. Molecular descriptors for the analytes were calculated with Dragon software using the geometry-optimized molecular structures, employing the AM 1 semi-empirical method. An optimal subset of molecular descriptors was then selected using an evolutionary algorithm (EA). Finally, the QSRR models were generated by multiple linear regression (MLR). As a result, six QSRR models with good predictive performance were successfully derived for a- and b-values on three columns (R 2  >  0. 98 and RMSE    0. 7 and RMSEP <  0. 4).

The main concern in QSRR modelling is to build models with high predictive power, allowing reliable retention prediction for the unknown compounds across the chromatographic space. With the aim of enhancing the prediction power of the models, in this work, our previously proposed QSRR modelling approach called "federation of local models" is extended in ion chromatography to predict retention times of unknown ions, where a local model for each target ion (unknown) is created using only structurally similar ions from the dataset. A Tanimoto similarity (TS) score was utilised {{as a measure of}} structural similarity and training sets were developed by including ions that were similar to the target ion, as defined by a threshold value. The prediction of retention parameters (a- and b-values) in the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) model in ion chromatography, log k = a - blog[eluent], allows the prediction of retention times under all eluent concentrations. The QSRR models for a- and b-values were developed by a genetic algorithm-partial least squares method using the retention data of inorganic and small organic anions and larger organic cations (molecular mass up to 507) on four Thermo Fisher Scientific columns (AS 20, AS 19, AS 11 HC and CS 17). The corresponding predicted retention times were calculated by fitting the predicted a- and b-values of the models into the LSS model equation. The predicted retention times were also plotted against the experimental values to evaluate the goodness of fit and the predictive power of the models.

The authors also optimized the sepn. of the involved polyamide oligomers, with respect to gradient steepness, stationary phase, column temp., and mobile phase pH. The irregular elution behavior of the cyclic monomer could be caused by its relatively large exposed/accessible hydrophobic surface, which permits relatively easy penetration into the hydrophobic stationary phase giving extra retention. The dipole moment of the different oligomers {{was used as a}} measure for this exposed/accessible hydrophobic area to correlate the retention factors using quant. structure-retention relationships. The authors also studied the retention behavior of the polyamide, which is injected each run directly onto the column and modifies the stationary phase. Using a 250 -ml post gradient injection zone of formic acid on a 250 * 3 mm Zorbax SB-C 18 column, the polyamide could be effectively removed from the stationary phase after each sepn. The <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> (LSS) model was used to optimize the sepn. of the first 6 linear and cyclic oligomers.

40|$|The method {{development}} process in liquid chromatography (LC) involves optimization {{of a variety}} of method parameters including stationary phase chemistry, column temperature, initial and final mobile phase compositions, and gradient time when gradient mobile phases are used. Here, a general simulation program to predict the results (i. e., retention time, peak width and peak shape) of LC separations, with the ability to study various complex chromatographic conditions is described. The simulation program is based on the Craig distribution model where the column is divided into discrete distance (Δz) and time (Δt) segments in a grid and is based on parameterization with either the <b>linear</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> or Neue-Kuss models for chromatographic retention. This algorithm is relatively simple to understand and produces results that agree well with closed form theory when available. The set of simulation programs allows for the use of any eluent composition profile (linear and nonlinear), any column temperature, any stationary phase composition (constant or non-constant), and any composition and shape of the injected sample profile. The latter addition to our program is particularly useful in characterizing the solvent mismatch effect in comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2 D-LC), {{in which there is a}} mismatch between the first dimension (1 D) effluent and second dimension (2 D) initial mobile phase composition. This solvent mismatch causes peak distortion and broadening. The use of simulations can provide a better understanding of this phenomenon and a guide for the method development for 2 D-LC. Another development that is proposed to have a great impact on the enhancement of 2 D-LC methods is the use of continuous stationary phase gradients. When using rapid mobile phase gradients in the second dimension separation with diode array detection (DAD), refractive index changes cause large backgrounds such as an injection ridge (from solvent mismatch) and sloping baselines which can be problematic for achieving accurate quantitation. Use of a stationary phase gradient may enable the use of an isocratic mobile phase in the 2 D, thus minimizing these background signals. Finally, our simulator can be used as an educational tool. Unlike commercially available simulators, our program can capture the evolution of the chromatogram in the form of movies and/or snapshots of the analyte distribution over time and/or distance to facilitate a better understanding of the separation process under complicated circumstances. We plan to make this simulation program publically available to all chromatographers and educators to aid in more efficient method development and chromatographic training...|$|R
40|$|The two-gradient self-consistent field Scheutjens-Fleer (SCF-SF) {{approach}} is employed for study of conformational transition occurring in molecular bottle brushes upon {{decrease in the}} <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> for grafted chains. In particular, the <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> was varied from theta to poor solvent conditions. It was found that at moderately poor <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> the bottle brush collapses, keeping cylindrically uniform shape. Further decrease in the <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> leads to appearance of longitudinal undulations in the collapsed cylindrical structure. This result of our SCF modeling is in agreement with earlier predictions of scaling theory concerning longitudinal instability of uniform cylindrical structure of the collapsed brush.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new theoretical {{predictions of}} the undrained uplift capacity of deeply embedded inclined strip anchors in a soil stratum with a linear variation of strength with depth. Rigorous bounds on the theoretical uplift capacity are presented using upper and lower bound limit analysis. The effects of the <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> on the normalized uplift capacity and the predicted failure mechanisms are analyzed. Overall, {{the effect of the}} <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> on the capacity is shown to be rather small (less than 16 % for the range of <b>strength</b> <b>gradients</b> considered), while the influence of the gradient on the failure mechanism can be significant. It is shown that the coupled effects of anchor inclination and the <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> are well characterized by formulae that provide a simple means for refining uplift calculations in practical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{displacement}} of two fluids in a porous medium {{can be affected}} by a viscous fingering instability (VF) that arises at the interface between the fluids when their viscosities are different. In parallel, one of the fluids may contain solutes that reversibly adsorb on the porous matrix {{at a rate that}} depends on the composition of the two-fluid mixture, a so-called <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> effect. In some systems encountered for instance in liquid chromatographic columns or in underground flows in environmental applications, both VF and <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> effects may combine to influence the spatio-temporal distribution of solutes. Here, a computational investigation of such dynamics is performed. The distribution of the solute in the porous medium is affected by the combined effects of VF and <b>solvent</b> <b>strength.</b> A three component system (displacing fluid, sample solvent and solute) is modeled using Darcy's law for the fluid flow velocity coupled to a convection-diffusion equation for the sample solvent and a mass balance equation for the solute in the mobile and stationary phases. The sample solvent is assumed to have a larger <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> than the displacing fluid, in which the retention parameter due to the linear adsorption of the solute depends exponentially on the concentration of the sample solvent. A parametric study of the influences of the factors controlling the VF and <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> effects on the displacement velocity of the fronts of solute zone and on its width along the porous medium has been performed by direct numerical simulation of the governing equations. While each of the two effects (VF and <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> effects) distorts and significantly increases the broadening of the solute zone, the simulations reveal that, when they are acting in combination, these solute zone perturbations are reduced.

40|$|Principal {{component}} {{analysis was used}} to determine the dimensionality and structure of three data sets consisting of the capacity factors of eleven to twenty different solutes measured in nine different mobile phase compositions consisting of water and methanol and/or acetonitrile on three reversed-phase columns. Principal {{component analysis}} showed that two principal components could account for the total variance in the data and that the percentage variance explained by the first principal component (about 80 - 95 %) was much greater than the percentage explained by the second principal component, but that the percentage depended strongly on the choice of solutes for the sample. The first principal component could be associated with <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> and <b>solvent</b> <b>strength</b> selectivity and the second principal component with modifier selectivity.

40|$|The paper aims to {{consider}} the <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> force as the dynamic of astrophysical jets, explaining the movement phenomena of astrophysical jets. J. C. Maxwell applied the quaternion analysis to describe the electromagnetic theory. This encourages others to adopt the complex quaternion and octonion to depict the electromagnetic and gravitational theories. In the complex octonion space, {{it is capable of}} deducing the field potential, field strength, field source, angular momentum, torque, force and so forth. As one component of the force, the <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> force relates to the gradient of the norm of field strength only, and is independent of not only the direction of field strength but also the mass and electric charge for the test particle. When the <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> force is considered as the thrust of the astrophysical jets, one can deduce some movement features of astrophysical jets, including the bipolarity, matter ingredient, precession, symmetric distribution, emitting, collimation, stability, continuing acceleration and so forth. The above results reveal that the <b>strength</b> <b>gradient</b> force is able to be applied to explain the main mechanical features of astrophysical jets, and is the competitive candidate of the dynamic of astrophysical jets.

30|$|The second {{possible}} factor {{could be}} the physical property of the solvent. The solvent we used in digestive ripening can be classified into two categories: <b>linear</b> <b>solvents</b> and benzol solvents. As shown in Table  1, the <b>linear</b> <b>solvents</b> (n-hexane, n-octane) could not remarkably improve the nanoparticles distribution. This was likely because the flexible chain of <b>linear</b> <b>solvents</b> could intertwine with the flexible chain of DDT coated on the nanopartcles, which reduced the etching degree of the Au NPs in digestive ripening. As a result, the monodisperse Au NPs was hard to obtain. On the contrary, the size distribution may dramatically be improved after digestive ripening in benzol solvents (p-xylene, m-xylene, toluene, and chlorobenzene). RSD could decrease from the initial 15 to 9.5 % after 4  h reflux in chlorobenzene. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the size distribution was inversely related to the polarity of solvents. As shown in Table  1, with the increase of dielectric constants (representing the solvent polarity [22]) of the solvents, the size distribution of the Au NPs after digestive ripening was decreased gradually.|$|R
