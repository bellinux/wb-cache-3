50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has revealed that}} the black falcon may be an early offshoot of the Old World hierofalcons - such as the saker falcon (F. cherrug) and <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon</b> (F. jugger).|$|E
50|$|<b>Laggar</b> <b>falcons</b> {{used to be}} {{the most}} common falcons in the region, but numbers have {{declined}} markedly in recent times and today it is probably nowhere a common species anymore. The main threats are the intensification of pesticide use in the region and use as a decoy to trap large falcons.|$|R
25|$|The {{region is}} {{a haven for}} 141 species of migratory and {{resident}} birds of the desert. One can see eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrel and vultures. There are short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), greater spotted eagles (Aquila clanga), <b>laggar</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco jugger) and kestrels. There are also a number of reptiles.|$|R
2500|$|The Desert National Park in Jaisalmer {{is spread}} over {{an area of}} , is an {{excellent}} example of the ecosystem of the Thar Desert and its diverse fauna. [...] Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert. The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert. One can see many eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrels and vultures. Short-toed snake eagles (Circaetus gallicus), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), spotted eagles (Aquila clanga), <b>laggar</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco jugger) and kestrels are the commonest of these.|$|R
50|$|The <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco jugger) is a mid-sized {{bird of prey}} {{which occurs}} in the Indian subcontinent from extreme {{south-east}} Iran, south-east Afghanistan, Pakistan, through India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and north-west Myanmar.|$|E

50|$|Birds in {{the park}} include Himalayan griffon vulture, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon,</b> {{peregrine}} falcon, kestrel, Indian sparrow hawk, Egyptian vulture, white cheeked bulbul, yellow vented bulbul, paradise flycatcher, black partridge, cheer pheasant, Khalij pheasant, golden oriole, spotted dove, collared dove, larks, shrikes, wheatears and buntings.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{a fragile}} {{ecosystem}} {{there is an}} abundance of birdlife. The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert. Many eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrel and vultures. Short-toed eagles, tawny eagles, spotted eagles, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcons</b> and kestrels {{are the most common}} among these. Sand grouse are spotted near small ponds or lakes. The endangered great Indian bustard is a magnificent bird found in relatively fair numbers. It migrates locally in different seasons. The most suitable time to visit the area is between November and January. The Desert National Park has a collection of fossils of animals and plants of 180 million years old. Some fossils of dinosaurs of 6 million years old have been found in the area.|$|R
50|$|The Margallas are an {{excellent}} place for bird watchers. The area {{is home to a}} large number of birds, including robins, sparrows, kites, crows, larks, paradise flycatchers, black partridge, shrikes, pheasants, spotted doves, Egyptian vultures, falcons, hawks, eagles, Himalayan griffon vulture, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon,</b> peregrine falcon, kestrel, Indian sparrow hawk, white cheeked bulbul, yellow vented bulbul, paradise flycatcher, cheer pheasant, Khalij pheasant, golden oriole, spotted dove, collared dove, wheatears and buntings.|$|E
50|$|Madhav National Park {{is equally}} rich in avifauna. The {{artificial}} lake, Chandpatha, is the winter home of migratory geese, pochard, pintail, teal, mallard and gadwall. A good site for bird watching {{is where the}} forest track crosses the rocky stream that flows from the waste weir. Species that frequent this spot are red-wattled lapwing, large pied wagtail, Indian pond heron and white-breasted kingfisher. The park's birds also include the cormorant, painted stork, white ibis, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon,</b> purple sunbird, Indian paradise flycatcher and golden oriole.|$|E
50|$|The wetland, Patisar Lake, was {{initially}} {{built as a}} water reservoir and was an important habitat for waterfowl in winter but is now largely covered with reed beds and aquatic vegetation. The park has around 160 species of birds including houbara bustard, marsh harrier, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon,</b> peregrine falcon, kestrel, and Egyptian vulture, {{some of which are}} endangered species. Mammals in the region include blackbuck and Indian rhino which were both critically endangered and almost became extirpated but were re-introduced. A number of snake species are also found in the park including Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw scaled viper, wolf snake, and sand boa.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} animals {{can be found}} {{throughout}} the park. These include several wild animals of the desert such as wildcats, rabbits, bustards, and deer. Reptiles in the park include the monitor lizard, Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, wolf snake, John's sand boa, and spiny-tailed lizard. More than 160 species of birds are also present, including the houbara bustard, griffon vulture, crested honey buzzard, marsh harrier, hen harrier, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon,</b> peregrine falcon, kestrel, Eurasian sparrowhawk, Egyptian vulture, lark, shrike, wheatear, and barn owl. Lake Patisar, {{a large body of}} water {{in the center of the}} park, is ideal for bird watching. In mid-winter, the lake is regularly home to between 10,000 and 30,000 ducks and common coot.|$|E
50|$|This species {{belongs to}} a close-knit complex of falcons known as hierofalcons. In this group, there is ample {{evidence}} for rampant hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting which confounds analyses of DNA sequence data to a massive extent; molecular studies with small sample sizes can simply not be expected to yield reliable conclusions in the entire hierofalcon group. The radiation of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons seems to have taken place in the Eemian interglacial {{at the start of the}} Late Pleistocene, a mere 130,000-115,000 years ago; the <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon</b> represents a lineage that arrived at its present range out of eastern Africa by way of the Arabian Peninsula which during that time had a more humid climate than today.|$|E
50|$|The Deosai National Park was {{established}} in 1993 to protect {{the survival of the}} Himalayan brown bear and its habitat. Having long been a prize kill for poachers and hunters, the bear now has a hope for survival in Deosai where its number has increased from only 19 in 1993 to 40 in 2005. During the last decade, a few but effective measures have been taken by the Government of Pakistan for the survival of brown bear in the region. In 1993, Himalayan Wildlife Project was founded with a substantial financial support from international environmental concerns. But the brown bear is still under threat.The Deosai Plains are also home to the Himalayan ibex, red fox, golden marmot locally called Phia, gray wolf, the Ladakh urial, the snow leopard, and over 124 resident and migratory birds. Birds in the park include the golden eagle, lammergeier, griffon vulture, <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon,</b> peregrine falcon, kestrel, sparrowhawk and snowcock.The following species are found in DeosaiArtemisia maritima, Polygonum affine, Thalictrum alpinum, Bromus oxyodon, Saxifraga flagellaris, Androsace mucronifolia, Aster flaccidus, Barbarea vulgaris, Artemisia maritima, Agropyron longearistatum, Nepeta connate, Carex cruenta, Ranaculyus laetus, Arenaria neelgerrensis, Astrogalus leucophylla, Polygonum amplexinade, Echinop nivetus, Seria chrysanthenoides, Artemisia maritima, Dracocephalum nutsus, Anapalas contorta, Chrysopogon echinulatus, and Dianthus crinitus. There were also observed some medicinal plants which are locally famous i.e. Thymu linearis (Reetumburuk), Saussures lappa (kuth), Ephedra intimedia (Say), Viola canescens (Skora-mindoq), Dracocephalum muristanicum (Shamdun) and Artemisia maritima (Bursay) etc. are used as traditional drug therapies.|$|E
40|$|Tilting {{wind tunnels}} {{have been used}} to study the gliding {{performance}} of the pigeon Columba tivia (Pennycuick, 1968), and the <b>laggar</b> <b>falcon</b> Falco jugger (Tucker & Parrott, 1970).
