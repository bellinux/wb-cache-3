5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The <b>ligature</b> marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that <b>ligature</b> marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, <b>ligature</b> and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius <b>ligature</b> to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To evaluate, over a 12 -week period, the tensile {{strength}} (TS) and extension to TS of elastomeric <b>ligatures</b> (both clear and coloured) obtained from two companies. Setting Ex vivo study. Method: Seven replicates of five <b>ligatures</b> from two orthodontic companies were tested using an ex vivo assembly which simulated a clinical situation. Results: The <b>ligatures</b> tested {{had a similar}} TS decay pattern, with the TS gradually decreasing over {{the duration of the}} study. The Unitek <b>ligatures</b> exhibited a greater TS than their respective Ormco <b>ligatures.</b> Generally, all of the <b>ligatures</b> tested experienced an increase in the extension to TS over time. The pre-stretching procedure used in this study did not produce any long-term detrimental effects on the TS and extension to TS of the <b>ligatures</b> tested. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm there are differences in TS, and extension to TS between clear and coloured elastomeric <b>ligatures,</b> and that some significant differences also exist between different brands of elastomeric <b>ligatures...</b>|$|R

25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight <b>ligature</b> onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the <b>ligature</b> was cool and pale, while above the <b>ligature</b> it was warm and swollen. The <b>ligature</b> was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this {{laboratory}} study was to evaluate changes in the pigmentation of esthetic elastomeric <b>ligatures</b> after immersion in a staining solution. METHODS: Sixty <b>ligatures</b> were selected and divided into 12 groups according to their brand and also considering their condition, i. e., unstretched or stretched. The groups were divided into: Morelli (clear), TP Orthodontics (clear), American Orthodontics (clear), 3 M/Unitek (clear), American Orthodontics (pearl color) and 3 M/Unitek (pearl color), separated into groups of 5 unstretched and five stretched <b>ligatures.</b> Assessment of their color changes was performed by means of digital photograph and computer analysis using Adobe Photoshop. Standardized digital photographs were taken at T 0 (before the staining process, with unstretched <b>ligatures)</b> and at T 1 (following the 5 -days staining process). The staining solution was composed of artificial saliva and foods with staining potential. At T 1 the <b>ligatures</b> were either stretched or unstretched. RESULTS: The {{results of this study}} showed that esthetic elastomeric <b>ligatures</b> are prone to staining. Among the evaluated brands, TP Orthodontics and American Orthodontics clear <b>ligatures</b> were the most stable. Moreover, 3 M/Unitek pearl <b>ligatures</b> demonstrated statistically significant changes in all variables. CONCLUSIONS: Esthetic elastomeric <b>ligatures</b> are susceptible to staining and no statistically significant difference was found between unstretched or stretched <b>ligatures,</b> with the sole exception of the TP Orthodontics brand. The 3 M/Unitek's pearl color <b>ligatures</b> displayed the greatest staining potential...|$|R

25|$|A notable {{feature of}} Caslon's {{structure}} is its widely splayed T, which can space awkwardly with an 'h' afterwards. Accordingly, an emerging tradition among digital releases {{is to offer}} a 'Th' <b>ligature,</b> inspired by a tradition in calligraphy, to achieve tighter letterspacing. Adobe Caslon, LTC Caslon, Williams Caslon and Big Caslon (italics only, in the Font Bureau release) all offer a 'Th' <b>ligature</b> as default or as an alternate.|$|E

25|$|In hand writing, a <b>ligature</b> is made {{by joining}} two or more {{characters}} in atypical fashion by merging their parts or by writing one above or inside the other. While in printing, a <b>ligature</b> {{is a group of}} characters that is typeset as a unit, and the characters {{do not have to be}} joined. For example, in some cases the fi <b>ligature</b> prints the letters f and i with a greater separation than when they are typeset as separate letters. When printing with movable type was invented around 1450, typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters, as they were based on handwriting. Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another.|$|E
25|$|Today, modern font {{programming}} divides <b>ligatures</b> {{into three}} groups, {{which can be}} activated separately: standard, contextual and historical. Standard <b>ligatures</b> are needed to allow the font to display without errors such as character collision.
