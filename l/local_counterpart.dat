A disaggregated industry-group-wise analysis indicates that MNE affiliates perform no {{better than their}} <b>local</b> <b>counterparts</b> in high-tech industries. Thus, even with {{a higher level of}} integration with the global economy in the 1990 s India appears to have failed in attracting efficiency-seeking FDI on a significant scale, particularly in high-tech industries. R&D and efficiency of manpower emerge as two significant determinants of international competitiveness in technology-based sectors (high- and medium-high tech sectors). Imports of raw materials enhance the export competitiveness of firms in all industry groups. Finally, large firms are found to be more export oriented, implying the need for creating large flagship companies in the country.
