5000|$|As shown schematically in Figure 1, a {{high-speed}} blower, the associated power supply and electronic control package was {{suspended from the}} base of the sample balloon, at the lowest point in the <b>load</b> <b>train</b> (#57). The base of the sample balloon was modified to take a cylindrical fitting (#40) that was fitted with the blower. The blower would operate at the ceiling altitude of 80000 ft for of the order of two hours to fill the sample balloon with about [...] of air. The inflated sample balloon is illustrated in Figure 2 at the conclusion of the sampling cycle. At this point, an autopilot would release a predetermined amount of helium from the lifting balloon and initiate the descent of the entire system at a rate of about 400 feet per minute. As the system descended to about 10000 ft, an axial fan (#29) located at the top of the sample envelope would be activated to transfer the air sample into a flexible armored vessel (#27) located just above the sample balloon and below the lifting balloon and suspended parachute (#23). The transfer of the sample required a short period of time and then a valve at the base of the armored vessel (#29) was sealed. The system continued to descend and when the control unit contacted ground, explosive devices severed the connection between the lifting balloon and the parachute and this led to a collapse of the lifting balloon and conclusion of the flight. The Grab Bag concept resulted in a complex <b>load</b> <b>train</b> with electrical cables running along the entire length of the system, about 300 ft in length. Launching of the system was a challenge to safely get this extended system off the ground, and to do so without damaging the lifting balloon, the sample envelope, electrical cables for the blowers, the autopilot and associated helium valve, antenna lines and other elements of the system.|$|E
5000|$|A non-rigid armored vessel (#27) was {{designed}} that would withstand {{the rigors of}} most landings and preserve the air sample of approximately [...] It consisted of three nested cylinders of flexible materials that, from the outside to the inside, were: a tough outer layer of plasticized nylon; an intermediate layer of woven nylon with very high tear strength, and; an innermost cylinder of polyethylene film that {{would serve as a}} gas barrier for the air sample. At takeoff the armored vessel hung in a deflated form around the steel cable (#27) and below an open parachute (#23) that would provide braking of the system descent if the rate exceeded about 2000 feet per minute. Launching of this complex balloon system required special handling techniques, and the entire process was referred to as a platform launch, a novel concept developed by Harold E. Froehlich, principal engineer of the Balloons and Meteorological System Group. In this form of launching the <b>load</b> <b>train,</b> nearly 300 ft in length, was laid out on a ground cloth-covered runway with the lowest part of the <b>load</b> <b>train</b> in the upwind direction. The uppermost part of the system, the top of the lifting balloon, would be in the downwind direction. A heavy platform was positioned at a point toward the top of the lifting balloon, and the balloon material would pass over the platform and be securely held in place by a large horizontal padded roller about four feet in length. The helium inflation tube was located in the upper portion of the lifting balloon so that the helium source would inflate the section of the balloon beyond the platform. Since the system would be ascending to 80000 ft in altitude, only about 3% of the maximum balloon volume was filled with helium. The inflation took place by metering in an amount of helium lifting gas that would equal the gross weight of the system plus typically about 5% of ‘free lift’ to ensure that the system would ascend at an appropriate rate at the launching. Launching was initiated by releasing the padded roller on the launch platform. The ascending balloon would then sequentially pick up {{the lower part of the}} lifting balloon, the deployed parachute and armored vessel, the uninflated envelope, and lastly the heavy insulated bag containing the controller, blower, instruments, telemetering equipment and power supply. There were variations of this procedure that evolved to facilitate the launching. For example, the heavy instrument bag and blower assembly was eventually mounted on the front of a vehicle that drove under the balloon system as it ascended during launching, and the bag was released from the vehicle using small explosive devices. [...] Grab Bag flights were typically launched early in the morning and recovered during daylight hours of that same day. The ascent time to 80000 ft was usually about three hours. As the balloon system approached the ceiling altitude, the excess lift (referred to as [...] "free lift") that drove the system upward on launching filled out a duct system of the lifting balloon, and helium was automatically vented from the lifting balloon and slowed the ascent. As this process continued, the balloon system slowly ascended to the ceiling altitude and was in equilibrium, the lift of the helium balloon just balancing the total weight of the system. If this process took place as designed, about thirty minutes were needed to assure that the system was stable at the ceiling altitude of 80000 ft. If the system instruments indicated that the altitude was not changing, the blower attached to the sample envelope balloon at the base of the system was initiated by the controller. The effect of turning on the blower was almost immediately evident in the appearance of the sample balloon. Viewing the system through a tracking telescope clearly showed the sample envelope beginning to fill out. The sample gathering process typically required of the order of an hour or so to be completed, the appearance of the system then being of two balloons, one immediately on top of the other. The blower was then turned off by the controller and a valve closed that sealed the sample envelope from the outside. The autopilot was then activated by the controller, releasing helium from the lifting balloon (#116) and initiating a descent of the entire system. In practice, the descent of the system did not become apparent for of the order of an hour after the autopilot was activated. This was because the sample balloon, now containing a large volume of air, would generate lift with any descent due to adiabatic heating of the sample air in the isothermal stratosphere. It could require an hour or two to establish a nominal descent rate of the system. The descent to altitudes of the order of 15000 ft could take of the order of two to three hours. At this point the axial fan (#29) was automatically initiated to transfer air in the sample balloon into the armored vessel. This transfer was usually completed before the system reached an altitude of 4 or 5 thousand feet and a valve in the armored vessel valve just above the axial fan (#25) was sealed by the controller. As the system continued to descend and touched down, explosive cutters fired to release the lifting balloon from the lower part of the system and the armored vessel fell the short remaining distance, perhaps fifty feet, to the ground. Usually the recovery crew was at the landing site and immediately began the process of transferring the air sample from the armored vessel into high-pressure bottles for transfer to another laboratory for analyses. A series of six test flights were carried out in the Grab Bag development program in which various system elements were examined. The seventh flight would be the first attempt to capture the first air sample at 80000 ft in the Minneapolis area in mid-August 1953. The six test flights carried out tests of various system components, and included: tests and further development of the launching procedure for this complex system; an evaluation of the system controller; adequacy of the power supply and the autopilot function; a study of the blower function at altitude to evaluate both its function and the volume of air delivered into the sample balloon as compared to the laboratory results; evaluation of the process in which the axial fan transferred the air sample from the sample balloon into the armored vessel and the vessel was sealed; and in each case, further development of logistics for system launching and recovery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mechanical test {{machines}} play {{an important}} role in providing simulation data to underpin careful analysis of high rate processes. In many cases elements of the test frame or testpiece can vibrate when subjected to a high rate force. The transducers attached to the machine frequently register this vibration superimposed on the true signal and thus may mask the signal required for analysis [1 - 4]. At impact all the parts of the test machine oscillate at their natural frequency (dependent on stiffness and mass). Ringing in test machines is determined by the rate at which the testpiece is deformed, the elastic characteristics of test material and resonances in components of <b>load</b> <b>train</b> anvils in compression. In the current work high rate hot compression tests are being developed to underpin best practice measurement guides on test methods for studying the dependence of strength on deformation rate and temperature, [5 - 7]. At higher rates of deformation ringing is observed in the transducer signals for load and displacement and this measurement note summarises the results of systematic tests to investigate this issue.

Diaphragmatic mobilization, represented by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and neural respiratory drive, expressed as the corrected root mean square (RMS) of the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi), both provide vital information to select the proper IMT device and loads in COPD, therefore contributing to the curative effect of IMT. Pdi and RMS of EMGdi (RMSdi%) were measured and compared during inspiratory resistive <b>training</b> and threshold <b>load</b> <b>training</b> in stable patients with COPD.

These {{techniques are}} based on the formation of a standing ultrasonic wave in the specimen and usually use frequencies around 20 kHz.

This limitation can be overcome by coupling an ultrasonic test device to a universal test rig. In this work a different approach is presented that is particularly well suited for studying environmental effects. The <b>load</b> <b>train</b> with the specimen is enclosed in a pressure vessel. An acoustic horn divides this pressure vessel into two separate chambers.

The {{authors have}} evolved an {{empirical}} method for characterizing resis-tance to ductile fracture using two parameters 0 f and f {{that can be}} determined from tensile test data of smooth cylindrical specimens.

The test procedure employed is simple and does not require gauge-length extensome-try, a distinct advantage at non-ambient temperatures. The tests are carried out in a screw-driven machine at a constant crosshead speed, with online computerized acquisition of load–time data; it is also necessary to have a prior precise calibration for the (nonlinear) elastic deformation of the <b>load</b> <b>train.</b> The method of computing 0 f and f, from tensile data is described, and its engineering application demon-strated by characterizing the effect of ageing of two dissimilar metal welds, namely Alloy 800 / 225 Cr– 1 Mo steel and Alloy 800 / 9 Cr– 1 Mo steel.

In the dynamic model, one wheel, the wing rails and the crossing nose (frog) are modelled. The bogie, the complete wheel set {{and the support of}} the crossing are represented as a system consisting of masses, springs, dampers and friction-generating elements. The rolling/sliding behaviour between the wheel and crossing is studied using the proposed model. Due to the conical shape of the wheel tread and multiple contacts between the wheel and the crossing parts, sliding occurs during the transition of the wheel from the wing rail to the crossing nose or vice versa. At the same time, an impact occurs that produces high contact forces. The parameters of the model are the train speed and passing direction, the wheel and the crossing geometry, the axle load and the support of the crossing. In this paper, the crossover process is studied for high axle loads and compared with results of simulations using a normal axle load.

Four types of geosynthetics and a shockmat were installed below the ballast layer in selected sections of track constructed on three different subgrades (soft alluvial clay, hard rock, and concrete bridge), and the performance of the instrumented track was monitored for five years under in-service conditions including tamping operations.

The study also showed that the aperture size of geogrids in the range of 1. 1 times the mean particle size of the ballast was most effective. The placement of shockmat on a concrete bridge contributed to reduced ballast breakage.

40|$|Three {{shapes of}} tensile {{specimens}} were tested [...] curved {{with a very}} low stress concentration factor and straight with either a circular hole or an elliptical hole. The nominal thickness was 125 micron with a net section 100 micron wide; the overall length of these microspecimens was 3. 1 mm. They were fabricated by an improved version of deep reactive ion etching, which produced specimens with smooth sidewalls and cross-sections having a slightly trapezoidal shape that was exaggerated inside the holes. The novel test setup used a vertical <b>load</b> <b>train</b> extending into a resistance furnace. The specimens had wedge-shaped ends which fit into ceramic grips.

The strengths of the curved specimens for two batches of material (made with slightly different processes) were 0. 66 +/- 0. 12 GPa and 0. 45 +/- 0. 20 GPa respectively at 24 C with identical values at 1000 C. The fracture strengths of the circular-hole and elliptical-hole specimens (computed from the stress concentration factors and measured loads at failure) were approximately 1. 2 GPa with slight decreases at the higher temperature. Fractographic examinations showed failures initiating on the surface [...] primarily at corners. Weibull predictions of fracture strengths for the hole specimens based on {{the properties of the}} curved specimens were reasonably effective for the circular holes, but not for the elliptical holes...|$|E
40|$|Damage {{tolerance}} testing {{development was}} required to help qualify a new spin forming dome fabrication process for the Ares 1 program at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). One challenge of the testing {{was due to the}} compound curvature of the dome. The testing was developed on a sub-scale dome with a diameter of approximately 40 inches. The simulated service testing performed was based on the EQTP 1102 Rev L 2195 Aluminum Lot Acceptance Simulated Service Test and Analysis Procedure generated by Lockheed Martin for the Space Shuttle External Fuel Tank. This testing is performed on a specimen with an induced flaw of elliptical shape generated by Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) and subsequent fatigue cycling for crack propagation to a predetermined length and depth. The specimen is then loaded in tension at a constant rate of displacement at room temperature until fracture occurs while recording load and strain. An identical specimen with a similar flaw is then proof tested at room temperature to imminent failure based on the critical offset strain achieved by the previous fracture test. If the specimen survives the proof, it is then subjected to cryogenic cycling with loads that are a percentage of the proof load performed at room temperature. If all cryogenic cycles are successful, the specimen is loaded in tension to failure {{at the end of the}} test. This standard was generated for flat plate, so a method of translating this to a specimen of compound curvature was required. This was accomplished by fabricating a fixture that maintained the curvature of the specimen rigidly with the exception of approximately one-half inch in the center of the specimen containing the induced flaw. This in conjunction with placing the center of the specimen in the center of the <b>load</b> <b>train</b> allowed for successful testing with a minimal amount of bending introduced into the system. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests were performed using the typical double beam assembly and with 4 -point loaded specimens under alternate immersion conditions in a 3. 5 % NaCl environment for 90 days. In addition, experiments were conducted to determine the threshold stress intensity factor for SCC (K 1 SCC) of Al-Li 2195 which to our knowledge has not been determined previously. The successful simulated service and stress corrosion testing helped to provide confidence to continue to Ares 1 scale dome fabrication...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} characterization including evolution of damage and failure of foams and composites {{are becoming increasingly}} important, as they form the basic components of sandwich structures. Sandwich structures consist of two faceplates that surround a core material. In many modern applications, faceplates and cores are typically comprised of composite materials and polymeric foam, respectively. Knowledge of the failure behavior of these individual components is necessary for understanding the failure behavior and design of sandwich structures. A systematic investigation of the damage evolution and failure behavior of foams and composites was conducted {{using a variety of}} experimental techniques. In-situ ultrasonic measurements were used to track the damage behavior in PVC polymeric foams with densities ranging from 130 to 250 kg/m 3. The wave speeds were measured by two quartz piezoelectric shear transducers with a resonant frequency of 5 MHz in the transmission mode. A fixture was developed and constructed to protect the transducers during compression, while allowing them to take sound speed measurements of the sample along the axis of the <b>load</b> <b>train.</b> This fixture was placed in a servo-hydraulic MTS (Materials Testing System) machine, where the load-displacement response of the foam was recorded. A digital image correlation (DIC) method was used to capture the progression of failure under compression. Two dominant failure modes, elastic buckling and plastic collapse, were identified – and their onsets corresponded to the change in elastic wave speeds in the material, measured by the in-situ ultrasonic technique. The transverse response of S-Glass/Epoxy unidirectional composites was investigated under varying degrees of confinement and strain rates. The experimental setup utilizes a fixture that allowed for independent measurement of the three principal stresses in a confined specimen. A servo-hydraulic materials testing system and a Kolsky (split Hopkinson) pressure bar generated strain rates between 10 - 3 to 104 s- 1. Post-test scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations suggest that under transverse loading at low-strain rates, confinement contributes to localized band formation. In addition, micrographs indicated that macroscopic transverse failure is dominated by shear stress, and occurs within these localized bands. These shear dominated failure bands were found inclined in a direction approximately 35 degrees to the direction of loading. Implications of this orientation deviation of failure bands from maximum shear trajectories at 45 degrees are discussed in reference to the state of confinement...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} whether overreached athletes show psychomotor slowness after a period of high <b>load</b> <b>training.</b> Fourteen well-trained cyclists (10 male, 4 female, mean age 25. 3 [SD = 4. 1] years, mean maximal oxygen consumption 65. 5 [SD= 8. 1] ml/ kg-min) performed a maximal graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer, filled out two questionnaires and performed two tests of psychomotor speed before and after high <b>load</b> <b>training</b> and after two weeks of recovery training. A control group performed the two tests of psychomotor speed on the same occasions without changing physical activity levels. Five cyclists were classified as functional overreached, seven cyclists were classified as well-trained and two cyclists were excluded from analysis. Results showed no significant differences in psychomotor speed between the control, well-trained and functional overreached groups on the three measurements. A trend towards psychomotor slowness was found for the functional overreached compared to the control group after high <b>load</b> <b>training.</b> Additional research with more subjects and a greater degree of overload training is necessary to more conclusively determine if psychomotor speed can be used as an early marker for overtraining...|$|R
