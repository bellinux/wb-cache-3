25|$|The Finapres {{methodology}} {{was developed}} to use this information to calculate arterial pressure from finger cuff pressure data. A generalised algorithm to correct for the pressure <b>level</b> <b>difference</b> between the finger and brachial sites in patients was developed. This correction worked under all of the circumstances it was tested in—even when it was not designed for it—because it applied general physiological principles. This innovative brachial pressure waveform reconstruction method was first implemented in the Finometer, the successor of Finapres that BMI-TNO introduced to the market in 2000.|$|E

25|$|On 30 November 1808 {{their most}} famous charge up the Somosierra Pass took place. That day the 3rd Squadron under Kozietulski (ad interim) {{was on duty}} as a {{personal}} escort to the Emperor. After {{the failure of the}} French infantry attack, Napoleon ordered Polish chevaulegers to take the pass defended by 3000 men and four batteries of Spanish cannons. The narrow road to the top (300 meters <b>level</b> <b>difference,</b> 2,500 meters long), bordered from both sides with waist high stone walls, lined with poplar trees, precluded a demi-squadron or even a troop frontal attack. This was why the attack was conducted in a column four horses wide. After the first battery was taken, chevaulegers, without slowing the full gallop charge gained the top of the Pass in about eight minutes. All four batteries were taken, and the road to Madrid opened for Napoleon's Army. The charge was led by Kozietulski who, however, lost his horse after taking the first battery. The squadron was then joined by Lt. Andrzej Niegolewski, who had previously been on reconnaissance with his troop. The charge was continued under Dziewanowski, and when he fell from his horse after taking the third battery, by Piotr Krasiński. The charge, which continued to the last battery, was led by Niegolewski, who miraculously survived when the Spanish attacked him (he received nine wounds from bayonnettes and two carbine shots to the head).|$|E

2500|$|It {{should be}} noted that the newer canal was not always at a higher level than the one it joined. For instance, there is a very shallow lock at Autherley Junction, where the 1835 Birmingham and Liverpool canal (now part of the Shropshire Union Canal) met the older Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, build in 1772. The Nicholson guide shows that a boater {{travelling}} south along the newer canal locks [...] "up" [...] before turning north or south onto the older Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal – so the Shropshire Union Canal gains a small lockful of water each time a boat passes.

40|$|PRICE indexes are {{commonly}} used to measure price <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> between one time period and the next, such as {{the consumer price index}} (CPI) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The percent change in the CPI is a measure of inflation. Less common are price indexes that measure price <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> between one place and another. This is in part because the methodology and sampling requirements for the two types of measures have important differences. Fortunately, advances in regional econometric analysis and in the techniques used in estimating timeto-time indexes, such as hedonic regressions, are applicable to the estimation of place-to-place indexes. This Research Spotlight describes a method developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate place-to-place indexes that measure regional price <b>level</b> <b>differences.</b> Percent differences in regional price levels are called regional price parities (RPPs). The main difference between an inflation index and the price parities described here is that the former measures changes in price levels across different time periods for one specific place, while the latter captures <b>differences</b> in price <b>levels</b> across various regions for one specific time period.

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the distribution of}} inter-aural sensorineural hearing threshold <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> in the non-noise-exposed adult population of the UK. Setting: A two-stage population study carried out in 1979 – 1986, initially by postal questionnaire, followed up in a proportion of participants by clinical and audiological examination. Participants: Volunteers (n = 48 313) initially selected at random from the electoral registers of four cities, subsequently selected at random from questionnaire respondents stratified by answers to questions about hearing. Main outcomes measure: Inter-aural hearing threshold <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> measured audiometrically, {{as a function of}} age and gender. Results: Tables of inter-aural threshold <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> provided as a resource with potential medicolegal, clinical and research applications. Based on the average of the frequencies 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz, ? 1 % of the general UK population aged 18 – 80 years have an asymmetry of 15 dB or more. The prevalence is greater in older than in younger people. Conclusions: Inter-aural threshold differences greater than attributable to measurement error are not uncommon in the adult population, even after screening for conductive hearing loss and substantial noise exposure. They are typically of unknown origin. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine subjective equivalence of aircraft subsonic flyover noise and sonic booms. Two of the {{experiments were}} conducted in a loudspeaker-driven sonic boom simulator, and the third in a large room containing conventional loudspeakers. The sound generation system of the boom simulator had a frequency response extending to very low frequencies (about 1 Hz) whereas the large room loudspeakers were limited to about 20 Hz. Subjective equivalence between booms and flyovers was quantified in terms of the difference between the noise level of a boom and that of a flyover when the two were judged equally annoying. Noise levels were quantified in terms of the following noise descriptors: Perceived Level (PL), Perceived Noise Level (PNL), C-weighted sound exposure level (SELC), and A-weighted sound exposure level (SELA). Results from the present study were compared, where possible, to similar results obtained in other studies. Results showed that noise <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> depended upon the descriptor used, specific boom and aircraft noise events being compared and, except for the PNL descriptor, varied between the simulator and large room. Comparison of noise <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> obtained in the present study with those of other studies indicated good agreement across studies only for the PNL and SELA descriptors. Comparison of the present results with assessments of 1 community response to high-energy impulsive sounds made by Working Group 84 of the National Research Council's Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics, and Biomechanics (CHABA) showed good agreement when boom/flyover noise <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> were based on SELA.

40|$|Objectives: The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to see how hearing-impaired individuals judge <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> between speech sounds with and without hearing amplification. It was hypothesized that hearing aid compression should adversely affect the user's ability to judge <b>level</b> <b>differences.</b> Design: Thirty-eight hearing-impaired participants performed an adaptive tracking procedure to determine their level-discrimination thresholds for different word and sentence tokens, as well as speech-spectrum noise, with and without their hearing aids. Eight normal-hearing participants performed the same task for comparison. Results: Level discrimination for different word and sentence tokens was more difficult than the discrimination of stationary noises. Word level discrimination was significantly more difficult than sentence level discrimination. There were no significant differences, however, between mean performance with and without hearing aids and no correlations between performance and various hearing aid measurements. Conclusions: There is a clear difficulty in judging the <b>level</b> <b>differences</b> between words or sentences relative to differences between broadband noises, but this difficulty was found for both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals and had no relation to hearing aid compression measures. The lack of a clear adverse effect of hearing aid compression on level discrimination is suggested to be due to the low effective compression ratios of currently fit hearing aids...|$|R
