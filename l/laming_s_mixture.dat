The reason for this is not clear, but may relate to restructuring/sintering of the systems. At 873  K, hydrogen sulphide adsorption produced the bulk sulphide Rh 2 S 3; however, when a 1 : 1 H 2 :H 2 <b>S</b> <b>mixture</b> was used, formation of the bulk sulphide was inhibited. The Rh:S ratio was reduced to ~ 1 : 1, and for Rh/silica a significant amount of HS(ads) was identified.|$|R
