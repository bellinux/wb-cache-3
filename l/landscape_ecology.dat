25|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> theory {{stresses}} {{the role of}} human impacts on landscape structures and functions. It also proposes ways for restoring degraded landscapes. <b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> explicitly includes humans as entities that cause functional changes on the landscape. <b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> theory includes the landscape stability principle, which {{emphasizes the importance of}} landscape structural heterogeneity in developing resistance to disturbances, recovery from disturbances, and promoting total system stability. This principle is a major contribution to general ecological theories which highlight the importance of relationships among the various components of the landscape. Integrity of landscape components helps maintain resistance to external threats, including development and land transformation by human activity. Analysis of land use change has included a strongly geographical approach which has led to the acceptance of the idea of multifunctional properties of landscapes. There are still calls for a more unified theory of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> due to differences in professional opinion among ecologists and its interdisciplinary approach (Bastian 2001).|$|E

25|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> is {{the science}} of {{studying}} and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.|$|E
25|$|A {{landscape}} with structure and pattern implies {{that it has}} spatial heterogeneity, or the uneven distribution of objects across the landscape. Heterogeneity {{is a key element}} of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. Landscape heterogeneity is able to quantify with agent-based methods as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology.</b> Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize {{that this is not}} always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. <b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances {{as an integral part of}} the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.|$|E

25|$|The {{concepts}} of spatial ecology are fundamental {{to understanding the}} spatial dynamics of population and community ecology. The spatial heterogeneity of populations and communities plays {{a central role in}} such ecological theories such as succession, adaptation, community stability, competition, predator-prey interactions, parasitism, and epidemics. The rapidly expanding field of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> utilizes the basic aspects of spatial ecology in its research.|$|E
25|$|Conflict over {{ecological}} and resource management has been controversial, {{and the area}} is a flagship site among conservation groups that promote ecosystem management.

It is also home to the diverse native plants and animals of Yellowstone.|$|E
25|$|A main {{concept in}} <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> is scale. Scale {{represents}} {{the real world}} as translated onto a map, relating distance on a map image and the corresponding distance on earth. Scale is also the spatial or temporal measure of an object or a process, or amount of spatial resolution. Components of scale include composition, structure, and function, which are all important ecological concepts. Applied to <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology,</b> composition refers {{to the number of}} patch types (see below) represented on a landscape and their relative abundance. For example, the amount of forest or wetland, the length of forest edge, or the density of roads can be aspects of landscape composition. Structure is determined by the composition, the configuration, and the proportion of different patches across the landscape, while function refers to how each element in the landscape interacts based on its life cycle events. Pattern is the term for the contents and internal order of a heterogeneous area of land.|$|E

25|$|Birds {{were also}} {{widely used in}} studies of the niche {{hypothesis}} and Georgii Gause's competitive exclusion principle. Work on resource partitioning and the structuring of bird communities through competition were made by Robert MacArthur. Patterns of biodiversity also became a topic of interest. Work {{on the relationship of}} the number of species to area and its application in the study of island biogeography was pioneered by E. O. Wilson and Robert MacArthur. These studies {{led to the development of}} the discipline of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Biogeography is most keenly {{observed}} on islands, {{which has led}} to the development of the subdiscipline of island biogeography. These habitats are often a more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland. In 1967, Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson published The Theory of Island Biogeography. This showed that the species richness in an area could be predicted in terms of factors such as habitat area, immigration rate and extinction rate. The theory is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory. The application of island biogeography theory to habitat fragments spurred the development of the fields of conservation biology and <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} nanotechnology with <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology,</b> {{a habitat}} landscape can be nanofabricated on-chip {{by building a}} collection of nanofabricated bacterial habitats, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements and with nano-scale channels providing them with the local ecosystem service of habitat renewal. These landscapes of MHPs {{can be used as}} physical implementations of an adaptive landscape: by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a metapopulation system operating on-chip within a synthetic ecosystem. The metapopulation biology and evolutionary ecology of these bacterial systems, in these synthetic ecosystems, can be addressed using experimental biophysics.|$|E

25|$|Crop {{protection}} {{scientists are}} trying to develop rice pest management techniques which are sustainable. In other words, to manage crop pests {{in such a manner}} that future crop production is not threatened. Sustainable pest management is based on four principles: biodiversity, host plant resistance (HPR), <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology,</b> and hierarchies in a landscape â from biological to social. At present, rice pest management includes cultural techniques, pest-resistant rice varieties, and pesticides (which include insecticide). Increasingly, there is evidence that farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary, and even facilitate pest outbreaks. By reducing the populations of natural enemies of rice pests, misuse of insecticides can actually lead to pest outbreaks. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an 87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers. IRRI also conducted two campaigns in 1994 and 2003, respectively, which discouraged insecticide misuse and smarter pest management in Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> {{not only}} created new terms, but also {{incorporated}} existing ecological terms in new ways. [...] Many {{of the terms}} used in <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> are as interconnected and interrelated as the discipline itself.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{into a variety of}} ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of landscape limnology. In addition, <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as agriculture and forestry. [...] In agriculture, <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices. [...] Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems. [...] In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes. [...] Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry. <b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> has been cited as a contributor to the development of fisheries biology as a distinct biological science discipline, and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in hydrology. It has helped shape integrated landscape management. [...] Lastly, <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning. [...] In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> tools and methods.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{research}} programmes of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> theory, namely those {{standing in}} the European tradition, may be slightly outside of the [...] "classical and preferred domain of scientific disciplines" [...] because of the large, heterogeneous areas of study. However, general ecology theory is central to <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> theory in many aspects. [...] <b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> consists of four main principles: the development and dynamics of spatial heterogeneity, interactions and exchanges across heterogeneous landscapes, influences of spatial heterogeneity on biotic and abiotic processes, and the management of spatial heterogeneity. [...] The main difference from traditional ecological studies, which frequently assume that systems are spatially homogenous, is the consideration of spatial patterns.|$|E
2500|$|One central <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> theory {{originated}} from MacArthur & Wilson's The Theory of Island Biogeography. [...] This work considered the biodiversity on islands {{as the result}} of competing forces of colonization from a mainland stock and stochastic extinction. [...] The concepts of island biogeography were generalized from physical islands to abstract patches of habitat by Levins' metapopulation model (which can be applied e.g. to forest islands in the agricultural landscape). [...] This generalization spurred the growth of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> by providing conservation biologists a new tool to assess how habitat fragmentation affects population viability. [...] Recent growth of <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> owes much to the development of geographic information systems (GIS) and the availability of large-extent habitat data (e.g. remotely sensed datasets).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> {{developed}} in Europe from historical planning on human-dominated landscapes. [...] Concepts from general ecology theory were integrated in North America. [...] While general ecology theory and its sub-disciplines {{focused on the}} study of more homogenous, discrete community units organized in a hierarchical structure (typically as ecosystems, populations, species, and communities), <b>landscape</b> <b>ecology</b> built upon heterogeneity in space and time. It frequently included human-caused landscape changes in theory and application of concepts.|$|E
