50|$|The {{disease is}} caused by a defect in an enzyme known as aspartylglucosaminidase. This enzyme plays a {{significant}} role in our bodies because it aids in breaking down certain sugars (for example, oligosaccharides) that are attached to specific proteins (for example, glycoproteins). Aspartylglucosaminuria itself is characterized as a <b>lysosomal</b> <b>disease</b> because it does deal with inadequate activity in an enzyme's function. Aspartylglucosaminidase functions to break down glycoproteins. These proteins are most abundant in the tissues of the body and in the surfaces of major organs, such as the liver, spleen, thyroid and nerves. When glycoproteins are not broken down, aspartylglucosaminidase backs up in the lysosomes along with other substances. This backup causes progressive damage to the tissues and organs.|$|E

40|$|Diagnosis of {{lysosomal}} storage diseases (LSDs) can {{be problematic}} in atypical cases where clinical phenotype may overlap with other genetically distinct disorders. In addition, LSDs {{may result from}} mutations in genes not yet implicated in disease. Thus, there are individuals that are diagnosed with apparent LSD based upon clinical criteria where the gene defect remains elusive. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether comparative proteomics approaches could provide useful insights into such cases. Most LSDs arise from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal proteins that contain mannose 6 -phosphate, a carbohydrate modification that acts as a signal for intracellular targeting to the lysosome. We purified mannose 6 -phosphorylated proteins by affinity chromatography and estimated relative abundance of individual proteins in the mixture by spectral counting of peptides detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Our rationale was that proteins that are decreased or absent in patients compared with controls could represent candidates for the primary defect, directing biochemical or genetics studies. On a survey of brain autopsy specimens from 23 patients with either confirmed or possible <b>lysosomal</b> <b>disease,</b> this approach identified or validated the genetic basis for disease in eight cases. These results indicate that this protein expression approach is useful for identifying defects in cases of undiagnosed <b>lysosomal</b> <b>disease,</b> and we demonstrated that it can be used with more accessible patient samples, e. g. cultured cells.

40|$|Mutations in {{solute carrier}} family 9 isoform 6 on {{chromosome}} Xq 26. 3 encoding sodium–hydrogen exchanger 6, a protein mainly expressed in early and recycling endosomes are known to cause a complex and slowly progressive degenerative human neurological disease. Three resulting phenotypes have so far been reported: an X-linked Angelman syndrome-like condition, Christianson syndrome and corticobasal degeneration with tau deposition, with each characterized by severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autistic behaviour and ataxia. Hypothesizing that a sodium–hydrogen exchanger 6 deficiency would most likely disrupt the endosomal–lysosomal system of neurons, we examined Slc 9 a 6 knockout mice with tissue staining and related techniques commonly used to study lysosomal storage disorders. As a result, we found that sodium–hydrogen exchanger 6 depletion leads to abnormal accumulation of GM 2 ganglioside and unesterified cholesterol within late endosomes and lysosomes of neurons in selective brain regions, most notably the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, the CA 3 and CA 4 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and some areas of cerebral cortex. In these select neuronal populations, histochemical staining for β-hexosaminidase activity, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of GM 2 ganglioside, was undetectable. Neuroaxonal dystrophy similar to that observed in <b>lysosomal</b> <b>disease</b> was observed in the cerebellum and {{was accompanied by a}} marked and progressive loss of Purkinje cells, particularly in those lacking the expression of Zebrin II. On behavioural testing, Slc 9 a 6 knockout mice displayed a discrete clinical phenotype attributable to motor hyperactivity and cerebellar dysfunction. Importantly, these findings show that sodium–hydrogen exchanger 6 loss of function in the Slc 9 a 6 -targeted mouse model leads to compromise of endosomal–lysosomal function similar to <b>lysosomal</b> <b>disease</b> and to conspicuous neuronal abnormalities in specific brain regions, which in concert could provide a unified explanation for the cellular and clinical phenotypes in humans with SLC 9 A 6 mutations...|$|E

In addition to these inhibitory chaperones, non-competitive chaperones without inhibitory bioactivity are being developed. Furthermore molecular chaperone therapy utilizing the heat shock protein and other chaperone proteins induced by small molecules has been experimentally tried to handle abnormally accumulated proteins as a new approach particularly to neurodegenerative diseases.

40|$|AbstractLysosomal {{diseases}} are inherited metabolic disorders caused by defects {{in a wide}} spectrum of lysosomal and a few non-lysosomal proteins. In most cases a single type of primary storage material is identified, which has been used to name and classify the disorders: hence the terms sphingolipidoses, gangliosidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, glycoproteinoses, and so forth. In addition to this primary storage, however, a host of secondary storage products can also be identified, more often than not having no direct link to the primary protein defect. Lipids – glycosphingolipids and phospholipids, as well as cholesterol – are the most ubiquitous and best studied of these secondary storage materials. While in the past typically considered nonspecific and nonconsequential features of these diseases, newer studies suggest direct links between secondary storage and disease pathogenesis and support the view that understanding all aspects of this sequestration process will provide important insights into the cell biology and treatment of <b>lysosomal</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

Background: <b>Lysosomal</b> storage <b>diseases</b> {{is a group of}} rare genetic disorders caused by defects in lysosomal enzymes or the transport mechanism involving them. This causes an accumulation of substrates which subsequently leads to disease involving many different organ systems depending on the enzyme at fault. Enzyme replacement therapy is one of the treatment options and aims to correct this enzyme deficiency by supplementing recombinant enzyme intravenously. Method: Litterature searches were performed in Medline in the period June-August 2015 using the words <b>lysosomal</b> storage <b>disease,</b> enzyme replacement therapy and <b>lysosomal</b> storage <b>disease</b> AND enzyme replacement therapy.
