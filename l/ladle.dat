5|$|The Qinghe Special Steel Corporation {{disaster}} was {{an industrial}} disaster that occurred on April 18, 2007, in Tieling, Liaoning, China. Thirty-two {{people were killed}} and six were injured when a <b>ladle</b> used to transport molten steel separated from an overhead rail in the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation factory.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} where the disaster occurred {{was used by}} the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation as a steel processing plant. The <b>ladle</b> which failed carried molten steel from a blast furnace to other processes, and had a diameter of two metres and a capacity of 30 tons (25 tonnes) of liquid steel. It ran on a rail at a height of three metres above the factory floor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ladles</b> can {{be either}} open-topped or covered. Covered <b>ladles</b> have a (sometimes removable) {{dome-shaped}} lid to contain radiant heat; they lose heat slower than open-topped <b>ladles.</b> Small <b>ladles</b> do not commonly have covers, although a ceramic blanket may be used instead (where available).|$|R
5000|$|The {{remaining}} {{objects in}} the Mildenhall assemblage are all small eating utensils; five round-bowled <b>ladles</b> or spoons, and eight long-handled spoons of the common late-Roman cochlear type. The round 'ladles' have zoomorphic handles cast {{in the form of}} dolphins. There is a comparable piece in the Traprain treasure, and there are two sets each of ten <b>ladles</b> of this type, though not with zoomorphic handles, in the Hoxne hoard. [...] Only four handles survive from the Mildenhall <b>ladles,</b> and one of those is broken and incomplete. Because handles and bowls were soldered together in antiquity and had separated during burial, it is not certain which handle belongs to which bowl. In theory, if each component bowl and each handle were from a different utensil, there could have been as many as 9 <b>ladles</b> originally. In practice, it seems more likely that the handles and bowls present all belong together, and the group has therefore been reconstructed as five <b>ladles,</b> combining the existing handles and bowls.|$|R

5|$|At 7:45am local time, the <b>ladle</b> in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation to pour out its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the <b>ladle.</b> The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E

In 1943, the silver service was transferred to the Illinois Executive Mansion.|$|E

He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a <b>ladle</b> made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item.

The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial <b>ladle</b> and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where the bride and groom go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the <b>ladle.</b> The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the <b>ladle</b> fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a <b>ladle.</b> The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (<b>ladle</b> or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E

25|$|An {{inclusion}} is a metal {{contamination of}} dross, if solid, or slag, if liquid.

The priest will use a special <b>ladle</b> to proffer the holy ash to the layperson, who in turn daubs it on his or her forehead and eyelids, and may take some home for use after a Kushti ceremony.|$|E

This small enamelled bronze Roman trulla (<b>ladle),</b> dating to the 2nd century AD, is inscribed with a series of names of Roman forts along the western sector of the wall, together with a personal name and phrase: MAIS COGGABATA VXELODVNVM CAMBOGLANNA RIGORE VALI AELI DRACONIS.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{military}} contract {{related to}} World War II {{was with the}} navy for spoons and <b>ladles</b> announced in August, 1940.

[...] With war imminent, Vollrath gradually converted to war production in late 1941, increasing the government supplies until August 1, 1942. At that time, Vollrath was working 100% on defense work, which continued throughout the war. By September 1943, Vollrath’s price list of porcelain enamelware permitted for civilian use was strictly limited to a few dozen necessary items such as coffee pots, boilers, and percolators, vegetable insets, bain maries, double boilers, dish pans, <b>ladles,</b> pails, hotel pans, sauce pans, and stock pots for kitchen use.|$|R
