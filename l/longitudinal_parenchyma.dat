5000|$|Most {{species of}} Caesalpinia [...] s.l. have poorly defined growth rings, with {{isolated}} vessels arranged in radial multiples. Pitting between vessels is alternate and covered, and fibres {{are generally not}} divided by a septum. The axial (i.e., <b>longitudinal)</b> <b>parenchyma</b> varies from a winged shape to confluent, and is irregularly storied (i.e., layered), while the rays (perpendicular to growth rings) are of variable height and generally comprise a single or double cell width. Libidibia in particular has layered <b>longitudinal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> and narrow homocellular (i.e., of uniform type) rays without crystals in the ray cells.|$|E

This work proposes elastic values {{measured in the}} cross section of wood for different anatomical elements of oak. The experimental device, conceived and developed in our laboratory, allows the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio to be determined on very small samples. In this work, four components of the anatomical pattern have been differentiated. The corresponding micro samples have been prepared by careful polishing, which is difficult at best. Finally, {{we are able to}} propose values for ray cells, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, initial ring porous zone and fibres. The ray cells depict the highest rigidity in the transverse plane. On the contrary, the ring porous zone is the weakest, with a value almost ten times less important. Fibres and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells exhibit average values. The later only seem to present a high anisotropy ratio (E-R/E-T approximate to 2). ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.) ...|$|E
40|$|The term "bark" {{is applied}} in common parlance to denote the {{material}} that surrounds the woody substance (xylem) in a mature tree. It is thus situated outside the cambium which is the living tissue of a growing tree. The anatomical structure of bark is rather complex but in general {{it can be said}} that the bark tissue is composed of different kinds of cella, such as sieve, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> ray parenchyma, fiber cella, etc., some of which are also typical of the wood tissue. The physiological function of these tissue elememts in the bark is mainly concerned with the translocation and storage of solutes. As the tree matures, the outermost layers of the bark are broken and die by exposure and especially by the stoppage of food and water supplies. This layer is commonly referred to as the outer bark as opposed to the active tissue beneath it which is termed, inner bark or phloem. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Decayed-wood {{samples were}} {{collected}} from a naturally-infected bridge made of Quercus robur. Fruiting bodies of the white-rot basidiomycetes Hymenochaete rubiginosa and Stereum hirsutum were sampled. The white-rot fungus Fuscoporia ferrea and the secondary saprobiont Mycena galericulata were identified from the rotten wood by means of rDNA-ITS sequencing. The topochemistry of lignin degradation within individual cell-wall layers was determined by cellular UV-microspectrophotometry (UMSP) at 278 nm wavelength. Increased delignification occurred in compound middle lamella regions (CML), secondary wall layers of fibres (S 2), <b>longitudinal</b> and ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells as well in vessels. The highest lignin content at initial and medium decay was recorded in the CML, whereas in advanced decay secondary wall layers of the vessels exhibited the highest content of residual lignin. In all stages of degradation, the S 2 layers of fibres had the lowest lignin amount...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is the understanding of how microtubers are formed out of auxiliary buds in induced conditions. In the induced buds, meristematical cells with high cytoplasmic and nuclear stain ability expand deeper into the inner sections of the buds, comparing with non-induced buds, which the area is restricted to the apical regions. The first sign of microtuberization is the increase in size of cortical parenchyma cells in lower section and also increase in mitosis divisions in inner sections of the meristems. Most of the growth rates occur in the induced medium along the length and {{the width of the}} cells. It is also considered that the diametric growth of the tubers and the base of the leaves on the tubers begin their radial growth. The cortical parenchyma cells begin forming amidon grains during their vacuolar extension at extending the internodes much earlier than pith parenchyma cells. The extension of cells in sub-apical region {{plays an important role in}} the longitudinal growth of tubers. In the first stages, the growth of tubers results from the change in the dimensions of cortical and pith parenchyma cells, due to the reproduction of apical meristem and later, mainly from the growth of the productive tissue in the pith <b>parenchyma.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> growth is initially grater than the growth in diameter; however with shift in the position of vacuoles and their arrangement across rather than along the tubers, the growth pattern begins to change and lateral growth catches on and exceeds longitudinal growth. In fully grown tubers, pith parenchyma cells are larger than the cells in cortical parenchyma...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Because Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii(Mirb.) Franco] bark is a raw {{material}} produced in our renewable forests along with wood, {{an understanding of}} the ultrastructure of bark cells is of paramount importance if wood technologists are to utilize the bark to the fullest potential. The objectives of this study were to develop microscopic techniques in order to 1) describe and illustrate ultrastructurally the anatomy of parenchyma cells present in phloem and changes that occur to them in rhytidome formation, 2) describe and illustrate pitting between sclereids and adjacent cells. To accomplish these objectives required the development of procedures. Standard techniques were used, modified and integrated with newly developed techniques. Micromanipulation of cells and tissues was required. Stereo, light, phase contrast, fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy were employed. The developed procedures resulted in successful bark preparations for ultrastructural examination. The results of this study showed that the longitudinal phloem parenchyma are connected by thin pit areas similar to primary pit fields and not by well defined simple pits as found between parenchyma cells in the xylem. The cell wall of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> is a layered structure with orientated microfibrils. Expansion of the phloem parenchyma with rhytidome formation involves a stretching out of wrinkled and folded cell walls to fully expanded and smooth cell walls. Pitting between a sclereid and a parenchyma cell consists of a long pit canal through the sclereid wall about one micrometer wide with little or no flaring out at the outer surface to form a pit chamber. The pit membrane is the original double cell wall of the parenchyma. Pitting between two sclereids exhibited similar long pit canals extending across the sclereids into a chamber area separated again by a thick pit membrane consisting of the original double cell wall of the parenchyma. Additional layers of secondary wall apparently are deposited by apposition on the original parenchyma cell wall in the pitted region during sclereid formation...|$|E
