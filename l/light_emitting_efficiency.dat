40|$|Abstract — Recently {{different}} and contradicting results regarding {{the influence of}} dislocation loops on <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Si-based LEDs at room temperature were published [1 - 4]. We report our results on light emission of devices called DILED and DiFLED which are with and without dislocation loops, respectively. The p-n junction in the DiFLED device was realized by dopant diffusion while using ion implantation with various ion energies for DILED. Electroluminescence (EL) {{has been used to}} investigate room-temperature light-emission and the contribution of dislocation loops by comparison of the characteristics between the DiFLED and DILED devices. In this paper, the device fabrication, working principle and properties will be discussed. The electrical and optical characteristics of the different devices were measured and discussed.

40|$|In this work, {{a number}} of {{electrical}} and optical properties of MBE-grown ZnS 1 -xTex thin films we re studied. In carrying out photo conductance measurements, a ZnS. 92 Te 08 - based metal-semiconductor-metal devices were {{used to test the}} photo response of this alloy. It was found that the photocurrent obtained in this structure was dominant by the band-edge absorption of ZnS. 92 Te. 08 alloy. A method using ITO (indium tin oxide) as intermediate medium was introduced to bond gold wire to ZnSl-xTex. The results suggest that ZnS 1 -xTex alloy is potentially capable as tunable UV detector material. The effects of the insulating layer between the Au contact and the ZnS 1 -xTex surface on the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the ZnS 1 -xTex - based MIS EL cells were examined. Under forward bias, most of the applied voltage was dropped across the insulating layer (I-layer) rather than the depletion region. This voltage drop across the I-layer raised the semiconductor valence band edge. Correspondingly, the hole injection efficiency increased when the top of the valence band approached the metal Fermi level. Under reverse bias, electrons were accelerated in the I-layer. Since the I-layer is thin enough, most the accelerated electrons can pass through the I-layer with high kinetic energy. Their impact-ionizing power was much enhanced after leaving the I-layer and it leads to a significant improvement in the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> compared to structure without the presence of an I-layer. We for the first time found the trace of the existence of DX centers in Al-doped ZnS 1 -xTex. Using DLTFS technique, we found that there were two Al-related deep energy levels El and E 2 in Al-doped ZnS and Al-doped ZnS. 983 Te. 017. A third deep energy level E 3 was also found in Al-doped ZnS. 983 Te. 017 which possibly is a deep level related to the presence of Te in this alloy system. The ratios between the El and E 2 concentration and the donor concentration in Al-doped ZnS. 983 Te. 0 l 7 are found to be much greater than those in Al-doped ZnS...|$|E

In wide band gap II-VI compounds, recombination of excitons bound to IEC can even emit blue light, in which case IEC has a high potential in optoelectronic device application. Tellurium in ZnS {{is one of the}} well-studied IEC systems, where emission features have been assigned to the recombination of excitons localized at single, paired and cluster-like Te centers. Recently, the existence of bound state in ZnTe:S was also predicted but no experimental results are available for comparison. In this MPhil project, sulfur in ZnTe epitaxial layer grown on GaAs is studied with photoluminescence (PL) at various temperatures, excitation powers and under hydrostatic pressures, as well as time-resolved PL. A sulfur-related emission peak, labeled as P 2, behaves as a deep level in hydrostatic pressure PL measurement, indicating that sulfur atoms form isoelectronic centers in ZnTe. The results agree with the theoretical prediction. Another emission band, labeled as P 3, which shows a donor-acceptor pair characteristics possibly involves isoelectronic sulfur acting as a donor.

40|$|Direct band {{electroluminescence}} (EL) from tensile-strained Si 0. 13 Ge 0. 87 /Ge multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on a Ge virtual substrate (VS) at {{room temperature}} is reported herein. Due to the competitive result of quantum confinement Stark effect and bandgap narrowing induced by tensile strain in Ge wells, electroluminescence from Γ 1 -HH 1 transition in 12 -nm Ge wells was observed at around 1550 nm. As injection current density increases, additional emission shoulders from Γ 2 -HH 2 transition in Ge wells and Ge VS appeared at around 1300 – 1400 nm and 1600 – 1700 nm, respectively. The peak energy of EL shifted to the lower energy side superquadratically with an increase of injection current density {{as a result of}} the Joule heating effect. During the elevation of environmental temperature, EL intensity increased due to a reduction of energy between L and Γ valleys of Ge. Empirical fitting of the relationship between the integrated intensity of EL (L) and injection current density (J) with L~Jm shows that the m factor increased with injection current density, suggesting higher <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the diode at larger injection current densities, which can be attributed to larger carrier occupations in the Γ valley and the heavy hole (HH) valance band at higher temperatures...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{identification}} {{and control of}} important nonradiative recombination centers in GaNP coaxial nanowires (NWs) grown on Si substrates {{in an effort to}} significantly increase <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of these novel nanostructures promising {{for a wide variety of}} optoelectronic and photonic applications. A point defect complex, labeled as DD 1 and consisting of a P atom with a neighboring partner aligned along a crystallographic ⟨ 111 ⟩ axis, is identified by optically detected magnetic resonance as a dominant nonradiative recombination center that resides mainly on the surface of the NWs and partly at the heterointerfaces. The formation of DD 1 is found to be promoted by the presence of nitrogen and can be suppressed by reducing the strain between the core and shell layers, as well as by protecting the optically active shell by an outer passivating shell. Growth modes employed during the NW growth are shown to play a role. On the basis of these results, we identify the GaP/GaNyP 1 –y/GaNxP 1 –x (x < y) core/shell/shell NW structure, where the GaNyP 1 –y inner shell with the highest nitrogen content serves as an active light-emitting layer, as the optimized and promising design for efficient light emitters based on GaNP NWs.

40|$|This paper reports {{quantitative}} {{correlation of}} CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 (MAPbBr(3)) thin film morphology to <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode <b>efficiency</b> parameters. Sequential (spin coating) deposition {{is used for}} highly reproducible and dense film morphology of MAPbBr(3) thin-film. In this fabrication process using an orthogonal solvent approach, control of morphology, coverage, thickness, and optical properties in these compact thin-films is demonstrated. Optical studies show direct correlation between morphology to dynamics of photoluminescence (PL) and absolute PL yield.

This study demonstrates PeLEDs with high brightness, approximate to 1050 cd m(- 2) at 4. 7 V (luminance efficiency approximate to 0. 1 cd A(- 1)), for optimal thin-film process with state-of-the-art device performance. This quantitative analysis suggests that these state-of-the-art PeLEDs suffer from poor charge carrier balance (approximate to 2 %) and out-coupling efficiency (approximate to 6 %). Interestingly, charge carrier balance and PL yield together can explain the change in PeLED efficiency modulation with film morphology. Studies on single carrier devices show that these PeLEDs are electron current dominated and charge carrier balance increases with operating bias voltage...|$|R

40|$|Spectrally and {{spatially}} resolved electroluminescence {{emission of}} crystalline silicon solar cells is interpreted {{in terms of}} two electro-optical reciprocity relations. The first relation links the photovoltaic quantum efficiency to the electroluminescence spectrum. Both methods contain information on recombination and the optical pathlength of the incident light, simultaneously. From the electroluminescence spectrum, we derive the pathlength enhancement factor of textured and untextured crystalline silicon solar cells. Further, we use local quantum efficiency measurements to quantitatively explain light induced current as well as panchromatic electroluminescence images. A second reciprocity relation connects open circuit voltage of a solar cell with the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode quantum <b>efficiency</b> of the same device.

40|$|Silicon is {{the most}} {{important}} semiconductor material used in microelectronic devices. As the number of transistors keep doubling every 24 months (Moore’s law), transistors continue scaling down in size, electrical interconnect is reaching its limits {{to keep up with the}} scaling down rate in integrated circuits. These limitations are related to interconnect density and power consumption. Hence, replacing electrical interconnect with optical interconnect on the chip or between chips has the ability to overcome these limitations. However, silicon has poor <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and other substitutes such as III-V materials are not suitable due to high cost, lattice mismatch, and thermal mismatch with Si. Recently researchers have been developing novel group IV alloys from silicon, germanium, and tin to overcome these problems. In this research a less developed group IV alloy, GePb, as well as GeSn, have been studied for the development of optoelectronic devices. A physical vapor deposition method is used to evaporate the solid sources in a thermal evaporator chamber to deposit the films on a Si substrate. The GeSn and GePb samples were deposited at room temperature then annealed in a Fisher Scientific furnace at different temperatures (300 - 600 °C) and times (15 - 60 min).

40|$|Molecular {{spintronics}} {{has successfully}} crossed its {{first decade of}} life becoming an important player in the race towards the fabrication of next generation spintronic devices. The development and fabrication of spin OLEDs {{represents one of the}} key challenges in this area. Indeed, combining spin polarised injection with light emission is expected to establish a quantum control over the statistics of singlet and triplet excitons in the emitting material, enabling a magneto electro optical multifunctionality. This may represent a new route for the increase of <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> and, on the other hand, may embody a powerful tool for the investigation of spintronics effects in organic materials. In spite of numerous steps made in this direction, a convincing demonstration of this magnetic quantum control of the light emission has not been accomplished so far. Here, by tailoring the energy level alignment between the frontier orbitals of the organic semiconductor and the electrode work functions, we have prepared a robust spin OLED that shows an increase in the magneto electroluminescence for the antiparallel configuration of the magnetic electrodes, increasing the weight of singlet branch. This result is specially suggestive since for this configuration the total current flowing through the OLED is reduced with respect to that for the parallel configuration due to magnetoresistance effects. Our findings demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} inject spin polarised carriers in the frontier electronic orbitals of an organic semiconductor, a question that was still open and debated, beginning the way for a new spintronic control of the OLED emitting efficiency with promising implications in organic optoelectronics and information processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the Project is to {{investigate}} doping mechanisms in p-type GaN and AlGaN and controllably fabricate ultra high doped p-GaN materials and epitaxial structures. Highly doped p-type GaN-based materials with low electrical resistivity and abrupt doping profiles are of great importance for efficient light emitters for solid state lighting (SSL) applications. Cost-effective hydride vapor phase epitaxial (HVPE) technology was proposed to investigate and develop p-GaN materials for SSL. High p-type doping is required to improve (i) carrier injection efficiency in light emitting p-n junctions {{that will result in}} increasing of <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency,</b> (ii) current spreading in light emitting structures that will improve external quantum efficiency, and (iii) parameters of Ohmic contacts to reduce operating voltage and tolerate higher forward currents needed for the high output power operation of light emitters.

Overall, highly doped p-GaN is a key element to develop light emitting devices for the DOE SSL program. The project was focused on material research for highly doped p-type GaN materials and device structures for applications in high performance light emitters for general illumination P-GaN and p-AlGaN layers and multi-layer structures were grown by HVPE and investigated in terms of surface morphology and structure, doping concentrations and profiles, optical, electrical, and structural properties.

40|$|In this work, {{processing}} {{procedures to}} fabricate InGaN/GaN MQW blue LEDs were developed and optimized. A blue LED, with an emission wavelength of 457. 6 nm and a CW output power of about 4 mW at 50 mA driving current in chip form, was fabricated. At the typical test current of 20 mA, the output power was 1. 7 mW under 3. 5 V forward bias before packaging. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics were measured and studied. Temperature dependent I-V measurement {{results indicated that}} the defects assistant tunneling current dominated at low forward bias, caused by the high density defects inside the p-n junction region of InGaN/GaN based LEDs. Although injection current will dominate at larger forward bias when energy band across the p-n junction is pulled flat, these defects may affect the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the LED. The doping concentration profile near the p-n junction interface was deduced from the C-V measurement. High doping concentration about 2 x l 018 cm - 3 was observed in the n+-GaN region near the interface. Using fine voltage scanning step, the MQW structure was clearly observed. I-V and C-V measurements provide valuable information and feedback for sample growth and fabrication. The spatial inhomogeneity images of electroluminescence of LEDs were taken using an optical microscopy. It was observed that light emitted only at some sporadic spots on the device surface at very low injection current. When the driving current was gradually increased, more spots and areas began to light up. However, some dark areas remained dark even at very high current injection. A large amount of fine structures with size smaller than 100 nm were directly observed under a 1000 x magnification microscope. The spatial inhomogeneity of light emitting was attributed to quantum dot like structures, with different sizes and different In compositions, inside the MQW structure. With increasing of the injection current, injected carriers gradually fill the quantum dots in the sequence of narrow to wide bandgap. The density of the fine QD like regions was very high. The light emission was contributed mainly by these fine QD like structures, which prevent the carriers from reaching the nonradiative defects outside the QDs. We believe this is the leading reason why GaN based materials can be used to fabricate high brightness LEDs in spite of their high dislocation density. Electroluminescence and photocurrent spectra were also measured and studied to investigate the light emitting mechanism. The peak position of electroluminescence spectra had a large red shift compared to the absorption edge obtained by photocurrent spectra for all samples. Such large Stokes' like shifts are typical for InGaN/GaN MQW structures as reported in literature suggesting the existence of QDs structures with minimum energy band...|$|E
40|$|One {{third of}} world’s total energy {{is used in}} {{production}} of electricity and one fifth of the total electricity produced {{in the world is}} used in lighting. Hence, the materials that have high potential in the field of photovoltaic’s and photoluminescence have recently drawn special attention to meet the ever increasing energy demands. In this thesis, we have studied a few materials that hold tremendous promises in fabricating photovoltaics and photoluminescent devices. Any ferroelectric material is an efficient solar energy converter as it contains an the intrinsic dipolar field which can effectively separate the photo excited electron and hole. We have developed a few materials which possess inherent polarization efficiently absorb over a wide portion of the solar spectrum and hence can find application in the field of photovoltaics. Secondly, we also dealt with semiconductor nonmaterial’s which are technologically very important owing to their improved photoluminescence properties. We tried to improve their <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>efficiency</b> by engineering crystal structure in nanometer length scales. The thesis deals with such advanced energy materials and is divided in seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the fundamental concepts that are relevant in the subsequent chapters. The chapter is started with a brief scenario of current status of energy production and its usage. Next, we have discussed the prospects of ferroelectric materials in photovoltaic devices. This is followed by a brief background on ferroelectricity and related properties which we have studied subsequently. At the end of this chapter a brief overview of photoluminescence properties in semiconductor nonmaterial’s is presented. In this section we have addressed the particular issues that need {{to be taken care of}} in order to improve their light emission properties. Chapter 2 describes different experimental and theoretical methods that have been employed to carry out different studies presented in the thesis. Chapter 3 addresses the possibility of employing BaTiO 3 (BTO) based composite perovskite oxides as a potent photovoltaic material. It is known that BTO can produce photocurrent upon excitation with suitable light source. However, inability of BTO to absorb sufficient sunlight owing to its near UV band gap prevents to make use of this material in photovoltaic devices. In order to reduce the band gap we have tried to tune the electronic structure at the band edge by doping non-d 0 transition metal ions at Ti site. As it is known in the literature an isovalent substitution of Ti 4 + stabilizes non-polar phase of BTO we employed a co-doping strategy to substitute tetravalent Ti with equal percentage of a trivalent and a pentavalent metal ion. Keeping in mind off-centering of Ti 4 + is primary reason behind the large ferroelectric polarization of BTO, a judicious choice of co-dopant was necessary to minimize reduction of polarization due to replacement of Ti. We have found at least two pairs of co-dopants, namely Mn 3 +-Nb 5 + and Fe 3 +-Nb 5 + which at low doping concentration (< 10 %) effectively reduces the band gap of BTO without affecting its polarization to a large extent. We systematically increase the doping concentration of both the pair of dopants and found Mn 3 +-Nb 5 + pair is more efficient over Fe 3 +-Nb 5 + both in terms of reducing band gap and retaining the polarization of BTO. We have characterized the ferroelectric nature of all the doped compositions with the help of dielectric, polarization and pyroelectric measurements. We have also performed first principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations for an equivalent doped composition and addressed the nature of modulations of electronic structure at the band edges which is responsible for such large reduction of band gap. Chapter 4 deals with composite perovskite materials which posses large tetragonal distortions with reduced optical band gaps. Here we have exploited Cu-Nb and Cu-Ta pair which upon complete substitution of Ti of BTO leads to composite perovskites with enhanced tetragonal distortion of the perovskite lattice. For two resultant compositions, namely BaCu 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3 O 3 and BaCu 1 / 3 Ta 2 / 3 O 3 we have characterized the optical and ferroelectric properties. We found though these material possess small band gap (∼ 2 eV), these are not ferroelectric in nature. Results of second harmonic generation measurements and refinement of powder X-ray diffraction both establish Centro symmetric nature of these materials. We infer from these results that presence of large tetragonal distortion is a result of symmetric Jahn-Teller type distortion of Cu 2 + and not due to off-centering of any of the metal ions in their MO 6 octahedral geometries. In Chapter 5, we have considered the material SrTiO 3 (STO) which is stable in cubic paraelectric phase at room temperature. But at the same time this material is considered as an incipient ferroelectric due to presence of an active polar vibrational mode which does not become completely soft even at temperature close to 0 K. While this polar vibrational mode can easily be frozen by making substitution at Sr site, a similar attempt by making substitution at Ti site failed earlier. Keeping in mind Ti is easier to substitute than Sr we employed same co-doping strategy that we have considered in Chapter 3. We found Mn- Nb and Mn-Ta co-dopants at low doping concentration are extremely useful in transforming incipient ferroelectric STO into a dipolar glass. We have characterized the glassy dipolar property of doped STO with the help of tem-perature dependent dielectric response of these material. At the same time we found these co-doped STO possess enhanced static dielectric constant at room temperature with favourable dielectric loss values in comparison to pure STO. We have also ad-dressed the origin of a glassy dipolar state with the help of DFT calculation performed on equivalent doped composition that we have considered for our experiments. In Chapter 6, we have considered another incipient ferroelectric material TiO 2 in rutile phase which also possess polar vibrational mode at temperature close to 0 K. A lattice strain along the polar vibrational mode make symmetric non-polar structure unstable with respect to the distorted polar structure. In this context, we found two particular compositions FeTiTaO 6 and CrTiTaO 6 that are also stable in rutile phases at room temperature but possess similar strain due to presence of larger Fe or Cr and Ta in rutile lattice. Considering the fact these two composite rutile oxides are relaxer ferroelectric in nature, we critically evaluated the effect of the particular kind of strain that these materials introduce in rutile lattice. We also characterized relaxor ferroelectric property and optical band gap of these materials and commented on the potential of these materials in exploiting them in photovoltaic devices. Chapter 7 presents a unique strategy of making use of crystal defects in improving photoluminescent properties of semiconductor nanocrystals. We have shown defects when introduced in nanocrystals in a controlled protected manner efficiently overcome the problem of self absorption which is known to reduce quantum efficiency of emit-ted light. Controlling synthesis conditions we separately prepared CdS nanocrystals with and without intergrowth defects. We characterized the presence of the intergrowth defect with the help of high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image. We have also characterized Stokes’ shifted PL emission and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics of these NCs with intergrowth defects. To support these experimental findings we have computed the electronic structures of model nanoclusters possessing similar intergrowth defects that has been observed in HRTEM images. We find that the presence of defects in a nanocluster particularly affect the position of the band edge. However our joint density of state calculation shows that contribution of these defect states to an absorption spectra is negligible. Thus presence of defect states at band edge ensures a Stokes’ shifted emission without affecting the position of absorption. In a separate section of this chapter we have shown apart from intergrowth defects presence of twin boundary also provide similar mid-gap states that can alter its’ optical proper-ties to large extent. In summary, we have studied a few bulk and nano-materials which can show improved photovoltaic and photoluminescence property. We investigated effect of external dopant ions on a classical ferroelectric material BaTiO 3 and two incipient ferroelectric materials SrTiO 3 and rutile TiO 2. We have also shown that efficient defect engineering could be extremely useful in improving photoluminescent property of CdS nanocrystals which is a prototype of II-VI semiconductor nanomaterials. In a separate Appendix Chapter, we have shown an easy and efficient way to suppress coffee ring effect which takes place universally when a drop of colloidal suspension is dried on a solid substrate. We have shown temporary modification of hydropho-bicity of a glass substrate not only can suppress the coffee ring effect but also leaves the particle in a highly ordered self-assembled phase after completion of drying proces...|$|E

The thermal-effect and thermal-stress of <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode are determined numerically. <b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode {{is attached to the}} silicon substrate through the wire bonding process by using epoxy as die bond material.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{electroluminescence}} (EL) of polycrystalline ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga) Se- 2 heterojunction solar cells with similar band gaps but different open circuit voltages, indicating {{a difference in}} the electronic quality of the absorber. Temperature dependent EL measurements reveal that all cells feature transitions from donor-acceptor pair recombination at lower temperature to band to band recombination at higher temperatures. However, the less efficient cells show a longer transition range with donor-acceptor pair recombination still apparent at room temperature. We find further that the part of the room temperature spectrum that is due to band to band transitions in the respective cells is relatively broader than expected from a direct semiconductor with a homogeneous band gap. We analyze this spectral broadening by a model that accounts for band gap fluctuations of the absorber material. The experimental results show that the dominant part of this spectral broadening results from the intentional band gap grading and not from stochastic band gap fluctuations. We show further that the spectral EL emission is linked to the photovoltaic external quantum efficiency by electro-optical reciprocity. In a similar way, the external EL quantum efficiency is related to the open circuit voltage of the device. We verify experimentally that the difference between radiative and measured open circuit voltage determines the EL external quantum efficiency of the solar cell. The best Cu(In,Ga) Se- 2 solar cell reaches an external <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode quantum <b>efficiency</b> of around 0. 1 %. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the micro-shear bond {{strength}} of composite resin cured with halogen visible light and blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode curing units. Flat enamel surfaces of 50 segments of teeth were prepared. 50 cylindrical composite resin specimens were bonded to the prepared teeth segments. Specimens were divided into 5 groups, three groups were cured for 10, 20 and 40 seconds using blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode and 2 groups were cured for 20 and 40 seconds using halogen light. Specimens were submitted to micro-shear bond test at 1 mm / min cross-head speed. Mean micro-shear bond strengths were analyzed by analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) and Tukey's test at P< 0. 05. At 40 seconds curing, the halogen light produced significantly higher bond strength than that of blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode. No significant difference was found between both lights at 20 seconds. There were no significant differences in bond strength ratios between 10 and 20 seconds blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode, and 20 seconds halogen light. At 40 seconds, the blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode produced significantly higher bond strength than that of blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode at 10 and 20 seconds, and halogen light at 20 seconds. It was concluded that despite the higher micro-shear bond strength of halogen light at 40 seconds, blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode curing unit provided sufficient output to exceed minimum requirements in terms of composites’ micro-shear bond strength according to ISO 11405, 1994.
