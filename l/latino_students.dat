40|$|Although colleges {{must have}} a full‐time <b>Latino</b> <b>student</b> {{enrollment}} of at least 25 percent to federally qualify as a Hispanic Serving Institution, colleges with a <b>Latino</b> <b>student</b> enrollment of 15 ‐ 24 percent are {{commonly referred to as}} “Emerging Hispanic Serving Institutions. ” As more community colleges approach such <b>Latino</b> <b>student</b> enrollment percentages, the changing demographic presents opportunities and challenges relative to diversity. It is important to equip community college administrators, all of whom are public administrators, to effectively manage their changing institutions and promote student success. Utilizing a qualitative approach, this article analyzes multiple perspectives on factors related to <b>Latino</b> <b>student</b> success.

25|$|In the US, Latino/as who {{identify}} as LGBTQ face scrutiny {{not just from}} their community at home but within their community at school as well, especially within a {{high school or college}} preparation experience. While facing scrutiny by family and community to maintain gender normality in order to prosper in the US, they also must face scrutiny from their fellow peers, mentors and administration in the educational environment. One such scrutiny that they face is a lack of acceptance and recognition as a separate educational entity within sexual educational programs, provided by many high school education districts. Lesson plans that are developed for the high school learning environment put emphasis on Heteronormativity of the and <b>Latino</b> <b>students.</b> Latinas are viewed as needing to have less interest in sexual education, while Latinos were told to maintain focus and to take the education seriously. When teachers are prompted to explain more about sexual education for lesbians or gays, the teachers or educators assume the student body to be heterosexual and refuse or regard the questions as immature and outside the scope of their teaching.|$|E

At Yale she fit in well although she found there were again few <b>Latino</b> <b>students.</b> She was known as a hard worker but she was not considered among the star students in her class.

40|$|<b>Latino</b> male <b>students</b> lag {{far behind}} their Latina and European American {{counterparts}} in academic achievement (Yosso & Solorzano, 2006; Moll & Ruiz, 2002). One potential {{explanation for this}} discrepancy is the pressure to resist school behaviors (Fordham & Ogbu, 1986) that <b>Latino</b> male <b>students</b> may encounter from their same-sex and same-ethnic peer group members. The current dissertation research explores how messages of school resistance from peers impact <b>Latino</b> <b>student</b> achievement and how self-monitoring strategies (i. e., regulating one's behaviors; Snyder, 1974) may provide a coping strategy for this school resistance. In Study 1, Latino and European American male and female undergraduate students (N= 95) completed peer school resistance items and reported GPAs. Analyses revealed that while male students reported higher perceptions of peer school resistance than female students, peer school resistance was only negatively correlated with achievement for <b>Latino</b> male <b>students,</b> and was unrelated to achievement for European American male students. In Study 2, Latino and European American male and female undergraduate students (N= 413) completed self-monitoring items and reported SAT math scores. Analyses revealed that self-monitoring strategies were positively correlated with achievement for <b>Latino</b> male <b>students,</b> but were unrelated to achievement for Latina and European American male and female students. While Studies 1 and 2 used correlational methods, in Study 3, <b>Latino</b> high school <b>students</b> (N= 174) who {{were randomly assigned to}} read messages of high or low peer school resistance completed self-monitoring items, thoughts about achievement items, and an achievement task (i. e., AIMS math items). Analyses revealed that high peer school resistance encouraged <b>Latino</b> male <b>students</b> to present more negative thoughts about achievement compared to low peer school resistance. Additionally, self-monitoring was positively related to achievement for <b>Latino</b> male <b>students.</b> Peer school resistance and self-monitoring had no effects on Latina students' thoughts or achievement. These findings demonstrate the negative impact of peer school resistance on <b>Latino</b> male <b>student</b> achievement, and the positive effects of self-monitoring on achievement for this cultural group. This research aims to offer new perspectives on the <b>Latino</b> male <b>student</b> achievement gap. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The term [...] "black flight" [...] {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} African-American parents in some cities moving their children from public schools to charter schools or suburban schools featuring open enrollment. This {{has taken place in}} a variety of places, including the Twin Cities and the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Other issues in the city proper of Dallas include an increase in immigration of Latinos. In the 1980s and 1990s, the school district had a majority of black students. Today it has a preponderance of <b>Latino</b> <b>students,</b> in a kind of ethnic succession that reflects residential changes in the city. Latinos constitute 68 percent of students, while blacks are 26 percent, and whites are 5 percent. In addition, 87 percent of the <b>Latino</b> <b>students</b> qualify as [...] "economically disadvantaged," [...] and many are just learning English. Middle-class blacks are moving to suburbs in a repetition of earlier migration of middle-class whites.

2500|$|The 1890s proved {{difficult}} in respects other than strictly financial. Because {{of the general}} recession, and due to some speculation that the University might have to resultingly close, enrollment dropped.

With the improved economy of the 1900s, the new century offered stronger horizons. The Physics building was quickly rebuilt. And with the sale of the Packer Estate's interest in the Lehigh Valley Railroad (June 1, 1900), the school ceased to be known as a [...] "railroad university". Fortuitously a new benefactor would take its stead: Bethlehem Steel. The first intercollegiate Greek-lettered organization for <b>Latino</b> <b>students</b> was founded at Lehigh as this time.

2500|$|CUNY's open admissions Program {{came into}} effect {{in the fall of}} 1970. The program had been slated to begin in 1975, but was sparked into early {{enforcement}} after a group of students at City College demonstrated against the overwhelming whiteness of CUNY's student body, demanding greater access for black and <b>Latino</b> <b>students.</b> Adopting the Open Admissions policy meant that the University would now provide a place for any high school graduate who desired to attend. Across CUNY, student enrollment ballooned. At John Jay, undergraduates numbered 2,600 in 1969; 4,400 in 1970; 6,700 in 1972; and 8,600 in 1973. The size of the faculty grew by over 200% between 1970–1972. Moreover, the policy brought many more [...] "civilian" [...] (non-law enforcement) students to the College. The school's massive and sudden growth had a profound effect. More of the college's budget went toward remedial programs to help transition underprepared freshmen. In addition, the college broadened its curriculum, expanding into liberal arts. Majors including English, Math, American Studies, and Chemistry were introduced during this period in the early 1970s. The SEEK program developed during this time as well, supporting students from underprivileged backgrounds who showed academic promise.|$|E
