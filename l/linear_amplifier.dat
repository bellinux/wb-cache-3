25|$|A <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{responds}} to different frequency components independently, {{and does not}} generate harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion. No amplifier can provide perfect linearity (even the most <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier</b> has some nonlinearities, since the amplifying devices—transistors or vacuum tubes—follow nonlinear power laws such as square-laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects).|$|E

50|$|Extensive {{systems can}} include {{multiple}} unit installations with <b>linear</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and splitters {{to increase the}} coupling points to a large electrical grid (whether a campus, a high-rise apartment or a community). These systems would typically require coaxial cable interconnection from a transmitter to the <b>linear</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> In the 1990s, LPB, Inc., possibly the largest manufacturer of these transmission systems, designed and supplied several extensive campus-based systems that included fiber-optic links between <b>linear</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to prevent heterodyne interference.|$|R

25|$|An FM signal {{can also}} be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with {{multiplexing}} and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes. A high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier.</b> This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.|$|E
25|$|For its {{transmission}} speed, RTTY has low spectral efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170Hz {{shift at}} 45.45 baud requires around 250Hz receiver bandwidth, {{more than double}} that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter {{does not need to}} use a <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year two more units were added: the SB-110 transceiver for the 6 meter band and the HA-14 “Kompact Kilowatt”, a smaller kilowatt <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{based on the}} SB-200. The HA-14 also used grounded grid 572B's but with external AC and DC power supplies. At 7 lbs the amplifier itself was very small, matching the HW mono-banders in style, and usable in both mobile and desktop service. Like the SB-200 from which it derived, its input was designed to match the 100-watt output of the Heathkit SB and HW series plus as Collins and others.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s the FCC {{banned the}} sale of <b>linear</b> <b>amplifiers</b> capable of {{operation}} from 24 to 35 MHz to discourage their use on the CB band, although the use of high‑power amplifiers continued. Late in 2006, the FCC amended the regulation to exclude only 26 to 28 MHz to facilitate amateur 10-meter operation. Lax enforcement enables manufacturers of illegal <b>linear</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to openly advertise their products; many CB dealers include these amplifiers in their catalogs.

25|$|Pegram's {{research}} focus {{remained on}} radioactivity. In 1929, he had recruited a graduate student, John R. Dunning, from Nebraska Wesleyan University, who built a <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In 1935 and 1936 Dunning was able construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts {{to reduce costs}} and funding from industrial and private donations. James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932 sparked a flurry of research into neutrons by Pegram and Dunning. Between 1933 and 1936, they would work together on two dozen papers, all on neutrons. He also collaborated with Harold Urey on separating oxygen isotopes. This period {{came to an abrupt}} end when Howard Lee McBain died suddenly on May 7, 1936, and Pegram became dean again on January 1, 1937.|$|E
25|$|John R. Dunning, {{professor}} of physics at Columbia, closely followed the work of Ernest Lawrence on the cyclotron. Dunning wanted a more powerful neutron source and the cyclotron appeared as an attractive tool to achieve this end. During 1935 and 1936, he was able to construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. The cyclotron design and building project began as Anderson was completing his engineering degree. At the suggestion of Professor Dana Mitchell, Dunning offered Anderson a teaching assistant position if he would also help with the design and building of the cyclotron. While working on his doctorate, Anderson made two major contributions to the project. The first was to design a high frequency filament supply, rather than the commonly used direct current version. This fostered longer filament life in the high magnetic field environment of a cyclotron. The second and more important contribution was the use of a pair of concentric lines to feed the cyclotron dees (cyclotron electrodes {{in the shape of a}} “D”), rather than the usual induction system. This refinement resulted in greater cyclotron efficiency and thereafter became a regular feature in cyclotron design. Others assisting Anderson in the construction of the cyclotron were Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, Hugh Glassford, and, of course, professor Dunning. In anticipation of conducting experiments with the cyclotron, Anderson also built an ionization chamber and a <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier</b> in late 1938.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} of <b>linear</b> <b>amplifiers</b> for current sources with very low, or voltage sources with very high {{impedance}} is discussed. In designing negative-feedback amplifiers for these sources, the loopgain is often low {{as a result of}} the source impedance, thus making it di#cult to obtain a su#ciently high bandwidth.

2500|$|However it is {{possible}} to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a <b>linear</b> <b>amplifier.</b> What's more, a standard AM receiver using an envelope detector is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally not referred to as [...] "AM" [...] even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%.
