500|$|Player Piano {{draws upon}} Vonnegut's {{experience}} as an employee at GE. He satirizes the drive to climb the corporate ladder, one that in Player Piano is rapidly disappearing as automation increases, putting even executives out of work. His central character, Paul Proteus, has an ambitious wife, a backstabbing assistant, {{and a feeling of}} empathy for the poor. Sent by his boss, Kroner, as a double agent among the poor (who have all the material goods they want, but <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose), he leads them in a machine-smashing, museum-burning revolution. Player Piano expresses Vonnegut's opposition to McCarthyism, something made clear when the Ghost Shirts, the revolutionary organization Paul penetrates and eventually leads, is referred to by one character as [...] "fellow travelers".|$|E
500|$|Combating the Titans is the military, {{which is}} divided into three branches. Foremost in the story is the , which goes out into Titan {{territory}} to try to reclaim the land. The Survey Corps are heavily derided in society because of their apparently senseless high casualty rate and <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> progress. The second and largest branch is the , which guards the walls and the civilian populace. The third branch is the , who guards the royal family and live relatively relaxed lives, although this eventually results in fraud, corruption, and political subterfuge. The soldiers use a tethering system called [...] acting as a grappling system, allowing them to jump onto (and swing from) walls, trees, or nearby buildings to attack Titans with dual swords. However, despite it being the soldiers' primary line of both offense and defense against the Titans, it is useless in open and flat terrain like fields.|$|E

500|$|Smith's teachings were {{rooted in}} dispensational restorationism. He taught that the Church of Christ {{restored}} through {{him was a}} latter-day restoration of the early Christian faith, which had {{been lost in the}} Great Apostasy. At first, Smith's church had <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hierarchy; his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations. Though Smith did not claim exclusive prophethood, an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments [...] "as Moses". This religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters. For instance, in the early 1830s, he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism, called the United Order, that required Latter Day Saints to give all their property to the church, which was divided among the faithful. He also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the Millennium.|$|E
500|$|In {{early years}} of the 20th century, Delius {{composed}} some of his most popular works, including Brigg Fair (1907), In a Summer Garden (1908, revised 1911), Summer Night on the River (1911), and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring (1912), of which McVeagh comments, [...] "These exquisite idylls, for all their composer's German descent and French domicile, spell 'England' for most listeners." [...] In 1910, Beecham put on an opera season at the Royal Opera House in London. Having access to the Beecham family's considerable fortune, he ignored commercial considerations and programmed several works of limited box-office appeal, including A Village Romeo and Juliet. The reviews were polite, but The Times, having praised the orchestral aspects of the score, commented, [...] "Mr. Delius seems to have remarkably <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dramatic writing for the voice". Other reviewers agreed that the score contained passages of great beauty, but was ineffective as drama.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} {{intended}} to reference Top 40 radio stations, and the tracks reflect a straightforward country-rock sound. The band members felt {{that they needed to}} establish themselves outside of the Tupelo fanbase. However, Tweedy later stated that in actuality, they were [...] "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience." [...] Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup, but decided that he didn't want any material on that subject matter to appear on the album. (It can be argued, however, that first single [...] "Box Full of Letters", as well as [...] "Too Far Apart" [...] allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy's friendship and working relationship.) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in [...] that [...] "Tweedy's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements; there's <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> drama, and virtually no hint of risk. Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time. Shortly after the album, Tweedy stopped smoking pot, to which he credits the introspectiveness of further albums.|$|E

However, Hampshire had a few reservations about DL2, notably that: [...] "the players have {{to go along with}} the plot to make any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> it at all." [...] He felt that, given the lack of real freedom for players, keeping up interest might be a problem. He also thought DL2 to be fairly short and that it would make <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> outside <b>of</b> the DL series. However, he concluded his review by noting that: [...] "as one of the series ... it has 'Dallas' appeal." ...|$|R
500|$|For {{the second}} season, 83% of 22 critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were positive, {{with an average}} score of 8.09/10. The site's {{consensus}} states, [...] "The second season of The Walking Dead fleshes out the characters while maintaining the grueling tension and gore that made the show a hit." [...] Of 22 Metacritic critic reviews, 18 were positive, four were mixed, and none were negative; their average score was 80/100. Early criticism of the show focused on {{the slow pace of}} the second season, particularly the first half. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, described the series as [...] "a nighttime soap", comparing it to [...] "a parody of a Samuel Beckett play" [...] that had very <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> direction and few appearances of walkers. Nate Rawlings of Times online entertainment section noted that [...] "the pace {{during the first half of}} this season has been brutally slow. [...] They've tried to develop individual characters, but each subplot meant to add a layer to a character has been quickly resolved." [...] Later reviews from other critics, such as Scott Wampler of Collider.com, recognized the increased quality of the second half, stating it [...] "seemed far more intense, more interesting, better written". Recognizing the overall season, Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant offered praise saying [...] "the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} {{performance of the}} album, Pornography was not well received by most music critics upon its release. NME reviewer Dave Hill was ambivalent towards the album, writing that it [...] "portrays and parades its currency of exposed futility and utterly naked fear with so few distractions or adornments, and so <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> shame. It really piles it on. The Cure have applied themselves to catching a related collection of the very purest feelings endemeic to their age, and holding them right on the spot in their intangible, unspecified, unmanageable and most unpleasantly real form." [...] Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "It's downhill all the way, into ever-darkening shadows... passing through chilly marbled archways to the final rendezvous with the cold comfort of the slab". Dave McCullough of Sounds felt that despite a [...] "genuine talent still at work", Pornography [...] "has too much music too cluttered a backing for Smith's well-intended observance [...] Robert Smith seems locked in himself, a spiralling nightmare that leaves The Cure making a pompous sounding music that is, when all's said and done, dryly meaningless". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, derided Smith's [...] "glum" [...] lyrics and felt that he should [...] "cheer up". Rolling Stone critic J. D. Considine commented that the lyrics seem [...] "stuck in the terminal malaise of adolescent existentialism", concluding, [...] "Pornography comes off as the aural equivalent of a bad toothache. It isn't the pain that irks, it's the persistent dullness". Trouser Press Charles McCardell, on the other hand, found that the Cure [...] "imposes an order that at first seems contrary to the basic preconceptions of rock 'n' roll" [...] – noting that [...] "for them, lyrics are everything" [...] and that instruments had been relegated to [...] "merely creating atmosphere" [...] – and hailed Pornography as an [...] "uncompromising and challenging" [...] work." ...|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{death was}} adulated by commentators, who affirmed {{that it was}} a gruesome and {{emotional}} scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, [...] "Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse." [...] Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: [...] "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world." [...] Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought {{that it was a}}mong the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was [...] "riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death". Handlen remarked: [...] "It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> danger right now." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as [...] "violent", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; [...] "That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that [...] "when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner." [...] Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The generic {{flexible}} space {{structure is}} a flexible beam {{controlled by a}} single actuator at one end. The actuator is attempting to control the rotation and/or lateral translation of the entire flexible system from rest to rest, requiring a combination of position control and active bending vibration damping. A new control strategy is presented for this problem. It is based on viewing the actuators motion as simultaneously launching and absorbing mechanical waves {{into and out of}} the system. It requires <b>little</b> <b>sensing,</b> <b>little</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the flexible system dynamics, and makes small demands on the actuator dynamics. It is generic and easily handles an arbitrary number of system components of arbitrary inertias and stiffnesses. It leads to a controller that can get the entire system to stop dead exactly at target, with little vibration in transit...|$|R
