Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to [...] "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". [...] "The more pathetic or deluded the character," [...] writes Gilbey, [...] "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous." [...] When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, [...] "I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> who have a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me." ...|$|E

The role of [...] "Alice" [...] was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film.
