The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall {{was the head of the}} west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.|$|E

25|$|The Tempest {{has been}} called the first {{landscape}} in the history of Western painting. The subject of this painting is unclear, but its artistic mastery is apparent. The Tempest portrays a soldier and a breast-feeding woman on either side of a stream, amid a city's rubble and an incoming storm. The multitude of symbols in The Tempest offer many interpretations, but none is wholly satisfying. Theories that the painting is about duality (city and country, male and female) have been dismissed since radiography has shown that in the earlier stages of the painting the soldier to the <b>left</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> seated female nude.|$|E

500|$|Many historians regard Offa as {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter Ælfflæd in marriage to the Northumbrian king Æthelred I in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view. In the words of a recent historian: [...] "Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he <b>left</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reputation, not a legacy." [...] Offa died in 796; his son, Ecgfrith, succeeded him, but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.|$|E

500|$|... x.The leftist in the 1960s {{democratic}} opposition regrouped in the 1970s {{in a different}} form, giving up in process much of its leftist moral affiliation. Defeated in 1968 by the regime which {{took advantage of the}} opposition's social isolation, the opposition activists opted for an alliance with the Polish Catholic Church. The alliance ended the opposition's isolation and legitimated the movement in popular perception. However, the cost for the <b>Left</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> surrender of its fundamental value system (the mainstream opposition could thus no longer be considered leftist) and, in the long run, granting the Right the upper hand in the ability to mobilize mass political support. The opposition's alliance with the Church (before 1989 and after, when it became the ruling establishment) is also responsible, according to the cultural philosopher Andrzej Leder, for the marginalization of the Left and its social concept in the political spectrum of democratic Poland.|$|E
500|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, Stenton {{argued that}} Offa {{was perhaps the}} {{greatest}} king of the English kingdoms, commenting that [...] "no other Anglo-Saxon king ever regarded {{the world at large}} with so... acute a political sense". Many historians regard Offa's achievements as second only to Alfred the Great among the Anglo-Saxon kings. Offa's reign has sometimes been regarded as a key stage in the transition to a unified England, but this is no longer the general view among historians in the field. In the words of Simon Keynes, [...] "Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he <b>left</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reputation, not a legacy." [...] It is now believed that Offa thought of himself as [...] "King of the Mercians," [...] and that his military successes were part of the transformation of Mercia from an overlordship of midland peoples into a powerful and aggressive kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Horace William Shaler Cleveland {{executed}} {{the plans}} within {{the limitations of}} the financial setbacks from the fire (including the loss of tax rolls) and the 1873 depression. [...] Olmsted's vision for Washington Park was generally realized. However, since spending for the park was diverted after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. [...] The loss of financial backing and difficulty in levying taxes after the fire meant that a water park could not be built on the property. [...] From 1897 until the 1930s the park housed an impressive conservatory and ornate sunken garden designed by D. H. Burnham & Co. at 56th Street and Cottage Grove. [...] The Washington Park Conservatory, like those of other city parks such as Humboldt and Douglas Parks, was torn down in the 1930s due to limited resources {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. [...] This left Lincoln Park and Garfield Park as Chicago's main Conservatories. [...] One of the earliest improvements was the [...] "South Open Green," [...] a pastoral meadow with grazing sheep, also used as a ball field. Architect Daniel H. Burnham's firm designed the 1880 limestone round stables, the 1881 refectory, and the 1910 administrative headquarters for the South Park Commission. [...] Other early attractions to the park included riding stables, cricket grounds, baseball fields, a toboggan slide, archery ranges, a golf course, bicycle paths, row boats, horseshoe pits, greenhouses, a rose garden, a bandstand, a small zoo featuring six alligators, and a lily pond. [...] The lily pond (pictured <b>left)</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> particularly enticing attraction because few had seen such a site. Today, the administrative building houses DuSable Museum of African American History. [...] The park has retained its environmental appeal with continuing visionary support of the Burnham Plan which supported the maintenance of a park system.|$|E

500|$|Carey's {{performance}} was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured {{a number of}} musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for [...] "Someday". Dana Jon Chapelle {{was chosen as the}} sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song [...] "Emotions" [...] Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her <b>left</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was [...] "If It's Over", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage. They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said [...] "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after. For [...] "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard. During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began [...] "Vision of Love", her [...] "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole. The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, [...] "Make It Happen", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began [...] "piling their vocals" [...] over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more [...] "churchy feel". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals: ...|$|E

[...] Apart from 73050, the society's locomotives were mostly small, industrial shunting engines and therefore not suitable for the [...] round trip. Ex-BR rolling stock was also in very short supply following the disposal of most pre-nationalisation (pre-1948) stock. The PDC, having paid out a considerable sum of money for the line, was anxious that trains should start running as soon as possible – certainly before the opening of the new Nene Park in 1978. However, with the PRC's lack of stock and locomotives this looked highly improbable.|$|E

[...] Although the labels hard left and soft left reflected a genuine political division within the Labour Party, Loony Left was by far the more often used label than either. While academics have depicted the era as of the [...] "new urban left" [...] (such as the rate-capping rebellion) as a throwback to earlier municipal militancy (e.g. Poplarism), wider media coverage tended to focus on the personalities of city leaders such as the Greater London Council's Ken Livingstone and Liverpool's Derek Hatton.|$|E
