25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing {{that is going on}} around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
60|$|And Zero <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair narrated the {{following}} simple tale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rose Danville, {{the court}} is waiting to hear you," [...] said the president, {{crossing}} his legs and <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously <b>in</b> <b>his</b> large armchair.|$|R
6000|$|Horace--thus far <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> {{carelessly}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair--suddenly raised {{himself and}} exclaimed, [...] "Good heavens! {{can this be}} the woman I saw laid out for dead in the French cottage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you run over, once again, {{what the}} boy said?" [...] asks Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting {{his hands into}} the pockets of his rusty smallclothes and <b>leaning</b> quietly <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|Immelan was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, gazing steadfastly {{across the}} crowded theatre.|$|E
60|$|George was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{his hands}} in his {{breeches}} pockets.|$|E
60|$|I {{bowed and}} {{returned}} to my seat. Blenavon was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, smoking thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Burger, <b>leaning</b> luxuriously <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> settee, {{and puffing}} a blue tree of cigar-smoke into the air, [...] "tell {{me all about}} your {{relations}} with Miss Mary Saunderson." ...|$|R
60|$|Cornelian {{was proof}} against these shafts; <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> {{gracefully}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair he launched forth into that {{detailed description of}} his last night's attire which the Dawn had so unaccountably failed to supply.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} whispered: [...] "I can't {{seem to make}} out very clear. I guess I {{got to take a}} little time to it," [...] he added, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> wearily <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. [...] "Ever seen much of the manifestations?" [...] he gasped at Westover.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned over}} the pages lazily, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar.|$|E
60|$|The Marquis was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{the tips}} of his long, elegant fingers pressed gently together.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Todd, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair and}} {{gripping}} the arms, gazed defiantly at {{a row of}} palms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, hardly," [...] he answered, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arm-chair, {{and sending}} up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. [...] "For example, {{observation}} shows {{me that you}} have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jean Baptiste Greuze," [...] Holmes continued, joining {{his finger}} tips and <b>leaning</b> well <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, [...] "was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, {{of course to}} his working career. Modern {{criticism}} has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} kind of hesitating," [...] Mr. Fischer went on, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> once more <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. [...] "You want the truth, don't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Leicester, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair and}} {{grasping}} the elbows, sits {{looking at him}} with a stony face.|$|E
60|$|His friend {{thrust his}} hands into his {{trousers}} pocket and, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, looked steadfastly at his guest.|$|E
60|$|To his astonishment {{he saw the}} {{official}} <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair hastily scanning {{the contents of the}} little black diary.|$|E
50|$|Buckley's {{distinctive}} mannerisms were prominently {{displayed by}} the program and {{were part of the}} public images of both the show and Buckley. Buckley was frequently seen <b>leaning</b> far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, a pen near his mouth and a clipboard <b>in</b> hand. <b>His</b> flicking tongue, widening eyes and flashing smile also characterized his style, as did his multi-syllabic vocabulary. Buckley's voice was widely satirized as, for instance, by Robin Williams in the animated movie Aladdin.|$|R
60|$|Lakamba's lips moved inaudibly. The man who {{had just}} spoken was again deeply absorbed in the game going on at his feet; and the chief--as if he had {{forgotten}} all about it already--sat with a stolid face amongst his silent followers, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> squarely <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{his hands on the}} arms of his seat, his knees apart, his big blood-shot eyes blinking solemnly, as if dazzled by the noble vacuity of his thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not of {{much use}} to convarse with you, Chainbearer, on such subjects, for we'll never think alike," [...] {{answered}} the 'squire, <b>leaning</b> still farther <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair; [...] "you're what I call a particular man, in your notions, {{and we should}} never agree." ...|$|R
60|$|Matlack {{looked at}} Peter Sadler {{and then at}} Mr. Archibald, who was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, his bright eyes twinkling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blessed compact, ours," [...] {{the giant}} remarked, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. [...] "No probing for confidences, no silly questions. Out with it!" ...|$|E
60|$|When Richard {{returned}} to the office he found that Mr. Joyce had just cleared his desk, and was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair.|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel, without replying, slowly {{filled a}} glass of whiskey and water. For a moment he held it dreamily before him, as if still engaged in gentle reminiscences called up by the act. Then tossing it off, he wiped his lips with a large white handkerchief, and <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> comfortably <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, said, {{with a wave of}} his hand, [...] "The {{interview}} I requested, Mr. Hotchkiss, concerns a subject--which I may say is--er--er--at present NOT of a public or business nature--although LATER it might become--er--er--both. It is an affair of some--er--delicacy." ...|$|R
60|$|Laxton {{had had a}} tiring day, and he was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> lazily <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{watching}} the crowd, when a man entered the turnstile-door, which was fitted with glass valves {{to keep out the}} cold. He looked about the room as if in search of somebody; and then after speaking to the clerk came toward the land agent. Laxton glanced at him without much interest, having already as much business on his hands as he could manage. The stranger wore an old fur-coat and looked like a rancher.|$|R
60|$|Norgate {{found himself}} in an {{atmosphere}} of strange excitement during his two hours' waiting at the House of Commons on the following day. He was ushered at last into Mr. Hebblethwaite's private room. Hebblethwaite had just come in from the House and was <b>leaning</b> a little <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, <b>in</b> an attitude of repose. He glanced at Norgate with a faint smile.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cruxhall puffed {{steadily}} at {{his cigar}} for a moment, and <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair thrust {{his hand into}} his trousers' pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "This man is mad!" [...] Mr. Parker sighed, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> place--"stark, staring mad! His {{interference}} with my meals is becoming unwarrantable." ...|$|E
60|$|Heneage, who was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{looking into}} the fire with half closed eyes, {{straightened}} himself, and turned directly towards his companion.|$|E
60|$|In sudden terror, {{she looked}} round for Miltoun. But {{he was still}} there, exactly as before, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> rigid <b>in</b> <b>his</b> corner of the cab, with staring eyes, and no other signs of life. And still only half awake, like a great warm sleepy child startled out of too deep slumber, she clutched, and clung to him. The {{thought that he had}} been sitting like that, with his spirit far away, all the time that she had been betraying her watch in sleep, was dreadful. But to her embrace there was no response, and awake indeed now, ashamed, sore, Barbara {{released}} him, and turned her face to the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some gallantry of that d----d Frenchman, who's {{trying to}} do some woman-stalking up here, and jealousy of Kilcraithie's, who's just got enough of <b>his</b> forbears' blood <b>in</b> him to think nothing of {{sticking}} three inches of <b>his</b> dirk <b>in</b> the wame of the man that crosses him. But I say," [...] continued Jock, <b>leaning</b> easily <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, [...] "YOU ought to know something of all this. This room, old man, {{was used as a}} sort of rendezvous, having two outlets, don't you see, when they couldn't get at the summer-house below. By Jove! they both had it in turns--Kilcraithie and the Frenchman--until Lady Macquoich got wind of something, swept them out, and put YOU in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a pause. Under {{ordinary}} circumstances Sybil {{would have}} left the room and terminated a distressing interview, but in the present instance that was impossible; for on the continuance of that interview any hope of assisting her father depended. Morley had thrown himself into a chair opposite her, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> silence with <b>his</b> face covered; Sybil was disinclined to revive the conversation about her father, because she had already perceived that Morley was only too much aware of the command which the subject gave him over her feelings and even conduct. Yet time, time now full of terror, time was stealing on. It was evident that Morley would not break the silence. At length, unable any longer to repress her tortured heart, Sybil said, [...] "Stephen, be generous; speak to me of your friend." ...|$|R
