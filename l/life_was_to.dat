5|$|Grint {{was born}} in Harlow, Essex, England, to Nigel Grint (b. 1963), a dealer in racing memorabilia, and Joanne Grint (née Parsons; b. 1967). Grint is the eldest of five siblings, the others being James (b. 1990), Georgina (b. 1993), Samantha and Charlotte. He has stated that his {{earliest}} goal in <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> become an ice cream man. He attended Richard Hale School, in Hertford.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} few years, the {{foremost}} goal of her <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> provide a safe and calm home for Miklós Horthy. Mrs. Horthy appeared in public extremely rarely. In essence, the family had a modest life when taking into account Horthy's position; the highest point of it was the yearly garden-party. Their residence was in the Buda Castle when they were at Budapest and it took up 9 rooms (of 814 in total). The Horthy family's retreat was at Kenderes - it was larger than a villa, but smaller than a castle.|$|E
25|$|Canute and {{his companions}} gain {{audience}} with the king. When King Sweyn refuses to refrain from attacking Wales, Askeladd goes on a rampage, killing the king and many in attendance. Askeladd is only stopped when he allows Canute to kill him, thus securing Canute's position as king {{and the safety of}} his homeland, Wales. This was Askeladd's plan, all along. Thorfinn, upon seeing Askeladd dying, tries to kill now-King Canute; Thorfinn's sole drive in <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> kill Askeladd and he felt robbed of this right by Canute. When Thorfinn is stopped, Canute decides to spare his life due to understanding Thorfinn's perspective. Canute shows mercy on Thorfinn as the common law demanded Thorfinn's death: he is granted a life of slavery.|$|E
25|$|The young Rasofsky {{grew up on}} Chicago's mean streets, {{ultimately}} {{ignoring his}} father's desire for {{him to become a}} rabbi and his admonition that Jews do not resort to violence. Let the goyim be the fighters, Ross later recalled being told by his father. The trumbeniks, the murderers—we are the scholars. Ross's ambition in <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> become a Jewish teacher and a Talmudic scholar, but his life was changed forever when his father was shot dead resisting a robbery at his small grocery. Prostrate from grief, his mother Sarah suffered a nervous breakdown and his younger siblings—Ida, Sam and George—were placed in an orphanage or farmed out to other members of the extended family. Dov was left to his own devices at the age of 14.|$|E

25|$|During the pre-earth life, God the Father {{presented}} {{a plan to}} have a Savior {{make it possible for}} mankind to be saved. The purpose of an earth <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> give men the opportunity to demonstrate obedience to the commandments of God while outside of his presence. This is the central test of the evolution or eternal progression of man to godhood. Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior. However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God's glory, and human agency would be eliminated. When God rejected that plan, the War in Heaven ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one-third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies. Lucifer became Satan, or the devil.|$|E
25|$|In circa 1193 (or {{possibly}} 1190), however, Basil Vatatzes, the doux of the Thracesian {{theme and}} megas domestikos of the Byzantine army, {{forced him to}} flee {{to the court of}} the Seljuk Turks at Iconium. There, the Sultan Ghīyāth al-Dīn Kaykhusraw (r. 1192–1196 and 1205–1211) allowed Theodore to enroll troops among the nomadic tribes, and with these bands he ravaged the frontier lands of the Byzantine Empire in 1195–1196. In late 1196, the new emperor, Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203), bought Mangaphas from the sultan, on condition that his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be spared, and that he would not {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. He remained in prison for an unknown period of time before he was released (at any rate before 1204) and returned to Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|Christianity {{and church}} had a modifying {{influence}} on the classical concept of heroism and virtue, nowadays identified with the virtues of chivalry. The Peace and Truce of God in the 10th century was one such example, with limits placed on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and also help the church maintain peace. At {{the same time the}} church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the just war; and liturgies were introduced which blessed a knight's sword, and a bath of chivalric purification. In the story of the Grail romances and Chevalier au Cygne, it was the confidence of the Christian knighthood that its way of <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> please God, and chivalry was an order of God. Thus, chivalry as a Christian vocation was a result of marriage between Teutonic heroic values with the militant tradition of Old Testament.|$|E

25|$|Padmavati, though {{initially}} dejected by her husband's departure, soon {{falls into}} the company of wanton women who suggest that she take on a lover. She agrees, and every night for the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single night by the parrot, which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing {{that the goal of}} <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her next story had. Padmavati naturally wants to know the details of the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to my studio to visit me. He would sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Egyptian animal mummies were religious offerings. If an Egyptian sought a favor from a god, he would purchase or make an offering and place it at the appropriate temple of the god he wished to please. Before animal mummification became common, these offerings were usually bronze statues depicting the animals. However, eventually a cheaper alternative to bronze statues—animal mummies—became the most popular form of offering. Literally millions of these mummified animals have been discovered throughout Egypt. Inspection of these mummies, usually done through CT scans which allow researchers to examine the skeletons of the mummies without damaging the outer wrappings, has suggested that these types of animals were bred {{for the sole purpose}} of offerings. As the process of animal mummification for the purpose of offerings grew, mummification techniques became progressively less meticulous. Studies have revealed many of the large-scale animal offerings to be ‘fakes’ — the wrappings containing only a few bones, feathers, reeds, wood, or pieces of pottery. The animals were raised on temple grounds, and then sold to pilgrims or regular citizens. The animals’ necks were often broken, an indication that their sole purpose in <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be sacrificed as offerings. When visiting the temples, Egyptians of the general public would purchase these pre-mummified animals and offer them to the gods.|$|E

Although she confesses to loneliness in the boarding school, she noted that it was compensated by her finding a [...] "...perfect set of friends" [...] there. As a student, she developed a love for literature, particularly the works of William Shakespeare and poetry. According to Zinta, she enjoyed schoolwork and received good grades; in her free time she played sports, especially basketball.|$|E

Robson, a future Attorney-General, whose [...] "vehement radicalism was an admirable stimulus and corrective to [...] liberal Conservatism". During these years Lang was largely aloof from religion, but continued churchgoing out of what he termed [...] "hereditary respect". He attended services at the nonconformist City Temple church and sometimes went to St Paul's Cathedral. Of his life at that time he said: [...] "I must confess that I played sometimes with those external temptations that our Christian London flaunts {{in the face of}} its young men." ...|$|E

Gibson has observed that he [...] "did not literally evade the draft, as they never bothered drafting me"; after the hearing he went home and purchased a bus ticket to Toronto, and left {{a week or two}} later. In the biographical documentary No Maps for These Territories (2000), Gibson said that his decision was motivated less by conscientious objection than by a desire to [...] "sleep with hippie chicks" [...] and indulge in hashish.

500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday. Only five games {{remained in the}} regular season, with the Warriors (46–29) in second place—eleven games behind the Boston Celtics—and the Knicks in last place. Chamberlain {{had spent the night}} before the game in New York City, partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6am With no sleep and suffering from a hangover, he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8am, met several friends at the Philadelphia train station, and had a long lunch with them, thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey. The other players were similarly bored. Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> see that. There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ... The town of Hershey was built around a huge chocolate factory; everything there became permeated with the smell of chocolate. It was practically impossible to stay indoors; people felt sick. I was just dreaming to leave the place as fast as I could." ...|$|E

Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the beautiful little girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd has the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
