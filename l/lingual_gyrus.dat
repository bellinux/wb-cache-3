The right middle temporal gyrus, right brainstem, left hippocampus, right cerebellum, right fuisform gyrus, and left <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> were also activated during fearful stimuli. Activation of multiple brain regions both indicates that emotions are processed {{in many parts of}} the brain and that emotions are complex.|$|E

Feedback projections have also been observed in the opossum directly from the auditory association cortex to V1. This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within the neuroscientific community. Sadato et al. (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein et al.

They hence concluded that A1 would not at all be effected by cross modal plasticity. This concurs with Jones and Powell's (1970) contention that primary sensory areas are connected only to other areas of the same modality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> {{activation}} {{has been}} linked to encoding of complex images. Subjects were scanned using fMRI while looking at pictures. The images were emotionally neutral, with no people in close-up. Subjects were tasked with memorizing the images for recognition at a later date. Data from the fMRI showed in several structures, notably the <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus.</b> Similar activation was recorded during the recollection several weeks later. It has also been shown that activation of ventral occipitotemporal cortex, including <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus,</b> is related to the processing of visual information about parts of human faces. Furthermore, left <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> activates during memorizing and maintating images of human faces in the working memory.|$|E
40|$|AbstractExtrastriate area V 4 {{is crucial}} for {{intermediate}} form vision and visual attention in nonhuman primates. Human neuroimaging suggests that an area in the <b>lingual</b> sulcus/fusiform <b>gyrus</b> may correspond to ventral V 4 (V 4 v). We studied a human neurological patient, AR, with a putative V 4 v lesion. The lesion does not affect early visual processing (luminance, orientation, and motion perception). However, it does impair hue perception, intermediate form vision, and visual attention in the upper contralateral visual field. Form deficits occur during discrimination of illusory borders, Glass patterns, curvature, and non-Cartesian patterns. Attention deficits occur during discrimination of the relative positions of object parts, detection of low-salience targets, and orientation discrimination {{in the presence of}} distractors. This pattern of deficits is consistent with the known properties of area V 4 in nonhuman primates, indicating that AR's lesion affects a cortical region functionally homologous to macaque V 4...|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} the {{symptoms}} and the damage is different from person to person. If a person has complete achromatopsia, then their entire visual field is devoid of colour. A person with dyschromatopsia, or incomplete achromtopsia, has similar symptoms to complete achromatopsia, but to a lesser degree. This can occur in people who had achromatopsia, but the brain recovered from the injury, restoring some colour vision. The person {{may be able to}} see certain colours. However, there are many cases where there is no recovery. Finally, a person with hemiachromatopsia see half of their field of vision in colour, and the other half in grey. The visual hemifield contralateral to a lesion in the <b>lingual</b> or fusiform <b>gyrus</b> is the one that appears grey, while the ipsilateral visual hemifield appears in colour. The variance in symptoms emphasizes the need to understand the architecture of the colour centre in order to better diagnose and possible treat cerebral achromotopsia.|$|R
50|$|Cerebral {{achromatopsia}} is {{a chronic}} condition {{where a person}} is unable to see colour, {{but they are still}} able to recognize shape and form. Cerebral achromatopsia differs from congenital achromatopsia in that it is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex as opposed to abnormalities in the retinal cells. The search for the colour centre was motivated by the discovery that lesions in the ventral occipital lobe led to colour blindness, as well as the idea that there are area specializations in the cortex. Many studies have shown that lesions in the areas commonly identified as the colour centre, such as V1, V2, and the V4-complex lead to achromatopsia. Cerebral achromatopsia occurs after injury to the <b>lingual</b> or fusiform <b>gyrus,</b> the areas associated with hV4. These injuries include physical trauma, stroke, and tumour growth. One of the primary initiatives to locating the colour centre in the visual cortex is to discover the cause and a possible treatment of cerebral achromatopsia.|$|R

40|$|Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, {{and risk}} genes {{are thought to}} act through {{disruption}} of brain development. Several genetic studies have identified dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP 1, also known as dysbindin) as a potential susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, but its impact on brainfunction is poorly understood. It has been proposed that DTNBP 1 {{may be associated with}} differences in visualprocessing. To test this, we examined the impact on visualprocessing in 61 healthy children aged 10 – 12 years of a genetic variant in DTNBP 1 (rs 2619538) that was common to all schizophrenia associated haplotypes in an earlier UK-Irish study. We tested the hypothesis that carriers of the risk allele would show altered occipital cortical function relative to noncarriers. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain responses during a visual matching task. The data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping and statistical inferences were made at p < 0. 05 (corrected for multiple comparisons). Relative to noncarriers, carriers of the risk allele had greater activation in the <b>lingual,</b> fusiform <b>gyrus</b> and inferior occipital gyri. In these regions DTNBP 1 genotype accounted for 19 %, 20 % and 14 % of the inter-individual variance, respectively. Our results suggest that that genetic variation in DTNBP 1 is associated with differences in the function of brain areas that mediate visualprocessing, and that these effects are evident in young children. These findings are consistent with the notion that the DTNBP 1 gene influences brain development and can thereby modulate vulnerability to schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{degree to}} which one {{identifies}} as male or female has {{a profound impact on}} one’s life. Yet, there is a limited understanding of what contributes to this important characteristic termed gender identity. In order to reveal factors influencing gender identity, studies have focused on people who report strong feelings of being the opposite sex, such as male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals. Method: To investigate potential neuroanatomical variations associated with transsexualism, we compared the regional thickness of the cerebral cortex between 24 MTF transsexuals who had not yet been treated with cross-sex hormones and 24 age-matched control males. Results: Results revealed thicker cortices in MTF transsexuals, both within regions of the left hemisphere (i. e., frontal and orbito-frontal cortex, central sulcus, perisylvian regions, paracentral gyrus) and right hemisphere (i. e., pre-/post-central gyrus, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, precuneus, fusiform, <b>lingual,</b> and orbito-frontal <b>gyrus).</b> Conclusion: These findings provide further evidence that brain anatomy is associated with gender identity, where measures in MTF transsexuals appear to be shifted away from gender-congruent men...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that cirrhosis may affect functional connectivity among various brain regions in patients prior to onset of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, most investigators have focused mainly on alterations in functional connectivity strengths, {{and the changes}} in functional connectivity density (FCD) are largely unknown. Here, we investigated alterations in resting-state FCD in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) without overt HE. Totally, 31 patients with HBV-RC without overt HE and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MRI examinations. FCD mapping was employed to compute local and global FCD maps. Then, short-range and long-range FCD values were calculated and voxel-based comparisons were performed between the two groups. The HBV-RC group showed significant decreases in FCD, including decreased short-range FCDs in the bilateral middle cingulum gyrus/precuneus, the bilateral cuneus, and the left <b>lingual</b> gyrus/inferior occipital <b>gyrus</b> and decreased long-range FCD in the bilateral cuneus/precuneus. In addition, the decreased long-range FCD in the bilateral cuneus/precuneus in the HBV-RC group was related to performance on the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) test. These findings suggest aberrant functional connectivity density in cirrhotic patients prior to overt HE onset, which may provide better insight into understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the cirrhotic-related cognitive impairment...|$|R

50|$|Activation of <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> {{has been}} shown in {{selective}} visual attention studies. Subjects were tasked with memorizing symbols in certain visual fields while ignoring those in others. In some subjects, the <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> was activated. The hemispheric activation of the structure was dependent on which visual field the subject was focused on. Hemispheric dependent gyrus activation has also been shown by isolating visual fields rather than by diverting focus.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{studies have}} shown a {{relationship}} between memorization and activation in the gyrus. When subjects were tasked with pairing abstract nouns with either visual imagery or sentence generation, many areas in the occipital lobe - namely the <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> - showed task-selective memory effects. This effect was primarily linked to visual imagery as {{there were no significant}} effects associated with sentence generation. This link between memory and the gyrus extends to retrieval fluency in children, as well. Studies have shown elevated signals in the <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> when subjects were tasked with retrieval of facts while problem solving. Control samples show the activation is not linked to the problem solving itself, rather the recollection. This suggests a potential link between the <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> and hippocampal regions in the brain. Furthermore, the gyrus is potentially linked to the amygdala. Gyrus activation was observed when subjects were tasked with verbalizing high-emotion words in contrast to neutral-emotion words. A second study linked the regions with high-emotion images. When subjects were shown emotional images, the amygdala and <b>lingual</b> <b>gyrus</b> both activated significantly more when compared to neutral-emotion images.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) without overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) are associated with a varying degree of cognitive dysfunction. Several resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been conducted to explore the neural correlates of such cognitive deficits, whereas little effort has been made to investigate the cortical integrity in cirrhotic patients without OHE. Here, using cortical thickness, surface area and local gyrification index (lGI), this study performed a comprehensive analysis on the cortical morphometry of patients with HBV-RC without OHE (HBV-RC-NOHE) versus matched healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, we found significantly increased cortical thickness in the bilateral <b>lingual</b> and parahippocampal <b>gyrus,</b> right posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, peri-calcarine sulcus and fusiform gyrus in patient with HBV-RC-NOHE, which may closely relate to be the low-grade brain edema. Cortical gyrification analysis showed significantly increased lGI in the left superior and inferior parietal cortex as well as lateral occipital cortex, which was speculated to be associated with disruptions in white matter connectivity and sub-optimal intra-cortical organization. In addition, the mean cortical thickness/lGI of the regions with structural abnormalities was shown to be negatively correlated with psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) of the patients with HBV-RC-NOHE. These morphological changes may serve as potential markers for the preclinical diagnosis and progression of HBV-RC-NOHE...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliable}} discrimination {{of emotional}} expressions in faces {{is essential for}} adequate social interaction. Deficits in facial emotion processing are an important impairment in schizophrenia with major consequences for social functioning and subjective well-being. Whether neural circuits underlying emotion processing are already altered before illness onset is yet unclear. Investigating neural correlates of emotion processing in individuals clinically at risk for psychosis offers the possibility to examine neural processes unchanged by the manifest disorder and to study trait aspects of emotion dysfunctions. Twelve subjects clinically at risk for psychosis and 12 matched control subjects participated in this study. fMRI data were acquired during an emotion discrimination task consisting of standardized photographs of faces displaying different emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear) as well as faces with neutral facial expression. There were no group differences in behavioral performance. Emotion discrimination was associated with hyperactivations in high-risk subjects in the right <b>lingual</b> and fusiform <b>gyrus</b> {{as well as the}} left middle occipital gyrus. Further, high-risk compared to control subjects exhibited stronger activation related to neutral faces relative to emotional faces in the inferior and superior frontal gyri, the cuneus, the thalamus and the hippocampus. The present study indicates that individuals clinically at risk for psychosis show differences in brain activation associated with processing of emotional and [...] more pronounced [...] neutral facial expressions despite an adequate behavioral performance. The proneness to attribute salience to neutral stimuli might indicate a biological risk marker for psychosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{growing number}} of {{functional}} magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been conducted in major depressive disorder (MDD) to elucidate reward-related brain functions. The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the common reward network in the MDD brain and to further distinguish the brain activation patterns between positive stimuli and monetary rewards as well as reward anticipation and outcome. Methods: A series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were performed across 22 fMRI studies that examined reward-related processing, with a total of 341 MDD patients and 367 healthy controls. Results: We observed several frontostriatal regions that participated in reward processing in MDD. The common reward network in MDD was characterized by decreased subcortical and limbic areas activity and an increased cortical response. In addition, the cerebellum, <b>lingual</b> gyms, parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> and fusiform gyrus preferentially responded to positive stimuli in MDD, while the insula, precuneus, cuneus, PFC and inferior parietal lobule selectively responded to monetary rewards. Our results indicated a reduced caudate response during both monetary anticipation and outcome stages as well as increased activation in the middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate during reward anticipation in MDD. Limitations: The reward-related tasks and mood states of patients included in our analysis were heterogeneous. Conclusions: Our current findings suggest that there exist emotional or motivational pathway dysfunctions in MDD during reward-related processing. Future studies may be strengthened by paying careful attention to the types of reward used as well as the different components of reward processing examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
