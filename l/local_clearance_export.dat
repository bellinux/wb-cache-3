40|$|The <b>Local</b> <b>Clearance</b> Triangulation (LCT) of {{polygonal}} obstacles is a cell decomposition {{designed for}} the efficient computation of locally shortest paths with clearance. This paper presents a revised definition of LCTs, new theoretical results and optimizations, and new algorithms introducing dy-namic updates and robustness. Given an input obstacle set with n vertices, a theoretical analysis is proposed showing that LCTs generate a triangular decomposition of O(n) cells, guaranteeing that discrete search algorithms can compute paths in optimal times. In addition, several examples are pre-sented indicating {{that the number of}} triangles is low in practice, close to 2 n, and a new technique is described for reducing the number of triangles when the maximum query clearance is known in advance. Algorithms for repairing the <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> property dynamically are also introduced, lead-ing to efficient LCT updates for addressing dynamic changes in the obsta-cle set. Dynamic updates automatically handle intersecting and overlapping segments with guaranteed robustness, using techniques that combine one exact geometric predicate with adjustment of illegal floating point coordi-nates. The presented results demonstrate that LCTs are efficient and highly flexible for representing dynamic polygonal environments with clearance information...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} efficiently computing optimal paths of arbitrary clearance from a polygonal representation of a given virtual environment. Key to the proposed method is {{a new type of}} triangulated navigation mesh, called a <b>Local</b> <b>Clearance</b> Triangulation, which enables the efficient and correct determination if a disc of arbitrary size can pass through any narrow passages of the mesh. The proposed approach uniquely balances speed of computation and optimality of paths by first computing high-quality locally shortest paths efficiently in optimal time. Only in case global optimality is needed, an extended search will gradually improve the current path (if not already the global optimal) until the globally shortest one is determined. The presented method represents the first solution correctly extracting shortest paths of arbitrary clearance directly from a triangulated environment...|$|R

This paper explores the use of triangulations as a navigation mesh, and discusses several useful triangulation–based algorithms and operations: environment modeling and validity, automatic agent placement, track-ing moving obstacles, ray–obstacle intersection queries, path planning with arbi-trary clearance, determination of corridors, etc. While several of the addressed queries and operations {{can be applied to}} generic triangular meshes, the efficient computation of paths with arbitrary clearance requires a new type of triangular mesh, called a <b>Local</b> <b>Clearance</b> Triangulation, which enables the efficient and correct determination if a disc of arbitrary size can pass through any narrow pas-sages of the mesh. This paper shows that triangular meshes can support the effi-cient computation of several navigation procedures and an implementation of the presented methods is available...|$|R

The bone mineral density (g/vm- 3) was lower in the forearm bones of the lumberjacks than in controls of the same age with healthy bones. Moreover the poorer the thenar muscle blood flow, the greater was the decrease in the mineral density of the distal radius. Measurement of the mineral density of the forearm bones by the gramma ray attenuation method can be used for early detection of bone lesions in traumatic vasospastic disease...|$|R

Normal skin reaction of {{the foot of the}} mouse on localized hyperthermia induced this apparatus was stronger than that on water bath, and so hyperthermia at 42 ℃ for 15 minutes was the maximum way for heating.

40|$|CSF {{is thought}} to flow {{continuously}} {{from the site of}} production in the ventricles into interconnected spaces; i. e. cisterns and subarachnoid spaces (SASs). Since the SAS of the optic nerve is defined by a cul-de-sac anatomy, it is not evident how local CSF might recycle from that region to the general SAS. The concept of free communication of CSF has recently been challenged by the description of a concentration gradient of beta-trace protein, a lipocalin-like prostaglandin d-synthase (L-PGDS), between the spinal CSF and that in the SAS of the optic nerve, indicating diminished <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> or <b>local</b> overproduction of L-PGDS here. In fact, computed cisternography with a contrast agent in three patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and asymmetric papilloedema demonstrate a lack of contrast-loaded CSF in the SAS of the optic nerve despite it being present in the intracranial SAS, thus suggesting compartmentation of the SAS of the optic nerve. The concept of an optic nerve compartment syndrome is further supported by a concentration gradient of brain-derived L-PGDS between the spinal CSF and the CSF from the optic nerve SAS in the same patient...|$|R

40|$|Patterns of fibrin {{deposition}} {{were investigated}} by immnunofluorescence microscopy in livers of thymus intact (TI) and athymic (AT) mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Thrombin and fibrinolysis inhibitor activity in tissue extracts also were measured. In TI mice fibrin was detected perivascularly by 6 weeks after infection and at 8 weeks {{it was found}} over the granulomas as they developed. Fibrin was cleared {{from the center of}} granulomas by 10 weeks. Thrombin inhibitor activity increased at 4 to 6 weeks but declined below control levels later as granulomas formed. Fibrinolysis inhibitor activity, on the other hand, peaked at 9 to 12 weeks after infection. In AT mice extensive fibrin deposition was detected in the liver throughout the period when smaller and incomplete granulomas developed. Central clearing did not occur. Thrombin inhibitor activity greatly increased by 8 weeks after infection but fibrinolysis inhibitor activity remained unchanged. These findings suggest that fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis are orderly events regulated in the lesions by proteinases and their inhibitors and this seems to be a general tissue reaction in the early stage of chronic granuloma formation. Since <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> of fibrin in vivo and fibrinolysis inhibitor activity from tissue extracts studied in vitro are more evident in TI mice than in AT mice, it appears that T cell function is important in modulating the tissue response during granulomatous inflammation...|$|R
40|$|In these {{patients}} {{the sequence of}} events is probably as follows: upper respiratory tract colonization occurs early as described above, and is followed by aspiration of organisms into the lower respiratory tract. Aspiration of pharyngeal content during sleep is frequent in healthy adults and becomes very common when consciousness is depressed (Huxley et ai, 1978). Impaired mucociliary clearance allows the organism to persist and penetrate to the alveolus. Multiplication and tissue invasion then occur because alveolar macro-phage clearance and immune function are depressed. Pseudomonas is thus able to reach its full potential as an opportunistic patho-gen. Mortality in initial reports was over 70 % although with better treatment this may be reduced (McKendrick & Geddes, 1981). Treatment with an aminoglycoside and certain /Mactam antibiotics can be successful but the underlying state of the patient is probably the most important factor. Newer antibiotics such as ceftazidime are at present being evaluated. Pseudomonas infections of the respiratory tract provide a rare opportunity to study pulmonary host defences. The range of disease from simple colonization to fatal pneumonia demonstrates the importance of both <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanisms and systemic defences, and furthermore empha-sizes that the host {{is by far the most}} impor-tant variable in the confrontation.

40|$|National audienceIn {{the western}} part of Morocco, various studies deal with land use (LU) mapping and analysis. However, no {{quantitative}} or qualitative analysis has been focused on the interrelations between mass wasting (MW) and LU. This paper is centered on the mapping in the NW Morocco (Chefchaouen province) to define different LU classes and their consequences for slope stability. Seven classes of LU were mapped: dense forests, shrubs or matorrals, reforestation areas, farmlands, naked areas, urban zones and free water bodies. Four major types of MW occur within this region: landslides, rock falls, debris flows and undercutting. Badlands (BL) do not belong to MW but are characterized by successive thalweg and crests resulting from linear erosion, also responsible for the loss in farmlands. Therefore, their location and extension are analyzed. The analysis of the spatial distribution of MW according to LU classes demonstrated that high densities of MW and BL classes cover three main LU classes: farmlands include 45 % of MW and BL; dense forest's areas reach up to 24 % of the phenomena, commonly due to an important <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> of vegetation; shrubs are concerned by 11 % of the MW only, in conformity with the discrete character of their plant cover. Landslides, river undermining and badlands are mostly triggered by farmlands. Debris flows and rock falls develop where steep rocks and resistant formations (limestone, sandstone, and quartzite) dominate, in association with marquetry of shrubs and islands of dense forests...|$|R

However, the systemic {{interaction between the}} virus and host in vivo has not been studied in individual hosts continuously, although such information can be crucial to control the persistent infection of the gammaherpesviruses. For the noninvasive and continuous monitoring {{of the interaction between}} gammaherpesvirus and the host, a recombinant murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV- 68, a gammaherpesvirus 68) was constructed to express a firefly luciferase gene driven by the viral M 3 promoter (M 3 FL). Real-time monitoring of M 3 FL infection revealed novel sites of viral replication, such as salivary glands, as well as acute replication in the nose and the lung and progression to the spleen. Continuous monitoring of M 3 FL infection in individual mice demonstrated the various kinetics of transition to different organs and <b>local</b> <b>clearance,</b> rather than systemically synchronized clearance. Moreover, in vivo spontaneous reactivation of M 3 FL from latency was detected after the initial clearance of acute infection and can be induced upon treatment with either a proteasome inhibitor Velcade or an immunosuppressant cyclosporine A. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the in vivo replication and reactivation of gammaherpesvirus are dynamically controlled by the locally defined interaction between the virus and the host immune system and that bioluminescence imaging can be successfully used for the real-time monitoring of this dynamic interaction of MHV- 68 with its host in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Orthostatic {{intolerance}} (OI) or postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome primarily affecting young females, and {{is characterized}} by lightheadedness, palpitations, fatigue, altered mentation, and syncope primarily occurring with upright posture and being relieved by lying down. There is typically tachycardia and raised plasma norepinephrine levels on upright posture, but little or no orthostatic hypotension. The pathophysiology of OI {{is believed to be}} very heterogeneous. Most studies of the syndrome have focused on abnormalities in norepinephrine release. Here the hypothesis that abnormal norepinephrine transporter (NET) function might contribute to the pathophysiology in some patients with OI was tested. In a proband with significant orthostatic symptoms and tachycardia, disproportionately elevated plasma norepinephrine with standing, impaired systemic, and <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> of infused tritiated norepinephrine, impaired tyramine responsiveness, and a dissociation between stimulated plasma norepinephrine and DHPG elevation were found. Studies of NET gene structure in the proband revealed a coding mutation that converts a highly conserved transmembrane domain Ala residue to Pro. Analysis of the protein produced by the mutant cDNA in transfected cells demonstrated greater than 98 % reduction in activity relative to normal. NE, DHPG/NE, and heart rate correlated with the mutant allele in this family. CONCLUSION: These results represent the first identification of a specific genetic defect in OI and the first disease linked to a coding alteration in a Na+/Cl(-) -dependent neurotransmitter transporter. Identification of this mechanism may facilitate our understanding of genetic causes of OI and lead to the development of more effective therapeutic modalities...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{invariant}} NKT (iNKT) {{cells in}} reactive arthritis is unknown. We explored the functional role of NKT cells in reactive arthritis using an established murine model of Chlamydia trachomatis-induced arthritis (CtIA). CtIA in wild-type and CD 1 d knockout (KO) mice was induced by intra-articular injection of C. trachomatis. The effect of a-galactosylceramide (a-GalCer) activation of iNKT cells was investigated by intra-peritoneal administration of a-GalCer. Histopathological and phenotypic changes, chlamydial clearance and cytokine and chemokine production in synovial tissue {{of the knee}} joint were investigated after onset of the arthritis. The severity of CtIA was significantly increased in CD 1 d KO mice, which was associated with decrease in bactericidal cytokine IFN-g, regulatory cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 10 and increase in pro-inflammatory chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2) and IFN-g-inducible protein- 10 (IP- 10). <b>Local</b> <b>clearance</b> of the pathogen from the joint was also decreased. Prior treatment of mice with a-GalCer, a potent activator of iNKT cells, significantly reduced the severity of CtIA in mice. The amelioration of CtIA was associated with decrease in chlamydial load and induction of cytokines IFN-g, IL- 4 and IL- 10 and significant suppression of MIP- 2 and IP- 10. Treatment of established CtIA with a-GalCer also demonstrated modulation of CtIA and decrease in chlamydial load. These results suggest that iNKT cells are protective against CtIA and a-GalCer-activated iNKT cells have an immunoregulatory role not only in preventing the induction of reactive arthritis but also in modulating established disease...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether food intake modulates experimental tumour growth by acute alterations in the energy state and blood flow of the tumour, and if so whether such changes are related to alterations in the enzyme ornithinedecarboxylase (ODC) and DNA synthesis. Inbred mice (C 57 BL/J) bearing a syngeneic undifferentiated and rapidly growing tumour were used. The tumour levels of high energy phosphates were measured in vivo by 31 -P-NMR spectroscopy and biochemically following tissue extraction. DNA synthesis was estimated by measuring the incorporation of bromodeoxy-uridine into tumour DNA. Difluoro-methylornithine (DFMO) was used to inhibit ODC-activity. Tumour blood flow was estimated by a 132 Xe <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> technique. Tumour progression was associated with a significant decrease in tumour tissue high energy phosphates. Acute starvation decreased DNA-synthesis and tumour energy charge as well as its PCr/Pi which were rapidly normalised during subsequent refeeding. These changes were related to similar alterations in tumour blood flow. The inorganic phosphate (Pi) resonance and the resonances in the phosphomonoester (PME) region were considerably increased in tumour tissue. Inhibition of ODC-activity by DFMO decreased DNA-synthesis, which was associated with a secondary increase in tumour high energy phosphates probably due to a lowered energy demand for tumour cell division. The results demonstrate that host undernutrition was translated into retarded tumour growth associated with a decrease in the energy state and blood flow of the tumour. The results have bearing for the evaluation and planning of all treatment protocols with potential influence on food intake in experimental tumour-bearing animals...|$|R
