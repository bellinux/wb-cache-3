25|$|The {{remaining}} eight crewmen {{clung to}} the wreckage throughout the night but by dawn the next morning, Captain Bell and seaman Bill Cunningham had succumbed to hypothermia and died, still afloat nearby in their life-jackets. Through the sea mist Norris spotted a beach several miles off. It was decided that each man should try {{to make his own}} way to shore, and so at intervals of maybe 15 minutes one-by-one the men left the floating planks and struck-out for the beach. Nagle, who didn't have a <b>life-jacket,</b> went first, followed by Thomsen and Fitzsimmons. After about an hour Fizsimmons passed the earlier two, still alive but near exhaustion, and at around 10am he stumbled onto Woonona beach where he flagged down a Hubbards Bakery truck driven by a Mr Hobbs, who took him to Bulli Police Station where he broke the news of the shipwreck.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert sent Baralongs 12 Royal Marines, {{under the}} command of a Corporal Collins, to find the {{surviving}} German sailors aboard Nicosian. As they departed, Herbert told Collins, [...] "Take no prisoners." [...] The Germans were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Steele: [...] "Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck -- I later found out it was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea.

60|$|As {{the oars}} {{were about to}} be shipped, one of the crew stumbled, and struck his head so violently against the bollard, that he fell stunned {{into the bottom of the}} boat. Guy saw the {{accident}} as he stood on the edge of the pier. A sudden impulse seized him. At one bound he passed from the pier to the boat, which was already some half-dozen feet away, and took the seat and oar of the injured man. In the confusion and darkness, the others thought he was one of the supernumerary boatmen, and took no further notice of him. The boat was shoved back, the <b>life-jacket</b> was transferred to Guy, and the boatman was put ashore.|$|E
6000|$|Several young women, {{wives of}} some of the men, had {{assembled}} there to dissuade their husbands from going out on such a terrible night. These were so alarmed at the terrific thunder of the surf on the shores of the little bay, and the howling of the wind, that they clung to the men and entreated them with tears not to venture. Is it a matter of wonder that these bold fellows, who could not be appalled by the storm, found it difficult to resist the power of woman's tears? They wavered for a few seconds; but when the coxswain, who was a cool, intrepid old man-of-war's man, cried in a hearty voice, [...] "Now then, lads, look alive; shove off and jump in!" [...] every man sprang to his post, and the lifeboat was afloat in an instant. Through some mismanagement, however, she turned broadside to the sea, was overturned instantly, and rolled over on the beach. The women shrieked; the men on shore ran to the rescue, and fortunately saved every man {{with the exception of the}} one who had refused to put on the <b>life-jacket,</b> and who being less able to support himself than his companions when washed back into deep water by each retiring wave, became at length exhausted and ceased to struggle for life. When he was at last laid hold of and dragged ashore, he was dead.|$|E

50|$|Buoyancy {{aids are}} a {{specialist}} form of personal flotation device (PFD) used most commonly by kayakers, canoeists and dinghy sailors.

Regardless of the specification of buoyancy aids, {{it is important to}} remember that they do not provide (nor are they intended to) the same high level of protection as lifejackets. Therefore, they should not be used as a substitute for a <b>life-jacket,</b> particularly where children are concerned.|$|E

50|$|During a {{disastrous}} full scale rehearsal of the Utah Beach landing on 28 April, Opportune engaged German E-boats which had sighted and engaged eight US landing craft {{on their way}} to the Slapton Sands. The E-boats escaped after deploying a smokescreen, but over 638 US servicemen were killed in their attack. Many casualties were US Army personnel who were not properly trained and had difficulties with the <b>life-jackets</b> and other equipment, and drowned whilst awaiting rescue.

After exiting the boat, his crewmate got {{confused}} with the direction {{to the surface and}} swam horizontally, only to lose himself between the hull and the superstructure. Upon reaching the surface, Machon swam around for roughly 1.5 hours unsuccessfully looking for his partner until an inflated <b>life-jacket</b> was dropped to him from a circling airplane from the 99th bombing squadron.

40|$|The {{maritime}} area dominates the current increasing wave {{of illegal immigration}} to Europe. The Greek islands of the eastern Aegean Sea are the main entrance points of immigrants arriving from the coasts of Turkey. Immigration to the Greek islands is mainly conducted with inflatable boats, which are abandoned upon arrival along the coasts together with other items such as <b>life-jackets,</b> inflatable tubes, and clothing. This novel type of marine litter dominates many beaches and becomes increasingly abundant. Two beaches in Lesvos Island were surveyed for marine litter, and immigration-related items were found to {{account for more than}} 97 % of marine litter by weight.
