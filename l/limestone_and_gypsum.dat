50|$|The main {{components}} of LC3 are clinker, calcined clay, <b>limestone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gypsum.</b> Its manufacturing process involves synergetic hydration. Adding {{large amounts of}} calcined clay and ground limestone to concrete mixtures, the aluminates from the clay interact with the calcium carbonates from the limestone.

50|$|The Magnesian Limestone belt forms {{a narrow}} north- south {{oriented}} strip of undulating {{land on the}} eastern edge of the Pennines overlooking the Vale of York. The magnesian limestone deposits were laid down in an evaporating inland sea in the Permian period. They are made up of a lower layer of dolomite and dolomitic limestone, which form the dominant landscape feature, overlain by red mudstone with gypsum. The upper layer is made of a similar sequence. There are numerous swallow holes caused by the underground dissolution of <b>limestone</b> <b>and</b> <b>gypsum.</b> The sequence can be seen clearly where it is cut by rivers in the Nidd gorge at Knaresborough, the Wharfe valley at Wetherby and the Don gorge near Doncaster. The York and Escrick glacial moraines swing north and merge north of Wetherby to cover the magnesian limestone with glacial deposits. In the Bedale area and northwards, these deposits are so extensive as to mask the limestone topography. South of Wetherby there is only a thin layer of glacial deposits overlying the limestone. The soils here are from the limestone and clay deposits and are generally very fertile.|$|E
