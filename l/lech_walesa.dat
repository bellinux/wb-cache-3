5|$|In 1983, Wałęsa {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize. Since then he has {{received}} more than 30 state decorations and more than 50 awards from 30 countries, including Order of the Bath (UK), Order of Merit (Germany), Legion of Honour (France) and European Human Rights Prize (EU 1989). In 2011, he declined to accept the Lithuanian highest order, citing his displeasure at Lithuania's policy towards the Polish diaspora. In 2008, he established the <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> Award.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter of}} support from 120 members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and draconian. On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in a show of support for the group. Attending the trial, British MP and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin urging him to pardon the women.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, the {{shipyard}} workers began their strike, {{organized by the}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża). The workers were led by electrician <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa,</b> a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at {{the shipyard}} late {{in the morning of}} August 14. The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wałęsa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other social concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of independent trade unions.|$|E
50|$|He {{lost his}} brother, Przemyslaw, 43 (born 1974), <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> third son, a border guard, {{who lived in}} the Morena {{district}} in Gdańsk, on Sunday, 8 January 2017.|$|R
50|$|Also {{in a press}} {{statement}} from President <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> press secretary on 21 September 1994, to Dziennik Polski Wieniawa-Dłogoszowski {{was referred to as}} one of the legitimate Presidents in Exile.|$|R
25|$|In the {{elections}} to the Contract Sejm on 4 June 1989 {{he became a}} member of parliament for <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> Solidarity Citizens' Committee electoral register, as a candidate for the city of Bytom.|$|R
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa,</b> future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it to cut back on its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|He {{was honored}} {{with a state}} funeral on 11 February 2015 at Berlin Cathedral. Eulogies were given by {{incumbent}} president Joachim Gauck, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) and former {{vice president of the}} Bundestag Antje Vollmer (Green Party). Steinmeier praised Weizsäcker's role in foreign relations, where he had worked towards reconciliation with France and Poland and supported a dialogue with the communist regimes in the East, often against his own party. The funeral was attended by many serving high-ranking politicians in Germany, including chancellor Angela Merkel. Also in attendance were former presidents Roman Herzog, Horst Köhler, and Christian Wulff, as well as former chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schröder. Princess Beatrix, former Queen of the Netherlands, was also present, as was former Polish president <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa.</b> After the ceremony, soldiers stood to attention as Weizsäcker's coffin was brought to its resting place at Waldfriedhof Dahlem. In the subsequent days, many Berliners visited Weizsäcker's grave to pay tribute and lay down flowers.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa,</b> the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw {{was seen as a}} symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum where it is now on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a kilim embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E
50|$|The Solidarity Party was an American {{political}} {{party in the}} state of Illinois. It was named after <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> Solidarity movement in Poland, which was widely-admired in Illinois at the time (Illinois has a very large Polish American population, especially around Chicago).|$|R
50|$|Their first {{performance}} {{was during the}} music festival in Sopot, Poland, in 1992. Staszewski then shocked the audience, singing the song 100 000 000, {{which was based on}} <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> presidential campaign unfulfilled promise that all Poles would be given 100 million złotys. In chorus, Staszewski repeats: Wałęsa, give me my 100 million, Wałęsa, give us our 100 million.|$|R
50|$|While in Warsaw, Nissenson {{was asked}} by CBS Network News to cover <b>Lech</b> <b>Walesa's</b> Solidarity Movement and ensuing labor strikes {{which led to the}} democratization of Poland. Nissenson's series of reports, Poland: Changing Nation, {{received}} a George Foster Peabody Award (television's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize) just two months after she had begun her first full-time on-air reporting job.|$|R
5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a sit-down {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa,</b> a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E
25|$|In September 1986, <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> {{created the}} first public and legal Solidarity {{structure}} since the declaration of martial law, the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarity (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność), with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki, and Józef Pinior. In October 1987, the Country Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarity (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created by <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> (chairman), Zbigniew Bujak, Jerzy Dłużniewski, Władysław Frasyniuk, Stefan Jurczak, Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Milczanowski, Janusz Pałubicki, Stanisław Węglarz.|$|E
25|$|Former {{president}} of Poland and {{cofounder of the}} Polish Solidarity Movement, <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa,</b> has expressed his support for Occupy Wall Street and is considering {{a visit to the}} site.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Jaruzelski {{resigned}} as Poland's president and was succeeded by Wałęsa, {{who won the}} 1990 presidential elections. <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> inauguration as president took place on 22 December 1990; he accepted the prewar presidential insignia from the stepping down President-in-Exile Ryszard Kaczorowski, distancing himself from Wojciech Jaruzelski. Wałęsa defeated Mazowiecki {{and in the second}} round Stanisław Tymiński, but under his presidency economic policy remained unchanged.|$|R
25|$|In 1988 {{he became}} an adviser of <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> {{informal}} Coordination Committee, and later he {{became a member of}} the Solidarity Citizens' Committee. He took an active part in planning and preliminary negotiations for the Round Table Talks in 1989, in which he also participated. Adam Michnik inspired and collaborated with the editors of the Ulam Quarterly prior to 1989 that journal pioneered the World Wide Web in the USA.|$|R
5000|$|A social democrat by conviction, Malinowski was an {{opponent}} of communism for his entire life. During the 1980s, Malinowski provided aid to <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> Solidarity movement in Poland via the Polish Relief Program, and also provided financial support to Polish refugees living in Austria. In 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for being [...] "instrumental in organizing the Polish Relief Fund during the early 1980s".|$|R
25|$|This {{management}} decision enraged the workers, who {{staged a}} strike action on 14 August, defending Anna Walentynowicz, and demanding her return. In early {{coverage of the}} Gdańsk strike by Western press, (which was permitted into the shipyard), Anna Walentynowicz is mentioned earlier than <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa.</b> She also headed {{the list of the}} strike committee of the Gdańsk shipyard typed by <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa.</b> On the third day of the strike, 16 August 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> and others announced the end of the strike. The women of the shipyard, Anna Waletynowicz and Alina Pienkowska, are credited in most eye-witness accounts for transforming a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments. Walentynowicz and Pienkowska managed to close the gates of the shipyard and keep some workers inside, but many workers went home, only to return by the next day.|$|E
25|$|To {{commemorate the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Gorbachev {{accompanied}} former Polish leader <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a celebration in Berlin on 9 November 2009.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, ten Nobel Peace Prize laureates, {{including}} Desmond Tutu and <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa,</b> urged Saudi Arabia to {{stop the}} executions of 14 young people for participating in the 2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{movements}} {{that led to}} capitalist counter-revolution such Boris Yeltsin's 1991 coup in the USSR and <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> Solidarność in Poland, these previous movements were not seen as having stated capitalist goals and were not seen as hostile to socialism. As such the Trotskyist movement opposed the 1956 invasion of Hungary, the 1969 invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Tiananmen Square massacre as the crimes of Stalinist governments.|$|R
50|$|From September 1939 to March 1945, Bartoszewski {{held the}} {{position}} of Ambassador of the Polish Republic to Austria. On 28 April 1995, he delivered a speech during the solemn joint session of the Bundestag and Bundesrat {{on the occasion of}} the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II as the only foreign speaker. On 22 December 1995, he resigned from his office due to the end of <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> presidential term.|$|R
5000|$|A {{manifesto}} entitled [...] "Development through Democracy" [...] {{issued by}} the party in February 2005 was signed by {{a broad range of}} Polish intellectuals and artists, including Paweł Huelle (writer), Marek Edelman (physician, last surviving leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Rising), Agnieszka Holland (director), Marek Kondrat (actor), Kazimierz Kutz (director), Jan Miodek (linguist), Daniel Olbrychski (actor), Jerzy Pilch (writer), Henryk Samsonowicz (historian), Jerzy Szacki (sociologist). <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> son Jarosław Wałęsa also signed the manifesto.|$|R
25|$|In Berlin on 9 November 2009, giant dominoes were toppled in a 20th-anniversary {{commemoration}} {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. Former Polish president and Solidarity leader <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> set the toppling in motion.|$|E
25|$|Delbarton {{has made}} many efforts {{to open up}} the student body to the {{international}} community. Over the past few years many respectable speakers have spoken to the student body including Dith Pran and <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Solidarity was legalized {{again in}} the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa</b> and his Komitet Obywatelski Solidarność in 1988. From February to April 1989, he participated in the Round Table talks.|$|E
5000|$|Nie wierzcie elektrykom (Polish Don't {{trust the}} electricians) {{is the second}} studio album of the punk rock band Big Cyc, {{released}} in 1991. The title is a pun on [...] "Don't trust the politicians" [...] and it alludes to <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> profession. The president of Poland was also depicted on the cover in a rather iconoclastic way, dressed in a jacket with a Playboy badge (as opposed to Virgin Mary badge, actually worn by Wałęsa). The album emulated a radio show, the songs being separated by nonsense dialogues of two [...] "hosts", Skiba and Paweł [...] "Konjo" [...] Konnak.|$|R
5000|$|Vermeulen studied {{graphic arts}} at the Sint-Lucas School of Architecture in Ghent and Brussels. He debuted in 1970, working for the {{magazine}} Humo, where he drew both comics ("Balthazar de Groene Steenvreter" [...] ("Balthasar the Green Stone Eater") and [...] "Piet Peuk" [...] ("Pete Stub")), as well as cover illustrations, caricatures and illustrations to articles. When Humo published books or CDs, Meulen often provided the cover illustration. In 1983 Humo won a Gold Award for a magazine cover created by Meulen about the visit of pope John-Paul II to Poland, which featured {{a photograph of the}} pope sporting <b>Lech</b> <b>Walesa's</b> moustache.|$|R
50|$|The Senate {{was only}} {{reestablished}} after the agreement struck between the Communists and Solidarity in 1989. During the first {{election to the}} newly reestablished senate in 1989 the future-president <b>Lech</b> <b>Wałęsa's</b> Solidarity Movement won 99 of the 100 seats being contested, with the final seat being taken by an independent. This enormous size of this defeat greatly embarrassed the ruling Polish United Workers' Party and hastened their exit from power, thus {{paving the way for}} the establishment of a democratic Poland and the foundation of the third republic, in which the Senate was to become a permanent upper house of the new bicameral legislature.|$|R
