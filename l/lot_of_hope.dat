But there’s a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, {{a firm grip on}} the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema."

[...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope,</b> and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E

[...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode three stars out of five and wrote that [...] "The deadpan goofiness remains fresh enough to keep fans interested" [...] and that [...] "the fact that this whole drama doesn't feel new and shiny anymore isn't anyone's fault. ... All The Office needs to do now is march out proudly random, zany and off-center." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it [...] "didn't give me a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> for a last-minute resurgence".
