40|$|A {{range of}} tasks related to {{increasing}} efficiency of <b>learning</b> process and <b>testing</b> {{by means of}} information technologies and automation of those processes come under review in this article. Efficiency of <b>learning</b> and <b>testing</b> using traditional methods vs. analogous methods utilizing personal computers is compared. It is stated that utilizing computer enables to eliminate certain shortcomings of traditional <b>learning</b> and <b>testing</b> methods. Basic technological steps of <b>learning</b> and <b>testing</b> associated with using “Auto-Examinator” computer-based <b>learning,</b> <b>testing</b> software package are reviewed. Conclusions on benefits of use of computer-based <b>learning</b> and <b>testing</b> software for both teachers and students are drawn. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on people that {{were involved in the}} Vietnam War or the Holocaust, returning Iraq soldiers and people that also suffered from rape and childhood abuse. Different tests were administered such as the Selective Reminding Test, Verbal <b>Learning</b> <b>Test,</b> Paired Associate Recall, the California Verbal New <b>Learning</b> <b>Test,</b> and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test. [...] The test results showed that the returning Iraq soldiers did have less verbal memory performance as compared to pre-deployment.|$|E

5000|$|Exploratory {{testing is}} an {{approach}} to software testing that is concisely described as simultaneous <b>learning,</b> <b>test</b> design and test execution. Cem Kaner, who coined the term in 1984, defines exploratory testing as [...] "a style of software testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by treating test-related <b>learning,</b> <b>test</b> design, test execution, and test result interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel throughout the project." ...|$|E

50|$|Caffeine’s {{effects in}} memory were also {{investigated}} in the auditory system. The Auditory-Verbal <b>Learning</b> <b>Test</b> is a memory test that assesses recall of lists of words on single and multiple trials given through the subjects' auditory system. Caffeine subjects recalled fewer words than did control subjects, and caffeine subjects showed a greater deficit in recalling the middle- to end-portions of the lists.|$|E

50|$|The California Verbal <b>Learning</b> <b>Test</b> (CVLT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used neuropsychological tests in North America. It is a {{relatively}} new approach to clinical psychology and computer science. It is a measure of episodic verbal learning and memory, which demonstrates sensitivity to a range of clinical conditions. The test does this by attempting to link memory deficits with impaired performance on specific tasks. It assesses encoding, recall and recognition in a single modality of item presentation (auditory-verbal). The CVLT is considered to be a more sensitive measure of episodic memory than other verbal learning tests. It was designed to not only measure how much a subject learned but also show the strategies they used and ultimately what kind of errors they made. The CVLT measures free and cued recall, serial position effects (including primacy and recency), semantic clustering, intrusions, interference and recognition. Delis et al. (1994) released the California Verbal <b>Learning</b> <b>Test</b> for Children (CVLT-C). The California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) is an updated version of the original CVLT, which has been standardised and provides normative data.|$|E

5000|$|The California Verbal Learning Test-II is {{an updated}} version of the {{original}} California Verbal <b>learning</b> <b>Test.</b> The original CVLT was normed on a 'reference sample' of 273 nonclinical subjects. The original test had often been criticised as being biased towards individuals of higher education and functioning, as well as reflecting a narrow range of memory performance. The conclusion that was reached was that it provided valuable qualitative information, but it failed to provide normative data ...|$|E
50|$|In {{a verbal}} <b>learning</b> <b>test</b> that {{consisted}} of words and non-words, background music had no significant impact on test performance. Participants studied with original excerpts in which tempo and consonance (in or out of tune) were manipulated, nondescript noise, and silence. While test performance did not differ across these conditions, stronger EEG readings were registered with consonant and fast music. This suggests music may draw more cognitive resources, though increased cortical activation compensates to preserve task performance.|$|E
50|$|The core {{curriculum}} at Thomas More College {{is similar to}} a Great Books program. Students read the great works of Western literature, philosophy, and political science in their entirety rather than as a collection of excerpts. Students earn a B.A. degree in Liberal Arts without a major concentration. Part of the sophomore year is spent in Rome, Italy. For admissions to the college, Thomas More College accepts the Classic <b>Learning</b> <b>Test</b> (CLT) as alternatives to the SAT and ACT.|$|E

50|$|Explicit memory (declarative memory) {{refers to}} all {{memories}} that are consciously available. These are encoded by the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, but consolidated and stored elsewhere. The precise location of storage is unknown, but the temporal cortex {{has been proposed}} as a likely candidate. Research by Meulemans and Van der Linden (2003) found that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit <b>learning</b> <b>tests</b> than did healthy controls. However, these same amnesiac patients performed {{at the same rate}} as healthy controls on implicit <b>learning</b> <b>tests.</b> This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning.|$|R
