60|$|The interlocutors did {{not part}} till after a {{prolonged}} pause, during which much {{seemed to be}} said. When Melbury and Grace resumed their walk it was with something of a <b>lighter</b> <b>tread</b> than before.|$|R

60|$|The {{passage in}} which Dick and Joanna now found {{themselves}} was narrow, dirty, and short. At {{the other end}} of it, a door stood partly open; the same door, without doubt, that they had heard the man unlocking. Heavy cobwebs hung from the roof, and the paved flooring echoed hollow under the <b>lightest</b> <b>tread.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} a {{familiar}} voice, lightly humming, was borne along the passage; the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> of a familiar foot was approaching. The editor turned quickly towards the open door,--so quickly that Mr. Bowers was fain to turn also.|$|E
6000|$|Oliver and Elizabeth {{approached}} the graves with a <b>light</b> <b>tread,</b> unheard {{by the old}} hunter, whose sunburnt face was working, and whose eyes twinkled as if something impeded their vision. After some little time Natty raised himself slowly from the ground, and said aloud: ...|$|E
60|$|In reality she {{had been}} there only a few minutes--although they seemed hours to her--when she heard the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> of moccasined feet on the moss behind her. Starting up with a cry of joy she turned and {{looked up into the}} {{astonished}} face of Alfred Clarke.|$|E
6000|$|I {{move away}} as the music rolls: [...] The place seems not to mind [...] That she--of old The {{brightest}} of its native souls - [...] Left it behind! Over this green aforedays she [...] On <b>light</b> <b>treads</b> went and came, [...] Yea, times untold; Yet none here knows her history - [...] Has heard her name.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the wide}} slot of the pursued came out upon the high-road from Holywood; it was there, for a moment, indistinguishable; and, where it once more {{plunged into the}} unbeaten snow upon the farther side, Dick was {{surprised}} to see it narrower and <b>lighter</b> <b>trod.</b> Plainly, profiting by the road, Sir Daniel had begun already to scatter his command.|$|R
50|$|Although {{similar to}} a small grey wolf, the golden jackal is {{distinguished}} by a more slender build, a narrower, more pointed muzzle, a shorter tail, and a <b>lighter</b> <b>tread.</b> Its winter fur also differs from a wolf's by its more fulvous-reddish colour. Despite its name, the golden jackal is not closely related to black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead {{more closely related to}} grey wolves, coyotes, and Ethiopian wolves. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both grey and African wolves.|$|R
60|$|Hengler made no reply, but glided silently away. One {{by one the}} {{men came}} up with the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> of cats, and manned the walls, keeping well under cover of the parapet--each taking his {{appointed}} station beside his particular pile of stones and sheaf of arrows, which lay on the platform, while below a man with a bow was stationed at every slit.|$|E
6000|$|How {{different}} {{the picture}} in her mind, from Caleb, as he sat observing her! She had spoken of his free step. She was right in that. For years and years he had never once crossed that threshold at his own slow pace, but with a footfall counterfeited for her ear; and never had he, when his heart was heaviest, forgotten the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> that was to render hers so cheerful and courageous! ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went upstairs}} at last but I ascended {{no higher than}} the sala. The door of Miss Bordereau's {{apartment}} was open, showing from the parlor the dimness of a poor candle. I went toward it with a <b>light</b> <b>tread,</b> {{and at the same}} moment Miss Tita appeared and stood looking at me as I approached. [...] "She's better--she's better," [...] she said, even before I had asked. [...] "The doctor has given her something; she woke up, came back to life while he was there. He says there is no immediate danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{cablegram}} {{was actually}} gone home! {{the thought of}} it gave him an immense uplift. He walked with a <b>lighter</b> <b>tread.</b> His heart was full of happiness. He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself that he was glad through and through {{that he was going to}} give up this experiment and go back to his home again. His eagerness to get his father's answer began to grow, now, and it grew with marvelous celerity, after it began. He waited an hour, walking about, putting in his time as well as he could, but interested in nothing that came under his eye, and at last he presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer had come yet. The boy said, ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had started}} at a real sound, {{and the sound}} was {{on the steps of}} the cart. It was the <b>light</b> hurried <b>tread</b> of a child, coming clambering up. That tread of a child had once been so {{familiar}} to me, that for half a moment I believed I was a-going to see a little ghost.|$|R
5000|$|... 'The {{trees are}} in their autumn beauty,The {{woodland}} paths are dry,Under the October twilight the waterMirrors a still sky;Upon the brimming water among the stonesAre nine-and-fifty swans.The nineteenth autumn has come upon meSince I first made my count; I saw, before I had well finished, All suddenly mount And scatter wheeling in great broken rings Upon their clamorous wings.I have looked upon those brilliant creatures, And now my heart is sore. All's changed since I, hearing at twilight, The first time on this shore, The bell-beat of their wings above my head,Trod with a <b>lighter</b> <b>tread.</b> Unwearied still, lover by lover, They paddle in the cold Companionable streams or climb the air; Their hearts have not grown old; Passion or conquest, wander where they will,Attend upon them still.But now they drift on the still water, Mysterious, beautiful; Among what rushes will they build,By what lake's edge or poolDelight men's eyes when I awake some day To find they have flown away? ...|$|R
60|$|We stood listening, with {{a strange}} anxiety, to the various noises that awoke in the silent house: the sound of doors opening and closing, the sound of feet near at hand and farther off. It was plain the arrival of my cousin {{was a matter of}} moment, almost of parade, to the household. And suddenly, out of this {{confused}} and distant bustle, a rapid and <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> became distinguishable. We heard it come upstairs, draw near along the corridor, pause at the door, and a stealthy and hasty rapping succeeded.|$|E
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} the next night, and Hetty Torrance and Miss Schuyler sat talking {{in their little}} sitting-room. Torrance was away, but his married foreman, who had seen service in New Mexico, and his wife, slept in the house, and Cedar Range was {{strongly}} guarded. Now and then, the bitter wind set the door rattling, {{and there was a}} snapping in the stove; but when the gusts passed the ranch seemed very still, and Miss Schuyler could hear the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> of the armed cow-boy who, perhaps to keep himself warm, paced up and down the hall below. There was another at a window in the corridor, and one or two more on guard in the stores and stables.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a welcome}} change in the weather when I rose early next morning; the sky was without cloud and had that purity in its colour and look of {{infinite}} distance seen only when the atmosphere is free from vapour. The sun had not yet risen, but old Nuflo was already among the ashes, {{on his hands and}} knees, blowing the embers he had uncovered to a flame. Then Rima appeared only to pass through the room with quick <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> to go out of the door without a word or even a glance at my face. The old man, after watching at the door for a few minutes, turned and began eagerly questioning me about my adventures on the previous evening. In reply I related to him how the girl had found me in the forest lost and unable to extricate myself from the tangled undergrowth.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{it came to}} an end. There was a {{sound of}} doors being quickly opened and shut, voices in the hall, and then a <b>light,</b> firm <b>tread,</b> {{crossing}} the main portion of the room. They both glanced toward the curtains, {{and there was a}} second's expectancy. Then they were thrown on one side with a hasty movement, and a tall dark woman in a long traveling cloak swept through them.|$|R
60|$|Among {{other things}} he {{observed}} that she was often anxious when it rained. If, after a wet day, a golden streak appeared in the sky over Deadman's Bay, under a lid of cloud, her manner was joyous and her <b>tread</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hist shed no tear at parting. She was {{sustained}} by the high resolution of one who had decided on her course, but her dark eyes were luminous with the feelings that glowed within, and her pretty countenance beamed {{with an expression of}} determination that was in marked and singular contrast to its ordinary gentleness. It was but a minute ere the Delaware advanced to the side of his friend with the <b>light,</b> noiseless <b>tread</b> of an Indian.|$|R
60|$|She went on her {{way across}} the fields, {{sometimes}} above the fog, sometimes below it, not much perplexed by its presence except when the track was so indefinite that it {{ceased to be a}} guide to the next stile. The dampness was such that innumerable earthworms lay in couples across the path till, startled even by her <b>light</b> <b>tread,</b> they withdrew suddenly into their holes. She kept clear of all trees. Why was that? There was no danger of lightning on such a morning as this. But though the roads were dry the fog had gathered in the boughs, causing them to set up such a dripping as would go clean through the protecting handkerchief like bullets, and spoil the ribbons beneath. The beech and ash were particularly shunned, for they dripped more maliciously than any. It was an instance of woman's keen appreciativeness of nature's moods and peculiarities: a man crossing those fields might hardly have perceived that the trees dripped at all.|$|E
60|$|The {{reader will}} readily imagine {{the state of}} mind, with which such a being watched the distant form of a husband, engaged in a duty like that we have described. Notwithstanding the {{influence}} of long habit, the forest was rarely approached, after night-fall, by the boldest woodsman, without some secret consciousness that he encountered a positive danger. It was the hour when its roaming and hungry tenants {{were known to be}} most in motion; and the rustling of a leaf, or the snapping of a dried twig beneath the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> of the smallest animal, was apt to conjure images of the voracious and fire-eyed panther, or perhaps of a lurking biped, which, though more artful, was known to be scarcely less savage. It is true, that hundreds experienced the uneasiness of such sensations, who were never fated to undergo the realities of the fearful pictures. Still, facts were not wanting to supply sufficient motive for a grave and reasonable apprehension.|$|E
6000|$|Of all the Federal Army on {{that summer}} morning none had {{accepted}} battle more joyously than Anderton Graffenreid. His spirit was buoyant, his faculties were riotous. He {{was in a}} state of mental exaltation and scarcely could endure the enemy's tardiness in advancing to the attack. To him this was opportunity--for the result he cared nothing. Victory or defeat, as God might will; in one or in the other he should prove himself a soldier and a hero; he should vindicate his right to the respect of his men and the companionship of his brother officers--to the consideration of his superiors. How his heart leaped in his breast as the bugle sounded the stirring notes of the [...] "assembly"! With what a <b>light</b> <b>tread,</b> scarcely conscious of the earth beneath his feet, he strode forward at the head of his company, and how exultingly he noted the tactical dispositions which placed his regiment in the front line! And if perchance some memory came to him of a pair of dark eyes that might take on a tenderer light in reading the account of that day's doings, who shall blame him for the unmartial thought or count it a debasement of soldierly ardor? ...|$|E
6000|$|That summer-eve {{his heart}} was light: [...] With <b>lighter</b> step he <b>trod</b> the ground: [...] And life was fairer in his sight, [...] And music was in every sound: [...] He blessed the world where there could be [...] So {{beautiful}} a thing as she.|$|R
6000|$|At {{last she}} started from a {{somewhat}} sounder doze than usual, {{and saw it}} was becoming light, the white summits of the mountains were beginning to show themselves, and there was twilight in the room. Just then she heard a <b>light,</b> cautious <b>tread</b> in the passage; the lock of Guy's dressing-room was gently, slowly turned. It was over then! Life or death? Her heart beat as she heard her husband's step in the next room, and her suspense would let her call out nothing but--'I am not asleep!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Devine {{appeared}} a trifle uncertain, {{and her face}} expressed rather resignation than any special desire to make the descent, but she permitted Brooke to assist her down the zig-zag trail, while Barbara followed with <b>light,</b> fearless <b>tread.</b> Once they entered the gully, they could not, however, see the cañon, which, in the elder lady's case, at least, made the climb considerably easier, and they reached the tent without misadventure. The door was triced up to form an outer shelter, and Barbara was a trifle astonished when Brooke signed them to enter.|$|R
60|$|Hetty {{certainly}} had no very distinct {{notions of the}} localities, but she found {{her way to the}} beach, which she reached {{on the same side of}} the point as that on which the camp had been made. By following the margin of the water, taking a northern direction, she soon encountered the Indian who paced the strand as sentinel. This was a young warrior, and when he heard her <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> coming along the gravel he approached swiftly, though with anything but menace in his manner. The darkness was so intense that it was not easy to discover forms within the shadows of the woods at the distance of twenty feet, and quite impossible to distinguish persons until near enough to touch them. The young Huron manifested disappointment when he found whom he had met; for, truth to say, he was expecting his favourite, who had promised to relieve the ennui of a midnight watch with her presence. This man was also ignorant of English, but he was at no loss to understand why the girl should be up at that hour. Such things were usual in an Indian village and camp, where sleep is as irregular as the meals. Then poor Hetty's known imbecility, as in most things connected with the savages, stood her friend on this occasion. Vexed at his disappointment, and impatient of the presence of one he thought an intruder, the young warrior signed for the girl to move forward, holding the direction of the beach. Hetty complied; but as she walked away she spoke aloud in English in her usual soft tones, which the stillness of the night made audible at some little distance.|$|E
60|$|But see! Roger Conant {{has other}} neighbors within view. Peter Palfrey {{likewise}} has built himself a house, {{and so has}} Balch, and Norman, and Woodbury. Their dwellings, indeed,--such is the ingenious contrivance of this piece of pictorial mechanism,--seem to have arisen, at various points of the scene, even while we {{have been looking at}} it. The forest-track, trodden more and more by the hobnailed shoes of these sturdy and ponderous Englishmen, has now a distinctness which it never could have acquired from the <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> of a hundred times as many Indian moccasins. It will be a street, anon! As we observe it now, it goes onward from one clearing to another, here plunging into a shadowy strip of woods, there open to the sunshine, but everywhere showing a decided line, along which human interests have begun to hold their career. Over yonder swampy spot, two trees have been felled, and laid side by side to make a causeway. In another place, the axe has cleared away a confused intricacy of fallen trees and clustered boughs, which had been tossed together by a hurricane. So now the little children, just beginning to run alone, may trip along the path, and not often stumble over an impediment, unless they stray from it to gather wood-berries beneath the trees. And, besides the feet of grown people and children, there are the cloven hoofs of a small herd of cows, who seek their subsistence from the native grasses, and help to deepen the track of the future thoroughfare. Goats also browse along it, and nibble at the twigs that thrust themselves across the way. Not seldom, in its more secluded portions, where the black shadow of the forest strives to hide the trace of human-footsteps, stalks a gaunt wolf, on the watch for a kid or a young calf; or fixes his hungry gaze on the group of children gathering berries, and can hardly forbear to rush upon them. And the Indians, coming from their distant wigwams to view the white man's settlement, marvel at the deep track which he makes, and perhaps are saddened by a flitting presentiment that this heavy tread will find its way over all the land; and that the wild-woods, the wild wolf, and the wild Indian will alike be trampled beneath it. Even so shall it be. The pavements of the Main Street must be laid over the red man's grave.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had told}} Eugenia that her waiting-woman {{would be in}} the hall, to show her down-stairs; but the large landing outside her door was empty, and Eugenia stood there looking about. She felt irritated; the dying lady had not [...] "la main heureuse." [...] She passed slowly down-stairs, still looking about. The broad {{staircase}} made a great bend, and in the angle was a high window, looking westward, with a deep bench, covered with a row of flowering plants in curious old pots of blue china-ware. The yellow afternoon light came in through the flowers and flickered a little on the white wainscots. Eugenia paused a moment; the house was perfectly still, save for the ticking, somewhere, of a great clock. The lower hall stretched away {{at the foot of the}} stairs, half covered over with a large Oriental rug. Eugenia lingered a little, noticing a great many things. [...] "Comme c'est bien!" [...] she said to herself; such a large, solid, irreproachable basis of existence the place seemed to her to indicate. And then she reflected that Mrs. Acton was soon to withdraw from it. The reflection accompanied her the rest of the way down-stairs, where she paused again, making more observations. The hall was extremely broad, and on either side of the front door was a wide, deeply-set window, which threw the shadows of everything back into the house. There were high-backed chairs along the wall and big Eastern vases upon tables, and, on either side, a large cabinet with a glass front and little curiosities within, dimly gleaming. The doors were open--into the darkened parlor, the library, the dining-room. All these rooms seemed empty. Eugenia passed along, and stopped a moment on the threshold of each. [...] "Comme c'est bien!" [...] she murmured again; she had thought of just such a house as this when she decided to come to America. She opened the front door for herself--her <b>light</b> <b>tread</b> had summoned none of the servants--and on the threshold she gave a last look. Outside, she was still in the humor for curious contemplation; so instead of going directly down the little drive, to the gate, she wandered away towards the garden, which lay to the right of the house. She had not gone many yards over the grass before she paused quickly; she perceived a gentleman stretched upon the level verdure, beneath a tree. He had not heard her coming, and he lay motionless, flat on his back, with his hands clasped under his head, staring up at the sky; so that the Baroness was able to reflect, at her leisure, upon the question of his identity. It was that of a person who had lately been much in her thoughts; but her first impulse, nevertheless, was to turn away; the last thing she desired was to have the air of coming in quest of Robert Acton. The gentleman on the grass, however, gave her no time to decide; he could not long remain unconscious of so agreeable a presence. He rolled back his eyes, stared, gave an exclamation, and then jumped up. He stood an instant, looking at her.|$|E
60|$|Returning {{through the}} same gate by which I had come out, I ascended into the city by a long and steep street, which was paved with bricks set edgewise. This {{pavement}} is common {{in many of the}} streets, which, being too steep for horses and carriages, are meant only to sustain the <b>lighter</b> <b>tread</b> of mules and asses. The more level streets are paved with broad, smooth flag-stones, like those of Florence,--a fashion which I heartily regret to change for the little penitential blocks of Rome. The walls of Siena in their present state, and so far as I have seen them, are chiefly brick; but there are intermingled fragments of ancient stone-work, and I wonder why the latter does not prevail more largely. The Romans, however,--and Siena had Roman characteristics,--always liked to build of brick, a taste that has made their ruins (now that the marble slabs are torn off) much less grand than they ought to have been. I am grateful to the old Sienese for having used stone so largely in their domestic architecture, and thereby rendered their city so grimly picturesque, with its black palaces frowning upon one another from arched windows, across narrow streets, to the height of six stories, like opposite ranks of tall men looking sternly into one another's eyes.|$|R
60|$|Armine {{scrambled}} {{round the}} rock over {{which he had}} fallen, a loose stone having turned with him. He had pulled himself up, but even with an arm round Armine's neck, {{he could not have}} walked a step on even ground, far less on these rough debris, which were painful walking even for the <b>lightest,</b> most springy <b>tread.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} the dark-looking hole in the door quickly sobered me down. All was quiet, however, but on {{entering}} my room, there was a strangeness in the air, and that not due to my landlady's forlorn trumpetings from above. Through the floating vaporous <b>light</b> I <b>trod</b> across to my staircase and was soon in bed. Hardly had my eyes closed when there broke out of the gloom around me a dismal, appalling cry. I soon realized that the creeping horror this caused in me was as nothing {{compared with that of}} the poor beast, lured, no doubt, into the house by Henry, at finding itself beneath a strange roof.|$|R
