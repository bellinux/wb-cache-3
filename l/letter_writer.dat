Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific <b>letter</b> <b>writer,</b> and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{explores the}} {{involvement}} of users and preparers of financial statements {{in the creation of}} an Australian standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs). Originality: This is the first study known to the authors that extends to unlisted entities and that interviews <b>writers</b> of comment <b>letters</b> participating in creating a uniquely-Australian accounting standard. We extend the findings of Georgiou (2004, 2010). Methodology: An online survey was used to poll users and preparers of financial statements. Members of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and comment <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> were interviewed. Findings: Non-participation in the standard setting process is a result of perceived adequate representation by professional or industry bodies, and professed inability to change outcomes. Participants favoured comment letters and lobbying via professional and industry groups. Interviews revealed discussions amongst <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> as well as between <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> and the AASB. Comment <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> admitted to overemphasis of particular positions and game behaviour. Roundtables were seen as necessary and positive by comment <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> and standard setters. Practical and Social implications: This study confirms a variety of methods of participation in standard setting. It affirms the role of professional and industry bodies in the standard setting process, as a counter to apathy and disengagement from the process of users of financial statements. 2 page(s...|$|R
5|$|During {{the great}} dispute between Becket and the king, Foliot was reviled by Becket and his supporters. He acted as an envoy {{for the king}} {{on a number of}} {{diplomatic}} missions related to this dispute and wrote a number of letters against Becket which were circulated widely in Europe. Becket excommunicated Foliot on two occasions, the second of which precipitated the archbishop's martyrdom. For a short period following Becket's death the papacy kept Foliot excommunicate, but he was quickly absolved and allowed to resume his episcopal functions. In addition to his role in the Becket controversy, Foliot often served as a royal judge, and was an active administrator and bishop in his different dioceses. He was a prolific <b>letter</b> <b>writer,</b> and some of his correspondence was collected after his death. He also wrote sermons and biblical commentaries, two of which are extant.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted <b>letter</b> <b>writer</b> and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The <b>letter</b> <b>writer,</b> who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E

These were added for the scene where Bart tries to think of a name for his fictional <b>letter</b> <b>writer,</b> and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E

25|$|The Whitechapel murders were {{featured}} {{heavily in}} the media, and {{attracted the attention of}} Victorian society at large. Journalists, <b>letter</b> <b>writers,</b> and amateur detectives all suggested names either in press or to the police. Most were not and could not be taken seriously. For example, {{at the time of the}} murders, Richard Mansfield, a famous actor, starred in a theatrical version of Robert Louis Stevenson's book Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The subject matter of horrific murder in the London streets and Mansfield's convincing portrayal led <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> to accuse him of being the Ripper.|$|R
25|$|Peter was in Rome in 1179 {{and there}} {{displayed}} the improvidence {{which was to}} become an important feature of his later life. His failure to repay a debt caused Pope Alexander III to write to the Archbishop {{on behalf of the}} creditor. This was a cause célèbre sufficient for inclusion in a compendium of canon law issued in 1234 by Pope Gregory IX. Richard of Dover died in 1184 and, after some delay, the king succeeded in getting Baldwin of Forde, Peter's friend and tutor from his Bologna days, installed as Archbishop of Canterbury. He confirmed Peter in his position as <b>letter</b> <b>writer</b> but also made him his chief legal adviser.|$|E

He founded the University of Virginia after retiring from public office. He was a prolific <b>letter</b> <b>writer</b> and corresponded with many prominent and important people throughout his adult life.

Perhaps his most enduring contribution to literary history is the children's classic The Story of the Three Bears, the original Goldilocks story, first published in Southey's prose collection The Doctor.

25|$|He {{wrote an}} {{unsuccessful}} drama, Le Candidate, and published a reworked version of The Temptation of Saint Anthony, portions {{of which had}} been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, Les Deux Cloportes (The Two Woodlice), which later became Bouvard et Pécuchet, breaking the obsessive project only to write the Three Tales in 1877. This book comprises three stories: Un Cœur simple (A Simple Heart), La Légende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier (The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitaller), and Hérodias (Herodias). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished Bouvard et Pécuchet, which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity. He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific <b>letter</b> <b>writer,</b> and his letters have been collected in several publications.|$|E
25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A <b>letter</b> <b>writer</b> would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.|$|E

40|$|Text in AfrikaansIt {{has become}} clear that the {{continued}} existence of the Afrikaner in the 21 st century will demand a recontextualisation of the identity and values attached to being an Afrikaans-speaking South African in a post-apartheid South Africa. Various institutions and intellectuals are already busy with this process. The study used the social phenomenology of Alfred Schutz to describe and analyse the first steps taken in the recontextualisation of Afrikaner identity from the perspective of <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> to the Afrikaans daily newspaper, Beeld. Phenomenology accepts that the world of everyday life is man's fundamental and pervasive reality. Schutz uses concepts like the social stock of knowledge, typifications and intersubjectivity to explain how people interpret their everyday reality so that it becomes meaningful to themselves and others in communication. The task of the phenomenologist would be to question the taken-for-grantedness of this life world and identify its underlying principles (or essences). The study found that, while the <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> did adjust their typification of the Self, no fundamental review of their typification of the Other (black South Africans) took place. <b>Letter</b> <b>writers</b> managed to free themselves of the baggage of apartheid after De Klerk gave up power in 1990 and declared white South Africa ready for negotiations for a new democratic South Africa. Together with giving up power, <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> also freed themselves from the aspect of Christian-nationalism {{which was one of the}} fundamental building blocks of Afrikanerskap. The Afrikaner of 2004 seems to be a white minority, proud of their language and culture, and fighting for their right to speak and hear Afrikaans. However, no major revision of the Other has taken place. The study will show that <b>letter</b> <b>writers</b> have adjusted their perception of blacks in so far as it became practically relevant to do so for survival in the new South Africa. Very few, if any, fundamental changes took place in terms of the perception of racial or cultural superiority. Communication ScienceM. A. (Communication...|$|R

500|$|Foliot {{was well}} known as a <b>letter</b> <b>writer,</b> and his letters were later {{collected}} as a book. The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the Bodleian Library, {{is supposed to have}} originated in Foliot's own writing office. About 250 to 300examples of Foliot's letters have survived, which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500items. The collection was printed in a modern edition edited by Adrian Morey and Christopher N. L. Brooke and published by the Cambridge University Press in 1967, under the title of The Letters and Charters of Gilbert Foliot. Some of the letters have appeared in volumes five through eight of Materials for the History of Thomas Becket, from the Rolls Series, published from 1875–1885. Older editions appeared in the Patres ecclesiae Anglicanae series from the 1840s, and in Migne's Patrologica from 1854. The letters cover most of the period of Foliot's public life, and are one of the main sources for the history of that period. The historian David Knowles said of the collection that [...] "owing to its wealth of personal and local detail [...] is of the greatest value for the church historian". According to Knowles, Foliot's letters paint a picture of an active bishop and ecclesiastical leader who supported the Gregorian church reforms but did not meddle in politics beyond those of the church. His letters are typical of the educated <b>letter</b> <b>writer</b> of his time, refined and polished to an art form.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] is {{a generic}} name {{used in the}} United Kingdom for a person, usually with {{strongly}} conservative political views, who writes letters to newspapers or the BBC {{in a tone of}} moral outrage.

The beatings were vicious and later described by one <b>letter</b> <b>writer</b> as [...] "The ministers have used a great deal of barbarous severities to extort confessions from those poor unhappy creatures."
