40|$|The {{parasitoid}} Aphidius gifuensis {{is able to}} parasitize {{both the}} green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> Myzus persicae and the foxglove aphid Aulacorthum solani in sweet pepper. In a greenhouse experiment we showed that rates of parasitism on green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> alone were equal to the commonly used Aphidius colemani, but lower than with Aphidius matricariae. Foxglove aphids were suppressed very effectively by A. gifuensis. In contrast, A. matricariae {{was not able to}} parasitize this aphid. When the two aphid species were offered simultaneously, A. gifuensis suppressed both aphid species, whereas the presence of foxglove aphids had a negative effect on the control of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> by A. matricariae. We conclude that A. gifuensis is a promising candidate for biological control of both foxglove <b>aphids</b> and green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> in sweet pepper, especially when these aphids occur together...|$|R

40|$|The green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzus persicae (Sulzer), is {{an insect}} pest that causes {{extensive}} damage to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) in China. Field trials {{were conducted in}} 2008 and 2009 at Longyan in the Fujian Province (China) to evaluate the effects of garlic (Allium sativum L.) {{as a deterrent to}} green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> and other arthropods when intercropped in flue-cured tobacco fields. This study demonstrated that green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> were affected by intercropping garlic in tobacco fields during the 2 yr studied. The appearance of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> in intercropped tobacco fields was delayed for approximately 7 d by the presence of garlic. Aphid abundance was reduced by 100 % in intercropped fields compared with monocultures, especially when populations peaked (34. 7 - 39. 0 % in 2008 and 42. 0 - 47. 2 % in 2009). Other arthropod populations were not negatively affected by intercropping garlic. Species richness, diversity, and stability of the arthropod communities increased and the dominance concentration index decreased in the intercropped garlic fields. The tobacco mosaic viruses (cucumber mosaic virus, potato virus Y, tobacco etch virus, and tobacco ring-spot virus) transmitted by green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> were decreased by 9. 6 to 42. 4 % in 2008 and by 22. 1 to 27. 9 % in 2009 by intercropping garlic in flue-cured tobacco fields. The net benefits of cropping flue-cured tobacco were also increased by 52. 1 to 80. 2 % by intercropping garlic in the tobacco fields. Therefore, intercropping tobacco with garlic may be useful in deterring green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> and in stabilizing arthropod communities in tobacco...|$|R
5000|$|Green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> are {{difficult}} to control since they reproduce quickly (one adult female can deposit up to four nymphs per day) {{because they tend to}} reside under the leaves and in leaf axils ("leaf armpits"), where they may not be wetted by a soap spray.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The probing {{behavior}} and feeding activity of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzus persicae Sulzer, on Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis- transgenic potatoes, insecticide treated potatoes, and host plants with different preference were electronically monitored. I found that first, transgenic potatoes {{had no effect}} on green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> probing suggesting that transmission of green peach aphid-borne viruses would not be affected. Second, the probing behavior of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> was not modified by the insecticides, aldicarb, Admire, and Di-syston. However, the postfeeding behavior of aphids was different over time and with insecticides, which might have an influence on virus transmission in the field. Third, the probing behavior of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> on host plants with different preference varied. Aphids probed more when they moved from a higher-preference host plant (radish) to a lower preference host plant (potato). In addition, the settling rate was low when aphids were moved from higher to lower preference host plants. This difference might affect virus transmission in the field. Vector efficiency, relationship of virus transmission between vector and host plants, and vector control strategies are discussed. In addition, the probing behavior of two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi, on mice was recorded electronically to examine waveform patterns and to quantify sporozoite output. My studies indicated that sporozoite output of malaria-infected mosquitoes was not detected by using the electronic monitoring system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> and {{associated}} weed populations were monitored continuously from April, 1978 to March, 1979 at three orchards and a drainage ditch. Aphid populations at all sites peaked {{in spring and}} declined in summer. Although natural enemies were most active {{during the period of}} peak aphid abundance, they were not numerous enough to account for population declines at all locations. Green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> population trends appeared {{to be related to the}} abundance and quality of preferred host plants. Two common weed species in the Yakima area, Descurania sophia and Solanum sarachoides, were found to be highly preferred and significant sources of aphid buildup in spring and early summer. In the absence of highly preferred types and during periods of high population density, less preferred species were colonized. Laboratory studies of the green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid's</b> feeding preferences have shown an intrinsic preference for summer host plants as opposed to the winter host in all life stages investigated. In choice chamber tests involving comparisons between 12 common crop and weed species, cruciferous plants were most highly preferred. Solanaceous plants were somewhat less preferred. Observations of settling behavior in these tests revealed no evidence of attraction to preferred hosts. Initial arrival appeared to be at random, and the buildup of aphids on preferred hosts resulted from a lower rate of departure than from non-preferred hosts. Studies of the host selection behavior of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> have shown that aphids initiate probing more quickly, settle and feed more readily, and are less restless on preferred hosts. It was also found that the contents of the trichomes of Chenopodium album have no effect on the host selection behavior of this aphid, although the trichomes themselves may provide a physical barrier early in the life of the plant...|$|R
40|$|The green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzus persicae (Sulzer), {{is found}} {{throughout}} the world, including all areas of North America, where it {{is viewed as a}} pest principally due to its ability to transmit plant viruses.

50|$|PLRV can be {{introduced}} to potatoes by planting infected seeds or by insect vectors. The green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzus persicae) is the primary vector of PLRV. Aphids acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants. The infected phloem is taken up through the aphid stylet into the digestive system. The virus then crosses the membrane of the gut and enters the hemocoel where it then can cross the membrane into the salivary glands.This process takes several hours, after which time the aphid will continue to transmit the virus for its remaining life. This process is known as persistent transmission. In temperate regions, the green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> is able to persist through the winter by laying eggs in woody species of the genus Prunus. Eggs hatch in early spring, and early instar aphids feed on tree phloem until summer, when they switch to more preferred herbacous hosts, including agricultural crops. During this time the green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> can transmit PLRV present in weeds of the family Solanaceae to potatoes and other crops. Potato plants infected with PLRV will produced infected tubers. If infected tubers are planted they will give rise to infected plants. Aphids can also spread PLRV to tubers in storage, especially after they sprout. Winged aphids can be carried several hundred kilometers by wind currents, allowing for widespread infection.|$|R

40|$|Green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzus persicae) and {{pea aphid}} (Acyrthosiphon pisum) are two phylogenetically closely related {{agricultural}} pests. While pea aphid {{is restricted to}} Fabaceae, green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> feeds on hundreds of plant species from more than 40 families. Transcriptome comparison could {{shed light on the}} genetic factors underlying the difference in host range between the two species. Furthermore, a large scale study contrasting gene expression between immature nymphs and fully developed adult aphids would fill a previous knowledge gap. Here, we obtained transcriptomic sequences of green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> nymphs and adults, respectively, using Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 2, 244 genes were found to be differentially expressed between the two developmental stages, many of which were associated with detoxification, hormone production, cuticle formation, metabolism, food digestion and absorption. When searched against publically available pea aphid mRNA sequences, 13, 752 unigenes were found to have no homologous counterparts. Interestingly, many of these unigenes that could be annotated in other databases were involved in the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathway, suggesting the two aphids differ in their adaptation to secondary metabolites of host plants. Conversely, 3, 989 orthologous gene pairs between the two species were subjected to calculations of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, and 148 of the genes potentially evolved in response to positive selection.

40|$|BACKGROUND Polygodial, a {{sesquiterpene}} dialdehyde of the drimane family, {{has been}} shown to have deterrent and antifeedant effects on various insect species, including Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Spodoptera spp. and Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). This compound may have potential as a broad-spectrum biocontrol agent, similar to pyrethrins, given that it was previously reported to improve yield when sprayed on barley fields. RESULTS This study compares the deterrent effect of polygodial and pyrethrins against the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) and the green <b>peach</b> <b>aphid</b> M. persicae in dual-choice assays using compound-coated tomato leaf discs. B. tabaci adults were deterred by polygodial at an ED 50 (effective dose at which 50 % of the insects are deterred) of about 25 µg g- 1 fresh weight (FW), and green <b>peach</b> <b>aphids</b> at about 54 µg g- 1 FW. Bioassays were benchmarked with pyrethrins that had a 20 -fold lower ED 50 of approximately 1. 4 µg g- 1 FW against whiteflies, but only a twofold lower ED 50 (about 28 µg g- 1 FW) against <b>peach</b> <b>aphids.</b> Polygodial showed moderate phytotoxic effects (score of 2 on a scale of 1 – 5) on tomato leaves at concentrations above the ED 50 concentrations (= 90 µg g- 1 FW). CONCLUSION The sesquiterpene dialdehyde polygodial is 2 – 20 times less deterrent than pyrethrins, depending on the insect species, but it could provide a useful complement to pyrethrin sprays as it has a different mode of action, is food grade and has low volatility. However, a formulation that reduces the risks of phytotoxic effects should be developed. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
