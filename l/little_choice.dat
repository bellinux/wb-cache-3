5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> in the decision he made.|$|E

5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that {{this would not be}} sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to have understood the limits of the stop lines and never expected them to hold out indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|George was {{succeeded by}} his son, George Augustus, {{who took the}} throne as George II. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was {{prevented}} from doing so by his queen, Caroline of Ansbach. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to retain him or risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns {{the power of the}} prime minister increased further {{at the expense of the}} power of the sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with Sir Spencer Compton. George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, {{to write his}} first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of Â£800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to retain him or risk ministerial instability. Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 5 {{takes place}} during the 21st century, about {{two months after the}} events of Mega Man 4, when the mad {{scientist}} Dr. Wily once again attempted to take over the world. Proto Man, secret brother and once ally to the world's greatest hero Mega Man, leads an army of robots in a series of destructive attacks on the world. To cripple the world's defenders, he kidnaps his own creator, the genius scientist Dr. Light. Mega Man wonders why Proto Man is doing this, but with <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> left, he sets out to stop him, assisted by Beat, a robot bird gifted to him by Dr. Cossack.|$|E

Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Reachs {{multiplayer}} beta {{was open}} to owners of Halo 3: ODST. More than threemillion copies of ODST were sold by November 2009. Bungie estimated between two and three million players for the upcoming Reach beta, compared to the 800,000 that participated in Halo 3s trial. Development schedules forced Bungie to release a six-week-old beta, fraught with bugs and issues already addressed in newer builds. Though concerned that these issues might tarnish the game's image, Jarrard noted that they had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to ship it as it was and communicate with players concerning the fixes.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{place after}} the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man un{{character}}istically leads a group of menacing robots in {{attacks on the world}} and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving the title character <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to take up arms in a fight against his once trusted sibling. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{building}} skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition {{of the real estate}} needed for the site. Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual lots of land required for a project, operating under a variety of names to avoid having the price increase once a planned build became known. The properties {{at the front of the}} site would typically be bought first, so if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot would have <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but to sell anyway. The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks, insurance companies, or raised through bonds sold through a specialised bond house, with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I.|$|E

5|$|Crusaders' {{arrival at}} Jerusalem {{revealed}} an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here {{there was no}} prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault. They might have been left with <b>little</b> <b>choice,</b> as {{by the time the}} Crusader army reached Jerusalem, {{it has been estimated that}} only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained. These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the ProvenÃ§al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid {{out of both}} of his {{portfolios}} {{and made}} him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets {{and that the government}} create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago's commodity market. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to go along with the}} creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of NewcastleâuponâTyne and Gateshead town centre. This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough. There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are {{at the lower end of}} the spectrum and provide <b>little</b> <b>choice.</b> There is a good provision of hardware stores, fastâfood outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed. The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E
5000|$|Hainanese {{people came}} later than Hokkien and Teochew people. Since {{businesses}} were already dominated by other ethnic groups, the Hainanese people left with <b>little</b> <b>choices</b> but to become helpers of colonial officers and doing household work. They mastered skills of making coffee, kaya, bread, curry, and chicken rice. At first, they sell the food items as mobile vendors but later set up coffee shops at Carpenter Street. The first Siang Ti temple {{was built by}} the Teochews at the Carpenter Street but was razed {{to the ground in}} 1884. A new temple was built in 1889 with Chinese opera theatre (named Yang Choon Tai) built directly opposite the temple. The Chinese Opera was built to hold thanksgiving ceremonies to the deities on the first day and the middle of every month. The theatre is still used to stage Chinese opera to this day especially on the birthday of the deity [...] "Hiang Thian Siang Ti". In the olden days, the Chinese opera was also used as a sanctuary for the homeless who arrived from mainland China. The homeless people could sleep under the stage until they find their own lodging. Back alleys of Carpenter Street was once a warm bed for brothels, opium dens, and gambling houses. The British eventually clear up the illegal activities here.|$|R
