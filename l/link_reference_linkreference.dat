We found that the concordance of <b>linked</b> <b>references</b> between MA and WoS ranges from weak to non-existent for the full sample (publications of the University of Zurich with less than 50 <b>linked</b> <b>references</b> in MA). An analysis with a sample restricted to less than 50 <b>linked</b> <b>references</b> in WoS showed a strong agreement between <b>linked</b> <b>references</b> in MA and WoS. Comment: 6 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Digital Library Research Group at Cornell has <b>Reference</b> <b>Linking</b> {{as one of}} its {{projects}}. Typical projects within in {{the group}} take an object-oriented approach to handling digital information. To support <b>reference</b> <b>linking,</b> therefore, we designed a scheme whereby <b>reference</b> <b>linking</b> information is extracted from archives by surrogate objects and then presented to client applications or users by means of a welldefined API. This paper describes that architecture, the API, and how the API might be supported in the Dienst protocol. 1 Background This report covers the design of a new <b>reference</b> <b>linking</b> service, supported by a DARPA/CNRI grant to intralink D-Lib Magazine and a JISC/NSF grant to intralink the Los Alamos physics E-prints archive, now called arXive. The ultimate goal of this work is not only to intralink these two archives of online literature but to interlink automatically Open Archives[14] and some online journals. What does it mean to "intralink " and "interlink"? <b>Reference</b> <b>Linking</b> is actually an old idea. Classical <b>reference</b> <b>linking</b> arose from a desire to study citation patterns among scholarly articles.
