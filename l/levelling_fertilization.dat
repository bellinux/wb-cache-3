Aims: Through the experience realised at ARDS Turda we follow the behavior of native varieties grȃu autumn, compared ȋn varieties of foreign origin, to make recommendations on their pretability to different systems of culture and <b>levels</b> of <b>fertilization.</b> Materials and Method: The experiment realized at the ARDS Turda, includes two ways to work the soil, a classic conventional system (with autumn ploughing, land preparation, sowing and fertilized) in parallel with the conservative ("no-tillage” with stubble crop directly into the preemergent plant). Experimental factors: A - soil tillage system; B - winter wheat variety; C - fertilization. Results: Of the eight winter wheat varieties, in the experiment is remarkable the variety Capo    that registered highest values of the gluten content at the <b>level</b> of <b>fertilization</b> c 2, c 3 and c 4 at cultivation in both work systems (classic and “no tillage”). At most varieties, the highest protein content is at the c 2 <b>level</b> of <b>fertilization,</b> except Capo and Exotic that react the best at c 3 <b>level</b> of <b>fertilization,</b> in the system "no tillage". Conclusion: The winter wheat  indigenous Andrada, Dumbrava, Arieşan and line T- 29 - 04 and cultivar Renan (Limagrain) reacts most favorable in  gluten content at <b>level</b> of  <b>fertilization</b> c 2 (at sowing 250 kg/ ha NPK 20 : 20 : 0 + resumption spring vegetation ȋn 214 kg/ ha ammonium nitrate). The productions obtained at all varieties wheat,  is not existlarge quantitative differences (200 - 700 kg/ha differences), but  variety Apache, Exotic, Ariesan and Dumbrava had reached over 7, 400 kg / ha.   Acknowledgments: This work {{was supported by a}} grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS – UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE- 2014 - 4 - 0884.   References *** www. ager. press. r...|$|R

The higher moisture regimes showed the greatest increase in percent crude protein with increasing nitrogen fertilizer levels. Chaff and straw values were significantly higher for the dry fallow-normal crop precipitation pattern than for normal fallow-dry crop pattern and significantly higher for the wet fallow-normal crop pattern than for normal fallow-wet crop. Percent in vitro dry matter digestibility also increased under the high moisture precipitation patterns {{and there was a}} positive relationship between <b>fertilization</b> <b>level</b> and digestibility. The digestibility values for chaff and straw were higher for the dry fallow-normal crop precipitation regime over the normal fallow-dry crop only at the higher <b>fertilization</b> <b>levels.</b> Examination of wet fallow-normal crop vs. normal fallow-wet crop showed increased digestibility for the pattern receiving more moisture in the fallow period, also at only the higher <b>fertilization</b> <b>levels.</b> This study indicated that higher moisture regimes resulted in increased straw and chaff yields.

40|$|In flood plains, {{cover crops}} {{are able to}} alter soil {{properties}} and significantly affect rice nutrition and yield. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine soil properties, plant nutrition, and yield of tropical rice cultivated on flood plains after cover crop cultivation with conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage system (NTS) at low and high nitrogen (N) <b>fertilization</b> <b>levels.</b> The experimental design was a randomized block in a split-split-plot scheme with four replications. In the main plots were cover crops [sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea and C. spectabilis), velvet bean (Mucuna aterrima), jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), Japanese radish (Raphanus sativus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) ] and a fallow field. In the subplots were the tillage systems (CT or NTS). The nitrogen <b>fertilization</b> <b>levels</b> in the sub-subplots were (10 kg N ha- 1 and 45 kg N ha- 1). All cover crops except Japanese radish significantly increased mineral soil nitrogen and nitrate concentrations. Sunhemp, velvet bean, and cowpea significantly increased soil ammonium content. The NTS provides higher mineral nitrogen and ammonium content than that by CT. Overall, cover crops provided higher levels of nutrients to rice plants in NTS than in CT. Cover crops provide greater yield than fallow treatments. Rice yield was higher in NTS than in CT, and greater at a higher rather than lower nitrogen <b>fertilization</b> <b>level.</b> 201...|$|R
40|$|Lately it {{is a high}} {{interest}} in the establishing of temporary grasslands, these being considered a valuable source of fodder from the quantitative and qualitative point of view. Temporary grasslands can be established instead of degraded permanent grasslands or in arable lands. In the paper are presented {{the results of the}} research which took place in 2010 and 2011, regarding the fodder evolution of a double factor experience; A factor – mixtures (8 complex mixtures of perennial grasses and legumes and one alfalfa pure crop, considered as a witness),B factor – <b>levels</b> of <b>fertilization</b> (0 N 0 P 2 O 5, 60 N 70 P 2 O 5, 120 N 70 P 2 O 5 kg·ha- 1). In 2010 the highest productions (13. 16 SU t·ha- 1) were obtained at all the cycles from the 5 th mixture composed from red clover and 4 species of grasses Trifolium pratense L., Dactylis glomerata L., Festulolium Asch. & Graebn., Phleum pratense L., Lolium perenne L.). In 2011, mixture number 3, recognized as being recommended for the forest steppe area and composed from Lotus corniculatus L.,Onobrychis viciifolia Scop., Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca pratensis Huds., Bromus inermis Leyss, presented the highest productions (4. 82 t·ha- 1) for the 60 N 70 P 2 O 5 and 120 N 70 P 2 O 5 kg·ha- 1 <b>levels</b> of <b>fertilization...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was based on}} two factors: 4 <b>levels</b> of <b>fertilization</b> with ash from biomass- 0; I- 4. 28; II- 8. 57; III- 12. 85 t∙ha - 1 and 2 <b>levels</b> of <b>fertilization</b> with sewage sludge: 0; 1 - 30. 3 t∙ha - 1. The experimental plant was Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), Gigant cultivar. The contents of nitrogen tended to increase in response to fertilization with sewage sludge and to decrease with a growing dosage of fertilization with biomass ash. The use of municipal sewage sludge as a fertilizer did not produce visible changes in the contents of six macronutrients (carbon, phosphorus, potassium, sulfir, calcium and magnesium) in overground part of Jerusalem artichoke. The use of ash at the dose of 12. 8 t∙ha - 1 resulted {{in an increase in}} potassium contents in the plants, to the level of 5. 63 g K∙kg - 1 {{during the first year of}} trials and the trend was continued in the second year. Biomass chemical stability in 2 -year {{experiment was}} noted except the content of nitrogen, cadmium and lead which were increasing while the level of sewage sludge increased. The content of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in overground part of Jerusalem artichoke did not exceed threshold values defined for wood pellets and briquettes by the standards set forth by DIN 51731 1996 - 10...|$|R
