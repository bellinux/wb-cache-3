2500|$|The [...] "Debacle in Durham" [...] {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} a game between the Miami Hurricanes and the Duke Blue Devils in Durham, NC. Like [...] "The Play", the [...] "Debacle in Durham" [...] was a kickoff return that included multiple laterals, a game-winning touchdown, and controversial officiating. After scoring a touchdown and converting a two-point conversion attempt with :06 left to play, Duke lined up to kick off leading 27–24. The Blue Devils squibbed the kick to the Miami 25-yard line, where it was fielded by the Hurricanes' Dallas Crawford. On the ensuing return, Miami executed a series of eight laterals that brought the ball back as far as its own three yard line. On the fourth <b>lateral,</b> <b>Mark</b> Walton tossed the ball to his left as he was being tackled from behind. Though photographs later showed that Walton's knee hit the turf before he released the ball, the officials did not whistle the play dead. The ball eventually found its way to Corn Elder at the Miami ten yard line. Assisted by two crucial blocks from teammate Greg Golden, Elder sprinted down the Miami sideline with a clear path to the end zone. As Elder crossed the Duke 16 yard line, teammate Artie Burns threw a block against a Duke defender, prompting the line judge to throw a flag. After Elder trotted into the end zone, the officiating crew immediately declared a video review and announced the flag as an illegal block in the back by Miami, which would have negated the touchdown and forced Miami to run a final untimed play from its own 8 yard line. However, after a lengthy review, the officiating crew declared that all of the laterals were legal, that no Miami ball carrier had gone down, and that the illegal block they had initially called was legal. The touchdown thus stood and resulted in a 30–27 Miami victory.|$|E

The new standardised system was ratified in 1980, and the buoyage system remains in international use.|$|R

After the game, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced that the officials had erred and that the final touchdown should not have counted. According to the ACC, the officiating crew had committed two crucial mistakes: 1) they had incorrectly ruled that Walton was not down on the fourth lateral (though it's unclear whether any video footage that clearly showed Walton's knee hitting the turf was available to the replay official), and 2) they reversed the flag they had thrown based on their review of the video footage, which cannot be used to overturn penalties. Although the outcome of the game could not be changed, the ACC suspended the entire officiating crew for two games.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design of}} a computer emulator of human visual search. The emulator mechanism is eventually meant to support ergonomic assessment of the effect of display structure and protocol on search performance. As regards target identification and localization, it mimics a number of characteristics of human search performance under experimental conditions of target/nontarget separability and stimulus complexity. Performance aspects accounted for, include: feature space adaptation, attention orienting and cueing, processing stages in early vision, data-limited and resource-limited processing, automatic and controlled processing, search asymmetry and illusory conjunction, spatial and temporal masking, and disengaged/engaged attentional states. Feature space adaptation results from the (supervised) training for optimized target/nontarget discrimination. In the actual emulation experiments there are three processing modes: Global identity processing, Sectoral-directional emphasis of identity processing, and Local identity processing. The chosen network approach (which was motivated on information theoretical grounds) proved instrumental in our quest for a set of ‘humanoid’ system behaviors that would function as a descriptive framework of visual search performance. Within the task constraints imposed on the human perception and action in the usual experimental setting the emulator may serve as a means to study subject training aspects, input data-limitation (e. g., low input excitation or short exposure time), memory data limitation (e. g., search asymmetries, illusory conjunction), and resource-limitation (e. g., display size, <b>lateral</b> <b>marking),</b> and the effects of self-paced or externally paced shifts of attention...|$|R
