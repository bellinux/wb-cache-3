5000|$|An {{equivalent}} {{definition is}} to find the order of finish that minimizes the size of the <b>largest</b> reversed <b>majority.</b> (In the 'lexicographical order' sense.

(In the example, the order of finish [...] "A, B, C" [...] reverses the 60% who rank C over A.

5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that the <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> of the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo.

The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
