40|$|Most solid {{tumors are}} aneuploid, and many missegregate {{chromosomes}} at high rates in a phenomenon called chromosomal instability (CIN).

To gain {{an insight into}} the cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause the abnormalities occurring in the hybrid medaka, we investigated the behavior of chromosomes and the expression patterns of proteins responsible for the chromosome behavior. The number of chromosomes in the hybrid embryos gradually decreased to nearly half, since abnormal cell division with <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> at anaphase eliminated the chromosomes from the cells. The <b>chromosome</b> <b>lagging</b> occurred at the first cleavage and continued throughout embryogenesis even after the midblastula transition. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analyses revealed that the chromosomes derived from O. hubbsi are preferentially eliminated in both O. latipes–hubbsi and O. hubbsi–latipes embryos. Whole-mount immunocytochemical analyses using antibodies against α-tubulin, γ-tubulin, inner centromere protein, Cdc 20, Mad 2, phospho-histone H 3 and cohesin subunits (SMC 1 α, SMC 3 and Rad 21) showed that the expression patterns of these proteins in the hybrid embryos {{are similar to those}} in the wild-type embryos, except for phospho-histone H 3.

40|$|SummaryChromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) is {{a common}} feature of most human neoplasms and was defined, in a seminal study by Vogelstein and colleagues [1], as persistently elevated rates of whole chromosome mis-segregation. Since then, it was shown that certain errors in mitosis, including defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint [2], sister chromatid cohesion [3], kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments [4, 5], and centrosome number [6] can cause chromosome mis-segregation {{in the form of}} merotelically attached anaphase <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> — <b>chromosomes</b> that <b>lag</b> behind at the spindle equator while all the other chromosomes move toward the spindle poles [7] (Figure 1 A). A recent study has suggested that pre-mitotic replication stress generates partially replicated chromosomes during mitosis, and that this results in both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities through the formation of chromosome bridges and acentric chromosome fragments during anaphase [8]. To determine whether whole chromosome instability in cancer cells is caused by defects originating in mitosis (<b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes)</b> or from ones originating pre-mitotically (chromatin bridges and acentric fragments), we compared a variety of CIN+ to CIN- cells to determine the types of segregation defects that phenotypically distinguish CIN+ from CIN- cells and whose abrogation can rescue whole chromosomal instability...|$|R
40|$|SummarySuccessful {{segregation}} of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis depends on {{the action of the}} ring-shaped condensin complex, but how condensin ensures the complete disjunction of sister chromatids is unknown. We show that the failure to segregate chromosome arms, which results from condensin release from chromosomes by proteolytic cleavage of its ring structure, leads to a DNA damage checkpoint-dependent cell-cycle arrest. Checkpoint activation is triggered by the formation of chromosome breaks during cytokinesis, which proceeds with normal timing despite the presence of <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome</b> arms. Remarkably, enforcing condensin ring reclosure by chemically induced dimerization just before entry into anaphase is sufficient to restore chromosome arm segregation. We suggest that topological entrapment of chromosome arms by condensin rings ensures their clearance from the cleavage plane and thereby avoids their breakage during cytokinesis...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation {{depends on the}} establishment of correct-amphitelic-kinetochore orientation. Merotelic kinetochore orientation is an error that occurs when a single kinetochore attaches to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles, a condition that hinders segregation of the kinetochore to a spindle pole in anaphase. To avoid chromosome missegregation resulting from merotelic kinetochore orientation, cells have developed mechanisms to prevent or correct merotelic attachment. A protein called Pcs 1 has been implicated in preventing merotelic attachment in mitosis and meiosis II in the fission yeast S. pombe. RESULTS: We report that Pcs 1 forms a complex with a protein called Mde 4. Both Pcs 1 and Mde 4 localize to the central core of centromeres. Deletion of mde 4 (+), like that of pcs 1 (+), causes the appearance of <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during the anaphases of mitotic and meiosis II cells. We provide evidence that the kinetochores of <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in both pcs 1 and mde 4 mutant cells are merotelically attached. In addition, we find that <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in cells with defective centromeric heterochromatin also display features consistent with merotelic attachment. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the Pcs 1 /Mde 4 complex is the fission yeast counterpart of the budding yeast monopolin subcomplex Csm 1 /Lrs 4, which promotes the segregation of sister kinetochores to the same pole during meiosis I. We propose that the Pcs 1 /Mde 4 complex acts in the central kinetochore domain to clamp microtubule binding sites together, the centromeric heterochromatin coating the flanking domains provides rigidity, and both systems contribute to the prevention of merotelic attachment...|$|R

HBV encodes a small protein, known as HBx, which is required for infection and has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Here we show that HBx induces <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during mitosis, which in turn leads to formation of aberrant mitotic spindles and multinucleated cells. These effects require the binding of HBx to UV-damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB 1), a protein involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, and are unexpectedly attributable to HBx interfering with S-phase progression and not directly with mitotic events. HBx also affects S-phase and induces <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> when expressed from its natural viral context and, consequently, exhibits deleterious activities in dividing, but not quiescent, hepatoma cells.

40|$|Gain or loss {{of whole}} {{chromosomes}} is often observed in cancer cells and {{is thought to be}} due to aberrant chromosome segregation during mitosis. Proper chromosome segregation depends on a faithful interaction between spindle microtubules and kinetochores. Several components of the nuclear pore complex/nucleoporins play critical roles in orchestrating the rapid remodeling events that occur during mitosis. Our recent studies revealed that the nucleoporin, Rae 1, plays critical roles in maintaining spindle bipolarity. Here, we show association of another nucleoporin, termed Tpr (translocated promoter region), with the molecular motors dynein and dynactin, which both orchestrate with the spindle checkpoints Mad 1 and Mad 2 during cell division. Overexpression of Tpr enhanced multinucleated cell formation. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Tpr caused a severe <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome</b> phenotype and disrupted spindle checkpoint proteins expression and localization. Next, we performed a series of rescue and dominant negative experiments to confirm that Tpr orchestrates proper chromosome segregation through interaction with dynein light chain.

40|$|SummaryDuring mitosis, equal {{segregation}} of chromosomes depends on proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Merotelic kinetochore orientation, in which a single kinetochore binds microtubules from both spindle poles [1], is a major cause of chromosome instability [2], which is commonly observed in solid tumors [3, 4]. Using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we show that a proper force balance between kinesin motors on interpolar spindle microtubules is critical for correcting merotelic attachments. Inhibition of the plus-end-directed spindle elongation motors kinesin- 5 (Cut 7) and kinesin- 6 (Klp 9) reduces spindle length, tension at kinetochores, {{and the frequency of}} merotelic attachments. In contrast, merotely is increased by deletion of the minus-end-directed kinesin- 14 (Klp 2) or overexpression of Klp 9. Also, Cdk 1 regulates spindle elongation forces to promote merotelic correction by phosphorylating and inhibiting Klp 9. The role of spindle elongation motors in merotelic correction is conserved, because partial inhibition of the human kinesin- 5 homolog Eg 5 using the drug monastrol reduces spindle length and <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome</b> frequency in both normal (RPE- 1) and tumor (CaCo- 2) cells. These findings reveal unexpected links between spindle forces and correction of merotelic attachments and show that pharmacological manipulation of spindle elongation forces might be used to reduce chromosome instability in cancer cells...|$|E

To perform the anaphase-telophase test, cells were cultured in cover glasses and treated 8 h before fixation with the same chemicals. An extra dose of CC (4 m M) was used in this test. Both metal salts significantly increased chromosomal aberration frequencies in relation to untreated controls, and to DMSO- and BHT-treated cells. Post-treatment with BHT decreased the yield of chromosomal damage in relation to treatments performed with CC and PD.

Here, we report that both subunits of Polf (Rev 3 and Rev 7) show an unexpected increase in expression during G 2 /M phase, but they localize independently in mitotic cells. Experimental depletion of Rev 3 results in {{a significant increase in}} anaphase bridges, chromosomal breaks/gaps and common fragile site (CFS) expression, whereas Rev 7 depletion primarily causes <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome</b> defect with no sign of CFS expression. The genomic instability induced by Rev 3 depletion seems to be related to replication stress, as it is further enhanced on aphidicolin treat-ment and results in increased metaphase-specific Fanconi anemia complementation group D type 2 (FANCD 2) foci formation, as well as FANCD 2 -positive anaphase bridges. Indeed, a long-term de-pletion of Rev 3 in cultured human cells results in massive genomic instability and severe cell cycle arrest.

40|$|Histone H 3 {{phosphorylation}} is {{the hallmark}} of mitosis deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C 4 only inhibits histone H 3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C 4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H 3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C 4 also induces <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome</b> in anaphase but we demonstrated that these chromosome compaction defects are not related to the absence of H 3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C 4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down. We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H 3 phosphorylation and anaphase chromosome compaction involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different conformations of the chromosomal complex revealed by FRAP. The presence of lagging chromosomes may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase inhibitors...|$|E

40|$|SummaryMerotelic {{kinetochore}} {{orientation is}} a misattachment {{in which a}} single kinetochore binds microtubules from both spindle poles rather than just one and can produce anaphase <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> {{a major source of}} aneuploidy [1]. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently in early mitosis, does not block chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate, and is not detected by the spindle checkpoint [2 – 5]. However, microtubules to the incorrect pole are usually significantly reduced or eliminated before anaphase [3, 6]. We discovered that the frequency of <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in anaphase is very sensitive to partial inhibition of Aurora kinase activity by ZM 447439 at a dose, 3 μM, that has little effect on histone phosphorylation, metaphase chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis in PtK 1 cells. Partial Aurora kinase inhibition increased the frequency of merotelic kinetochores in late metaphase, and the fraction of microtubules to the incorrect pole. Measurements of fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation showed that kinetochore-microtubule turnover in prometaphase is substantially suppressed by partial Aurora kinase inhibition. Our results support a preanaphase correction mechanism for merotelic attachments in which correct plus-end attachments are pulled away from high concentrations of Aurora B at the inner centromere, and incorrect merotelic attachments are destabilized by being pulled toward the inner centromere...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} is {{a critical}} step during cell division to avoid aneuploidy and promote proper organismal development. Correct sister chromatid positioning and separation during mitosis helps to achieve faithful transmission of genetic material to daughter cells. This prevents improper chromosome partitioning that can potentially result in extrachromosomal fragments, increasing the tumorigenic potential of the cells. The kinetochore is a protenaicious structure responsible for the initiation and orchestration of chromosome movement during mitosis. This highly conserved structure among eukaryotes is required for chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle and failure to assemble the kinetochore results in aberrant chromosome segregation. Thus elucidating the mechanism of kinetochore assembly {{is important to have}} a better understanding of the regulation that controls chromosome segregation. Our previous work identified the C. elegans Tousled-like kinase (TLK- 1) as a mitotic kinase and depletion of TLK- 1 results in embryonic lethality, characterized by nuclei displaying poor mitotic chromosome alignment, <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome,</b> and chromosome bridges during anaphase. Additionally, previous studies from our group revealed that TLK- 1 is phosphorylated independently by Aurora B at serine 634, and by CHK- 1 at threonine T 610. The research presented herein reveals that both phosphorylated forms of TLK- 1 associate with the kinetochore during mitosis. Moreover, by systematic depletion of kinetochore proteins, I uncovered that pTLK- 1 is bona fide kinetochore component that is located at the outer kinetochore layer, influencing the microtubule-binding interface. I also demonstrated that TLK- 1 is necessary for the kinetochore localization of the microtubule interacting proteins CLS- 2 and LIS- 1 and I show that embryos depleted of TLK- 1 presented an aberrant twisted kinetochore pattern. Furthermore, I established that the inner kinetochore protein KNL- 2 is an in vitro substrate of TLK- 1 indicating a possible role of TLK- 1 in regulating centromeric assembly. Collectively, these results suggest a novel role for the Tousled-like kinase in regulation of kinetochore assembly and microtubule dynamics and demonstrate the necessity of TLK- 1 for proper chromosome segregation in C. elegans...|$|E
40|$|Kinetochore {{formation}} {{is required for}} the attachment of microtubules to the chromosome at centromere where CENP-A (also known as CID in Drosophila) is the key factor for the formation of kinetochore. CENP-A is a variant of histone H 3 and its accumulation at the centromere leads to the initiation of kinetochore formation. CENP-A localization to centromere in Drosophila requires CENP-C and CAL 1. Ectopic localization of CENP-A has been reported to give rise to pseudo-kinetochore, which results in chromosome segregation defect and could lead to aneuploidy. Breast, prostate and colon cancer show higher level of CENP-A with ectopic localization. In 2014 our lab reported that depletion of CHRAC 14 leads to ectopic localization in Drosophila cells. CHRAC 14 is a subunit of two chromatin remodelling complex, CHRAC and ATAC complex. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of CHRAC 14 in maintaining chromatin structure and how it’s absence lead to CENP-A ectopic localization. We show that depletion of CHRAC 14 leads to increase in transcript level of histone methyltransferase Su(var) 3 - 9. Su(var) 3 - 9 is responsible for histone H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) methylation. Using Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence we show that lack of CHARC 14 leads to overall increase in histone H 3 lysine (H 3 K 9) di methylation and reduction in H 3 K 9 acetylation, thereby highlighting the importance of CHRAC 14 in maintaining heterochromatin and euchromatin balance. Further, we examined if the increase in Su(var) 3 - 9 expression level could lead to ectopic CENP-A localization. Using Su(var) 3 - 9 overexpressing Drosophila S 2 cells, we show that overexpression of Su(var) 3 - 9 can cause ectopic localization of CENP-A and CENP-C. Moreover, live-cell imaging analysis revealed that Su(var) 3 - 9 overexpressing cells show cell segregation defect with delayed metaphase and <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Further analysis of the observed lagging chromosomes in Su(var) 3 - 9 overexpressing cells revealed presence of higher number of CENP-A foci, indicating it to be the cause of cell segregation defect. Overall, this study reveals the role of CHRAC 14 in maintaining the chromatin structure and highlights the significance of maintaining the physiological level of Su(var) 3 - 9 for proper CENP-A localization...|$|E
40|$|In our {{laboratory}} we {{have about}} a hundred progeny lines of rice plants descended from the plants which were exposed to atomic radiation in Nagasaki. These lines have been classified into some categories, genic mutation lines, chromosome structural changed lines and so on, according to their genetic behavior or the characteristics of their abnormal derivatives. However, many kind of variant types have occurred irregularly {{in the process of}} pedigree culture of them even now. The author planned to clarify such complicated genetic behavior of the progenies of atomic bombed rice plants. The present paper deals mainly with the results of the cytogenetical studies, First of all, the data for kind of variants, their morphological and genetical characteristics and others in the progeny lines which demonstrated before 1958 by Dr. T. Nagamatsu were arranged. As a result of this arrangement of data, it was shown that the progeny lines including chromosome structural changes ceuld be classified into three groups as follows. 1) Semi-sterile lines, which descended from the semi-sterile mother plant and segregated into normal and semi-sterile plants in the ratio of 1 : 1. 2) High sterile lines, which descended from the high sterile mother plant and segregated into normal, semi-sterile and high sterile plants in ratio of about 1 : 2 : 1. These sterility and the segregation ratio are caused by the reciprocal translocation. 3) Primary and/or tertiary trisomic lines derived from their sterile lines. And moreover, it was supposed that there were not a few chromosome structural changes, which is latent in these lines as homozygous conditions and can be detected only by test crossing to chromosomal standard plant. By the test crossing between chromosome standard plant and fertile plants descended from progenies of atomic bombed rice plants, the plants having chromosome structural changes were detected in 60 out of 79 lines used. According to the observation of seed fertility (s), pollen fertility (p) and the chromosome behavior at meiosis in the PMCs of the F_ 1 hybrids, these chromosomal changes were categorized into A (s≑p≑ 50 %, a quadrivalent was observed), B (s≑p≑ 50 %, a quadrivalent was not observed), C (s≑p≑ 50 %, chromosome observation was not yet made), D (s p, a quadrivalent was not observed) and compound types of them. It was indicated that each of the types, A, B, C and D, was the homozygote for one reciprocal translocation and that the compound types such as double A (s≑p were lower than 25 ％, two quadrivalents were observed) and A+D (s<p＝ 30 ％, a quadrivalent was observed but two quadrivalents were observed infrequently) were the homozygotes for two reciprocal translocations. Therefore, the semi-sterile plants which segregated in semi－sterile lines and in high sterile lines were heterozygous plants for A, B, C and D types and the high sterile plants which segregated in high sterile lines were heterozygous for the compound types of chromosome structural changes. These facts were also confirmed from their segregation patterns of fertility in the F_ 2 generations. Moreover, it was observed in several cases that the H hybrids between standard plant and fertile plants descended from semi-sterile lines showed the high sterile plants of compound types in addition to semi-sterile plants. It demonstrated the being of latent structural changes in sterile lines. For the identification of the reciprocal translocations isolated from progenies lines, the F_ 1 hybrids were compared with each other in some characteristics, with special reference to the chromosome configuration and frequency of quadrivalent at meiosis. And these translocation lines were also tested as to homology of translocated chromosomes by reciprocal crosses among them. As a result, it was confirmed in some cases that the homologous changes existed among the lines even which derived from different original lines. For example, 6 kinds of homologous changes were observed in category A, and moreover, in category D, one homologous change was identified among 10 lines which derived from the 5 original lines. Nevertheless, about 20 different reciprocal translocations were isolated. Then, they were analyzed for translocated chromosomes by means of reciprocal translocation analysis. Occasionally, the high sterile plants, which may be the heterozygote for two of chromosome structural changes, have occurred in sterile lines in the process of the maintenances and the renewals of progeny lines of atomic bombed rice plants. The cause of that was infered from the mode of occurrence, genetic behavior of them and moreover the outcrossing ratio of semi-sterile plants as follows: as a result of outcrossing, 1) the chromosome structural changes which had been latent as homozygous condition in semi-sterile lines were appeared as heterozygous condition in high sterile plants, or 2) some chromosome structural changes were introduced from other semi-sterile lines. Most of the progeny lines of atomic bombed rice plants have been maintained up to date through such high sterile generations, once or more, in process of line renewals. This fact was probably supposed the cause of the existance of the homozygous chromosome structural changes among the lines which derived from different original lines and, chromosome structural changes among the lines which derived from different original lines and, consequently, there were fewer changes than that expected in progeny lines of atomic bombed rice plants {{at the beginning of this}} study The D types, in which a quadrivalent was not observed practically, had rather higher pollen fertility (60 - 70 %) than seed fertility, so it was suggested that the male gametes with a duplicate－deficient of translocated chromosomes may be viable in a certain case. On the E types, which had been categorized by lower pollen fertility than seed one, a bridge or a <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosome</b> was observed at the first anaphase in the PMCs and thus it suggested the presence of an inversion. Trisomic lines which have descended from the progenies of atomic bombed rice plants were not treated directly. However, some trisomics derived from reciprocal translocation heterozygotes, in which translocated chromosome had already identified, were examined for several generations as to the chromosome constitution, chromosome behavior at meiosis in the PMCs, the segregation mode of trisomic phenotypes in their progenies and so on. As a result, a general tendency was observed as follows: in early generations the chromosome constitution of trisomics which derived from translocation heterozygous plants were homo type II (primary trisomic interchange homozygote and tertiary trisomic) or hetero type (primary trisomic interchange heterozygote and tertiary trisomic interchange heterozygote) and the segregation of semi-sterile plants were observed in the hetero types; and with the generations, these chromosome constitution of trisomics became to the homo type I (primary trisomic and tertiary trisomic interchange homozygote) and finally fixed in this type which does not segregate the semi-sterile plants. In this process, the segregations of various morphological characteristics in primary or tertiary trisomics were observed according to the kind of extra chromosomes and their size of reciprocal translocations involved. Then, the endeavors to analyze the relation between the extra chromosome and the morphologica 1 characteristics were made and the morphological characteristics of 11 sorts of primary trisomics were demonstrated. On the basis of those knowledge described above, the complicated occurrence of variant types and their genetic behavior in the process of pedigree culture of these progenies of atomic bombed rice plants more than 10 years period were discussed. 長崎の原爆イネ後代に含まれる染色体構造変異の概要を明らかにし,その知見に基づいて過去 10 余年にわたる原爆イネの系統保存の過程での複雑な変異型の出現傾向とその遺伝組成について明確な説明を与えた. 1. まず, 1958 年までにすでに明らかにされた変異型の種類,特性,出現状態および遺伝様式などに関する資料を整理し,染色体構造変異に起因するものには大別して,相互転座ヘテロによる半稔系統群,高不稔系統群と,それらの系統から派生する一次あるいは三次三染色体植物群の存在することを明らかにし,さらにホモ状態で系統内に潜在して,検定交配によらねば検出不可能な構造変異の存在も少なくないことを推測した. 　 2. 染色体標準系との検定交配により,供試した原爆イネ 79 系統中 60 系統について染色体構造変異個体を検出,分離した. それらを,検定交配F_ 1 の種子稔性(S),花粉稔性(P),花粉母細胞の減数分裂期の染色体行動によつてA型(S≑P, 40 ～ 50 ％, 4 価観察),B型(S≑P,約 50 ％, 4 価なし),C型(S≑P,約 50 ％, 4 価不明),D型(S＜P,ごくまれに 4 価観察),E型(S＞P, 4 価なし) およびその複合型に分けた. A,B,C,D型はいずれも 1 つの相互転座の存在を,重複A型,A+D型は 2 つの相互転座の存在を示し;さらに半稔系統群,高不稔系統群において分離する半稔個体はこれらA,B,C,D型の転座ヘテロ個体であり;高不稔系統群に分離する高不稔個体は複合型のヘテロ個体である. この事実は,検定交配F_ 1 の特徴とそのF_ 2 の分離様式からも確かめられた. 半稔系統群では検定交配F_ 1 で半稔個体とともに複合型の高不稔個体が現われる場合が 2, 3 みられたが,これは潜在変異の存在を示すものと思われる. 3. 各系統に包含される相互転座の特性を検定交配F_ 1 の特徴,とくに 4 価染色体の形状,出現頻度などについて比較検討するとともに,転座系統間の相互交配によつて相同性を検定した. その結果,原系統の異なる系統間にも相同な変異の存在する場合が少なくなかつた. A型で 6 例,D型では 5 原系統に由来する 10 系統に相同な変異が存在した. それでも,約 20 の異なる相互転座が検出されたので,これらはさらに転座分析により転座染色体を同定した. 4. 4 価染色体のほとんど観察されないD型は,種子稔性にくらべ花粉稔性がかなり高い(63 ～ 74 ％) ことから,転座染色体の重複,欠失を伴なつた配偶子の生存の可能性が考えられる. 5. 種子稔性は正常で花粉稔性のみ半稔性を示すE型は,第 1 後期に染色体橋や遅滞染色体が観察され,逆位の存在することが考えられる. 6. 原爆イネ系統の保存,更新の過程で偶発的に出現する高不稔個体は,複合型変異のヘテロ個体であり,出現傾向,遺伝行動さらには半稔個体の他殖率などから,その成因は,他系統との交雑により, 1) ホモ状態で潜在していた変異がヘテロとして発現したか, 2) 他の系統の変異が導入されたかのいずれかであると推定した. 原爆イネ後代系統の多くが系統更新の過程でこのような高不稔世代をへて今日にいたつていることが,異なる原系統に由来する系統間に相同な変異が存在し,原爆イネ系統に含まれる染色体構造変異を予想以上に少なくしている原因であろう. 7. 原爆イネ後代に出現した三染色体系統を直接取扱うことはしなかつたが,転座染色体の明らかな数系統から派生した三染色体植物を数世代にわたつて染色体構成,染色体行動,表現型の分離様式などについて追跡した結果,転座系統から派生した当初はその染色体構成はホモII型か,あるいは半稔個体を分離するヘテロ型であり,いずれも世代が進むにしたがつて不稔個体を分離しないホモI型に固定する傾向がみられた. その過程で,一次あるいは三次三染色体植物の表現型の分離が観察されるが,転座染色体の種類,転座の程度によつて 4 つの表現型が明瞭に区別されるものからそうでないものまで存在することを認めた. 8. 転座染色体の明らかな転座系統の後代から派生した三染色体植物について,過剰染色体と三染色体植物の形態的特徴との関係を解析し,さらに 11 種の染色体を含む一次三染色体植物の形態的特性を明らかにした...|$|E

Chromosome numbers of the three species were all 2 n = 2 x = 28; those of M. fortunei and M. polydonta represent the first report. The three species at metaphase I possessed the same configuration of 14 II, however, the secondary asso-ciation was also observed. During anaphase I, 1. 5 % of the cells of M. fortunei had <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and chro-mosome bridges. During anaphase II, <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> chromosome bridges and asynchronism in second divi-sion were observed, with abnormality rate in M. fortunei being about 9. 5 %. The rate of fertile pollen grains of the three species amounted to more than 90 %, which {{was consistent with the}} cell abnormality rate at anaphase II. The results indicate that, overall, meiotic process of the three species is normal, which is in line with the high pollen fer-tility rate and high seed yield of the three species.

40|$|Background: Chromosomal {{instability}} (CIN), {{a feature}} widely shared by cells from solid tumors, {{is caused by}} occasional chromosome missegregations during cell division. Two {{of the causes of}} CIN are weakened mitotic checkpoint signaling and persistent merotelic attachments that result in <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during anaphase. Principal Findings: Here we identify an autophosphorylation event on Mps 1 that is required to prevent these two causes of CIN. Mps 1 is phosphorylated in mitotic cells on at least 7 residues, 4 of which by autophosphorylation. One of these, T 676, resides in the activation loop of the kinase domain and a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated on T 676 is less active than wild-type Mps 1 but is not kinase-dead. Strikingly, cells in which endogenous Mps 1 was replaced with this mutant are viable but missegregate chromosomes frequently. Anaphase is initiated in the presence of misaligned and <b>lagging</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> indicative of a weakened checkpoint and persistent merotelic attachments, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: We propose that full activity of Mps 1 is essential for maintaining chromosomal stability by allowing resolution of merotelic attachments and to ensure that single kinetochores achieve the strength of checkpoint signaling sufficient to prevent premature anaphase onset and chromosomal instability. To our knowledge, phosphorylation of T 676 on Mps 1 is the first post-translational modification in human cells of which the absence causes checkpoin...|$|R
