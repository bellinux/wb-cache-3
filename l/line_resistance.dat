500|$|In {{the areas}} of the mine explosions, the British {{infantry}} found dead, wounded and stunned German soldiers. The attackers swept through the gaps in the German defences as Germans further back hurriedly withdrew. About [...] British troops advanced up the slope, the creeping bombardment throwing up lots of smoke and dust, which blocked the view of the German defenders. The barrage moved at [...] in two minutes, which allowed the leading troops to rush or outflank German strong points and machine-gun nests. Where the Germans were able to resist, they were engaged with rifle-grenades, Lewis guns and trench mortars, while riflemen and bombers worked behind them. Pillbox fighting tactics had been a great success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April and in training for the attack at Messines, the same methods were adopted along with emphasis on mopping-up captured ground, to ensure that bypassed German troops could not engage advancing troops from behind. In the smoke and dust, direction was kept by compass and the German forward zone was easily overrun in the [...] allotted, as was the [...] line, half way to the German [...] (second) line on the ridge. The two supporting battalions of the attacking brigades leap-frogged through, to advance to the second objective on the near crest of the ridge [...] further on. The accuracy of the British barrage was maintained and local German counter-attack attempts were stifled. As the infantry approached the German second <b>line,</b> <b>resistance</b> increased.|$|E
30|$|However, {{there are}} several {{limitations}} of these methods mentioned above when <b>line</b> <b>resistances</b> are considered, as the batteries will operate at different charging/discharging current due to the voltage drops across the <b>line</b> <b>resistances.</b> This will cause the SoC of the BESSs to diverge.

50|$|The split {{of power}} between {{transmission}} losses (Joule heating in transmission lines) and load (useful energy delivered to the consumer) can be approximated by a voltage divider.

50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, the Ferranti {{effect is}} an increase in voltage occurring at the receiving end of a long transmission line, above the voltage at the sending end. This occurs when the line is energized, but there is a very light load or the load is disconnected. The capacitive line charging current produces a voltage drop across the line inductance that is in-phase with the sending-end voltage, assuming negligible <b>line</b> <b>resistance.</b> Therefore both line inductance and capacitance are responsible for this phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|On January 25, 1942, a {{superior}} Japanese Army force launched an attack southward from a general line along Pilar-Bagac Road. The attack swept the outpost <b>line</b> in <b>resistance,</b> and penetrated the Main <b>Line</b> of <b>Resistance</b> (MLR) of the 1st Regular Division on the Gogo-Cotar River area, Bataan, creating a 500-yard gap {{through which the}} enemy rushed.

5000|$|Modern {{electric}} power transmission systems consist of generating plants inter-connected by electrical circuits that operate at fixed transmission voltages controlled at substations. The grid voltages employed are largely dependent on the path length between these substations and 200-700 kV system voltages are common. There is a trend towards higher voltages and lower <b>line</b> <b>resistances</b> to reduce transmission losses over longer and longer path lengths. Low <b>line</b> <b>resistances</b> produce a situation favourable to the flow of GIC. Power transformers have a magnetic circuit that is disrupted by the quasi-DC GIC: the field produced by the GIC offsets the operating point of the magnetic circuit and the transformer may go into half-cycle saturation. This produces harmonics to the AC waveform, localised heating and leads to high reactive power demands, inefficient power transmission and possible mis-operation of protective measures. Balancing the network in such situations requires significant additional reactive power capacity. [...] The magnitude of GIC that will cause significant problems to transformers varies with transformer type. Modern industry practice is to specify GIC tolerance levels on new transformers.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>line</b> {{of least}} <b>resistance</b> was assumed as the {{distance}} from mid-length of the charge {{to the surface of}} the rock. Since the charges were perfectly tamped by the confined water within the excavation, this rule of measuring the <b>line</b> of least <b>resistance</b> was assumed to be practically correct. With less perfect tamping, the <b>lines</b> of least <b>resistance</b> for such mines designed to break through the roof would have required estimates quite different.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} polarential systems, known as types A and B, are in use. In {{half-duplex}} {{operation of a}} type A polarential system, the direct-current balance is independent of <b>line</b> <b>resistance.</b> In half-duplex operation of a type B polarential system, the direct current is substantially independent of the line leakage. Type A is better for cable loops where leakage is negligible but resistance varies with temperature. Type B is considered better for open wire where variable line leakage is frequent.|$|E

The user interface called MAPCI, consists {{of a series of}} multi-level menus and is usually accessed from a connected VT100 compatible dumb terminal or terminal emulator. Each level or overlay performs different functions. For example, the alarm overlay (invoked by typing OVLY ALO on a terminal connected to a DMS-10) allows the operator to enter commands to display and clear alarms. Similarly, OVLY LIT permits running metallic Line Isolation Testing on cable pairs to determine <b>line</b> <b>resistance,</b> voltage, capacitance, etc. DMS switches are also capable of running a specialized version of UNIX.|$|E
50|$|NRZ(Non-Return-to-Zero) - Traditionally, a {{unipolar}} {{scheme was}} designed as a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) scheme, in which the positive voltage defines bit 1 and the zero voltage defines bit 0. It is called NRZ because the signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit, as instead happens in other line coding schemes, such as Manchester code. Compared with its polar counterpart, polar NRZ, this scheme applies a DC bias to the line and unnecessarily wastes power - The normalized power (power required to send 1 bit per unit <b>line</b> <b>resistance)</b> is double that for polar NRZ. For this reason, unipolar encoding is not normally used in data communications today.|$|E

50|$|The {{parameters}} A, B, C, and D differ {{depending on}} how the desired model handles the <b>line's</b> <b>resistance</b> (R), inductance (L), capacitance (C), and shunt (parallel, leak) conductance G. The four main models are the short line approximation, the medium line approximation, the long line approximation (with distributed parameters), and the lossless line.

25|$|Because {{pure line}} (genotypically identical) plant {{varieties}} often {{only have one}} or a few major genes for disease resistance, and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure <b>line's</b> <b>resistance,</b> multiline varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.|$|R
