50|$|Preceding the {{analysis}} of mass spectra data obtained by analyzing samples found in meteorites, it was inferential at best to accredit 244Pu as being the nuclide responsible for the fissiogenic xenon found. But an analysis of a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> of 244Pu {{compared with that of}} fissiogenic xenon gathered from the meteorites Pasamonte and Kapoeta produced matching spectra that immediately left little doubt as to the source of the isotopic xenon anomalies. Spectra data was further acquired for another actinide, 244Cm, but such data proved contradictory and helped erase further doubts that the fission was appropriately attributed to 244Pu.|$|E

40|$|An {{open-source}} 3 -D printable <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> rotator mixer {{is developed}} here in two variants that allow users {{to opt for}} the level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity needed in their laboratories. First, a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> rotator is designed and demonstrated {{that can be used}} for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$ 30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $ 20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90 % of the costs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A hybrid ANN-FE {{solution}} {{is presented as}} a result of two level analysis of soils: a level of a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> and a level of engineering geotechnical problem. Engineering properties of soils (sands) are represented directly in the form of ANN (this is in contrast with our former paper where ANN approximated constitutive relationships). Initially the ANN is trained with Duncan for-mula (Duncan and Chang [2]), then it is re-trained (calibrated) with some available experimental data, specific for the soil consid-ered. The obtained approximation of the constitutive parameters is used directly in finite element method at the level of a single ele-ment at the scale of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> to check the correct representation of the laboratory test. Then, the finite element that was successfully tested at the level of <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> is used at the macro level to solve engineering problems involving the soil for which it was calibrated...|$|E

40|$|Since {{one does}} not know the {{photometric}} functions of various parts of Io, one cannot convert the observed geometric albedo of the satellite to a parameter more directly measurable in the laboratory. One must therefore convert laboratory reflectances to geometric albedos before quantitative comparisons between Io's surface and a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> are made. This procedure involves determining the wavelength dependence of the sample's photometric function. For substances such as sulfur, whose reflectance varies strongly with wavelength, it is incorrect {{to assume that the}} photometric function, and hence the ratio (laboratory reflectance/geometric albedo) is independent of wavelength. To illustrate this point, measurements of the color dependence of this ratio for sulfur are presented for the specific case in which the measured laboratory reflectance is the sample's normal reflectance. In general, unless the laboratory reflectance is precisely the geometric albedo, a wavelength-dependent correction factor must be determined before the <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> can be compared quantitatively with Io's surface...|$|E

40|$|Earth Materials Laboratory Report No. EM- 170 {{covers the}} {{laboratory}} tests made on {{one type of}} soil from Logan, Utah, {{for the purpose of}} using the soil in soil-cement canal lining experiments. The intention was that two types of soil would be used for experimental linings at Logan, Utah; a fine sandy soil, poorly graded with little or no silt (Classification Symbol SP) and a fine sandy soil with excess silt (Classification Symbol SF-silty). These field test sections which will provide durability and permeability information gathered under natural conditions were carried out as part of a joint lower-cost canal lining experiment by the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, the Soil Conservation Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation. When Report EM- 170 was written (April 19, 1948) only materials of the 2 ̆ 2 SF-silty 2 ̆ 2 type were available for testing.

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracks (SCC) {{had been}} found in a natural gas transmission pipeline during a dig-up and inspection program. The question was raised as to whether the SCC was active or dormant. This paper describes the resultant investigation to determine if a particular service crack was actively growing. The strategy adopted was to assess the appearance of the fracture surface of the service crack and to compare with expectations from laboratory specimens with active SCC. The conclusions from this study are as follows. To judge whether a crack in the service pipe is active or dormant, it is reasonable to compare the very crack tip of the service crack and a fresh crack in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample.</b> If the crack tip of the active <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> {{is similar to that of}} the service pipe, it means the crack in the service pipe is likely to be active. From the comparison of the crack tip between the service pipe and the laboratory samples, it appears likely that the cracks in the samples extracted from service were most likely to have been active intergranular stress corrosion cracks.
