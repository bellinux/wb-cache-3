Her {{mother was a}} stern lady, and the family's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>means</b> and Presbyterian beliefs made for a frugal upbringing. Tinne had two brothers and a sister, and the four were sent to boarding school in 1893, when Tinne was about seven. During the school holidays, the children would live either with Tinne's maternal aunt in Sevenoaks, Kent or grandparents in Edinburgh. Her parents remained in India until the 1920s.|$|E

While these flaws had been present in past elections, the closeness of results in the 1989 election {{and the fact that the}} PSOE overall majority depended on a disputed seat meant that these ended up being exposed. As a result, the electoral law was subsequently amended in 1991 in order to introduce improvements in the efficiency of the electoral administration.|$|E

500|$|Catalonia {{was one of}} {{the main}} fronts of the Nine Years' War. However, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>means</b> and poor {{relations}} with the peasantry due to the Revolt of the Barretinas marked for the Spanish Viceroy of Catalonia, the Duke of Villahermosa, the early stage of the conflict. In 1689 the Admiral of Castile, Juan Gaspar Enríquez de Cabrera, said to the Spanish Council of State that [...] "the best relief that Catalonia can have are the outer capabilities, what would be done from Flanders, from Milan and from Navarre". The French army under the Duke of Noailles, however, was also short of resources, and attrition warfare prevailed on the first four years of the war. In 1694, Louis XIV committed more resources to his army in Catalonia, and Noailles managed to break the Spanish defenses, defeating the Spanish army at the battle of Torroella, on the banks of the Ter river, and seizing the ports of Roses, Palamós and Cadaqués, and the important city of Girona.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} part of the 19th century, artists ventured to the White Mountains of New Hampshire to sketch and paint. [...] Many of the first artists were {{attracted}} to the region because of the 1826 tragedy of the Willey family, in which nine people lost their lives in a mudslide. [...] These early works portrayed a dramatic and untamed mountain wilderness. Dr. Robert McGrath describes a Thomas Cole (18011848) painting titled Distant View of the Slide that Destroyed the Willey Family thus: [...] "... an array of broken stumps and errant rocks, together with a gathering storm, suggest the wildness of the site while evoking an appropriate ambient of darkness and desolation". [...] The images stirred the imagination of Americans, primarily from the large cities of the northeast, who traveled to the White Mountains to view the scenes for themselves. [...] Others soon followed: innkeepers, writers, scientists, and more artists. [...] The White Mountains became a major attraction for tourists from the New England states and beyond. [...] The circulation of paintings and prints depicting the area enabled those who could not visit, because of <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>means,</b> distance, or other circumstance, to appreciate its beauty.|$|E

2500|$|Withdrawal to the [...] was debated by Ludendorff {{and other}} senior German commanders {{over the winter}} of 1916–1917. An {{offensive}} {{in the new year}} with [...] was discussed on 19 December but it was considered that such a force could not achieve a decisive result. An Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, German army high command) memorandum of 5 January, noted that offensive preparations by the French and British were being made all along the Western Front so as to keep the site of a spring offensive secret. It was considered that the Somme front, the area between Arras and Lille, the Aisne front, Lorraine and Flanders were particularly threatened. Prisoner interrogation, postal analysis, espionage and air reconnaissance were used to identify the probable sites of Anglo-French offensives. March was considered the earliest that the Anglo-French could attack, with a possible delay if a Russian offensive was also planned. The Chief of Staff of Army Group Rupprecht, Generalleutnant Hermann von Kuhl issued a survey of offensive possibilities on 15 January. A German breakthrough attempt was rejected for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>means</b> and the consequences of failure. Limited-objective attacks at Loos, Arras, the Somme and the Aisne were considered but the manpower and equipment shortage meant that even smaller attacks risked using up reserves needed for defence against the expected Anglo-French spring offensives. Local attacks like those at Bouchavesnes and La Maisonette on the Somme in late 1916, which could be mounted without reinforcements, were all that could be considered. Ludendorff accepted the analysis that no offensive was possible.|$|E
