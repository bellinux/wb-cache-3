50|$|The pool complex has {{undergone}} several expansions since its opening in 1964, {{at which time}} only the main pool and diving pool were complete. The main pool is of Olympic dimensions (50m by 17.5m), and is kept heated to 28.5 degrees Celsius. It can be divided by a moveable bulkhead into two 25m pools; The original diving pool, which is still in use, is 13m by 7.2m with two 1m boards, a 3m board and a high 5m platform. The learners' pool was competed and opened in 1965, and a small restaurant {{was added to the}} facilities in the same year. Between 1984 and 1990, two hydroslides were added to the complex, and additions to the <b>learners</b> <b>pool</b> to encourage young families were also made. The restaurant was removed in 1991, replaced by gym facilities, and the sun terrace was revamped, removing two trampolines which had been located there.

40|$|As a {{group of}} three {{community}} Colleges who {{are in the process of}} merging we have been seeking ways to improve the <b>learner</b> experience, <b>pool</b> current resources and achieving efficiencies in delivery. In a survey of 250 learners across the three colleges we found that 90 % own web-enabled mobile devices and over 75 % expressed a desire to access course materials on these devices. All three colleges are currently using the Moodle VLE. We are also currently all planning to move to a single, shared instance of Moodle in 2014 / 15. Our proposal was therefore to collaboratively create a range of mobile learning materials, based on video content with associated self-assessment resources for three identified curriculum areas, one in each college. All of these materials would be accessible by learners on mobile platforms, through a Moodle hub maintained by the three partner colleges. ...|$|R

5000|$|Hethersett lies {{so close}} to Norwich that many {{think of it as}} just another of its suburbs. It is, however, a {{separate}} community with its own vitality and quite a marked community spirit. This shows itself not only in the wide range of activities in the village but also in more permanent ways in items provided for the village through the efforts of villagers. These include a <b>learner</b> swimming <b>pool</b> in the Middle School, a bench in the memory of Zita James sited at the church, a cassette library, the conversion of School House in the Middle School to provide a Music Room, the erection of a village sign, village street plans, the Jubilee Youth Club and the Scout and Guide Hut. Trees have been planted {{in various parts of the}} village and a memorial plaque has been erected on the site of the old School (No 3 Queen's Road).

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{problem of}} this study was to develop and {{validate}} an instrument that would measure vocational teacher trainees and practitioners' attitudes toward handicapped <b>learners.</b> The item <b>pool</b> consisted of 90 items which addressed three major dimensions of attitudes toward handicapped vocational students: handicapping conditions, characteristics of these conditions, and the severity of the conditions. The item pool was submitted to a panel of experts to establish the instruments' content validity and the face validity of the items. The content validation resulted in the inclusion of 87 items in the pilot instrument. The instrument was pilot tested with 27 students and 14 practitioners. Item analyses resulted in the identification of four items addressing each of seven handicapping conditions: mental retardation, speech impairment, visual impairment, hearing impairment, emotional disturbance, orthopedic handicap, and chronic illness. Two conditions, multiple handicaps and learning disabilities, were deleted from the instrument based on the concerns expressed by the panel of experts, results of item analysis, and interviews with students who had participated in the pilot test. The subjects for the field test were 53 advanced undergraduate vocational teacher education students and 164 vocational teachers. Internal consistency indices indicated that the instrument was a relatively reliable measure of vocational teachers' attitudes toward handicapped learners. Indices of concurrent validity for the scale and its subscales and the standardized "Attitude Toward Disabled Persons" scale seemed to support the contention that specific conditions rather than the general concept of "handicapped" should be assessed. The subjects' sex and vocational teaching areas were significantly related to their subscale scores. The quality of prior experience with handicapped persons also seemed to influence the practitioners' responses. Age, and variables apparently related to it, such as years of teaching experience, were not related to subscale scores. The findings {{of this study}} indicated that the "Attitudes Toward Handicapped Vocational Students" scale is a valid and reliable instrument for use in measuring practicing vocational educators' attitudes toward handicapped learners. Further study is needed on the use of the instrument to determine vocational teacher trainees' attitudes...|$|R

40|$|Discriminative training, a. k. a. tuning, is an {{important}} part of Statistical Machine Translation. This step optimises weights for the several statistical models and heuristics used in a machine translation system, in order to balance their relative effect on the translation output. Different weights lead to significant changes in the quality of translation outputs, and thus selecting appropriate weights is of key importance. This thesis addresses three major problems with current discriminative training methods in order to improve translation quality. First, we design more accurate automatic machine translation evaluation metrics that have better correlation with human judgements. An automatic evaluation metric is used in the loss function in most discriminative training methods, however what the best metric is for this purpose is still an open question. In this thesis we propose two novel evaluation metrics that achieve better correlation with human judgements than the current de facto standard, the BLEU metric. We show that these metrics can improve translation quality when used in discriminative training. Second, we design an algorithm to select sentence pairs for training the discriminative <b>learner</b> from large <b>pools</b> of freely available parallel sentences. These resources tend to be noisy and include translations of varying degrees of quality and suitability for the translation task at hand, especially if obtained using crowdsourcing methods. Nevertheless, they are crucial when professionally created training data is scarce or unavailable. There is very little previous research on the data selection for discriminative training. Our novel data selection algorithm does not require knowledge of the test set nor uses decoding outputs, and is thus more generally useful and efficient. Our experiments show that with this data selection algorithm, translation quality consistently improves over strong baselines. Finally, the third component of the thesis is a novel weighted ranking-based optimisation algorithm for discriminative training. In contrast to previous approaches, this technique assigns a different weight to each training instance according to its reachability and its relationship to test sentence being decoded, a form of transductive learning. Our experimental results show improvements over a modern state-of-the-art method across different language pairs. Overall, the proposed approaches lead to better translation quality when compared strong baselines in our experiments, both in isolation and when combined, and can be easily applied to most existing statistical machine translation approaches. ...|$|R
