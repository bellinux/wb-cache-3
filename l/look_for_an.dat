5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appointment elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|When {{researchers}} <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> organism to use {{in their}} studies, they look for several traits. Among these are size, generation time, accessibility, manipulation, genetics, conservation of mechanisms, and potential economic benefit. The yeast species S. pombe and S. cerevisiae are both well studied; these two species diverged approximately , and are significant tools {{in the study of}} DNA damage and repair mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, scale invariance is {{a feature}} of phase transitions. The key observation is that near a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> explicitly scale-invariant theory to describe the phenomena. Such theories are scale-invariant statistical field theories, and are formally very similar to scale-invariant quantum field theories.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Seale {{argued that}} {{the reason why the}} Syrians were stopped was the superiority of the IAF, which was free to devote all of its {{attention}} to the Syrian front. Kenneth Pollack wrote that the Syrian forces did not <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alternative axis of advance and rolled forward without defending their flanks. Martin Van Creveld suggested the explanation that on October 8, when Israel felt that the battle was being lost, it threatened Syria with a nuclear strike.|$|E

The first games were played at the Wanderers Club’s stadium whose grounds were situated where Johannesburg Park Station is today.

The choice was to host the matches at Neo GSP Stadium in Nicosia, Cyprus.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{soldiers}} {{rounded up}} the Jesuits in Mexico, marched {{them to the}} coasts, and placed them below the decks of Spanish warships headed for the Italian port of Civitavecchia in the Papal States. When they arrived, Pope Clement XIII refused to allow the ships to unload their prisoners onto papal territory. Fired upon by batteries of artillery from the shore of Civitavecchia, the Spanish warships had to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> anchorage off the island of Corsica, then a dependency of Genoa. But since a rebellion had erupted on Corsica, it took five months before some of the Jesuits could set foot on land.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study by}} the California Department of Public Health {{found that women who}} lived near farm fields sprayed with {{endosulfan}} and the related organochloride pesticide dicofol during the first eight weeks of pregnancy are several times more likely to give birth to children with autism. This is the first study to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> association between endosulfan and autism, and additional study is needed to confirm the connection. A 2009 assessment concluded that epidemiology and rodent studies that suggest male reproductive and autism effects are open to other interpretations, and that developmental or reproductive toxicity in rats occurs only at endosulfan doses that cause neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Blue overhears Blondie {{relaying}} Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming {{his suspicions}} {{that something is}} amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.|$|E

25|$|In the Philosopher’s Stone he accompanies Harry, Hagrid, Draco, and Hermione {{into the}} Forbidden Forest to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> injured unicorn. In the {{following}} book, the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron take Fang {{into the forest}} where he is scared stiff of both the gigantic acromantula and Mr Weasley’s flying car. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, an escaping Death Eater sets fire to Hagrid’s hut while Fang is inside; Hagrid enters the flaming hut, slings Fang over his shoulder, and carries him to safety. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fang and Hagrid participate in the Battle of Hogwarts; though Fang's exact involvement is not clear. He is last seen running away after a shattered vase frightens him. It's implied that Fang survives, as Hagrid is not seen mourning him at any time. It's unknown if Fang is still alive when Harry's children come to Hogwarts.|$|E
25|$|After all of {{his troops}} were across the James on August 14, Hancock {{positioned}} Birney's X Corps on the left, Hancock's 3rd Division of II Corps, under Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott, in the center, and Hancock's 1st and 2nd Divisions, under Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow (temporarily commanding {{in the absence of}} Maj. Gen. John Gibbon), on the right. Birney was ordered to demonstrate against New Market Heights while the II Corps divisions attempted to turn the Confederate left. Mott was to push forward on the New Market Road toward Richmond, Barlow to attack Fussell's Mill on the Darbytown Road, and Gregg's cavalry to cover the right flank of the army and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to race into Richmond. Birney's troops successfully pushed aside pickets on the Kingsland Road, but were stopped by the fortifications on New Market Heights. The II Corps units moved slowly into position, suffering numerous deaths from heat stroke.|$|E
25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, we <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, {{and there may be}} a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back and colored red.|$|E

25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
