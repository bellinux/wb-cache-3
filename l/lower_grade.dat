5|$|Penfold {{was born}} to Alfred and Florence (née Green) in 1944 and educated at Sutton Grammar School for Boys, where he stayed on until 19. He left school with A-levels in French, German, and geography, and took casual {{employment}} to earn money. Having a desire {{to make use of}} his language qualifications, he began applying for jobs at multi-national companies. He applied to Her Majesty's Civil Service and passed the civil service exam, but was keen to join the Foreign Service. He took and passed a second exam to join the Foreign Service, but had to enter at a <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> than he would have held in the Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|The Tales of Ise portrays Narihira as {{falling in}} love with , a consort of Emperor Seiwa, and it is hinted that {{this was one of the}} reasons for his leaving the capital and {{travelling}} east. It has been speculated that this romantic affair with the consort of the emperor was the reason why the Sandai Jitsuroku describes his rank as going down from Junior Fifth Rank, <b>Lower</b> <b>Grade</b> to Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade, before again rising to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade the following year. However, it has also been speculated that this may be an error in the Sandai Jitsuroku as a result of binding changing the order of events. Furthermore, Fujiwara no Takaiko reputedly had an affair with the monk , which may have formed the core of the otherwise fictional legend that she also had an affair with Narihira. Whether the affair was historical or not, the Reizei family's commentary on The Tales of Ise speculates that Emperor Yōzei was a product of this union, and not the previous emperor.|$|E
25|$|Anaplastic astrocytoma is {{classified}} as grade III and are malignant tumors. They grow more rapidly than <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> tumors and tend to invade nearby healthy tissue. Anaplastic astrocytomas recur more frequently than <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> tumors because their tendency to spread into surrounding tissue makes them difficult to completely remove surgically.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Because {{clinical}} clerkship {{grades are}} associated with resident selection and performance and are largely based on residents'/attendings' subjective ratings, {{it is important to}} identify variables associated with clinical clerkship grades. METHODS: U. S. medical students who completed > or = 1 of the following required clinical clerkships [...] internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, neurology and psychiatry [...] were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey, which inquired about demographics, degree program, perceived quality of clerkship experiences, assertiveness, reticence and clerkship grades. RESULTS: A total of 2395 medical students (55 % women; 57 % whites) from 105 schools responded. Multivariable logistic regression models identified factors independently associated with receiving <b>lower</b> clerkship <b>grades</b> (high pass/pass or B/C) compared with the highest grade (honors or A). Students reporting higher quality of clerkship experiences were less likely to report <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in all clerkships. Older students more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in internal medicine (P = 0. 02) and neurology (P < 0. 001). Underrepresented minorities more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in all clerkships (P < 0. 001); Asians more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in obstetrics/gynecology (P = 0. 007), pediatrics (P = 0. 01) and neurology (P = 0. 01). Men more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in obstetrics/gynecology (P < 0. 001) and psychiatry (P = 0. 004). Students reporting greater reticence more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in internal medicine (P = 0. 02), pediatrics (P = 0. 02) and psychiatry (P < 0. 05). Students reporting greater assertiveness less likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in all clerkships (P < 0. 03) except IM. CONCLUSIONS: The independent associations between <b>lower</b> clerkship <b>grades</b> and nonwhite race, male gender, older age, lower quality of clerkship experiences, and being less assertive and more reticent are concerning and merit further investigation...|$|R

25|$|Hot blast allowed blast {{furnaces}} to use anthracite or <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> coal. Anthracite {{was difficult to}} light with cold blast. High quality metallurgical coking coal deposits of sufficient size for iron making were only available in Great Britain and western Germany in the 19th century, but with less fuel required per unit of iron, {{it was possible to}} use <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> coal.|$|E
25|$|Companies were {{commanded}} by captains {{and had two}} or more lieutenants. Regiments were {{commanded by}} colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> officer. Barring {{the same type of}} circumstances which might leave a <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods of time as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.|$|E

25|$|The Broadway subway {{plan was}} changed in 1915 to route both tracks into 60th Street and {{to cross the}} East River by a tunnel {{just north of the}} Queensboro Bridge. The 59th Street {{crossing}} was obviously now useless, and at 60th Street, the subway would have to be at a <b>lower</b> <b>grade,</b> {{on its way to the}} 60th Street Tunnel. The 59th Street crossing was worked into a pedestrian underpass for the IRT 59th Street station, which turned into a way to get between the downtown platform and the direct subway entrance to Bloomingdale's on the uptown platform. That section is still in use, and the floor level is that of the never-completed BMT station. The 60th Street crossing was mostly destroyed when the existing station was built at a <b>lower</b> <b>grade.</b> A door in the southern wall across from the platform opens into a remaining unused space, and suggests the platform level of the original grade, which is the same as the 59th Street underpass.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1931, {{construction}} on the approach occurred in 1934. WPA money was used to hire laborers to begin the extension of the roadway past Lee Boulevard toward the cemetery. Construction created a number of traffic hazards. By April 1935, the road had reached Fort Myer and Arlington National Cemetery. Survey work showed that a <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> could be achieved by altering the route, but this would require an addition expenditure of $21,966 for rights-of-way.|$|E
