40|$|Background: Terminal {{haemorrhage}} {{is a rare}} but devastating {{event that}} may occur in certain advanced cancers. The focus <b>of</b> <b>management</b> involves administration <b>of</b> ‘crisis medicine’ {{with the intention of}} relieving patient distress through sedative doses of anxiolytics or opioids. This practice, whilst widely accepted, is based on limited evidence and has never been formally evaluated. Aim: To evaluate the utility of crisis medication in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> haemorrhage, through the experiences of nurses who had personally managed such events. Method: Semi-structured interviews exploring the experiences of palliative care and head and neck oncology nurses were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Saturation of themes occurred after interviewing 11 nurses with cumulative experience <b>of</b> managing 37 <b>terminal</b> haemorrhages. Results: Participants reported crisis medication to have little, if any, role in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> haemorrhage, which was such a rapid event that patients died before it could be administered. As many events had not been predicted, anticipatory prescribing of crisis medication did not always occur. Staying with and supporting the patient, and using dark-coloured towels to camouflage blood were reported to be of more practical use. A focus on accessing crisis medicines had often been to the detriment of these simple yet beneficial measures. Conclusion: Anticipatory prescribing of crisis medication rarely benefits the patient and may unintentionally detract from nursing care. Guidelines on the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> haemorrhage should reconsider the emphasis on crisis medication and focus on non-pharmacological approaches to this invariably fatal event...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{demonstrates}} {{the possibility of}} using simulation modelling for improving the processes of managing the development <b>of</b> the <b>terminal</b> at a strategic level, taking into account, first of all, security and safety aspects of quality of services. The described in the paper developed simulation model based on the AnyLogic software could be treated as decision support tool for <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the passenger <b>terminal.</b> The background <b>of</b> the problem is related with the started reconstruction process <b>of</b> the <b>terminal</b> with no ability to close it for reconstruction period. The decision to temporary close different parts of the platforms and make step-by-step reconstruction was done by management. But this decision causes a number of question regarding safety aspects of the passengers. The developed simulation model is directed on estimation of the passengers’ density in terminal. The higher density directly influences the safety issues. The primary task of the developed decision support tool is to support <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>terminal</b> with quantitative values of passenger density for different scenarios of reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -Oral {{potassium}} permanganate {{has been used}} in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> carcinoma in three patients. Symptomatic improvement occurred in all three, with elimination of oral foetor in one patient and diminished requirement of analgesics in the other two. The mental state of each patient was improved and normal activities were resumed. STROUD, the " Birdman of Alcatraz ", demonstrated (Gaddis, 1956) that a suitable antiseptic used as a whole body detergent could enable the host to overcome the deleterious effects of a pathogen. By using oxidising agents he succeeded in eliminating viral infection from birds. There is now more recent evidence (Lund, 1966) that oxidising agents may also have a direct inactivating action on some viruses. Potassium permanganate is not toxic to human beings when used in small doses, except when it is administered for very long periods. It has proved useful in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> patients with carcinoma in whom other methods of treatment had been unable to give symptomatic relief. These patients were in the <b>terminal</b> stages <b>of</b> the disease and had such troublesome symptoms that life was absolutely miserable...|$|R

40|$|Although {{terminal}} hemorrhage is an infrequent {{occurrence in}} advanced cancer patients, {{it is extremely}} distressing for patients, their families, and health care professionals when it does occur. By definition, {{there is a very}} short time period to support and comfort the patient, and it is vital that the management approach follows the best available evidence base. A systematic literature search was carried out to retrieve relevant publications relating to the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> hemorrhage in patients with advanced cancer in whom invasive or interventional procedures are no longer appropriate. From 3, 564 initial citations, 18 were appropriate to include in the final review, many of which focused on patients with head and neck tumors. The reported incidence of significant bleeding in patients with advanced cancer is 6 %– 14 % and incidence <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> hemorrhage 3 %– 12 %. Key areas arising from the literature were 1) identifying patients at risk, 2) general supportive measures to use, and 3) use of sedative medication. General supportive measures included use of dark towels to camouflage blood loss, use of suction, and applying external pressure. There was variation in the recommended sedative medication (drug, dose, and route). Drugs recommended included diazepam, midazolam, diamorphine, and ketamine at varying doses and routes of administration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} implementing a program of controlled non-heart beating organ donation, in patients undergoing the withdrawal of intensive care treatment. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study. Medical and Surgical ICUs in a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients younger than 70 years dying in the ICU after treatment withdrawal for dire neurological prognosis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We analyzed prospectively collected data from the ICU clinical information system. Seventy-three of 516 ICU deaths (13 %) were identified, equally distributed among traumatic, stroke, and anoxic brain injury. The management and the course in these three diagnostic categories were similar. All patients underwent withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and half were extubated. Median time to death was of 4. 8 h (IQR 1. 4 - 11. 5). In 70 % of cases the patient received analgesia and 30 % sedation. Such treatment {{was not related to}} earlier death. Hypotension was observed in 50 % of patients during the 30 min preceding cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: With our current <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> patients controlled non-heart beating organ procedure may be difficult due to the duration and variability of the dying process.
