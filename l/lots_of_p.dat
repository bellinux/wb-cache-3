40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{architectures}} {{are very}} prevalent in today’s Internet. <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>P</b> 2 P file sharing systems using Gnutella protocol emerge out and draw attractions {{of millions of}} people. The “flooding ” search mechanism of Gnutella {{makes it easy to}} be deployed, but also spawns numerous messages which leads to serious scalability problems. However, the locality discovered in both user’s share files and queries, enables us to use query-caching to shorten the search length and reduce the messages traffic. This paper makes an extensive study of query-caching in P 2 P systems and proposes an adaptive query-caching mechanism to manage the cached query reply messages according to the heterogeneity of the uptime of different peers. Along with several other techniques we proposed, our approach achieves a 30 % reduction of average search length and a 61 % reduction of query message traffic comparing with the previous query-caching mechanisms in the simulation, which indicates that our approach makes Gnutella more scalable. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim  Members of the {{tropical}} tree snail family Partulidae are endemic to Pacific high oceanic islands and typically have single‐island ranges. Two nominal Papua New Guinean species, Partula carteriensis and Partula similaris, deviate from familial norms by having extensive multi‐island ranges that include low islands. We hypothesized that undocumented anthropogenic introductions may underlie this regional biogeographical anomaly and evaluated this hypothesis with novel field distributional and genotypic data. Location  Papua New Guinean archipelagos between 1. 4 and 11. 4 ° S and 146. 5 and 154. 2 ° E. Methods  Ethanol‐preserved museum <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>P.</b> carteriensis (from New Britain, Bismarck Archipelago) and P. similaris (from Woodlark, Boiaboiawaga and Goodenough islands) were genotyped for a standard mitochondrial marker, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the resulting haplotypes were subjected to phylogeographical analyses. Results  All four genotyped populations showed very little genetic or conchological differentiation, irrespective of nominal taxonomic status, the archipelago sampled or whether the island was low, high, oceanic or continental. Partula carteriensis and P. similaris exhibit atypical distributions on larger high islands, being restricted to coastal villages and absent from native forest. Main conclusions  Our results strongly indicate that P. carteriensis and P. similaris are conspecific, although a formal taxonomic revision {{is beyond the scope}} of this present study. They collectively exhibit the most heterogeneous geographical range known among partulids and their explicitly synanthropic association with high island coastal villages strongly implicates human introduction as the regional dispersal mechanism. We currently lack insights into the timeframe (apart from regional prehistory) and cultural context of these translocations. We also lack a convincing source population, and it may be necessary to survey the partulid fauna of the neighbouring Solomon Islands to identify one. Partulids are critically endangered throughout much of their range and the discovery of populations that apparently thrive in human‐altered landscapes is noteworthy. Their study may provide clues of broad relevance to partulid conservation...|$|E
40|$|Seeds are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used regeneration material for reforestation purpose; hence interest in “precision sowing” among nurseries is high due to the high cost of containerized seedling production. In addition, the increased interest in growing hybrid larch in commercial forestry has raised concerns about the purity of hybrid larch seed lots, as there are large proportions of pure parental seeds mixed with hybrid larch seed lots. The aims of the studies presented in this thesis were to evaluate the application of visible (Vis) and/or near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate modelling for sorting filled-viable, empty and petrified seeds of Larix sibirica Ledeb., verification of hybrid larch, Larix × eurolepis Henry seeds, identification of seeds of Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh., and authentication of the origin of Picea abies (L.) Karst seed lots. For these purposes, reflectance spectra were recorded on single seeds using XDS Rapid Content Analyzer (FOSS NIRSystems, Inc.) from 400 – 2500 nm with a resolution of 0. 5 nm, and multivariate classification models were developed. The results showed that filled-viable, empty and petrified seeds of L. sibirica can be sorted with 98 %, 82 % and 87 % accuracies, respectively. When the seed lot was sorted into viable and non-viable (empty and petrified combined) classes, the predicted class membership reached 100 % for both classes. The technique could separate the hybrid larch seeds from pure parental seeds with 100 % accuracy. Seeds of B. pubescens and B. pendula were differentiated with 100 % and 99 % classification accuracy, respectively. Also, the overall classification accuracy among three B. pendula families was 93 % and that of B. pubescens was 98 %. NIR spectroscopy discriminated Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Polish and Lithuanian seed <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>P.</b> abies with 92 % - 100 % accuracy. Absorption bands that were accounted for distinguishing the various seed lots examined in this thesis were attributed to differences in seed color, moisture content and chemical composition of the seeds, presumably polysaccharides, proteins and fatty acids, which are the common seed storage reserves. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of Vis + NIR spectroscopy as a robust technique for sorting seed lots according to their viability and for certification of seed lots by species and origin. Thus, concerted efforts should be made to scale-up the technique to on-line sorting system for large-scale tree seed handling operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{sanitary}} {{quality of}} 26 lots commercial seeds of tropical forages, produced in different regions (2004 - 05 and 2005 - 06) was analyzed. The lots were composed of seeds of Panicum maximum ('Massai', 'Mombaça' e 'Tanzânia') and stylo ('Estilosantes Campo Grande' - ECG). Additionally, seeds of two <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>P.</b> maximum for exportation were analyzed. The blotter test was used, at 20 ºC under alternating light and darkness in a 12 h photoperiod, for seven days. The Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Rhizopus genus consisted the secondary or saprophytes fungi (FSS) with greatest frequency in P. maximum lots. In general, there was low incidence of these fungus in the seeds. In relation to pathogenic fungi (FP), it was detected high frequency of contaminated lots by Bipolaris, Curvularia, Fusarium and Phoma genus. Generally, there was {{high incidence of}} FP in P. maximum seeds. The occurrence of Phoma sp. was hight, because in 81 % of the lots showed incidence superior to 50 %. In 'ECG' seeds it was detected FSS (Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Penicillium genus) and FP (Bipolaris, Curvularia, Fusarium and Phoma genus), usually, in low incidence. FSS and FP were associated to P. maximum seeds for exportation, with significant incidence in some cases. The results {{indicated that there was}} a limiting factor in all producer regions regarding sanitary quality of the seeds. Sementes comerciais de forrageiras tropicais, pertencente a 26 lotes produzidos em diferentes regiões (safras 2004 - 05 e 2005 - 06), foram avaliadas quanto à sanidade. Foram analisadas sementes de cultivares de Panicum maximum (Massai, Mombaça e Tanzânia) e de estilosantes (Estilosantes Campo Grande – ECG). Adicionalmente, avaliou-se a qualidade sanitária de dois lotes de sementes de P. maximum destinados à exportação. Para isso, as sementes foram submetidas ao teste de papel de filtro em gerbox, os quais foram incubados a 20 ºC, com fotoperíodo de 12 h, durante sete dias. Os fungos saprófitos ou secundários (FSS) mais frequentemente detectados nos lotes de P. maximum foram Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp. e Rhizopus sp., os quais, em geral, apresentaram baixa incidência nas sementes. Quanto aos fungos patogênicos (FP), constatou-se elevado número de lotes contaminados pelos gêneros Bipolaris, Curvularia, Fusarium e Phoma. Em geral, foi elevada a incidência de FP nas sementes de P. maximum. A ocorrência de Phoma sp. foi a mais crítica, pois 81 % dos lotes registraram índices superiores a 50 %. Nas sementes de ‘ECG’ foram detectados FSS (gêneros Aspergillus, Cladosporium e Penicillium) e FP (gêneros Bipolaris, Curvularia, Fusarium e Phoma), os quais apresentaram, em geral, baixa incidência.

40|$|International audienceRecently, most {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) applications ignore traffic {{costs at}} {{internet service providers}} (ISPs), and thus generate {{a large amount of}} traffic crossing ISPs or autonomous systems (ASes) on the Internet. To reduce the cross-ISP/AS traffic, the existing approaches introduce network-aware strategies in which a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> modifications <b>of</b> <b>P</b> 2 P systems are required. In this paper, we propose a router-aided method for localizing P 2 P traffic hierarchically with multiple levels. By intentionally limiting the bandwidth of each connection path between peers based on geographical location of the peers' destinations, the traffic can be localized. Compared to the existing locality-enhancing approaches, our proposed method does not require dedicated servers, cooperation between ISPs and users, or any modification <b>of</b> existing <b>P</b> 2 P application software. Therefore, the proposal can be easily utilized by all types <b>of</b> <b>P</b> 2 P applications.

40|$|Purpose: To {{associate}} psychosocial {{and environmental}} factors with fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake of children (years 4 - 7) from a lower socio-economic school. Methods: Two questionnaires were used to explore preferences and knowledge about F&V. Questionnaires were completed in class and compared with self-completed 24 -hour diet diaries. All students (n= 114) completed the questionnaires. Parents (43 % participation) also were surveyed about their children's attitudes regarding F&V. Results: Diet diaries showed 41. 6 % reported consuming no fruit, vegetables or legumes during 24 hours. Several questions {{were significantly associated with}} reported fruit intake: "lots of fruit and vegetables at home?"(p = 0. 013), "Do you eat <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> fruit?" (<b>p</b> = 0. 009) and "Does your family eat <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> fruit?" (<b>p</b> = 0. 028). Girls and younger children showed more interest in fruit and vegetables in general. Banana (94. 7 %), apple (93. 6 %) and strawberry (90. 4 %) were correctly identified by 94. 7, 93. 6 and 90. 4 % of students, respectively. Lower rates were seen with starfruit (35. 1 %) and peach (41. 5 %). Children's interest in gardening waned with age, with 71. 4 %, 58. 1 %, 45 % and 18. 2 % being interested for grades 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively. Knowledge of peer fruit and vegetable preferences was low.
