40|$|Lean-burn engines {{offer the}} {{potential}} for significant fuel economy improvements in cars and trucks, perhaps the next great breakthrough in automotive technology that will enable greater savings in imported petroleum. The development of lean-burn engines, however, has been an elusive goal among automakers because of the emissions challenges associated with lead-burn engine technology. Presently, cars operate with sophisticated emissions control systems that require the engine's air-fuel ratio to be carefully controlled around the stoichiometric point (chemically correct mixture). Catalysts in these systems are called "three-way" catalysts because they can reduce hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions simultaneously, but {{only because of the}} tight control of the air-fuel ratio. The purpose of this cooperative effort is to develop advanced catalyst systems, materials, and necessary engine control algorithms for reducing NOX emissions in oxygen-rich automotive exhaust (as with <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engine</b> <b>technology)</b> to meet current and near-future mandated Clean Air Act standards. These developments will represent a breakthrough in both emission control technology and automobile efficiency. The total project is a joint effort among five national laboratories, together with US CAR. The role of Lockheed-Martin Energy Systems in the total project is two fold: characterization of catalyst performance through laboratory evaluations from bench-scale flow reactor tests to engine laboratory tests of full-scale prototype catalysts, and microstructural characterization of catalyst material before and after test stand and/or engine testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} scarce {{resources}} has advanced {{the development of}} more efficient <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engine</b> <b>technology</b> for power generation and transportation. Thus, the issue of NOx production and the need to monitor that production becomes increasingly important. To better understand NOx sensing, the potentiometric couple of La 2 CuO 4 and platinum across a yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrate was studied. Temperature programmed reaction and desorption studies were performed on powder samples to determine desorption strength and catalysis of NOx on La 2 CuO 4. A mass spectrometer with one part per billion resolution collected spectra for the experiments. NO gas proved non-reactive in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean conditions. NO 2 gas desorbed in multiple gas-phase products, and its reaction was catalytically activated by La 2 CuO 4. Adsorption of NOx was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflection configuration. Results indicated the presence of ionic nitrate and nitrite complexes providing substantial electronic charge separation in large quantities. Photoelectron peak splitting of the O 1 s oxygen orbital verified NO caused oxygen deprivation and increased resistivity, while NO 2 adsorption resulted in creation of electron holes and an overall decrease in resistivity. Oxygen isotope exchange was performed to determine the adsorption mechanism of NOx. Temperature programmed experiments using 18 O 2 gas over La 2 Cu 16 O 4 and La 2 Cu 18 O 4 identified bonding behavior and adsorption/desorption sequence of NOx. Formation surface complexes were found to occur exclusively with solid phase oxygen, but substitution of the primary oxygen in the complex was dependent on available thermal energy. It could be concluded that the oxygen exchange is a very important component of the overall sensor response, and that the adsorptive component plays a large role in the establishment of the potential between the electrodes. To adjust the adsorption equilibrium and modify sensor response, desorption experiments under external electric field bias were performed on a La 2 CuO 4 pellet. Initial bias, aging effects and increases in field strength were shown to change the desorption profile of NO and NO 2 gases {{from the surface of the}} La 2 CuO 4 pellet. A sensor utilizing a La 2 CuO 4 pellet with similar field generating structures was also constructed. It displayed sensitivity changes to NOx gases with changes in field voltage and bias...|$|E

50|$|Lean-burn {{refers to}} the burning of fuel with an excess of air in an {{internal}} combustion <b>engine.</b> In <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engines</b> the air:fuel ratio may be as lean as 65:1 (by mass). The air / fuel ratio needed to stoichiometrically combust fuel, by contrast, is 14.64:1. The excess of air in a <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engine</b> emits far more hydrocarbons (see Manufacturers Specifications ie. Waukesha 7042GSIrich 2g/Bhp-hp vs. Waukesha 7042GLlean 5.5g/Bhp-hp).

50|$|A {{catalytic}} converter is an emissions control device that converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas to less toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction (an oxidation {{and a reduction}} reaction). Catalytic converters are used with internal combustion engines fueled by either petrol (gasoline) or diesel—including <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engines</b> as well as kerosene heaters and stoves.|$|R
50|$|The main {{drawback}} of lean-burning is that {{a complex}} catalytic converter system is required to reduce NOx emissions. <b>Lean-burn</b> <b>engines</b> do not work well with modern 3-way catalytic converter—which require a pollutant balance at the exhaust port so they can carry out oxidation and reduction reactions—so most modern engines run {{at or near the}} stoichiometric point.|$|R
5000|$|Heavy-duty <b>lean-burn</b> gas <b>engines</b> admit {{twice as}} much [...] air than {{theoretically}} needed for complete combustion into the combustion chambers. The extremely weak air-fuel mixtures lead to lower combustion temperatures and therefore lower NOx formation. While <b>lean-burn</b> gas <b>engines</b> offer higher theoretical thermal efficiencies, transient response and performance may be compromised in certain situations. However, advances in fuel control and closed loop technology by companies like North American Repower have led to production of modern CARB certified lean burn heavy duty engines for use in commercial vehicle fleets. <b>Lean-burn</b> gas <b>engines</b> are almost always turbocharged, resulting in high power and torque figures not achievable with stoichiometric engines due to high combustion temperatures.|$|R

40|$|WOS: 000336310800002 International audienceThis study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} Residual Burnt Gas (RBG) field heterogeneity on Cycle-to-Cycle Variations (CCVs) under lean operation in Spark-Ignited (SI) engines. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) was {{used in conjunction with}} solving chemical kinetics for iso-octane/air mixtures to examine early premixed flame propagation. In SI engines, RBGs represent dilution by hot combustion products that remain from the previous engine cycle. Prior to investigating coupled effects, the opposing effects of temperature and dilution were first purposely isolated in order to quantify their respective contributions. To quantify the influence of RBG heterogeneity on actual engine CCVs, aerothermochemical conditions representative of low-load <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engine</b> operation were extracted from experimental data and engine large eddy simulation computations. Salient findings are as follows: (1) Standard RBG mixtures encountered in <b>lean-burn</b> SI <b>engines</b> increase laminar flame speeds because the positive effect of reactant temperature is dominant over the negative effect of dilution. (2) RBG heterogeneities create additional flame wrinkling even if no sensible enthalpy fluctuation is introduced. (3) For laminar flows, the statistical expansion of the flame kernel (averaged over multiple heterogeneity fields) occurs more quickly in heterogeneous mixtures than in homogeneous mixtures because of the non-linear laminar flame speed response to local temperature/dilution variations. (4) RBG heterogeneities encountered in <b>lean-burn</b> SI <b>engines</b> dramatically modify turbulent flame structures by either amplifying flame propagation in conducive conditions or quenching the flame when hostile conditions are encountered. (5) For turbulent flows, the statistical expansion of the flame kernel (averaged over multiple heterogeneity fields and turbulence draws) occurs more slowly in heterogeneous mixtures than in homogeneous mixtures because of the additional quenching that takes place when the flame encounters adverse thermodynamical conditions. (6) Typical RBG heterogeneities found in <b>lean-burn</b> SI <b>engines</b> lead to an additional cyclic variation in flame development of about 50 % compared with the isolated effect of turbulence...|$|R

40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{work done}} on a project intended to {{lower the cost of}} environmental compliance and expedite project permitting for Exploration and Production (E&P) operators by identifying, developing, testing, and commercializing emissions control and monitoring technologies. Promising technologies have already been identified and developed. Current work focuses on testing these promising technologies. Specifically, several technologies are being tested in the laboratory for application to <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engines</b> or fully characterized on-site for use with rich-burn engines. Upon completion of these tests, the most cost-effective and robust technologies will be tested in the field and commercialization will ensue. During this quarter, progress in laboratory testing for <b>lean-burn</b> <b>engines</b> was limited by maintenance issues on the KSU Ajax DP- 115. The difficulties that required maintenance to be performed will likely require that the 180 psig prototype valve be tested in the future, if possible. The maintenance was performed, and it is expected that the Ajax will be available for testing in the coming quarter. Although laboratory testing was slowed as a result of maintenance issues, progress in experimental characterization of technologies has been significant. NSCR systems will be characterized as applied to rich-burn engines on-site. This characterization will ensure high-quality data in final field testing on rich-burn engines and is considered to be essential, despite that the work requires the delay of official field testing until 2008.
