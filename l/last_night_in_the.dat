In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E

Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci set out for Switzerland, intending to board a plane and escape to Spain.

500|$|Comments from Darryl McDaniels, AKA DMC of Run-D.M.C., {{make this}} {{connection}} to the underground explicit: [...] "hat's exactly what we did. We didn't really think it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When {{a lot of the}} old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bronx!' ... So we said that we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes. We're gonna keep it real." ...|$|E
500|$|James {{spends much}} space {{in his review}} quoting Bates's account of the {{strangling}} fig, called the [...] "Murderer Liana or Sipo", which he uses to emphasize the [...] "struggle for existence" [...] between plants, as much as for animals. Bates explains how the fig grows rings around the [...] "victim" [...] tree, which eventually dies, leaving the [...] "selfish parasite clasping in its arms the lifeless and decaying body of its victim", so that the fig itself must quickly flower, fruit and die when its support fails. James observes that [...] "It is {{as much in the}} reflections that the varied phenomena under observation give rise to as in the descriptive portions that the value and charm of the book lie." [...] Unable to resist a final quotation, even after admitting he has [...] "overstepped our space", he cites Bates's description of his <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "country of perpetual summer", regretting he will have to live again in England with its [...] "gloomy winters" [...] and [...] "factory chimneys"; but after Bates has returned, he rediscovers [...] "how incomparably superior is civilized life" [...] which can nourish [...] "feelings, tastes and intellect".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Dreamer {{had a short}} {{feud with}} The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von), during which they [...] "broke" [...] Beulah's neck. In 1999, on their <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company, they cited this {{incident}} to get Dreamer to accept a challenge for the ECW Tag Team Championship they had won earlier in the night. He did accept, and got the title, but was paired with the unexpected partner Raven, who slid into the ring {{at the last second}} and made the pin. The team only lasted a short time before it dissolved, with Raven taking the title and choosing Mike Awesome as his new partner. He also, begrudgingly, became World Heavyweight Champion in 2000 by beating Tazz at CyberSlam, only to lose it to Justin Credible just 30minutes later.|$|E

2500|$|That summer, Link {{returned}} to Memphis where he resumed his feud with Jerry Lawler. In July 1985, {{he was awarded}} the NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship and lost the title to Lawler at the Mid-South Coliseum that same month. On July 22, he lost to Jerry Oski, Tojo Yamamoto and Jerry Jarrett in a 6-man tag team match with The Spoiler and Jerry Bryant. He and Bryant lost a tag team match to Yamamoto and Jarrett via disqualification the following week. In August, Link faced off in singles competition against Tracy Smothers and Yamamoto. Link would have a few more stints in Memphis over the next two years. On September 20, 1986, he was enlisted by [...] Larry Sharpe in a tag team match against former student Bam Bam Bigelow and Jerry Lawler.
