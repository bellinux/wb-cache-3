The approach is designed to simultaneously address the shortcomings and maintain the attractive features of detailed energy sector and general equilibrium models.

We illustrate the capabilities of this integrated bottom-up approach by analyzing the implications of (i) a carbon tax, (ii) <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> supply restrictions in order to exploit regional hydropower potential, and (iii) a combined policy where both carbon taxes and import liberalization are pursued. For the combined scenario, our results suggest substantial emissions reductions relative to Baseline at essentially no cost to economic growth but about a one percent reduction in employment. We conclude that a regional energy strategy, anchored in hydropower, represents a potentially inexpensive approach to decarbonizing the South African economy.

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of the Soviet Union's foreign trade potential would necessitate adopting a realistic exchange rate and increasing the foreign exchange retention quotas for direct and indirect exporters. It would also require reforms of domestic policies. The first prerequisite is the establishment of rational prices. Eventually, world market prices would {{be brought to bear}} on domestic prices in conjunction with the <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports,</b> but this will be a long process since the pent-up demand for imports, cannot be satisfied from available foreign exchange. It would further be necessary to decentralize decision making on foreign trade in enlarging the scope of firms that can directly trade abroad. The decentralization of decision making in foreign trade should be accompanied by decentralization in the domestic economy, to be complemented by the introduction of the profit motive and competition. In fact, rational prices, decentralization, profit maximization, incentives to managers, and competition are interdependent, and they will have to be pursued simultaneously for efficient resource allocation.

During the past decade, Tanzania has faced an unprecedented economic crisis, characterised by severe balance of payments disequilibrium, high inflation, and large government budget deficits. Population has grown more rapidly than gross domestic product. Shortages of consumer goods were widespread and intermittent food shortage had to be met by food imports. To tackle the economic crisis, government implemented several adjustment and stabilization programmes (Ndulu and Lipumba, 1986). These policies culminated in significant devaluation and the <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> financed by privately-owned foreign exchange. Restrictions on private trade b food grains were relaxed. In June 1986, the government adopted the World Bank and IMF-supported Economic Recovery Programme (ERP). The policy measures taken included a major devaluation and a crawling peg to correct future overvaluation, control of the growth of government expenditures to reduce and limit government borrowing from the banking system, increases in agricultural producer prices, and further relaxation of restrictions on private trade in major food grains. The policy thrust has been to adopt market-oriented policy instruments and to depend less on state-controlled procedures. Since 1984 government has further liberalized the economy.

They compare those results with the impact of Russian accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on income distribution and the poor. The model incorporates all 55, 000 households from the Russian Household Budget Survey as"real"households. Crucially, given the importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) <b>liberalization</b> as part <b>of</b> Russian WTO accession, the authors also include FDI and Dixit-Stiglitz endogenous productivity effects from <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> barriers against goods and FDI in services. The authors estimate that Russian WTO accession in the medium run will result in gains averaged over all Russian households equal to 7. 3 percent of Russian consumption (with a standard deviation of 2. 2 percent of consumption), with virtually all households gaining. They find that global free trade would result in a weighted average gain to households in Russia of 0. 2 percent of consumption, with a standard deviation of 0. 2 percent of consumption, while a successful completion of the Doha Development Agenda would result in a weighted average gain to households of - 0. 3 percent of consumption (with a standard deviation of 0. 2 percent of consumption). Russia, as a net food importer, loses from subsidy elimination, and the gains to Russia from tariff cuts in other countries are too small to offset these losses. The results strongly support the view that Russia's own liberalization is more important than improvements in market access as a result of reforms in tariffs or subsidies in the rest of the world. Foremost among the own reforms is <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> barriers against FDI in business services.

40|$|The authors use an {{accelerator}} {{model to}} assess the determinants of private investment and to analyze how adjustment policies affect those determinants. Their model emphasizes the effect of resource constraints on private investment behavior, including that arising from foreign exchange rationing. Econometric estimation of the investment model with Kenyan data for 1968 - 88 suggests that Kenya's failure to implement adjustment policies {{after the collapse of}} the coffee boom and the breakup of the East African common market reduced private investment sharply in the 1980 s. The authors argue that inadequate fiscal adjustment was a key failure of policy. With direct competition between public and private sectors for limited financial resources, fiscal deficits preempted funds and restricted private investor's access to them. In addition, when cuts in government spending were undertaken to contain deficits, they fell disproportionately on capital expenditure, especially on physical infrastructure. Though real depreciation is found to have a direct negative impact on investment, the authors use simulations to show that it has a positive indirect effect on private investment in the medium term because such depreciation relaxes the foreign exchange constraint on imports. They conclude that efficient fiscal adjustment and <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> will be critical for the recovery of private investment in Kenya.

A Comparative Analysis of the EU-Morocco FTA vs. Multilateral Liberalization _____________________________________________________________________________________ An applied general equilibrium model with oligopoly and scale economies, based on detailed plant-level data, is used to contrast the impacts of the Morocco-EU free trade area (FTA) to multilateral trade liberalization on Morocco’s economy. Simulation {{results show that the}} FTA agreement is likely to have adverse effects on Morocco due to: (a) deteriorating terms of trade, (b) reductions in output per firm in industries dominated by scale economies, (c) diversion of imports away from relatively low cost, non-EU suppliers, and (d) potentially adverse effects on the aggregate demand for labor which could exacerbate already high levels of unemployment. We contrast this FTA with a multilateral liberalization scenario along the lines of those proposed under the Doha Development Round and find this to be more beneficial to Morocco, despite the associated income transfer from the EU to Morocco.

30|$|The {{international}} environment {{is very important}} {{from the point of}} view of certain categories of businesses. It is particularly important for industries directly depending on imports or exports and import-competing industries. For example, a recession in foreign markets, or the adoption of protectionist policies by foreign nations, may create difficulties for industries depending on exports. On the other hand, a boom in the export market or a relaxation of the protectionist policies may help the export-oriented industries (Coulter et al. 2008). A <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> may help some industries which use imported items but may adversely affect import-competing industries. It has been observed that major international developments have their spread effects on domestic businesses. The last economic recession in the global world sent its shock waves to a number of other countries. Oil price hikes seriously affected a number of economies, and these hikes increased the cost of production and the prices of certain products. The high oil price has led to an increase in the demand for automobile models that economize fuel consumption. Therefore, a good understanding of export market enables a firm to develop a more profitable product mix and to consolidate its position in the domestic market. Many companies now plan production capacities and investment taking into account also the foreign markets. Export marketing facilitates the attainment of optimum capacity utilization; a company may be able to mitigate the effects of domestic recession by exporting. However, a company which depends on the export market to a considerable extent also faces the impact of adverse developments in foreign markets.|$|E

Modeling problems associated with these policies include the change from a quota to a tariff and {{the choice of a}} tariff reduction path. A proposed formula for the adjustment path of the tariff reduction is designed to buffer the transfer of world price volatility while achieving the goal of reducing trade barriers;Problems associated with the incorporation of meat demand systems derived from utility-maximizing behavior into livestock policy models are examined. These problems include complementarity, issues of aggregation, levels of substitutability, and estimation problems. The changes in the degree of producer supply responsiveness under alternative policies are also discussed. An econometric model of the Japanese livestock industry is then used to simulate the impact of the BMAA, the GATT tariff reduction proposal, and the complete <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> beef <b>imports</b> from 1988 to 1997;The projected levels <b>of</b> beef <b>imports</b> under the alternative import policies suggest that the potential market for beef in Japan will be over 1. 6 million mt by 1991 and over 2 million mt by 1997.

During the post-transition phase, an additional 20 percent tariff provision will be invoked. Beef imports are projected to increase by over 67 percent in 1991 under the BMAA and to reach 1. 232 million mt by 1997. The BMAA and the GATT tariff reduction results are similar until 1994 when the BMAA tariff levels off at 50 percent...|$|R
40|$|Concerns about {{external}} debt and energy security have motivated several {{developing countries to}} develop biological technologies to substitute for petrochemical inputs. This paper examines the economic feasibility of azolla {{as a source of}} nitrogen in Philippine rice production. Green manuring with azolla is found not to be cost effective. Substantial savings from intercropping with azolla can be realized only if the cost of nitrogen from azolla is compared with the price of nitrogen from ammonium sulfate, but not if urea is used as the basis of comparison. Farmers would benefit more from <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> controls on urea. Additional research is needed to develop appropriate chemical-saving systems before investing heavily in extension. Key words: biological technology, fertilizer policy, rice production. Levels of living in Southeast and parts of South Asia depend critically on the production of rice. Rice production in these countries has grown roughly one percent faster than popula-tion during the 1970 s and early 1980 s. Most of this growth is due to the use of high yield varieties (HYV s) and to the increased invest-ments in irrigation and use of fertilizer. Fears have arisen recently that continued growth in rice production may be threatened by the growing dependence on petrolum-based chem-ical fertilizer. Despite the recent decline of relative petro-leum prices, there remains a concern that con-tinued reliance on exhaustible resources may be "ecologically imprudent " in the long run (Falcon, p. 184, Norgaard). In addition, the balance of payments and debt problems of oil-importing developing countries have moti-vated them to search for import substitutes.
