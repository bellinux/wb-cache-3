5|$|By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in {{particular}} Bingham's teachings, had become the de facto state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize. In December1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> a ship, the Waverly, bound for North America. Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.|$|E

5|$|In November, the {{squadron}} {{was transferred to}} the Balkans to help the Greek Air Force oppose the Italian invasion. On 8 November, {{the squadron}} and its new Gladiator IIs moved from their base at Sidi Haneish to Abu Suweir. There the pilots were granted two days <b>leave.</b> <b>On</b> 16 November 1940, the squadron arrived in Athens and moved to airfields north of the capital. Pattle's aerodrome was situated at Eleusis. They stayed to organise the squadron into flights but moved to the Albanian–Greek border town of Trikkala hours later.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{were awarded}} in each weight class. In baseball, {{atypical}} rainfall {{during the games}} forced the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games to rearrange the schedule, and the competition for the bronze medal never took place. Mexico had to <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> the previously assigned date without playing for the third position. Therefore, the technical delegate ruled that Mexico and Nicaragua were each to be awarded a bronze medal.|$|E
50|$|Helianthus tuberosus is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{growing to}} 1.5 - 3 m tall with opposite <b>leaves</b> <b>on</b> {{the upper part}} of the stem but alternate below.

50|$|Stems are green. The {{leaves are}} large, alternate, and are of two types: palmately lobed {{juvenile}} <b>leaves</b> <b>on</b> creeping and climbing stems, and unlobed cordate adult <b>leaves</b> <b>on</b> fertile flowering stems exposed to full sun (usually {{high in the}} crowns of trees or the top of rock faces).|$|R
5|$|Nicol {{attended}} Chantry High School but {{had left}} home at 16 {{to live in}} a hostel, working as a prostitute to fund her addiction to heroin and cocaine. She had originally worked in massage parlours, but was asked to <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> suspicion that she was using drugs. Her mother was unaware she was a prostitute, and thought she had been working in a bar or a hairdresser's.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Division's {{role in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein {{ended on}} 5 November 1942. From 30 November the {{division}} travelled to Palestine by road, and all its units arrived there by 9 December. After settling into camps located between Gaza and Qastina, the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training, and many soldiers were granted <b>leave.</b> <b>On</b> 22 December, a formal parade involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Voss signed {{himself out}} on <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> his authority as Staffelführer.

From the 15th to the 17th, {{he was at the}} Fokker factory in Schwerin; he was accompanied by his girlfriend Ilse. His leave authorization also cleared him for Düsseldorf and his hometown of Krefeld, but it is unknown if he visited them. In any case, he returned to duty on 22 September 1917.|$|E

5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to <b>leave,</b> <b>on</b> the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|David and Cowan {{finally left}} Antibes in May 1940, sailing to Corsica {{and then to}} Sicily. They had reached the Strait of Messina when Italy entered the war on 10 June. They were {{suspected}} of spying and were interned. After 19 days in custody {{in various parts of}} Italy, they were allowed to cross the border into Yugoslavia, which at that point remained neutral and non-combatant. They had lost almost everything they owned—the boat, money, manuscripts, notebooks, and David's cherished collection of recipes. With the help of the British Consul in Zagreb, they crossed into Greece, and arrived in Athens in July 1940. By this time, David was no longer in love with her partner but remained with him from necessity. Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of Syros, where David learnt to cook with the fresh ingredients available locally. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, the couple managed to <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> a civilian convoy to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{involvement}} at Pozières and Mouquet Farm, the 12th Battalion {{was briefly}} {{transferred to the}} Ypres sector in Belgium in September, before returning to Bernafay Wood on the Somme late the following month. Newland {{was admitted to the}} 38th Casualty Clearing Station with pyrexia on 4 December. He was moved to the 2nd General Hospital at Le Havre, and returned to the 12th Battalion two weeks later following recuperation. On the same day, he was attached to the headquarters of the 2nd Australian Brigade for duty as a staff officer. He was granted <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> 21 January 1917 on completion of this stint.|$|E
5|$|In June 1917, Stewart {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in {{recognition}} of his leadership of his battalion during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette in September the previous year. He had planned and executed an attack by his battalion on German-held trenches and, once the objective was captured, organised its defence against several counterattacks. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO six months later, for his efforts during the Battle of Messines during which he was wounded. His injuries were severe, due to eight separate shrapnel wounds, and he was evacuated to London for treatment. Returning to the field in late 1917, he was temporary commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade at various times during 1918 while its regular commander was on leave or employed elsewhere. While on <b>leave,</b> <b>on</b> 21 February 1918, Stewart married Alexandrina Kathleen Johnston at Uttoxeter, in the county of Staffordshire in England.|$|E
5|$|Joan Marie Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the {{navigator}} of the Nostromo and {{the only}} other woman on the ship besides Ripley. Disinclined to take risks beyond her console, she resents being chosen {{as part of the}} team to explore the Derelict. After Kane's infestation by the facehugger, she berates Ripley for refusing to allow her {{and the rest of the}} team aboard. When the Alien begins to kill her crew, Lambert insists that they evacuate the Nostromo. While preparing to <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> a shuttle, Lambert and Parker are confronted by the Alien which kills them. During Ripley's ICC tribunal, fifty-seven years after the first incident, a screen details the deceased members of the Nostromo crew (including Lambert, who is revealed as a trans woman).|$|E

5|$|Nolan {{then became}} a staff officer, joining the staff of General George Berkeley, {{commander-in-chief}} in Madras, as an aide-de-camp in January 1849. He quickly became close friends with Berkeley's two sons, Charles and George, who were also enthusiastic about horse-racing. In 1850 Nolan accompanied Berkeley {{on a tour of}} the region, conducting horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was also promoted, purchasing a Captaincy on 8 March. Despite these successes, Nolan recognised that his prospects were far more limited in India than in England, and he could not afford the increased costs of serving in the colonies. At the same time, service in India was not taken seriously by many of the officers in high command, and would not be sufficient on its own to advance him. Accordingly, he obtained two years sick <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> 16 January 1851 and returned to England, intending to tour Europe and write a book on cavalry theory.|$|E
5|$|Robert Anderson was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, {{who was in charge}} of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard. A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} Harel brigade made <b>leave</b> <b>on</b> {{foot from}} Bab al-Oued but took a wrong way and mistakenly {{attacked}} Hill 315. Located by the Jordanian sentries, they launch the attack of the hill. The Legionnaires were outnumbered but counterattacked with violence, going as far as requiring an artillery bombing on their own position. The Israelis suffered some heavy losses. When the Yiftach arrived {{at the bottom of}} Hill 346, they are targeted by firearms, grenades and artillery. Thinking that Harel men were there, they called by radio to the headquarters to ceasefire, and laid down arms. They refused, not believing that account of the events and Harel soldiers stayed in place.|$|E
