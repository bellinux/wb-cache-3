5|$|After World War I, {{in which}} {{approximately}} one million Indians served, a new period began. It {{was marked by}} British reforms but also repressive <b>legislations,</b> by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by {{the beginnings of a}} nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The Directive Principles {{have been}} used to uphold the Constitutional {{validity}} of <b>legislations</b> in case of a conflict with the Fundamental Rights. Article 31C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Article 39(b)–(c) would not be invalid {{on the grounds that they}} derogated from the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1970, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has adopted the view of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the effects of {{industry}} regulation on worker earnings are reconsidered using a wider array of industries and differentiating between industry-opposed and industry-supported <b>legislation.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Primary data from the Current Population Surveys are used in this paper with data on regulatory <b>legislation</b> from Cahan and Kaempfer. A difference-in-difference approach is used to compare wage changes pre- and post-legislation, in industries with opposed or supported <b>legislation,</b> with those unaffected by <b>legislation.</b> The relative contribution of union and non-union wage changes to the overall wage changes are also examined. Findings – The paper finds that regulatory <b>legislation</b> opposed by the industry did not affect earnings growth relative to industries not subject to regulatory <b>legislation.</b> <b>Legislation</b> supported by the industry led to slower relative earnings growth. Union wage differentials increased in industries with <b>legislation</b> regardless of industry opposition or support. Relative earnings declined among non-union workers in industries that received <b>legislation.</b> The effects vary across industries with the results suggesting that some <b>legislation</b> led to increased product competition, while some <b>legislation</b> affected labor market competition. Research limitations/implications – The paper shows that data on regulatory <b>legislation</b> are limited by the lack of detailed information. For example, it is only known whether <b>legislation</b> was passed that was opposed or supported by the industry. Future research should replicate this analysis with more complete data. Practical implications – Also the paper sees that regulatory <b>legislation</b> does not need to completely regulate or deregulate an industry to affect workers. As such, policy makers should consider the effects of proposed <b>legislation</b> on workers in the affected industries. Originality/value – This paper directly tests whether the wage effects from regulation differ depending on industry opposition or support for the <b>legislation.</b> As such, this paper is innovative because it differentiates between different types of <b>legislation</b> in examining the effect of <b>legislation</b> on wages and the union differentials.
