The present study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of the fly ash along with <b>lime</b> precipitated waste <b>sludge</b> and cement. The Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests were carried out on the specimens comprising of fly ash (FA), (5 to 35 %) lime precipitated electroplating waste sludge (S) and (2 - 20 %) cement at 7 and 28 days of curing periods. The results of UCS tests indicated that the strength of fly ash increases substantially on addition of <b>lime</b> precipitated <b>sludge</b> and cement. It has been observed that compressive strengths of cement stabilized fly ash were smaller than the cement-sludge stabilized mix. It has also been observed that the strength was increasing upto 20 % sludge addition to fly ash-cement mix, however, the strength started decreasing on further addition of sludge beyond 20 % to the fly ash-cement combination. The most effective percentage of fly ash-cement-sludge was found as 72 %FA+ 20 %S+ 8 %C. The UCS of this mix was found as 18 and 25 MPa at 7 and 28 days of curing respectively. This is substantially higher than the UCS of plain fly ash (1. 0 and 2. 5 MPa) at the same curing periods respectively.

Lime was used at various ratios and the mixture was stabilized for 30 days. During the lime hydrated stabilization pH values were significantly increased from 7 to 12. 5. Also, aerobic digester was loaded with raw sludge and mixed by sufficient amount of air for 30 days. The results indicate that the lime addition with the dose of 0. 4 g Ca(OH) 2 g - 1 DS could completely inactive a high amount of fecal coliforms within 1 h and in all of the times was lower than 1000 MPN g - 1 DS after 30 days (p< 0. 01).

In this research, <b>lime</b> <b>sludge</b> (LS) was investigated as an alternative stabilizer due to the benefits of using waste materials and the uncertain future of fly ash and PC. For this purpose, LS was used alone and with other stabilizers for soil stabilization, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS), freeze-thaw (F-T), wet-dry (W-D) tests and swelling test under F-T were conducted. The UCS test results of the specimens cured up to 90 days showed that LS can be used alone to increase the strength of soil. The UCS test results of 7 -day cured specimens pointed out LS can be mixed with CF and FF for further increase in strength. Using LS and PC together decreased the effect of PC because of a low pH environment. F-T test results of 7 -day cured specimens showed that relatively higher strength losses were observed in the open system compared to the closed one. In addition, test results showed that there were no considerable benefits of using LS either alone or with other stabilizers on F-T durability.

To maintain optimum pH during biooxidation of pyrite the acid produced has to be neutralised. Batch bioleaching was performed on a pyrite concentrate in 1 -L reactors, using a mixed mesophilic culture at a temperature of 35 ºC. Neutralising agents were added regularly to ad-just pH to the desired level of 1. 5. The ashes used were Bioash, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash, representing ashes gen-erated from combustion of biomass, a mixture of wood chips and municipal waste, and a mixture of coal and tyres. The dust used was an EAF dust produced in a scrap-based steel plant, while the sludge used was Mesalime produced in a pa-per and pulp plant.

Some of the by-products used contained potentially toxic elements for the bacteria, like fluoride, chromium and vanadium, but no negative effect of these elements could be observed on the bacterial activity. The Waste ash contained a large number potentially toxic elements and a high chloride concentration of 11 %, which had a negative effect as observed on the lower redox potential and leaching yield. Slags originating from stainless steel production should be avoided for environmental reasons, due to the presence of chromium. The electric arc furnace (EAF) dust has a good potential to be used as neutralising agent in bioleaching processes for zinc recovery from zinc sulphides, due to the high content of zinc, however the chlorides present should be removed prior to its use. The neutralising capacity, as determined by the amount needed for neutralisation during bioleaching, were rather high for all the steel slags, EAF dust, Bioash and Mesalime with a range of 16 - 37 g as compared with 22 g needed for slaked lime. However, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash had lower neutralising capacities with 81 g and 57 g needed, respectively. Hence, it is concluded that considerable savings in operational costs can be obtained by replacement of lime or limestone with steel slag, ash, dust or sludge without negative impact on bioleaching efficiency. Use of industrial oxidic by-products would provide opportunities to recycle elements present in them as for example zinc rendering an eco-friendly process and a means for sustainable use of natural resources.

30|$|Waste Fe(III)/Cr(III) OH. Adsorption {{has gained}} wide {{acceptance}} and popularity {{for the removal}} of phenolic compounds including industrial solid wastes[149]. Chromium(VI) compounds are used as corrosion inhibitors in cooling water systems in industries. Fe(II), which is generated electrolytically, reduces chromium(VI) in wastewater to Cr(III) under acidic conditions[150]. The Fe(III)/Cr(III) ions, produced in solution, are precipitated as Fe(III)/Cr(III) hydroxide by the use of <b>lime.</b> The resultant <b>sludge</b> is discarded as waste by the industries. Waste Fe(III)/Cr(III) hydroxide has been investigated in the laboratory {{for the removal of}} heavy metals[151], dyes, and pesticides[152]. The percentage C removal at equilibrium decreased from 80 % to 65 % as the Co increased from 10 to 40 mg/l onto ‘waste’ Fe(III)/Cr(III) hydroxide[53].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Neutralisation of Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) {{by adding}} an {{alkaline}} reagent produces sludges generally dominated by amorphous ferrihydrite, often {{with high levels}} of adsorbed heavy metals. The effect of neutralisation method and reagent on the long-term chemical stability of these treatment sludges was investigated experimentally using a relatively oxidised synthetic ARD (containing Fe[~ 70 % Fe + 3], Al, Cu and Zn) with a variety of reagents and processes, and two reduced synthetic ARD compositions (Fe + 2, Al, Cu and Zn; Fe + 2, Cu and Zn) treated with hydrated <b>lime.</b> The <b>sludges</b> were all subjected to kinetic testing to determine the rate of Cu and Zn release at pH 4, simulating disposal in a moderately acidic pit lake. All sludges precipitated from the oxidised ARD by standard ARD neutralisation procedures and reagents (lime, limestone, Bauxsol, KB- 1 and HDS lime) showed similar chemical stability, with an initial rapid rate of release of Cu and Zn (~ 50 % of leaching in the first 5 minutes) that reduced over time, apparently exponentially. The Cu and Zn are adsorbed onto the surface of the amorphous ferrihydrite present...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludge is {{inevitable}} end by-product of sewage treatment. Land application provides a cost-effective alternative for sewage sludge disposal. However, {{the release of}} contaminants from sewage sludge amended soils is {{a major source of}} water quality impairment. Therefore, sewage sludge immobilization seems necessary. In this work, red mud and lime were explored to immobilize the contaminants of sewage sludge. The results showed that red mud and lime could reduce the contaminants release. The results of XRD showed that there were no detectable changes in the mineralogy of sewage sludge after chemical amendments. EDX spectra of many red mud amended sewage sludge particles contained large Al peaks and <b>lime</b> amended sewage <b>sludge</b> particles contained large Ca peaks, while untreated sewage sludge particles showed little Al and Ca...|$|R
