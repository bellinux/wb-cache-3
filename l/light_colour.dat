5|$|Tourism has {{now become}} the town's main industry. Initially {{attracted}} by its associations with the Skagen Painters, well-to-do visitors sought to benefit from its special <b>light,</b> <b>colour</b> and its fishermen. Their interest led to new hotels, summer houses and expensive villas. The old fishing village {{was transformed into a}} miniature city with fine streets lined with boutiques. From the 1960s, it became increasingly fashionable for the upper-classes to spend their summers in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of <b>light.</b> <b>Colour</b> vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E

60|$|Effect of colour on {{warmth of}} clothing.--Dark colours become hotter than <b>light</b> <b>colours</b> in the sunshine, {{but they are}} not hotter under any other circumstances. Consequently a person who aims at equable temperature, should wear <b>light</b> <b>colours.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>colours</b> are far the best for {{sporting}} purposes, as they are usually much less conspicuous than black or rifle-green. Almost all wild beasts are tawny or fawn-coloured, or tabby, or of some nondescript hue and pattern: if an animal were born with a more decided colour, he would soon perish for want of ability to conceal himself.|$|R

25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is often so {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be thin as a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a <b>light</b> <b>colour</b> and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori people use the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, a {{group of}} Melbourne artists formed the first {{distinctive}} Australian school of painting. Named the Heidelberg School, and latterly described as Australian Impressionism, the movement's four prinicple artists were Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder and Frederick McCubbin. Together they painted en plein air at artists' camps set up around Melbourne's rural suburbs, including Box Hill and Heidelberg, allowing them to capture the unique <b>light,</b> <b>colour</b> and atmosphere of the Australian bush. Many of the group's most famous works from this period are large-scale sunlit landscapes and pastoral figure subjects, however they also explored Melbourne's urban scenery, local history (including pioneer and bushranger themes), beaches (often along Port Phillip Bay at Mentone, Sandringham and Beaumaris), and did portraits of wealthy Melburnians from their inner-city studios. In 1889 they staged the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition opposite the Melbourne Town Hall. It {{is regarded as a}} landmark event in Australian art history.|$|E
25|$|The topmost Jurassic {{layer is}} called the White Jurassic due to its <b>light</b> <b>colour.</b> These layers can be up to 400m thick in the Franconian Jura, but at Hesselberg they are mostly ablated; only 85m is left. The rocks of the Malm are partly sediments and partly formed from reefs of ancient sea sponges. This rock is widely {{distributed}} on the main peak. The light-coloured lime of the White Jurassic was a popular building material for houses (burnt lime) and for road construction (rubble). The depressions on the western plateau are caused by these excavations. The lowest layers form the Impressa-layers (low Malm alpha), which are approximately 25m thick, and the Bimammatum-lime (high Malm alpha). The old name of the Planula-lime (Malm beta) is factory lime, which indicates the use as building material. This layer, which is 15m thick and interspersed with sponge reefs, forms the plateau of the Osterwiese. The small quarry below the main peak consists of Planula-lime in its lower part, and the Ataxiocerate's layer (Malm gamma) in its upper, which builds up the main peak and is 20m thick. The top layer of Malm gamma and the layers of Malm delta to Malm zeta have already been eroded away on Hesselberg.|$|E

500|$|The volcano is {{just south}} of Sairecabur, a group of volcanoes which rises to [...] and is an {{apparent}} source of recent volcanic activity. East of Licancabur is its companion volcano, Juriques. This -high volcano has a large——deep crater and is considered a parasitic cone. West-east alignments of volcanoes like Licancabur and Juriques are common in the region, due to tectonic influences. Araral, Cerro Cabana, Cerro Canapa, Cerros de Tocorpuri, Cerro Linzor, Inacaliri, Inca, Jardin, Putana, Volcan Tatio and Zapaleri are other volcanoes in the neighbourhood of Licancabur. Nineteen kilometres (12 miles) southeast, the volcanic chain continues with Tocol, the Purico Complex and the -high Llullaillaco. Volcanoes in the Puna de Atacama formed during the Pliocene on Tertiary dacite, liparite and rhyolite ignimbrites. These rocks have a <b>light</b> <b>colour,</b> due to the rhyolite. Licancabur was formed over 1.35-million-year-old Purico, La Pacana and Chaxas ignimbrite. The Chaxas ignimbrite erupted 1.09 ±0.56million years ago.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, {{theatrical}} designer Oliver Messel made {{a number}} of notable changes to the interior of the hotel. He incorporated aspects of theatrical design into the hotel interior, and designed the lavish apartments on the 7th and 8th floors. As Country Life documented, Messel's rooms at the hotel [...] "represents a rare glimpse into the world of mid-20th-century interior design", in which he drew upon his skills as a theatre designer to fill his rooms with [...] "tricks of space and <b>light,</b> <b>colour</b> and period reference". Today one of the suites is named after him, the Oliver Messel Suite. This suite displays a remarkable Georgian country house ambiance. Messel made the changes on the Deanery Side of the building in 1952/3. Oliver Frederick Ford served as consultant designer from 1962, decorating both the Stanhope Suite and the Orchid Room, a corner of which was completely re-built and decorated in the English rococo style. He also remodelled the white, gold, and green entrance hall. The current dark green staff uniform of The Dorchester was designed in 1980 and is also attributed to Ford.|$|E
500|$|Beyond Han's sculptures which embrace organic forms, she {{has also}} {{designed}} geometric pieces. Four Dimensions (1993) {{was made up of}} ten geometrical structures, including single objects (such as Tetrahedron–Tetrahedron Interpenetration) and opened-up planes (Cubic Triangle) connected with each other through the use of angles, and light and shadow. Han said: [...] "My works are based on the concept of mathematical logic. The idea is to show how each step is based on the previous one so that the geometrical forms progress in logical sequence ... The fourth dimension is abstract. It cannot be seen or touched. It contains the feelings and talents of Mankind. We wish to possess this space and to open it up for all people to share." [...] Sabapathy was somewhat critical of these works, saying that they dealt only with techniques and fabrication and did not [...] "disclose fresh insights into space and its articulation". He expressed the hope that Han would stay the course and deepen her investigation beyond form into an exploration of <b>light,</b> <b>colour</b> and materials to [...] "create environments in which form, space and time can be seen to be related in ever-changing yet intelligent systems".|$|E

500|$|As well as lavish illumination, {{the period}} saw the {{development}} of a distinct English tradition of line drawing in manuscripts, sometimes with the addition of <b>light</b> <b>colour</b> in ink or wash (watercolour), often to reinforce ink in highlighting outlines. This is often divided into two rather different sub-styles. These also developed from continental styles [...] one of which, sometimes referred to as the [...] "Utrecht style", was influenced strongly by the presence in Canterbury from around 1000 of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, where each psalm is illustrated with a panoramic ink drawing full of tiny figures. The Harley Psalter from Canterbury (probably 1020s) is a copy, with differences in style such as the addition of coloured washes. Dunstan was himself an artist, as were many monks who rose to senior positions, and the earliest datable outline drawing is probably by him, and includes a portrait of him prostrating himself before Christ. This was added to a blank page in an older book, probably before his exile in 956. The other [...] "Winchester" [...] style of drawing can be characterised by detailed and agitated drapery, an effect sometimes taken to excess, but giving animation to figures. The skilled use of line drawing continued to be a feature of English art for centuries, for example in the Eadwine Psalter (Canterbury, probably 1150s) and the work of Matthew Paris, monk of St Albans (c. 1200 – 1259) and his followers.|$|E

Notwithstanding much marvellous deadpan humour, this is one of their darkest efforts." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to one critic, modernism {{developed}} out of Romanticism's {{revolt against}} {{the effects of the}} Industrial Revolution and bourgeois values: [...] "The ground motive of modernism, Graff asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism." [...] While J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), one of the greatest landscape painters of the 19th century, {{was a member of the}} Romantic movement, as [...] "a pioneer in the study of <b>light,</b> <b>colour,</b> and atmosphere", he [...] "anticipated the French Impressionists" [...] and therefore modernism [...] "in breaking down conventional formulas of representation; [...] unlike them, he believed that his works should always express significant historical, mythological, literary, or other narrative themes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1802 he {{made his}} debut at the Salon with Portrait of a Woman (the current {{whereabouts}} of which is unknown). Between 1804 and 1806 he painted a series of portraits which were striking for their extreme precision, particularly in the richness of their fabrics and tiny details. [...] These included the Portrait of Philipbert Riviére (1805), Portrait of Sabine Rivière (1805–06), Portrait of Madame Aymon (also known as La Belle Zélie; 1806), and Portrait of Caroline Rivière (1805–06). [...] The female faces were not at all detailed but were softened, and were notable for their large oval eyes and delicate flesh colours and their rather dreamlike expressions. His portraits typically had simple backgrounds of solid dark or <b>light</b> <b>colour,</b> or of sky. These were {{the beginning of a}} series that would make him among the most celebrated portrait artists of the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|The Quaestiones {{contains}} {{notes from}} Newton's thorough reading of Descartes, Walter Charlton's translation of Gassendi into English, Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Robert Boyle, Thomas Hobbes, Kenelm Digby, Joseph Glanvill and Henry More, and others. These were set down under 45 section headings {{which he used}} to organise his readings. They began {{with the nature of}} matter, place, time and motion and went on to the organisation of the universe. This was followed by what would be classed today as properties of condensed matter, for example, rarity, fluidity, hardness etc. These were followed by questions on violent motion, <b>light,</b> <b>colour,</b> vision, and other sensations. The last part contains miscellaneous topics which presumably occurred to him later during his readings: [...] "Of God", [...] "Of ye Creation", [...] "Of ye soule" [...] and [...] "Of Sleepe and Dreams &c". Some headings were followed by vast entries, which had to be continued elsewhere; others were blank. The earlier essays were organised into questions and outlines of possible experiments which roughly fit into modern notions of science, not the broader ancient notion of philosophy.|$|E

The altar table, of carved timber panels, features gilded lettering – [...] "TO THE DEAR MEMORY OF THOSE WHO SERVED IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-18" [...] – {{across the front}} face. A sanctuary lamp is suspended over the altar. Various early timber items including chairs, tables, and psalm and hymn boards are found throughout the church and vestries. The timber altar rails remain within the chancel; however these and the altar table have been moved from their original positions. Other notable items within the chancel include: the foundation stone set into the eastern wall and a concrete plaque with a red Canterbury cross on the western wall, commemorating the consecration {{of the church in}} 1937. Facing the nave from {{the eastern side of the}} chancel steps is a raised octagonal brick pulpit finished with a rendered base and capping, while on the western side is a movable brass lectern topped by an eagle.
