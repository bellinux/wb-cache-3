40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{investigated}} the role of <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> cognitive function in the subsequent loss of independence in activities of daily living. METHODS. Of the 678 elderly nuns who-completed cognitive and physical function assessments in 1992 / 93, 575 were reassessed in 1993 / 94. Mini-Mental State Examination scores were divided into three categories and related to loss of independence in six activities of daily living. RESULTS. Participants with <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> cognitive function at first assessment had twice {{the risk of losing}} independence in three activities of daily living by second assessment relative to those with high normal cognitive function. This relationship was largely due to a progression from <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> cognitive function at first assessment to impaired cognitive function at second assessment and was associated with an elevated risk of losing independence in the six activities. CONCLUSIONS. Progression from <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> to impaired cognitive function was associated with loss of independence in activities of daily living. Thus <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> cognitive function could be viewed as an early warning of impending cognitive impairment and loss of physical function...|$|R

5000|$|The Woodlark Basin {{is one of}} {{very few}} places on the earth to have active <b>low</b> angle <b>normal</b> faults.

BackgroundThe {{associations of}} borderline and <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> ABI with functional decline are unknown. MethodsThe 666 participants included 412 with {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD). Participants were categorized as follows: severe PAD (ABI < 0. 50), moderate PAD (ABI 0. 50 to 0. 69), mild PAD (ABI 0. 70 to 0. 89), borderline ABI (0. 90 to 0. 99), <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> ABI (1. 00 to 1. 09), and normal ABI (ABI 1. 10 to 1. 30). Outcomes were assessed annually for 5 years. Mobility loss was defined as loss {{of the ability to}} walk one-quarter mile or walk up and down 1 flight of stairs without assistance among participants without baseline mobility impairment. Becoming unable to walk for 6 min continuously was defined as stopping during the 6 -min walk at follow-up among those who walked for 6 min continuously at baseline. Results were adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, and other confounders. ResultsHazard ratios (HRs) for mobility loss according to ABI category were as follows: severe PAD, HR: 4. 16 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 58 to 10. 92); moderate PAD, HR: 3. 82 (95 % CI: 1. 66 to 8. 81); mild PAD, HR: 3. 22 (95 % CI: 1. 43 to 7. 21); borderline ABI, HR: 3. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 21 to 7. 84); and <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> ABI, HR: 2. 61 (95 % CI: 1. 08 to 6. 32; p trend = 0. 0018). Similar associations were observed for becoming unable to walk for 6 min continuously (p trend < 0. 0001). ConclusionsAt 5 -year follow-up, persons with borderline ABI values have a higher incidence of mobility loss and becoming unable to walk for 6 min continuously compared with persons who have a normal baseline ABI.

40|$|Slopes {{of sandy}} soil such as {{decomposed}} granite soil {{are susceptible to}} be suffered from damages when they are inundated by rainfalls. One of causes of such shallow slips is attributed to the decreasing of shear strength of the soil due to submergence. Another noteworthy characteristic of this soil is that the particles are easily crushed under a relatively low stress. In order to discuss the shallow slips of decomposed granite soil, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the chang in shear characteristics owing to the variation of the water content at <b>low</b> <b>normal</b> stresses. The commonnest strength parameters in use for the stability analyses of the slope are generally obtained from the test at higer normal stresses than the actual stress which applys to the slope.

40|$|We perform atomistic {{computer}} simulations {{to study the}} mechanism of homogeneous dislocation nucleation in two dimensional (2 D) hexagonal crystalline films during indentation with a circular nanoindenter. The nucleation process is governed by the vanishing of the energy associated with a single normal mode. This critical mode is largely confined to a single plane of adjacent atoms. For fixed film thickness, L, the spatial extent, ξ, of the critical mode grows with indenter radius, R. For fixed R/L, the spatial extent ξ, grows roughly as ξ L^ 0. 4. We, furthermore, perform a mesoscale analysis to determine the <b>lowest</b> energy <b>normal</b> mode for mesoscale regions of varying radius, r_meso, centered on the critical mode's core. The energy, λ_meso, of the <b>lowest</b> <b>normal</b> mode in the meso-region decays very rapidly with r_meso and λ_meso = 0 for r_meso > ξ. The <b>lowest</b> <b>normal</b> mode shows a spatial extent, ξ_meso, which has a sublinear power-law increase with r_meso for r_meso 1. 5 ξ.
