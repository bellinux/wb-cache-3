25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, Wesselsbron virus, yellow fever virus and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E

Significant taxonomic improvements are proposed, e. g. {{the identification of}} three major groups (mammalian, seabird and Kadam tick-borne flavivirus groups), {{the creation of a}} new species (Karshi virus) and the assignment of Tick-borne encephalitis and <b>Louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>viruses</b> to a unique species (Tick-borne encephalitis virus) including four viral types (i. e.

25|$|Estimates of {{divergence}} {{times have}} been made for several of these viruses. The origin of these viruses appears {{to be at least}} 9400 to 14,000 years ago. The Old World and New World dengue strains diverged between 150 and 450 years ago. The European and Far Eastern tick borne encephalitis strains diverged about 1087 (1610–649) years ago. European tick borne encephalitis and <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>viruses</b> diverged about 572 (844–328) years ago. This latter estimate is consistent with historical records. Kunjin virus diverged from West Nile virus approximately 277 (475–137) years ago. This time corresponds to the settlement of Australia from Europe. The Japanese encephalitis group appears to have evolved in Africa 2000–3000 years ago and then spread initially to South East Asia before migrating to the rest of Asia.|$|R
40|$|Through {{the use of}} acetone and ether {{extraction}} of brain tissue from newborn mice infected with certain arthropod-borne viruses, it has been possible to demonstrate hemagglutinins for chick erythrocytes associated with the following viruses: dengue Type 1, dengue Type 2, Eastern equine encephalitis, Ilhéus, Japanese B, Ntaya, St. Louis, Sindbis, Uganda S, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, West Nile (Egypt 101 strain), Western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever (viscerotropic and neurotropic strains). On {{the basis of the}} temperature and pH required for reaction, the viruses can be assembled in two groups: A—those that require 37 °C. and a pH of about 6. 4, comprising Eastern, Venezuelan, and Western equine encephalitis and Sindbis viruses; and B—those that require either 4 ° or 22 °C. and a pH of about 7. 0, comprising dengue Types 1 and 2, Ilhéus, Japanese B, Ntaya, St. Louis, Uganda S, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses. A method of eliminating non-specific inhibitory substances present in sera was developed. The method consists essentially of filtration through Seitz pads. Extensive serological crossings were found among viruses of each group, while antisera of one group failed consistently to cross-react with antigens of the other. Antisera deriving from animals immunized with certain viruses for which no hemagglutinins could be developed by the present method, reacted with members of either one or the other group. Thus Semliki Forest virus would appear to belong to Group A, and Russian Far Eastern and <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>viruses</b> to Group B...|$|R

This virus is closely related to tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) {{and is a member of}} the same viral complex. Four subtypes of <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus</b> – the British, Irish, Spanish and Turkish subtypes – have been identified; however, a recent genetic analysis suggests that the Turkish subtype (Turkish sheep encephalitis virus) is more closely related to TBEV than <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus,</b> and should be reclassified. Species Affected Sheep are the most important hosts for <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus.</b> Clinical cases have also been documented in other mammals including cattle, goats, horses, llamas, alpacas, pigs, dogs, deer and European elk. Fatal cases have been reported among grouse and their relatives, including experimentally infected ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) and willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), and naturally or experimentally infected red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus). <b>Louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus</b> can also infect a number of small mammals including shrews, wood mice, voles, rats, hares and rabbits. Humans seem to be accidental hosts.

In the 1920s <b>Louping</b> <b>Ill</b> and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and lamb dysentery.

40|$|The genomic RNA {{encoding}} {{the structural}} proteins of louping ill, a tickborne flavivirus, was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparisons of louping ill envelope protein showed greater homology with tick-borne than mosquito-borne flaviviruses and greater homology {{with the western}} than the far eastern subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus. Louping ill and tick-borne encephalitis viruses are probably varieties of a common tick-borne ancestral virus. The average amino acid sequence diversity between members of the tick-borne serogroup was significantly {{lower than that of}} mosquito-borne serogroups, suggesting that tick-borne flaviviruses have been subjected to different evolutionary immune selection pressure from the mosquito-borne viruses. Using the published model of tick-borne encephalitis envelope protein and the derived sequence data on <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus,</b> three discontinuous peptides (amino acids 81 - 88, 207 - 212 and 230 - 234) which may represent critical molecular determinants within the receptor binding site of tick-borne flaviviruses, were identified. These peptides may provide a specific genetic marker for these viruses. Recombinant baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses containing cloned DNA, encoding either the envelope protein or the structural proteins of <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus,</b> were constructed. Glycosylated envelope protein, presented both inside and on the surface of insect and mammalian cells, was expressed by all four recombinant viruses. Differences in antigenic presentation of envelope protein were observed between envelope protein and structural protein constructs as well as between insect cell and mammalian cell expression systems. Despite the expression of epitopes known to elicit neutralizing and protective antibodies when present in authentic antigen, the recombinant envelope protein expressed by either baculovirus or vaccinia virus failed to induce, under the experimental conditions employed, either neutralizing or protective antibodies in both mice and rabbits against <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> <b>virus.</b> Hence, louping ill envelope protein expressed by baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses was antigenically reactive but immunogenically inert. </p...|$|E
25|$|Transmission to {{vertebrates}} usually occurs via a tick vector. THOV {{persists in}} the tick, {{remaining in the}} organism as it goes through its developmental stages; this is called transstadial transmission. The virus can be transmitted to another host within a day of attachment to the host. THOV can be transmitted between ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, {{in the absence of}} a detectable level of virus in the blood. Such nonviraemic transmission has also been observed with other predominantly tick-transmitted RNA viruses, including bluetongue, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, <b>louping</b> <b>ill,</b> tick-borne encephalitis, vesicular stomatitis virus and West Nile virus viruses. Transmission of DHOV by respiratory aerosol has also been observed.|$|R
