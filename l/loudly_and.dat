5|$|The first Australian {{fighting}} patrol into Kalimantan began on 24 May with two platoons, 5 and 11 Platoons, from B Company and a forward observation party, departing the company base at Bukit Knuckle {{under the command}} of Major William Broderick. The patrol—designated Operation Article—involved an ambush patrol along the bank of the Sungei Koemba river. After several days of careful and laborious movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale. The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a re-entrant below, talking <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> firing random shots, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E

25|$|Copulation is {{frequent}} {{in winter}} colonies, {{with as many}} as 27 instances observed per day in colonies with large proportions of female bats. During mating, the bats screech <b>loudly,</b> <b>and</b> males will lick the female's vulva. This species probably has the ability to breed year-round. Gestation is estimated at 5–7 months, after which the female gives birth to one pup. Pups are most frequently seen in August, though they have been observed in February, March, April, and December as well.|$|E

25|$|He {{immediately}} {{ordered to}} raise the levy to invade Lan Xang in the following dry season of 1573–1574. But the kingdom had been in constant campaign mode, and his annual demands of more levy were pushing his vassals to a breaking point. Even his senior advisers murmured <b>loudly,</b> <b>and</b> the king reluctantly agreed to postpone the expedition for a year. The respite did little to restore the ranks of depleted vassals. When the conscription drive came in 1574, the northernmost states of Mohnyin and Mogaung refused, and revolted.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the raid, the room was poorly illuminated. Sergeant Pat Gonzales entered the room first, {{followed}} by Sergeant Ervin Romans. As Romans entered, he was ambushed by Mixon, who shot him through the wall and door of a bedroom he was hiding in, mortally wounding him. Gonzales was then shot and wounded in the shoulder, although he continued to lead the team inside the bedroom. None of the officers had yet managed to fire their weapons due to the poor lighting of the room. They were momentarily surprised by a woman who screamed <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> fled from the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the message out and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E
25|$|At {{the inauguration}} of the UN in 1945, no {{delegation}} from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference {{did not have a}} delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.|$|E

25|$|On October 28, 2005, Game {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct and {{resisting}} arrest in Greensboro, North Carolina. At one point, police said his companions were pepper sprayed when they surrounded officers in a threatening manner. Mall security officers said the rapper was wearing a full-face Halloween mask, filming shoppers, cursed <b>loudly,</b> <b>and</b> refused to leave when asked. Game continued to act up and was arrested, a police statement said. Game claimed that officers overreacted {{and that he did}} nothing wrong when he was pepper-sprayed by the mall security. The five officers involved in the incident ended up suing Game for defamation. The officers were awarded $5 million in compensatory damages, which was upheld on appeal by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in February 2012.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young boa constrictors may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. Boa constrictors strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, boa constrictors in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspector}} of the Nationalsingspiel was Gottlieb Stephanie. When the 25-year-old Mozart {{arrived in}} Vienna in 1781, seeking professional opportunity, {{one of the}} first tasks to which he addressed himself was to become acquainted with Stephanie and lobby him for an opera commission. To this end, he brought a copy of his earlier opera Zaide and showed it to Stephanie, who was duly impressed. Mozart also made a strong impression on the manager of the theater, Count Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg, when in the home of Mozart's friend and patroness Maria Wilhelmine Thun the Count heard him play excerpts from his opera Idomeneo, premiered with great success the previous year in Munich. With this backing, it was agreed that Stephanie would find appropriate material and prepare a libretto for Mozart. Stephanie complied by preparing an altered version of an earlier work Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail without attributing or seeking permission from its original author Christoph Friedrich Bretzner. Bretzner later complained <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> publicly about the theft.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} rumours after the Broadway meeting of January 1648, that Levellers were conspiring with Royalists to {{overthrow}} the new republic. During the Oxford mutiny this was confirmed when Parliament acquired {{a letter from a}} Royalist prisoner in the Tower of London to Lord Cottington, an advisor in exile with Charles II in France, which suggested that the Royalists should finance the Levellers, as a method by which Charles could be restored to the throne. Armed with this evidence parliament published a long declaration against the Levellers and passed a motion to try Lilburne for high treason, using a court similar to that which had tried Charles I. Like the trial of the King sentence would be passed by appointed commissioners (forty for Lilburne's trial), but unlike the King (who had no peers) a jury of 12 would decide on Lilburne's guilt or innocence. The trial took place in the London Guildhall. It started on 24 October 1649, and lasted two days. When the jury found him not guilty, the public shouted their approval so <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> for so long that it was another half an hour before the proceedings could be formally closed.|$|E
25|$|Later, Huang Zhong {{heard that}} Cao Cao's forces were {{transporting}} food supplies to Beishan (北山), so {{he led a}} group of soldiers, including some of Zhao Yun's men, to seize the supplies. Huang Zhong did not return after a long time so Zhao Yun led tens of horsemen in search of Huang. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao's forces and engaged them in battle but was outnumbered {{and was forced to}} retreat back to his camp, with Cao Cao's men in pursuit. Zhang Yi, one of Zhao Yun's subordinates, wanted to close the gates to prevent the enemy from entering. However, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, all flags and banners to be hidden, and the war drums silenced. Cao Cao's forces thought that there was an ambush inside Zhao Yun's camp so they withdrew. Just then, Zhao Yun launched a counter-attack and his men beat the war drums <b>loudly</b> <b>and</b> fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray. Some of them trampled on each other while fleeing in panic, and many of them fell into the Han River and drowned.|$|E
25|$|The St. Pauli {{quarter was}} well known as being an area where prostitutes were to be found, and was {{dangerous}} for anyone that looked different than the usual clientele.

Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen with coshes, who beat the musicians as punishment. Horst Fascher was Koschmider's nightclub bouncer, whose career as a boxer had been cut short (he had unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight) although he later became a friend of The Beatles, and protected them.|$|E
