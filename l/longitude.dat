5|$|The secular {{effects of}} a distant massive planet alters this behavior, causing the longitudes of {{perihelion}} of anti-aligned objects to librate, or oscillate within a limited range of values, while their perihelia rise and fall. As the angle between an anti-aligned object's perihelion and Planet Nine's (delta <b>longitude</b> of perihelion on diagram) climbs beyond 180° Planet Nine exerts an increasingly positive torque on the object. This torque increases the object's angular momentum, causing the eccentricity of its orbit to decline (see blue curves on diagram) and its perihelion to rise away from Neptune's orbit. While the object's eccentricity is declining its precession rate is slowing. Once the object's precession rate becomes slower than that of Planet Nine delta <b>longitude</b> of perihelion begins to descend. After delta <b>longitude</b> of perihelion drops below 180° the object begins to feel an increasingly negative torque. This causes the object's angular momentum to decrease, and its eccentricity grows and perihelion falls. When the object's eccentricity is again large, its precession rate increases, causing delta <b>longitude</b> of perihelion to climb toward 180°, returning the object to its original orbit.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the <b>longitude</b> of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of these objects. Those with a <b>longitude</b> of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with <b>longitude</b> of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the <b>longitude</b> of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine <b>longitude</b> had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact <b>longitude</b> of Villegagnon Island.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} <b>longitude</b> based on {{the timing of the}} orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence <b>longitude.</b> The main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E

40|$|The {{absence of}} {{preferential}} <b>longitudes</b> for emerging flux regions (EFRs) {{on the sun}} indicates that sunspot preferential <b>longitudes,</b> if they exist, are due to favorable <b>longitudes</b> for EFRs to become spot groups {{rather than to the}} distribution of points of emergence of EFRs. A short-lived 'preferential latitude' (classical activity complex) is found. The latitudinal distribution of all EFRs exhibits a Maunders diagram behavior as expected on the basis of data for the fraction of EFRs which become spot groups. Possibly significant nonrandom behavior of the EFR time distribution is also found...|$|R

5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} <b>longitude</b> and latitude or celestial <b>longitude</b> and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. <b>Longitude</b> is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of the observational results related to the existence of long-lived sunspot active <b>longitudes.</b> These are affected by the solar differential rotation. The existence of such migrating active <b>longitudes</b> imposes an important constraint on the dynamo theory. We review different approaches to model non-axisymmetry in solar dynamo models and find that, in principle, plausible mechanisms exist to reproduce the observed non-axisymmetry. The most favorable interpretation is suggested by the ‘stroboscopic effect’, where a quasi-rigidly rotating non-axisymmetric mean-field can produce seemingly migrating active <b>longitudes</b> in sunspots. Other scenarios are less favorable but cannot yet be excluded...|$|R
