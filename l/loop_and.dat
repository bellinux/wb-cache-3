40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} definition of elemen-tary <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> extends {{the notion of}} proper loops for disjunctive logic programs. Different from normal logic programs, the computational complexities of recogniz-ing elementary <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> proper <b>loops</b> for disjunctive programs are coNP-complete. To address this problem, we introduce weaker versions of both elementary <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> proper <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> provide polynomial time algorithms for identifying them respectively. On the other hand, based {{on the notion of}} elementary loops, the class of Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) programs was presented, which can be turned into equivalent normal logic programs by shifting head atoms into bodies. However, the problem of recognizing an HEF program is coNP-complete. Then we present a subclass of HEF programs which generalizes the class of Head-Cycle-Free programs and provide a polynomial time algorithm to identify them. At last, some experiments show that both elementary <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> proper <b>loops</b> could be replaced by their weak versions in practice...|$|R

5|$|A major Brundage {{investment}} was Chicago's La Salle Hotel, {{which had been}} built in 1908. Located {{in the heart of}} The <b>Loop</b> <b>and</b> the city's financial district, Brundage first leased it in 1940, later purchasing it. When the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it. As Brundage made a home there during his time as IOC president, the hotel became famous in international sports as his residence. He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed it when the purchaser failed to make required payments.|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectron {{microscopy}} {{has shown}} that non-histone chromosomal HMG 1 could induce DNA looping or compaction in the presence (but not in the absence) of Ca 2 +. The effect of calcium on DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction was interpreted as calcium binding to the acidic C-domain of HMG 1. Both individual DNA-binding HMG 1 -box domains A and B {{were found to be}} involved in DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction. Treatment of HMG 1 with a thiol-specific reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, inhibited the ability of the protein to induce DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction but not the electrostatic interaction with DNA. These results indicated that cysteine-sulfhydryl groups of the HMG 1 -box domains A and B are specifically involved in DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction, and that in the absence of calcium the acidic C-domain down-regulates these effects by modulation of the DNA-binding properties of the HMG 1 -box domains...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise <b>loop</b> <b>and</b> drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>and</b> then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the next few days, the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} of the Capitol Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was partially transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained as part of the new Capitol <b>Loop</b> <b>and</b> the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an unsigned trunkline.|$|E

5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a <b>loop</b> <b>and</b> makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which {{is compounded by the}} effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{their school}} years, {{children}} {{continue to build}} their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading.

5|$|To further {{improve the}} {{function}} of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs.

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, the east–west highway across the Lower Peninsula through Howell to Detroit was {{assigned}} the M-16 designation. This was redesignated US16 in 1926. In 1962, I-96 was completed between Lansing and Brighton, and US16 was decommissioned in Michigan. At the time, a new limited-access connector road was constructed between I-96 and Grand River Avenue, providing access {{for the business}} <b>loop</b> <b>and</b> M-59 to I-96. Afterwards, the former route of US16 along Grand River Avenue through Howell was redesignated BL I-96.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise <b>loop,</b> <b>and</b> on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E
5|$|After the US127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, {{and passes}} {{to the east}} of Grayling.

There is no interchange further north for M-72; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/M-93 that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around <b>loop</b> <b>and</b> stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964.
