5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle <b>line,</b> <b>behind</b> hastati of the first line {{and in front of}} the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E
5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E

5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he had used the optimal tactics in the final sprint, but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{continues}} his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, {{the head of}} the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba diving in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a limpet mine on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{soldiers}} marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating {{pockets of}} Chinese resistance. By December 9 {{they had reached}} {{the last line of}} defense, the Fukuo <b>Line,</b> <b>behind</b> which lay Nanking's fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in the streets in the hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E

5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> Sans Pareil and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|On 8February 1913, the Ottoman navy {{supported}} an {{amphibious assault}} at Şarköy. Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, {{along with two}} small cruisers provided artillery support to the right flank of the invading force once it went ashore. The ships were positioned about a kilometer off shore; Turgut Reis was the second ship in the <b>line,</b> <b>behind</b> her sister Barbaros Hayreddin. The Bulgarian army resisted fiercely, which ultimately forced the Ottoman army to retreat, though the withdrawal was successful in large {{part due to the}} gunfire support from Turgut Reis {{and the rest of the}} fleet. During the battle, Turgut Reis fired 225rounds from her 10.5cm guns and 202 shells from her 8.8cm guns.|$|E
5|$|One {{isolated}} Covenanter brigade {{that stood}} its ground {{was at the}} right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland. Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them. In the third charge, Lucas's horse was killed, and he was taken prisoner. Behind them, Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre, pushing four regiments (those of the Earl of Cassilis, William Douglas of Kilhead, Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front <b>line.</b> <b>Behind</b> them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.|$|E

5|$|The 1947–48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in {{what has}} been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league's scoring leader. Evincing the depth of the team at centre, Bentley played on the team's third <b>line,</b> <b>behind</b> Apps and Kennedy. Decades later, Hap Day argued that this team was the strongest NHL team ever and Globe and Mail {{reporter}} Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have been relegated to the fourth line on this Leaf team.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} 1st Army {{were able}} to cross the Danube and began to prepare defences. By the evening of 10 April, the 1st Army was ordered to {{withdraw}} from this line and form a defensive <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> the Sava from Debrc to the confluence with the Vrbas river, for which {{one or two days}} would be needed. On the night of 10/11 April, the whole 2nd Army Group continued its withdrawal, but units of the 2nd Army on the left flank of the 1st Army that included significant numbers of Croats began to dissolve due to the fifth column activities of the fascist Ustaše and their sympathisers.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese sappers built a {{pontoon bridge}} over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese {{quarters}} in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' troops to cross the river. Having reinforced Santa Engracia, north of San Critsóbal, and fortified a {{bridge over the}} Gévora river, they built, unmolested, an arc of the circumvallation from Gévora to Vado del Moro. Fort del Mayordomo, located near the Guadiana river, had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built. The Portuguese used it to cover {{the construction of the}} circumvallation line to the Guadiana. They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento, a hill near Vado del Moro, but were repelled by the Spanish garrison that was there and had to build the circumvallation <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> it. Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento, the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona, but it had not been built, leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The 25,400-strong Allied {{left flank}} corps under William Beresford began its advance on 16 February, {{aiming for the}} village of Bidache. Beresford's corps {{was made up of}} the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Division as well as Somerset's and Vivian's cavalry. Altogether, Wellington had 42,000 foot {{soldiers}} and 3,000 horsemen marching to the east. Reacting to the Allied pressure, Soult joined two of the three divisions north of the Adour to the four divisions farther east. This action created a field army of 32,000 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. The French divisions were directed to form a new <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> the Gave d'Oloron River, along a line from Peyrehorade to Sauveterre-de-Béarn to Navarrenx. On 17 February, Hill's corps forded the Saison River, breaching yet another French defensive line. The French marshal sent Abbé's division to help defend Bayonne, a questionable move which left his army with fewer troops to fight Wellington. By 18 February, Soult had his troops in position on the Gave d'Oloron. That day the weather broke again, causing another pause in operations.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army {{was able}} to {{evacuate}} Baranja and organised a defence of the left flank of the 2nd Army Group, now threatened by the 8th Panzer Division, but Croat reservists began to desert their units due to the fifth column activities of the fascist Ustaše and their sympathisers. This significantly reducing the combat power of the 2nd Army.

5|$|The French, led by Charles, {{similarly}} {{sought to}} expand their influence; Charles seized Sicily and Byzantine territory while marrying his daughters to the Latin claimants to Byzantium. To create his own claim to the throne of Jerusalem, Charles executed one rival and purchased {{the rights to the}} city from another. In 1270 Charles turned his brother King LouisIX's last Crusade, known as the Eighth Crusade, to his own advantage by persuading Louis to attack his rebel Arab vassals in Tunis. Louis' army was devastated by disease, and Louis himself died at Tunis on 25August. Louis' fleet returned to France, leaving only Prince Edward, the future king of England, and a small retinue to continue {{what is known as the}} Ninth Crusade. Edward survived an assassination attempt organised by Baibars, negotiated a ten-year truce, and then returned to manage his affairs in England. This ended the last significant crusading effort in the Eastern Mediterranean. The 1281 election of a French pope, MartinIV, brought the full power of the papacy into <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> Charles. He prepared to launch a crusade against Constantinople but, in what became known as the Sicilian Vespers, an uprising fomented by MichaelVIII Palaiologos deprived him of the resources of Sicily, and Peter III of Aragon was proclaimed king of Sicily. In response, Martin excommunicated Peter and called for an Aragonese Crusade, which was unsuccessful. In 1285 Charles died, having spent his life trying to amass a Mediterranean empire; he and Louis had viewed themselves as God's instruments to uphold the papacy.|$|E
5|$|With {{his three}} {{divisions}} reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw {{action at the}} Battle of Borodino. He {{was placed on the}} French right, in second <b>line,</b> <b>behind</b> the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed to take two of the redoubts on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of {{the right wing of the}} army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign. He was transported to Moscow following the battle and although still wounded, on 10 October, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that was to take the wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines. During this mission, he was exposed to great danger, to famine and extreme cold, which impacted his already frail health. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a <b>line</b> <b>behind</b> their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E
