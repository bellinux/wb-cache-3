Yet the United States is still without an effective federal pollution <b>control</b> <b>program,</b> and those state and <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> that do exist are largely ineffective. Until government regulation is able to keep the expulsion of air contaminants within tolerable limits, it will be necessary for those seeking to control air pollution to rely upon the assertion of private rights. In this article the author discusses the principal causes of action available to the private pollution controller, and concludes that, although traditional legal concepts may provide the framework for obtaining adequate relief in individual cases, the overall pollution control consequences of private actions are at best piecemeal and not a substitute for effective government regulation...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{the current}} {{published}} emission factors for selected area source solvent categories are derived by, in effect, allocating National solvent consumption data to State and county locations. The emission factors, then, are a composite or National average of solvent consumption at the local or regional level.

Therefore, improved methods must be considered for allocating National solvent consumption to represent the area source solvent VOC and HAP emission activities occurring in the States and counties.

Results demonstrated the presence of two species of E. granulosus complex, E. granulosus sensu stricto and E. canadensis. Of E. granulosus sensu stricto, the G 1 genotype (including three microvariants) was found in 17 isolates from humans and sheep, the G 3 genotype and an intermediate form G 1 /G 3 in one isolate each (both from sheep). Of E. canadensis, the pig strain G 7 was found in three isolates from sheep and human. This is the first report of this strain in Turkey.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using a survey to gather open burning activity information for use in developing emission inventories for MSW burning and yard waste burning, including both brush waste and leaf waste. E. H. Pechan and Associates, Inc. (Pechan) conducted MSW and yard waste burning surveys for the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Visibility Union (MANE-VU). Two separate surveys were performed. One survey was designed to gather information on <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> that were in place for open burning (e. g. burn bans). As part of the control survey, a rule effectiveness (RE) survey was conducted to estimate controlled emissions. The second survey was designed to gather activity information in areas where burning is allowed. The survey did not find statistically-significant differences in MSW activity among urban, suburban, and rural areas. In areas allowing both brush and leaf waste burning, survey respondents could not provide separate estimates {{for the number of}} households burning each of these types of yard waste. Municipal yard waste burning results showed a higher percentage of households that burn yard waste in areas that have a municipal collection program, than in other areas, so there may be factors involved that lead to a higher incidence of both residential and municipal burning for an area.

A hypothetical hospital outbreak problem was also submitted for analysis. Typeability, reproducibility, discrimination (D) index, and epidemiological concordance were evaluated. Ten centers participated in each survey. Seven centers performed PFGE analysis, while others used repetitive-element or randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, amplified fragment length polymorphism, or spa typing. Full typeability (100 %) was achieved by all centers, and all but one showed 100 % reproducibility. Discrimination was appropriate (D index, ≥ 96 %) for centers performing PFGE analysis but not for all those using other methods (D index range, 72 % to 97 %).

40|$|Understanding the {{different}} background landscapes in which malaria transmission occurs {{is fundamental to}} understanding malaria epidemiology and to designing effective <b>local</b> malaria <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> Geology, geomorphology, vegetation, climate, land use, and anopheline distribution were used {{as a basis for}} an ecological classification of the state of Roraima, Brazil, in the northern Amazon Basin, focused on the natural history of malaria and transmission. We used unsupervised maximum likelihood classification, principal components analysis, and weighted overlay with equal contribution analyses to fine-scale thematic maps that resulted in clustered regions. We used ecological niche modeling techniques to develop a fine-scale picture of malaria vector distributions in the state. Eight ecoregions were identified and malaria-related aspects are discussed based on this classification, including 5 types of dense tropical rain forest and 3 types of savannah. Ecoregions formed by dense tropical rain forest were named as montane (ecoregion I), submontane (II), plateau (III), lowland (IV), and alluvial (V).

The mosquito control is still mainly performed by using insecticides but their effectiveness is increasingly questioned nowadays. We here conducted a study on Ae. aegypti resistance development towards several commonly used insecticides {{in the capital city}} of Jakarta, Indonesia. In order to achieve this goal, Ae. aegypti eggs from Jakarta were collected with ovitraps and hatched in the insectary of the Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia. The F 0 generations were used for WHO resistance tests and knockdown resistance (kdr) assays. Presented results clearly showed that there was resistance development of Ae. aegypti populations to the here tested pyrethroid insecticides (i. e. permethrin). Observed mortalities were less than 90 % with highest resistance against 0. 75 % permethrin concentrations. Furthermore, a significant association of V 1016 G gene mutations with resistance phenotypes to 0. 75 % permethrin was observed. Nevertheless, the F 1534 C mutation did not show a significant correlation to resistance development. In conclusion, our results show that populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes within the city of Jakarta have developed resistance against several routinely used pyrethroid insecticides in <b>local</b> performed <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> Thus, the regular verification/assessment of resistance development status will hopefully help in the future to assist local public health authorities in their mosquito <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> by recommending and managing the rotation of different routinely used insecticides with diverse effector mechanisms in order to delay Ae. aegypti resistance development...|$|R

In Thailand, dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever is {{a leading cause of}} hospitalization and death among children. A longitudinal study among 1750 people in two rural and one urban sites in northern Thailand from 2001 to 2003 studied spatial and temporal determinants for recent dengue infection at three levels (time, individual and household). Methods Determinants for dengue infection were measured by questionnaire, land-cover maps and GIS. IgM antibodies against dengue were detected by ELISA. Three-level multi-level analysis was used to study the risk determinants of recent dengue infection. Results Rates of recent dengue infection varied substantially in time from 4 to 30 %, peaking in 2002. Determinants for recent dengue infection differed per site. Spatial clustering was observed, demonstrating variation in local infection patterns. Most of the variation in recent dengue infection was explained at the time-period level. Location of a person and the environment around the house (including irrigated fields and orchards) were important determinants for recent dengue infection.

We isolated and cultured 10 strains of cyanobacteria from three mosquito breeding sites along the French Mediterranean coast. Most of the strains were tolerant to a relatively wide range of salt concentrations, and all of them were totally or partially resistant to at least four of the five biological or chemical larvicides used in the <b>local</b> mosquito <b>control</b> <b>program.</b> Six unicellular strains from these habitats and Synechococcus strain PCC 7942, a strain maintained for more than 10 years under laboratory conditions, were assessed for ingestion and digestion by larvae Culex pipiens and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.

A longitudinal study among 1750 people in two rural and one urban sites in northern Thailand from 2001 to 2003 studied spatial and temporal determinants for recent dengue infection at three levels (time, individual and household). METHOD: Determinants for dengue infection were measured by questionnaire, land-cover maps and GIS. IgM antibodies against dengue were detected by ELISA. Three-level multi-level analysis was used to study the risk determinants of recent dengue infection. RESULTS: Rates of recent dengue infection varied substantially in time from 4 to 30 %, peaking in 2002. Determinants for recent dengue infection differed per site. Spatial clustering was observed, demonstrating variation in local infection patterns. Most of the variation in recent dengue infection was explained at the time-period level. Location of a person and the environment around the house (including irrigated fields and orchards) were important determinants for recent dengue infection. CONCLUSION: We showed the focal nature of asymptomatic dengue infections. The great variation of determinants for recent dengue infection in space and time should be taken into account when designing <b>local</b> dengue <b>control</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Syphilis Surveillance Report, 1999 {{presents}} syphilis {{statistics and}} {{trends in the}} United States through 1999. The surveillance information in this report {{is based on the}} following sources of data: case reports for the STD project areas, and prevalence of reactive serologic tests for syphilis from the Jail STD Prevalence Monitoring Projects, the Innovations in Syphilis Prevention Project, and from state and local health departments who voluntarily submitted jail screening data to CDC. The STD surveillance systems operated by state and <b>local</b> STD <b>control</b> <b>programs,</b> which provide the case report data on adult and congenital syphilis, are the sources of most of the information in this publication. These systems {{are an integral part of}} program management at all levels of STD prevention and control in the United States. The Syphilis Surveillance Report consists of two parts. The National Profile contains figures that provide an overview of syphilis morbidity in the United States. The State Specific Data contains figures of syphilis case report trends at the state and county level and tables detailing the prevalence of reactive serologic tests for syphilis from jails, delivery rooms, and drug treatment centers for those states that report data to CDC.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{neoliberalism}} on global health, particularly {{the aspect of}} international aid, involves key players such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. According to James Pfeiffer, neoliberal emphasis {{has been placed on}} free markets and privatization which has been tied to the [...] "new policy agenda" [...] in which NGOs are seen as being able to provide better social welfare than governments. International NGOs have been promoted to fill holes in public services created by the World Bank and IMF through their promotion of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) which reduce government health spending, and which Pfeiffer criticized as unsustainable. The reduced health spending and the gain of the public health sector by NGOs causes the local health system to become fragmented, undermines <b>local</b> <b>control</b> of health <b>programs</b> and contributes to local social inequality between NGO workers and local individuals.|$|R
40|$|Catheter-associated {{urinary tract}} infections (UTIs) have {{accounted}} {{for as much as}} 40 % of all nosocomial infec-tions in the United States, affecting an estimated 800, 000 patients per year. 1 Among the 25 % of hospitalized patients who have a urinary catheter, the incidence of nosocomial UTI is approximately 5 % per day, with virtually all patients developing bacteriuria by 30 days of catheterization. 2 One recent study found that most catheter-associated bacteri-uria was asymptomatic, 3 but silent catheter-associated UTIs may represent a large pool of antibiotic-resistant pathogens 4 and drive a great deal of generally unneces-sary antibiotic therapy. These infections have been shown to increase length of stay, hospital cost, and mortality. 5, 6 In Argentina, we have found that catheter-associated UTI increases hospital stay by 13 days and the attributable cost is $ 1, 970 (U. S.). 7 Many countries in Latin America including Argentina lack mandatory infection <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> This lack of governmental oversight has resulted in the development of <b>local</b> infection <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> loosely based on guide-lines published in the United States. Among the numerous strategies that have been studied {{to reduce the risk of}} catheter-associated UTI, only the closed drainage system has been of value. 8 Novel technology, such as the use of sil-ver hydrogel catheters, has shown promise in reducing the risk of catheter-associated UTI, 9 but such technology is dif-ficult to implement with limited resources. We report the results of a prospective, open trial assessing the effectiveness of education and performance feedback in reducing catheter-associated UTI rates in two level III cardiac and medical–surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in an Argentinean hospital...|$|R
40|$|Converging factors {{contribute}} to elevated tuberculosis (TB) incidence and complicate case management in the U. S. states bordering Mexico. These factors include a) Mexico's higher TB rate; b) low socioeconomic status and limited {{access to health care}} in the border area; c) frequent border crossings and travel in the United States for employment, commerce, health services, and leisure; d) language and sociocultural differences; and e) lack of coordinated care across health jurisdictions {{on both sides of the}} U. S. -Mexico border. Prevention and control efforts that address the challenges created by border-crossing populations require collaboration among local, state, and national TB <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> in both countries. In June 1999, to facilitate future discussions with Mexican counterparts, CDC convened a meeting of TB control officials from the four U. S. states bordering Mexico (i. e., California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) to address TB prevention and control in the border area. Focus areas included a) surveillance needs, b) case management and therapy completion, c) performance indicators and program evaluation, and d) research needs.
