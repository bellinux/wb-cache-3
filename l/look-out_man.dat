6000|$|... "Why, just look, Lieutenant," [...] says Brown, {{pointing}} {{into the}} [...] "blank {{height of the}} dark;" [...] "and I was on the pier too, and couldn't see; but the <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> here says--" [...] A shift of wind, a drift of cloud, and the moon flashes out a moment.--"There she is, sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|So Bert, {{slightly}} refreshed by {{coffee and}} sleep, resumed his helpless co-operation in the War in the Air. He went {{down into the}} little gallery as the lieutenant had directed, and clung to the rail at the extreme end beyond the <b>look-out</b> <b>man,</b> trying to seem as inconspicuous and harmless a fragment of life as possible.|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} on whom I thus entered unexpectedly: the <b>look-out</b> <b>man,</b> with grizzled beard, keen seaman's eyes, and that brand on his countenance that comes of solitary living; and a visitor, an oldish, oratorical fellow, in the smart {{tropical}} array of the British man-o'-war's man, {{perched on a}} table, and smoking a cigar. I was made pleasantly welcome, and was soon listening with amusement to the sea-lawyer.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was nearly}} done; only {{the hem of}} his golden robe was rustling. Soon it was almost dark, but the <b>look-out</b> <b>men</b> still {{remained}} unset.|$|R
60|$|The {{cause of}} this accident, which came near being the death of all on board, was nothing but the {{drowsiness}} of the <b>look-out</b> <b>men</b> on the forecastles of both ships. The sailor who had the look-out on our vessel was terribly reprimanded by the mate.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately the Flatlanders {{were on the}} <b>look-out</b> {{when the}} <b>men</b> of Poloe drew near. One of the Flatland braves was {{returning}} from a fishing expedition at the time, saw the advancing host while they were yet well out at sea, and came home at racing speed with the news.|$|R
60|$|He sat still. The other {{customers}} had gone, and all was quiet {{but for the}} faint rumble of traffic and soothing throb of an electric fan. Cartwright mused about Oreana and pictured Davies sheltering behind the wind-screens on his bridge and trying to pierce the snow, and the <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> half frozen in the spray that leaped about the forecastle. Oreana was a wet boat when she was loaded deep. Now and then, perhaps, a buoy loomed in the tossing flakes. One tried to read the number and see the color. Then the steering-engine rattled as the rudder was pulled across and Oreana headed for another mark.|$|E
60|$|Overnight {{there had}} been a gun placed in Union Square. It had never been mounted, much less fired, and in the {{darkness}} after the surrender it was taken with its supplies and put out of the way under the arches of the great Dexter building. Here late in the morning it was remarked by a number of patriotic spirits. They set to work to hoist and mount it inside the upper floors of the place. They made, in fact, a masked battery behind the decorous office blinds, and there lay in wait as simply excited as children until at last the stem of the luckless Wetterhorn appeared, beating and rolling at quarter speed over the recently reconstructed pinnacles of Tiffany's. Promptly that one-gun battery unmasked. The airship's <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> must have seen the whole of the tenth story of the Dexter building crumble out and smash in the street below to discover the black muzzle looking out from the shadows behind. Then perhaps the shell hit him.|$|E
60|$|For {{four days}} the wind held, and they ran down Channel before it, {{hoping to catch}} sight of the Spaniard; but the San Antonio was a swift caravel of 250 tons with much canvas, for she carried four masts, and {{although}} the Margaret was also a good sailer, she had but two masts, and could {{not come up with}} her. Or, for anything they knew, they might have missed her on the seas. On the afternoon of the fourth day, when they were off the Lizard, and creeping along very slowly under a light breeze, the <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> reported a ship lying becalmed ahead. Peter, who had the eyes of a hawk, climbed up the mast to look at her, and presently called down that he believed from her shape and rig she must be the caravel, though of this he could not be sure as he had never seen her. Then the captain, Smith, went up also, and a few minutes later returned saying that without doubt it was the San Antonio.|$|E
5000|$|The two highest land {{elevations}} surveyed for Devils Battery observation posts were Flandrum Hill, Cow Bay and Caldwell Road between [...] "A-23" [...] barracks and [...] "Radio 16" [...] aircraft direction radar (Scott Drive). Each elevated {{point had}} a four-storey reinforced concrete Victoria Fortress Observation Post, with plotting rooms and telephones {{connected to the}} Halifax fire command post. Two other three-storey observation posts were erected, one at the new radar installation at Osborne Head, and the other above the hill behind the three turrets. Each <b>look-out</b> was <b>manned</b> with a crew of two on the top storey using a Depression position finder looking out towards the harbour for any suspicious targets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Honor {{sees the}} wing of the {{sporting}} gull, again; it had been nigh to deceive my sight, which would be to cheat the <b>look-out</b> of a <b>man</b> that {{has the advantage of}} some ten or fifteen years' more practice in marine appearances. I remember once, when beating in among the islands of the China seas, with the trades here at south-east----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must know}} they kept Kalashee watch in that ship, all hands {{sleeping}} through the night, {{and only the}} reliefs of quartermasters and <b>look-out</b> <b>men</b> being called. He was tempted to grip and shake {{the shoulder of the}} nearest lascar, but he didn't. Something held his arms down along his sides. He was not afraid--oh no! only he just couldn't--that's all. He was not afraid of death perhaps, but I'll tell you what, he was afraid of the emergency. His confounded imagination had evoked for him all the horrors of panic, the trampling rush, the pitiful screams, boats swamped--all the appalling incidents of a disaster at sea he had ever heard of. He might have been resigned to die but I suspect he wanted to die without added terrors, quietly, in a sort of peaceful trance. A certain readiness to perish is not so very rare, but it is seldom that you meet men whose souls, steeled in the impenetrable armour of resolution, are ready to fight a losing battle to the last; the desire of peace waxes stronger as hope declines, till at last it conquers the very desire of life. Which of us here has not observed this, or maybe experienced something of that feeling in his own person--this extreme weariness of emotions, the vanity of effort, the yearning for rest? Those striving with unreasonable forces know it well,--the shipwrecked castaways in boats, wanderers lost in a desert, men battling against the unthinking might of nature, or the stupid brutality of crowds.' ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the main}} deck the cook, locking up the galley doors, had an altercation with young Charley about {{a pair of}} socks. He could be heard saying impressively, in the {{darkness}} amidships: [...] "You don't deserve a kindness. I've been drying them for you, and now you complain about the holes--and you swear, too! Right in front of me! If I hadn't been a Christian--which you ain't, you young ruffian--I would give you a clout on the head.... Go away!" [...] Men in couples or threes stood pensive or moved silently along the bulwarks in the waist. The first busy day of a homeward passage was sinking into the dull peace of resumed routine. Aft, on the high poop, Mr. Baker walked shuffling and grunted to himself in the pauses of his thoughts. Forward, the <b>look-out</b> <b>man,</b> erect between the flukes of the two anchors, hummed an endless tune, keeping his eyes fixed dutifully ahead in a vacant stare. A multitude of stars coming out into the clear night peopled the emptiness of the sky. They glittered, as if alive above the sea; they surrounded the running ship on all sides; more intense than {{the eyes of a}} staring crowd, and as inscrutable as the souls of men.|$|E
60|$|Then we {{laid out}} our bedding in the bows among the {{sleeping}} Lascars, to catch any breeze that {{the pace of}} the ship might give us. The sea was like smoky oil, except where it turned to fire under our forefoot and whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame. There was a thunderstorm some miles away; we could see the glimmer of the lightning. The ship's cow, distressed by the heat and the smell of the ape-beast in the cage, lowed unhappily {{from time to time in}} exactly the same key as that in which the <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> answered the hourly call from the bridge. The trampling tune of the engines was very distinct, and the jarring of the ash-lift, as it was tipped into the sea, hurt the procession of hushed noise. Hans lay down by my side and lighted a good-night cigar. This was naturally the beginning of conversation. He owned a voice as soothing as the wash of the sea, and stores of experiences as vast as the sea itself; for his business in life was to wander up and down the world, collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for German and American dealers. I watched the glowing end of his cigar wax and wane in the gloom, as the sentences rose and fell, till I was nearly asleep. The orang-outang, troubled by some dream of the forests of his freedom, began to yell like a soul in purgatory, and to pluck madly at the bars of the cage.|$|E
6000|$|From {{first to}} last the seaman's {{thoughts}} {{are very much}} concerned with his anchors. It {{is not so much}} that the anchor is a symbol of hope as that it is the heaviest object that he has to handle on board his ship at sea in the usual routine of his duties. The beginning and the end of every passage are marked distinctly by work about the ship's anchors. A vessel in the Channel has her anchors always ready, her cables shackled on, and the land almost always in sight. The anchor and the land are indissolubly connected in a sailor's thoughts. But directly she is clear of the narrow seas, heading out into the world with nothing solid to speak of between her and the South Pole, the anchors are got in and the cables disappear from the deck. But the anchors do not disappear. Technically speaking, they are [...] "secured in-board"; and, on the forecastle head, lashed down to ring-bolts with ropes and chains, under the straining sheets of the head-sails, they look very idle and as if asleep. Thus bound, but carefully looked after, inert and powerful, those emblems of hope make company for the <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> in the night watches; and so the days glide by, with a long rest for those characteristically shaped pieces of iron, reposing forward, visible from almost every part of the ship's deck, waiting for their work {{on the other side of}} the world somewhere, while the ship carries them on with a great rush and splutter of foam underneath, and the sprays of the open sea rust their heavy limbs.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} named after the Tsetsebjwe hill, and lies {{at the foot of}} this hill. Tradition holds that the village was settled from Gobojango, and used to be a cattle post called Mokgojwe, which took its name from a {{perennial}} spring. Two brothers called Motshabi and Motshegwa were given the duty of patrolling the border with the South African Republic to prevent wild Boers from poaching game. The hill provided an ideal <b>look-out</b> point.A <b>man</b> called Tsetsebjwe died here, and the hill was given his name. A traditional doctor named Moshashane came to join the two brothers, and later he became a priest of the Protestant United Congregational Church of Southern Africa. His relatives and those of the two brothers established the village.|$|R
60|$|Fired by the cry {{which seemed}} {{simultaneously}} {{taken up by}} the three <b>look-outs,</b> the <b>men</b> on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was a man who had a meadow which lay {{on the side of a}} mountain, and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored hay. But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years, for every St. John's eve, when the grass was in the height of its vigor, it was all eaten clean up, just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night. This {{happened}} once, and it happened twice, but then the man got tired of losing his crop, and said to his sons--he had three of them, and the third was called Cinderlad--that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St. John's night, for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again, blade and stalk, as it had been the last two years, and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp <b>look-out,</b> the <b>man</b> said.|$|R
5000|$|When Columbus {{left for}} his first {{expedition}} to the New World, the two children, Diego and Ferdinand, were turned over to Beatriz. She took great care of them and was even congratulated by Queen Isabella I for her outstanding work. Some historians think that the award money intended for the <b>look-out</b> <b>man</b> {{that would be the}} first to spot land went instead to Columbus's mistress. When Columbus died he left his fortune to her. She never claimed the inheritance.|$|E
5000|$|Hebenstreit {{was born}} in Eisleben, a short {{distance}} west of Leipzig, in 1668. His father, described in one source as a [...] "Thürmer" [...] (<b>look-out</b> <b>man),</b> died in 1678. On 29 January 1691 Hebenstreit entered the University of Wittenberg. By 1697 he was employed in Leipzig as a violinist, keyboard musician and dancing master (i.e. teacher). It must have been at this time that, {{during one of his}} regular visits to Jean-Baptiste Volumier in Berlin, he is reported by Johann Kuhnau to {{have spent a lot of}} time practising his keyboard skills on an enlarged type of hammered dulcimer which he had constructed himself. In 1697 he was obliged to leave Leipzig in order to escape his creditors, and took a position as a private tutor in Merseburg, which gave him the opportunity to develop his instrument: shortly afterwards he was invited to demonstrate it to the court in Dresden. Hebenstreit was able to return to Leipzig, his debts apparently paid off.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War Sint-Oedenrode {{suffered}} tremendously. In May 1940 the German Army {{invaded the}} Low Countries and France, {{and due to}} the retreat from the Peel-Raam Line by the Dutch Armed Forces skirmishes arouse in Sint-Oedenrode {{in an attempt to}} keep the enemy at bay. After the capitulation (15 May 1940, in Zeeland 2 days later) Sint-Oedenrode found itself under German occupation. There was a small German Luftwaffe detachment of about 15 people providing a <b>manned</b> <b>look-out</b> (just like the Royal Observer Corps) for Allied planes which were undertaking operations against Volkel Air Base and Eindhoven (Air Base Welschap, now Eindhoven Airport).|$|R
6000|$|... "Yamsi," [...] I should explain, {{is a mere}} code address, and I use it here symbolically. I {{have seen}} {{commerce}} pretty close. I {{know what it is}} worth, and I have no particular regard for commercial magnates, but one must protest against these Bumble-like proceedings. Is it indignation at the loss of so many lives which is at work here? Well, the American railroads kill very many people during one single year, I dare say. Then why don't these dignitaries come down on the presidents of their own railroads, of which one can't say whether they are mere means of transportation or a sort of gambling game for the use of American plutocrats. Is it only an ardent and, upon the whole, praiseworthy desire for information? But the reports of the inquiry tell us that the august senators, though raising a lot of questions testifying to the complete innocence and even blankness of their minds, are unable to understand what the second officer is saying to them. We are so informed by the press from the other side. Even such a simple expression as that one of the <b>look-out</b> <b>men</b> was stationed in the [...] "eyes of the ship" [...] was too much for the senators of the land of graphic expression. What it must have been in the more recondite matters I won't even try to think, because I have no mind for smiles just now. They were greatly exercised about the sound of explosions heard when half the ship was under water already. Was there one? Were there two? They seemed to be smelling a rat there! Has not some charitable soul told them (what even schoolboys who read sea stories know) that when a ship sinks from a leak like this, a deck or two is always blown up; and that when a steamship goes down by the head, the boilers may, and often do break adrift with a sound which resembles the sound of an explosion? And they may, indeed, explode, for all I know. In the only case I have seen of a steamship sinking there was such a sound, but I didn't dive down after her to investigate. She was not of 45,000 tons and declared unsinkable, but the sight was impressive enough. I shall never forget the muffled, mysterious detonation, the sudden agitation of the sea round the slowly raised stern, and to this day I have in my eye the propeller, seen perfectly still in its frame against a clear evening sky.|$|R
6000|$|What, after all, {{had really}} happened? He knew quite {{accurately}} the answer Sir Hugo would have given: [...] "A consumptive Jew, possessed by a fanaticism which obstacles and hastening death intensified, had fixed on Deronda as the antitype of some visionary image, {{the offspring of}} wedded hope and despair: despair of his own life, irrepressible hope in the propagation of his fanatical beliefs. The instance was perhaps odd, exceptional in its form, but substantially it was not rare. Fanaticism was not so common as bankruptcy, but taken in all its aspects it was abundant enough. While Mordecai was waiting on the bridge for the fulfillment of his visions, another man was convinced {{that he had the}} mathematical key of the universe which would supersede Newton, and regarded all known physicists as conspiring to stifle his discovery and keep the universe locked; another, that he had the metaphysical key, with just that hair's-breadth of difference from the old wards which would make it fit exactly. Scattered here and there in every direction you might find a terrible person, with more or less power of speech, and with an eye either glittering or preternaturally dull, on the <b>look-out</b> for the <b>man</b> who must hear him; and in most cases he had volumes which it was difficult to get printed, or if printed to get read. This Mordecai happened to have a more pathetic aspect, a more passionate, penetrative speech than was usual with such monomaniacs; he was more poetical than a social reformer with colored views of the new moral world in parallelograms, or than an enthusiast in sewage; still he came under the same class. It would be only right and kind to indulge him a little, to comfort him with such help as was practicable; but what likelihood was there that his notions had the sort of value he ascribed to them? In such cases a man of the world knows what to think beforehand. And as to Mordecai's conviction that he had found a new executive self, it might be preparing for him the worst of disappointments--that which presents itself as final." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how can the}} {{prevalent}} offence be house-breaking {{in a place like}} this?" [...] "Easily enough. When you've seen a little of the city you'll see. Natives sleep and lie about all over the place, and whole quarters are just so many rabbit-warrens. Wait till you see the Machua Bazar. Well, besides the petty theft and burglary, we have heavy cases of forgery and fraud, that leave us with our wits pitted against a Bengali's. When a Bengali criminal is working a fraud of the sort he loves, he is about the cleverest soul you could wish for. He gives us cases a year long to unravel. Then there are the murders in the low houses--very curious things they are. You'll see the house where Sheikh Babu was murdered presently, and you'll understand. The Burra Bazar and Jora Bagan sections are the two worst ones for heavy cases; but Colootollah is the most aggravating. There's Colootollah over yonder--that patch of darkness beyond the lights. That section is full of tuppenny-ha'penny petty cases, that keep the men up all night and make 'em swear. You'll see Colootollah, and then perhaps you'll understand. Bamun Bustee is the quietest of all, and Lal Bazar and Bow Bazar, as you can see for yourself, are the rowdiest. You've no notion what the natives come to the police station for. A man will come on and want a summons against his master for refusing him half-an-hour's leave. I suppose it does seem rather revolutionary to an up-country man, but they try to do it here. Now wait a minute, before we go down into the city and see the Fire Brigade turned out. Business is slack with them just now, but you time 'em and see." [...] An order is given, and a bell strikes softly thrice. There is a rush of men, the click of a bolt, a red fire-engine, spitting and swearing with the sparks flying from the furnace, is dragged out of its shelter. A huge brake, which holds supplementary horses, men, and hatchets, follows, and a hose-cart is the third on the list. The men push the heavy things about as though they were pith toys. The men clamber up, some one says softly, [...] "All ready there," [...] and with an angry whistle the fire-engine, followed by the other two, flies out into Lal Bazar. Time--1 min. 40 secs. [...] "They'll find out it's a false alarm, and come back again in five minutes." [...] "Why?" [...] "Because there will be no constables on the road to give 'em the direction of the fire, and because the driver wasn't told the ward of the outbreak when he went out!" [...] "Do you mean to say that you can from this absurd pigeon-loft locate the wards in the night-time?" [...] "What would be the good of a <b>look-out</b> if the <b>man</b> couldn't tell where the fire was?" [...] "But it's all pitchy black, and the lights are so confusing." ...|$|R
