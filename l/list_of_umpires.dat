25|$|The Elite Panel of ICC Umpires is a {{panel of}} cricket umpires {{appointed}} by the International Cricket Council to officiate in Test matches and One Day Internationals around the world. The panel was first established in April 2002 when the ICC decided to reform the way that international cricket was umpired. The main change was that both umpires in a Test match {{and one of the}} umpires in a One-day international are now independent of the competing nations, whereas before 2002 just one of the umpires in a Test was independent and in ODIs both umpires were from the home nation. The majority of these ICC appointments are fulfilled by the members of the Elite Panel, who are generally thought to be the best umpires in the world. As such the ICC hopes to ensure that umpiring standards are as high as possible. Members of the panel stand in around 10 Tests and 15 ODIs each year. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>umpires</b> in the panel are revised every year by the ICC umpires selection panel and the current panel consists of ICC general manager Geoff Allardice, chief match referee Ranjan Madugalle, former umpires David Lloyd and Srinivas Venkataraghavan.|$|E
