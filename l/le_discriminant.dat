40|$|We {{explicitly}} bound the Faltings {{height of}} a curve over the field of algebraic numbers {{in terms of the}} Belyi degree. Similar bounds are proven for three other Arakelov invariants: the discriminant, Faltings' delta invariant and the self-intersection of the dualizing sheaf. Our results allow us to explicitly bound these Arakelov invariants for modular curves, Hurwitz curves and Fermat curves. Moreover, as an application, we show that the Couveignes-Edixhoven-Bruin algorithmtime under the Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions of number fields. This was known before only for certain congruence subgroups.

Pour chaque discriminant fixé, nous calculons le nombre des éléments de EQp qui ont un tel discriminant et nous donnons <b>les</b> <b>discriminants</b> et <b>les</b> groupes de Galois (avec leur fil-trations des groupes de ramification) de leurs clôtures normales. Nous montrons aussi que l’on peut generalizer cette méthode pour obtenir une classification des extensions qui appartiennent a ̀ Ek. Abstract. Let k be a finite extension of Qp and Ek be {{the set of}} the extensions of degree p 2 over k whose normal closure is a p-extension. For a fixed discriminant, we show how many exten-sions there are in EQp with such discriminant and we give the dis-criminant and the Galois group (together with its filtration of the ramification groups) of their normal closure. We show how this method can be generalized to get a {{classification of}} the extensions in Ek. 1. Notation, preliminaries and results. Throughout this paper, p is an odd prime and k will be a fixed p-adic field of degree d over Qp which does not contain any primitive p-th root of unity. If E is a p-adic field and L|E is a finite extension, then we say that L|E is a p-extension if it is Galois and its degree is a power of p. The aim of the present paper is to give a classification of the extensions of degree p 2 over Qp whose normal closure is a p-extension. This classification is based on the discriminant of the extension and on the Galois group and the discriminant of its normal closure. Let Ek be {{the set of the}} extensions of degree p 2 over k whose normal closure is a p-extension. Then for every L ∈ Ek, there exists a cyclic extension K|k of degree p, K ⊆ L and L|K is cyclic (of degree p). Furthermore, the converse is true: if K|k is a cyclic extension of degree p, then every cyclic extension L of degree p over K is an extension of degree p 2 over k whose normal closure is a p-extension (see Prop. 2. 1). Therefore, if K|k is a cyclic extension of degree p, we can ha l-...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Several studies 1, 2 have {{highlighted}} the high incidence ofpremature osteoarthritis (OA) in relatively young sportspeople follow-ing {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) surgery. Fewer studies 3 haveassessed the incidence of OA following non-surgically treated ACLpatients and to date no study was found that assessed OA in anuninjured control group. This study aimed to assess the incidence oftibiofemoral OA (TFOA) and patellofemoral OA (PFOA) in non-surgically treated ACL injured group and compare this to an uninjuredcontrol group matched for age and activity level. A secondary aim wasto assess the factors inﬂuencing OA in the injured group. Method: A cohort of 56 ACL injured patients were treated withoutsurgery and followed over the long-term. Twenty-ﬁve patients, aged to 46 years old, were selected from the cohort and matched for age andsporting history with 25 uninjured athletes in order to compare theincidence of OA in ACL injured and uninjured age-matched athletes. The injured group comprised 6 females and 19 males aged 23 to 46 years old (mean 32). The uninjured group comprised 9 females and 16 males aged 21 to 44 years old (mean 34). The patients were assessedfor clinical and instrumented stability and radiology using 4 x-ray views. Assessment of presence of OA by 2 assessors was based on theKelgren-Lawrence scale. The anterior-posterior views were taken inweight-bearing and the intercondylar views were completed asdescribed by <b>Le</b> Prade. A <b>discriminant</b> analysis was conducted toassess which factors inﬂuenced the development of OA. Results: 52 % of the injured patients had TFOA (32 % mild, 20 %moderate) and 32 % had PFOA (all mild). In contrast, only one unin-jured sportsperson (4 %) had OA, mild TFOA. A discriminant analysis(n = 56) found that 4 factors reliably discriminated between thosepatients who did and did not develop OA following ACL injury namely,meniscal injury (p <. 001); left-sided injury (p <. 014); older age atinjury (29 v 25 years, p = 0. 007) and time post-injury (15. 7 years v 9. 5 years, p = 0. 004), χ 2 (7, n = 56) = 49. 93; p <. 001. Conclusions: The incidence of premature OA following ACL injuriestreated conservatively is disturbingly high especially in comparison touninjured aged matched individuals active in sport. The incidence andseverity of OA {{is as high as}} that reported following ACL reconstruction. 4 The development of OA following ACL injury was inﬂuenced bymeniscal injury, older age at the time of injury, time post injury and leftsided injury. ...|$|R
40|$|Notre travail se situe dans le contexte de {{recherche}} d'information (RI) sociale et s'intéresse plus particulièrement à la recherche de microblogs. Les modèles de RI doivent s'adapter aux spécificités des microblogs : fraîcheur, aspect social et spécificités syntaxiques doivent ainsi être pris en compte. Nos travaux visent à améliorer la qualité des résultats de recherche d'information adhoc dans les microblogs. Nos contributions se situent à plusieurs niveaux : -Nous avons mené à une analyse de défaillance d'un modèle de recherche usuel. Nous avons trouvé que le problème principal vient de la concision des microblogs. Cette concision engendre une correspondance limitée entre les termes des microblogs et les termes des requêtes, même s'ils sont sémantiquement similaires. -Afin de compenser l'impact de la concision des microblogs, nous avons proposé d'étendre les requêtes (i) en exploitant des ressources de type actualités, (ii) en applicant des techniques de réinjection de pertinence. Nous avons enfin étendu les microblogs grâce aux liens (URLs) qu'ils contiennent. Nos expérimentations ont montré que l'emploi des URLs et l'expansion de requêtes sont primordiales pour la RI dans les microblogs. - Nous avons repris les critères souvent utilisés dans l'état de l'art et nous les avons évalués. Nous avons montré que les critères en relation avec les URLs sont <b>les</b> plus <b>discriminants.</b> -Afin de prendre en compte l'aspect temporel dans la restitution des microblogs pertinents, nous avons proposé trois méthodes qui intègrent {{le temps}} dans le calcul de la pertinence. Cette intégration du temps n'a cependant pas montré son intérêt dans nos méthodes. This work {{deals with the}} context of social information retrieval (IR), more particularly the retrieval of microblogs. Microblogs are messages of short length. They contain information on various topics :opinions, events, articles [...] . Microblogs represent {{a significant part of}} the information generated on the Web. In the case of Twitter, the most popular platform, the number of microblogs can reach 500 million per day. Microblogs have a different form from traditional documents. Their length is reduced compared to traditional blogs and articles on the web (only 140 characters in the case of Twitter). Moreover, microblogs can have specific syntax such as #hashtags, @mentions or shortened URLs [...] . Microblogging platforms are a social network model different from other social networks. Relationships between users are not necessarily reciprocal and subscriptions are unrestricted between microbloggers. Users of microblogging platforms do not only produce but they also search for information. The motivations of this research are diverse. Some are inspired from Web search (e. g. the search for news) and others are specific to the search for microblogs (e. g. real-time search or social information). In Twitter, 1. 6 billion queries are issued every day. Though, the IR models must adapt to the specificities of microblogs: freshness, social aspect and syntactic characteristics must therefore be taken into account. The aim of our work is to improve the quality of the results of adhoc information retrieval in microblogs. Our contributions are at several levels: -In order to accurately determine the factors limiting the performance of conventional models of search in a corpus of microblogs, we conducted an analysis of failure of a conventional model search. We selected relevant microblogs. However, they are not found by the search pattern. Then, we identified the factors preventing their return. We found that the main problem is the shortness of microblogs. -To offset the impact of the shortness of microblogs, we proposed and tested several solutions: to extend the queries by (i) exploiting news articles, (ii) using the WordNet lexical database, (iii) applying techniques of relevance feedback of the state of art which often proved effective: Rocchio to identify terms likely to bring relevance and for weighting the terms of the new query, and the natural extension mechanism queries of the BM 25 model. Using Rocchio, we tested different methods of calculating the weight of expansion terms. We finally extended microblogs thanks to the links (URLs) they contain. Our experiments have shown that the use of URLs and the expansion of the query are crucial for IR in microblogs. Most of these experiments (expansion of queries and microblogs) were performed on the basis of the vector model and the probabilistic model, as a model of restitution. This allowed us to compare the behavior of the two models on microblogs and with the two types of expansion. In general, we found that the Vector Space Model is more efficient than the probabilistic one in the selection of relevant microblogs (better recall). However, the probabilistic model puts more value on relevant microblogs returned over all returned microblogs (better precision). -A second part of our work is concerned with the study of the features used to identify relevant microblogs. We selected the features often used in the state of art (content features, features on the importance of authors, URLs features and quality features). Then, we evaluated them. We conducted this analysis in 3 axes. In the first axis, (i) we studied the behavior of the features in the relevant documents and compared them with their behavior in non-relevant documents. In the second axis, (ii) we analyzed the impact of the combination of the features scores with the content's score, calculated with a model of conventional IR. In the third axis, (iii) we used learning techniques as well as algorithms of feature selection that may be useful as input to the learning techniques. In general, we have shown that the features related to URLs posted in tweets are the most discriminating. The features related to the authors do not reflect the relevance. -To take into account the temporal aspect when selecting relevant microblogs, we have proposed three methods that incorporate time in the calculation of relevance. However, this integration of time did not show any positive impact in our methods...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. One key {{focus in}} the 21 st century is {{adjusting}} work and personal life in order for individuals to find a rhythm to help them combine work with other responsibilities and aspirations in their personal lives. Over {{the past few decades}} it has become evident that work and personal life are interrelated domains and that employed individuals experience interaction between these domains. Although the amount and extent of work-family research studies in South Africa have progressed considerably over the past decade, {{it is not clear how}} the experiences of the interference between work and nonwork roles compare to the experiences of employees in other countries. There is also no South Africa instrument that measures the interference between work and different nonwork roles in both directions (work-to-nonwork and nonwork-to-work). This could pose potential problems for organisations and future workfamily studies in South Africa. The objectives of this research were 1) to gain insight into the interaction between work and personal life in the South African context and how South African employees experience this interaction; 2) to develop a new work-nonwork interference instrument that is suitable for the South African context and that addresses measurement and theoretical issues relating to previous work-family instruments; and 3) to test the psychometric properties of the newly developed work-nonwork interference instrument. The empirical study consisted of three phases. During the first phase, exploratory interviews (i. e. 92 interviews) were conducted in order to gather information regarding the interaction that individuals experience between their work and their personal lives. Thereafter, a new instrument that measures work-nonwork interference was developed and tested with a pilot study (n = 245) in order to overcome some of the measurement limitations relating to previous work-family instruments. During the final phase, the psychometric properties of the newly developed work-nonwork interference instrument were tested (<b>Le.</b> construct validity, <b>discriminant</b> validity, convergent validity and external validity; n = 366). Results from the exploratory phase indicated that South African employees experience various forms of interaction between their work and other dimensions in their personal life (e. g. domestic, leisure, exercise, studies, community, extended family and religion/spirituality). In addition, South African employees experience various stressors in their work environment that contribute to this interaction (i. e. general stressors such as pressure, overload, workload, stressful working arrangements, and strenuous relationships at work, and more occupation-specific stressors such as stressful nature of the job and not being valued in an unsupportive work environment). Additional supportive aspects present in their work environment included supportive work arrangements, supportive relationships at work and occupation satisfaction. Results also indicated consequences specifically related to all the forms of interaction (e. g. time-based consequences, build-up and spillover of emotions, and energy depletion) and consequences that are more related to a specific form of interaction (e. g. mental preoccupation, strain on relationships, managing responsibilities, limiting of work opportunities, energy generation, learned skills). From the exploratory study, very similar findings were obtained and some unique contributions were made to existing workfamily literature. The antecedents mentioned are in line with international literature (physical workload, time pressures, physical stressors, shift work and recipient contact) and the consequences are very similar to categorised consequences reported in international research (i. e. physical, psychological, behavioural, attitudinal, organisational consequences or work, nonwork and health-related consequences). During the second phase a new work-nonwork interference (W-NWI) instrument was developed which differentiates among interference between work and various specific roles in an individuals' personal life (i. e. work-parent interference, parent-work interference, workspouse interference, spouse-work interference, work-religion/spirituality interference, religion/spirituality-work interference, work-domestic interference, domestic-work interference). During the evaluation study various problematic items were eliminated using the Rasch measurement model. The fmal phase included the validation study where the psychometric properties of the new instrument were investigated. The results provided evidence for constrUct, discriminant and convergent validity, reliability and significant relations with external variables. Tills study provides evidence for the psychometric properties of the new instrument, which researchers and managers can use to investigate the specmc interference between work and different nonwork roles in employees' private lives. Recommendations for future research were made. Doctora...|$|R
