25|$|In 2003, House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay</b> {{engineered}} {{a controversial}} mid-decade redistricting. He {{was the only}} white Democratic congressman not targeted by the remap. However, his district was shifted slightly to the north. Tyler, {{the heart of the}} 4th for a century, was shifted to the neighboring 1st District. It did, however, pick up most of Collin County, which {{had been part of the}} district until the 1980s round of redistricting.|$|E
25|$|While Wallace ran unopposed in 2006, a {{political}} development was {{happening at the}} federal level in Sugar Land. On the night of April 3, 2006, former House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay</b> decided to retire from Congress instead of facing a difficult re-election bid (for a twelfth term). On June 9, 2006, he officially resigned from Congress. DeLay had been the focus of an indictment issued in Travis County, Texas stemming from his funding of Republican candidates through such groups as TRMPAC, which funded Texas candidates, and ARMPAC, which funded federal candidates.|$|E

25|$|The 2006 Texas 22nd congressional {{district}} election for the 110th Congress {{was held on}} November 7, 2006, and attracted considerable attention because this district was represented by former House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay,</b> a prominent member of the Republican Party, who resigned after being indicted and subsequently winning the Republican primary. Because of Texas state law (and court rulings interpreting it), Republicans, in order {{to hold on to}} the seat, would have had to win a write-in campaign, something that has only been done four other times in the history of U.S. Congressional elections.|$|E
25|$|In the November 2005 off-year elections, New York City, Republican mayoral {{candidate}} Michael Bloomberg won {{a landslide}} re-election, the fourth straight Republican victory {{in what is}} otherwise a Democratic stronghold. In California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger failed {{in his effort to}} use the ballot initiative to enact laws the Democrats blocked in the state legislature. Scandals prompted the resignations of Congressional Republicans House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay,</b> Duke Cunningham, Mark Foley and Bob Ney. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of both the House of Representatives and Senate to the Democrats in what was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the administration's war policies. Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters. Soon after the elections, Donald Rumsfeld resigned as secretary of defense to be replaced by Bob Gates.|$|E
500|$|When the United States House Committee on Ethics {{recommended}} {{a series of}} reprimands against Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay,</b> Hastert fired committee Chairman Joel Hefley, (R-CO), as well as committee members Kenny Hulshof, (R-MO) and Steve LaTourette, (R-OH).

500|$|In 2001, the Federal Election Commission {{ruled that}} Jackson, Jr. could hire {{his wife on}} his {{campaign}} payroll. The ruling stated that relatives can be employed {{as long as they}} were compensated [...] "no more than the fair market value" [...] for their services. [...] At the time, Sandi Jackson was employed by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the deputy director of training. Many other lawmakers have made similar arrangements without contacting the FEC for a ruling. When House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay</b> was charged with ethical infractions, matters such as these came to light. Jackson remained on the payroll of her husband's main campaign fund, Jesse Jackson Jr. for Congress, in 2006 as she considered a run for public office. [...] She also continued to be employed by Howard Dean of the DNC. Between 2001 and early 2009, Jesse Jackson Jr.’s congressional campaign paid Sandra at least $247,500, including at least $95,000 after Sandra became Alderman.|$|E

In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay's</b> Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.|$|R

January 2011, <b>Tom</b> <b>Delay</b> was convicted of money {{laundering}} and sentenced {{to three years in}} prison but was freed on bail while appealing his conviction. His comments in 2005 made Shays the first Republican to say DeLay should step down from the Majority Leader post. He fought to maintain the Republican Party rule that requires an indicted leader to step down — the rule that ultimately resulted in <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay's</b> resignation. Shays stated that he should resign, saying, [...] "Tom's conduct is hurting the Republican Party, is hurting this Republican majority and it is hurting any Republican who is up for re-election." ...|$|R

50|$|In October 2003, Bell {{became a}} target in U.S. House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay’s</b> 2003 congressional {{redistricting}} effort. One proposal would have thrown Bell into the heavily Republican 7th District of John Culberson. The final plan was somewhat less ambitious, but still put Bell in political jeopardy. His 25th District was renumbered as the 9th District, and absorbed {{a larger number}} of blacks and Latinos than he had previously represented. The old 25th was approximately 65 percent white; the new 9th was only 17 percent white. On March 9, 2004, Bell was handily defeated in the Democratic primary for District 9 by Al Green, {{the former president of the}} Houston NAACP, with Bell receiving only 31 percent of the vote.|$|R
50|$|The Republican {{race was}} from the {{beginning}} hotly contested between House Representative Bob Beauprez, and former University of Denver President Marc Holtzman. While Holtzman, who has never before held elected office, was once considered a long shot for the nomination, his message resonated {{with some of the}} Republican base. Holtzman criticized Beauprez for compromising with Democrats on key issues and for offering only belated and lukewarm opposition to Referendums C and D during the 2005 campaign. Such criticism grew strident enough for Beauprez to announce in April that he would no longer attend political debates which also included Holtzman. He is a fairly well-regarded conservative in his area of the state, but was recently a recipient of former House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay's</b> ARMPAC campaign contributions. DeLay is being prosecuted on charges of money laundering and finance charges. Beauprez has been criticized by many for keeping DeLay's money after the Texas politician was indicted.|$|R

Some of the people he accuses of having taken money from his team and clients, particularly members of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and Democratic Party politicians, have denied the allegations, calling Abramoff [...] "a liar".|$|R

Abramoff allegedly provided DeLay with trips, gifts, and political donations in exchange for favors to Abramoff's lobbying clients, which included the government of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Internet gambling services, and several Native American tribes. Two of DeLay's former political aides, Tony Rudy and Michael Scanlon, as well as Abramoff himself, pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges relating to the investigation.

2500|$|Traditionally, the Speaker is {{reckoned}} as {{the leader}} of the majority party in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command. For instance, when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections, Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader. [...] Despite this, Cantor and his successor, Kevin McCarthy, have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House, since Boehner is still reckoned {{as the leader}} of the House Republicans. However, there have been some exceptions. The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>DeLay</b> generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006.

[...] The initiative became politically toxic for Republicans when the Jack Abramoff scandal broke in late 2004. [...] Although some sources indicate that Santorum {{played a key role}} in the K Street Project, Santorum has denied any involvement. [...] In November 2005, several months after the indictments of Abramoff and Delay, Santorum told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [...] "The K Street project is purely to make sure we have qualified applicants for positions that are in town. From my perspective, it's a good government thing." [...] A few months later, however, Santorum emphatically denied any connection with either the K Street Project or Norquist, saying: [...] "I had absolutely nothing to do—never met, never talked, never coordinated, never did anything—with Grover Norquist and the quote K Street Project."
