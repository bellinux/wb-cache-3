5000|$|Ex-Im Bank {{played a}} {{critical}} role during the years between the end of Lend-Lease (September 1945) {{and the beginning of the}} Marshall Plan and the World Bank's first authorizations (May 1947 - 1948). At the end of WWII, it was recognized that the U.S. did not have a credit facility capable of handling the demand that would result from the cessation of hostilities. One of the major rationales behind the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, the basis of Ex-Im's current charter document, was the necessity to dramatically increase Ex-Im's lending capacity to adequately respond to Europe's post-war reconstruction needs. The 1945 Ex-Im Annual Report predicated Ex-Im's role in the immediate post-WWII period: [...] "the Export-Import Bank was to be the principal source of long-term dollar loans for an extended period of time." [...] This assertion was based on the lack of interest by private capital in lending to foreign government buyers and delays in ratification of the Articles of Agreement for the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 increased <b>lending</b> <b>authority</b> from $750 million to $3.5 billion, almost a fourfold increase to help address these shortfalls.|$|E

Fryzel also addressed the severe liquidity challenges facing the credit union industry by requesting and receiving from Congress the authority to increase the borrowing authority of the Central Liquidity Facility from $1.5 billion to $41.5billion.Fryzel worked with staff to develop programs to stabilize the corporate system and prepare extensive contingency plans.In November 2008, Chairman Fryzel and the NCUA Board determined that extensions of credit by the Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) for “other than liquidity needs” were of national economic interest and obtained the concurrence of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury to invoke NCUA’s non-liquidity-needs <b>lending</b> <b>authority</b> through December 31, 2009.On December 9, 2008, Fryzel provided details on the Credit Union Homeowners Affordability Relief Program (CU HARP), unveiled in November, and a complementary program to provide contingent liquidity for the corporate credit union system, the Credit Union System Investment Program (CU SIP). These were new temporary initiatives for CLF extensions of credit to credit unions made to meet system liquidity needs.|$|E
5000|$|Roosevelt {{appointed}} Wallace to be Secretary of Commerce in January 1945, {{shortly before}} Roosevelt's death, {{as a sort}} of consolation prize for losing the vice presidency. Wallace's nomination prompted an intense debate. During his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in early January 1945, Wallace [...] "called to a guaranteed annual minimum wage for all employees, maintenance of high wartime wages in the postwar era, and automatic government pump-priming to be triggered whenever the number of jobs in the nation fell below 57 million. For both supporters and opponents, therefore, Wallace's nomination was a symbol of the Administration's intent to resume New Deal reform, with its emphasis on Executive leadership, at war's end." [...] Senate conservatives tried to stymie Wallace's prospective future powers through a measure, proposed by Walter F. George, to remove the Federal Loan Administration - and therefore the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and its $32 billion in <b>lending</b> <b>authority</b> - from the Commerce Department. This measure was adopted. Some conservatives, such as Harry F. Byrd and Josiah Bailey, sought to defeat Wallace's nomination altogether; Bailey made a motion on February 1 to immediately proceed to the nomination, [...] "in the belief that if the powers of the Commerce Department were not diminished, Henry Wallace would never win confirmation." [...] The motion was defeated on a 42-42 vote, however, and the George bill was approved before the Wallace nomination came to the floor.|$|E

5000|$|Changing {{world events}} and {{differences}} of opinion within the Eisenhower administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however. First, while a [...] "trade not aid" [...] strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize import policy. [...] On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products. The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as [...] "PL-480," [...] (which had been pushed by Sen. Hubert Humphrey) allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies. Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was used to supplement development assistance budgets, thus creating {{a new form of}} economic assistance. PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs. Second, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. South Korea needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953, and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam ramped up after the retreat of France in 1954. [...] On a global scale, the Cold War evolved (particularly after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953) in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally. [...] These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: for example, by the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen, by an influential former advisor, C.D. Jackson, of the Time-Life publishing business (drawing on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow), by the State Department, and by the National Security Council. [...] As a result, the USG decided in the course of 1954 to raise the profile of development assistance. [...] In June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank’s <b>lending</b> <b>authority</b> from $4.5 billion to $5 billion. [...] Following Congress’s August 1954 decision that technical assistance for developing countries should be put back under the State Department, Pres. Eisenhower also separated it from military assistance by abolishing the MSA {{at the same time as}} he put the new International Cooperation Administration (ICA) in the State Department, in May 1955. In November 1954, the administration decided to endorse the proposed International Finance Corporation, which as part of the World Bank would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries. The IFC idea had been discussed by the World Bank with the Truman administration since the late 1940s and had been supported by the 1951 report of the [...] "International Development Advisory Board" [...] established by Pres. Truman and chaired by Nelson Rockefeller. The IFC was finally established in 1956. [...] Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy, which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development. In April 1955, Pres. Eisenhower proposed a special economic fund for Asia.|$|E

This paper develops simple models of a twotier hierarchy (the center vs. the local) to study the optimal division of <b>lending</b> <b>authority</b> between central and local bank managers. Using a unique data set collected by the authors from a survey of rural financial institutions in China, we empirically assess the determinants of decentralization. We find that concerns over agency problems (collusion and government influence) and especially commitment failures (excessive refinancing) explain the recent trend toward centralization of <b>lending</b> <b>authority.</b> We conclude that the inability of financial systems to exploit local information in weak institutional environments may substantially limit the efficiency of financial intermediation despite financial market liberalization...|$|E
