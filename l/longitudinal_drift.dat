5000|$|As {{in other}} linear-beam {{microwave}} tubes, {{the energy of}} the output electromagnetic waves comes from the kinetic energy of the electron beam, which is due to the accelerating anode voltage. In the region before the resonant cavity where the magnetic field strength is increasing, it compresses the electron beam, converting the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> velocity to transverse orbital velocity, in a process similar to that occurring in a magnetic mirror used in plasma confinement. [...] The orbital velocity of the electrons is 1.5 to 2 times their axial beam velocity. Due to the standing waves in the resonant cavity, the electrons become [...] "bunched"; that is, their phase becomes coherent (synchronized) so they are all at the same point in their orbit at the same time. Therefore, they emit coherent radiation. [...] The electron speed in a gyrotron is slightly relativistic (comparable to but not close to the speed of light). This contrasts to the free-electron laser (and xaser) that work on different principles and whose electrons are highly relativistic.|$|E

The operator coefficients are 1 -periodic in the longitudinal variable.

The magnetic field non axi-symmetry {{is responsible for}} radial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drifts</b> in a way much similar to the neo-classical transport in a tandem mirror cell distorted by end plugs. Accordingly, a regime exhibiting large radial displacements - similar to the resonant regime in tandem mirrors - {{can be obtained by}} confining ions azimuthally, for example by means of a properly tuned radial electric field. Because of the mass dependence of the magnetic field non-homogeneity drift velocities, the azimuthal trapping is mass specific, allowing in principle the filtering of a specific species based on its mass...|$|R

The route of horizontal mining facilities primarily depends on: physical and mechanical properties of surrounding rocks and ore deposits, as on the thickness and way of providing the ore body, the construction costs and the projected mining method. It {{should be noted that}} within same types of rock exist zones with different structural characteristics, regardless where mining facilities will be constructed either in surrounding rocks or ore body. Different properties create a difference in stability of the rock material. Therefore, is essential for any rock type to determine its structural properties such as: discontinuity plane orientation, the degree of jointed on rock material, joint and joint family, as and stability of each block, located adjacent to underground facilities. ...|$|R

Spatially-resolved imaging reveals that spin accumulation observed in transverse arms develops due to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> of spin polarization produced at the sample boundaries. One- and two-dimensional drift-diffusion modeling is used to explain these features, providing a more complete understanding of observations of spin accumulation and the spin Hall effect.

The longitudinal compression is achieved by imposing an initial velocity profile tilt on the drifting beam. In this paper, the problem of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> compression of intense charged particle beams is solved analytically for the two important cases corresponding to a cold beam, and a pressure-dominated beam, using a one-dimensional warm-fluid model describing the longitudinal beam dynamics...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{relationships}} between the meridional and <b>longitudinal</b> ion <b>drifts</b> at low and midlatitudes that are enforced by the condition of a curl-free electric field is derived. The application of these relationships to observations from the Jicamarca radar allow additional properties of the observations to be exposed. The results of including and excluding these properties in plasma distribution calculations are discussed. Some possible alternatives to an electrostatic potential model for the ion drifts, which allow extreme features {{to be included in}} the conditions of a curl-free electric field, are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} slow magnetic Rossby {{waves in}} convection-driven dynamos in rotating spherical shells. Quasi-geostrophic waves riding on a mean zonal flow {{may account for}} some of the geomagnetic westward drifts and have the potential to allow the toroidal field strength within the planetary fluid core to be estimated. We extend the work of Hori et al. (2015) to include a wider range of models, and perform a detailed analysis of the results. We find that a predicted dispersion relation matches well with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drifts</b> observed in our strong-field dynamos. We discuss the validity of our linear theory, since we also find that the nonlinear Lorentz terms influence the observed waveforms. These wave motions are excited by convective instability, which determines the preferred azimuthal wavenumbers. Studies of linear rotating magnetoconvection have suggested that slow magnetic Rossby modes emerge in the magnetostrophic regime, in which the Lorentz and Coriolis forces are in balance in the vorticity equation. We confirm this to be predominant balance for the slow waves we have detected in nonlinear dynamo systems. We also show that a completely different wave regime emerges if the magnetic field is not present. Finally we report the corresponding radial magnetic field variations observed at the surface of the shell in our simulations and discuss the detectability of these waves in the geomagnetic secular variation...|$|R

Three of the spots were very small (less than 1 arcsec in diameter), but show on the best photographs obtained at the Mauna Kea Observatory station of the NASA-Lowell Planetary Patrol. The spots are not greatly distinguished from other Jovian features {{on the basis of}} their rotation or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift.</b> Their distinct red color is the main point of interest in light of current ideas as to the origin and nature of the Great Red Spot...|$|E

The motion description {{takes into account the}} perturbations introduced by earth's tesseral harmonics and by the luni-solar gravity, assuming a near-circular orbit that requires only the control of orbital energy to repeat the ideal drift cycle via a single impulsive velocity change. The location of the maneuver along the orbit is such that the post-Delta-V eccentricity is always minimized...|$|E

In this paper, critical electron energies are calculated for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> resonance, snowplow (i. e., strong) absorption, leapfrog, and corkscrew effects, using a reduced version of OTD that neglects nonaxial dipole offsets. Earlier analytic work on sweeping rates is extended to give the radial dependence of these rates within the minimum-L region and to set limits on diffusion of electrons with the simplifying approximation that leapfrog effects are ignored...|$|E

40|$|During the First Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition 1984 / 85,observation on {{whistler}} and VLF emission {{was carried}} out by using GM type VLF broadband direction-finding receiver. The morphology of whistlers received shows two peaks of their activity at 17 - 20 LT around sunset and at 03 - 06 LT of the early morning. Whistler dispersion is greater during sunset and less after midnight. Detailed analysis of whistler data of Januray 23 and 26 at Great Wall Station reveals that the dispersions of whistlers propagating in different shells markedly decrease on the day of geomagnetic storm commencement (January 23). It implies a rapid depletion of the electron density in the shells. There is a downward flux of electron of 1 ×(10) ^ 9 el/(cm) ^ 2 s. A steady refilling process occurs in shells of L- 2. 8 - 2. 9 three days after the storm on January 26. Whistler direction-finding data obtained on January 20 show that the exit points of the whistlers are situated in a strip of about 80 km wide in longitudes whith an azimuthal direction 20 °- 40 °E of N between 48 °- 52 ° geomagnetic latitude, and there are no obvious cross L or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drifts.</b> Whistler data at Great Wall Station are very useful for deducing temporal and spatial variations of electron density in L- 2 - 3 shells and investigating particle interchange processes between the ionosphere and the plasmasphere...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} analysis of <b>longitudinal</b> particle <b>drifting</b> in a standing {{circularly polarized wave}} at extreme intensities when quantum radiation reaction (RR) effects should be accounted for. To get an insight into the physics of this phenomenon we made a comparative study considering the RR force in the Landau-Lifshitz or quantum-corrected form, including the case of photon emission stochasticity. It is shown that the cases of circular and linear polarization are qualitatively different. Moreover, specific features of particle dynamics have a strong impact on spatial structures of the electron-positron ($e^-e^+$) density created in vacuum through quantum electrodynamic (QED) cascades in counter-propagating laser pulses. 3 D PIC modeling accounting for QED effects confirms realization of different pair plasma structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of turbulence {{and its influence}} on plasma viscosity have been investigated. A simple model of turbulence has been obtained by {{the balance of the}} growth of the combined Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, with the damping by friction against the neutrals, by kinetic viscosity and by turbulent viscosity itself. In the experiment with a hollow cathode arc, three regimes can be distinguished: a kinetic, a frictional and a turbulent regime. By variations of the discharge parameters around a suitably chosen operating point, transitions between the three regimes are caused. It appears that the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> velocity is also influenced by the turbulence. A dispersion relation for the large scale oscillation of the whole arc has been derived and checked experimentall...|$|E

Those with energies not less than approximately 75 keV move in longitude in the direction and with the magnitude expected from gradient B drifts. Lower-energy protons and electrons appear at the satellite sooner than expected from their gradient B drifts, as though the observed particles of such energies were not those originally accelerated but were newly produced from or by the higher-energy drifting component...|$|E

At the maximum of the event, electrons deposited approximately 50 ergs/sq cm per sec in the ionosphere, producing a peak density of 500, 000 /cu cm at 89 km altitude. At that time the radar observed densities greater than 100, 000 /cu cm between 70 km and 110 km altitude and riometer absorption at 30 MHz was approximately 12 db...|$|E
40|$|Neutralized drift {{compression}} {{offers an}} effective method for particle beam focusing and current amplification. In neutralized drift compression, a linear radial and <b>longitudinal</b> velocity <b>drift</b> {{is applied to}} a beam pulse, so that the beam pulse compresses as it drifts in the drift-compression section. The beam intensity can increase more than a factor of 100 in both the radial and longitudinal directions, resulting in more than 10, 000 times increase in the beam number density during this process. The self-electric and self-magnetic fields can prevent tight ballistic focusing {{and have to be}} neutralized by supplying neutralizing electrons. This paper presents a survey of the present theoretical understanding of the drift compression process and plasma neutralization of intense particle beams.

40|$|We report {{temperature}} and drift velocity measurements on the ion {{component of a}} plasma produced by the interaction of a UV laser beam with a Cu solid target. A XeCl excimer laser (308 nm wavelength, 20 ns pulse duration, 70 mJ pulse energy) was used, achieving a power density on the target of about 0. 3 GW/cm 2 after beam focusing. The diagnostics was performed by means of ion collector measurements. Suitable theoretical expressions were derived for fitting the recorded ion current, under the assumption of a “shifted ” Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the ion velocity. Two specific Faraday cups were used, which sampled the plasma in two orthogonal directions. So, a <b>longitudinal</b> plume <b>drift</b> velocity value of 5300 m/s resulted.

The objective of drift compression is to compress a long beam bunch by imposing an initial longitudinal velocity distribution over the length of the beam in the beam frame. The <b>longitudinal</b> dynamics of <b>drift</b> compression and pulse shaping for high intensity particle beams are studied using a one-dimensional warm-fluid model. Two self-similar drift compression solutions admitted by the one-dimensional warm-fluid equations are derived.

40|$|Remote {{observations}} of the Io plasma torus have revealed a persistent longitudinal asymmetry in the brightness of optical S(+) emission lines but not of ultraviolet S(2 +) emission lines. The S(+) asymmetry (with respect to the corotating System III coordinates) {{has been attributed to}} an asymmetric plasma source; the question then arises, why do the higher ionization states of sulfur not reflect a similar asymmetry? The explanation proposed here is {{based on the fact that}} torus ions do not quite corotate at the System III rate because of mass loading. If the resulting System III drift period of the ions is intermediate between the ionization lifetimes of S(+) and S(2 +), then the asymmetry of the source will be obscured by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> for the relatively long-lived multiply-ionized sulfur ions, but not for short-lived S(+) ...|$|E

40|$|Taxonomies are {{a useful}} method for {{providing}} structure when grouping {{large numbers of}} individual near-earth space objects in near-Earth orbits. In particular, lateral thrusting, <b>longitudinal</b> thrusting, and <b>drifting</b> may be directly linked to detectable changes in the orbital elements that affect object location and orientation. The purpose of this work {{is to develop a}} fully-automated taxonomy of the geosynchronous objects based on dynamical principles. Groups of objects are found using clustering methods; as such, two clustering methods are compared for constructing the taxonomy. The first is an adaptive k-means algorithm that does not require a priori information. It is compared to an agglomerative clustering algorithm that utilizes limits on cluster sizes to form distinct clusters. The effectiveness of the automated taxonomy is determined by comparison with the European Space Agency 2 ̆ 7 s DISCOS database and clusters from the Geosynchronous yearly report. ...|$|R

By separating the wave and mean flow contributions, we can infer the strength of the “hidden” azimuthal part of the magnetic field within the core. We explore the origin of the westward drift commonly seen in dynamo simulations and show that it propagates at the speed of the slow magnetic Rossby waves with respect to a mean zonal flow. Our results indicate that such waves could be excited in the Earth's core and that wave propagation may indeed play some role in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift,</b> particularly at higher latitudes where the wave component is relatively strong, the equatorial westward drift being dominated by the mean flow.

Replacing the conventionally used argon by neon would permit a reduction of detector depth by almost a factor of two. The measurements were carried out in a detector with 64 pairs of 2 x 2 cm ' proportional counters and a 50 cm drift space. Performance of the neon mixture was verified in a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drift</b> chamber consisting of 16 stages of 4. 7 cm drift each using Flash ADC with 25 ns sampling intervals.

40|$|Biomarkers that drift {{differentially}} {{with age}} between normal and premalignant tissues, such as Barrett's esophagus (BE), {{have the potential}} to improve the assessment of a patient's cancer risk by providing quantitative information about how long a patient has lived with the precursor (i. e., dwell time). In the case of BE, which is a metaplastic precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), such biomarkers would be particularly useful because EAC risk may change with BE dwell time and it is generally not known how long a patient has lived with BE when a patient is first diagnosed with this condition. In this study we first describe a statistical analysis of DNA methylation data (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) derived from tissue samples from 50 BE patients to identify and validate a set of 67 CpG dinucleotides in 51 CpG islands that undergo age-related methylomic drift. Next, we describe how this information can be used to estimate a patient's BE dwell time. We introduce a Bayesian model that incorporates <b>longitudinal</b> methylomic <b>drift</b> rates, patient age, and methylation data from individually paired BE and normal squamous tissue samples to estimate patient-specific BE onset times. Our application of the model to 30 sporadic BE patients' methylomic profiles first exposes a wide heterogeneity in patient-specific BE onset times. Furthermore, independent application of this method to a cohort of 22 familial BE (FBE) patients reveals significantly earlier mean BE onset times. Our analysis supports the conjecture that differential methylomic drift occurs in BE (relative to normal squamous tissue) and hence allows quantitative estimation of the time that a BE patient has lived with BE...|$|R
