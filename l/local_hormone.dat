50|$|Fatty acid {{metabolism}} {{consists of}} catabolic processes that generate energy, and anabolic processes that create biologically important molecules (triglycerides, phospholipids, second messengers, <b>local</b> <b>hormones</b> and ketone bodies).Fatty acids are {{a family of}} molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class. One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production, captured {{in the form of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis, when they are completely oxidized to CO2 and water by β-oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids (mainly in the form of triglycerides) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals, {{and to a lesser extent}} in plants. In addition, fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the cell wall, and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus). Fatty acids can also be cleaved, or partially cleaved, from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell, and <b>local</b> <b>hormones</b> in the immediate vicinity of the cell.

A tryptophan-free diet depleted intestinal 5 -hydroxytryptamine by a mean value of 90 %; in some rats, the depletion appeared to be complete.

Intraluminal and serosal 5 -hydroxytryptamine produced effects in 5 -hydroxytryptamine-depleted rats similar to those in the normal and in the control animals. Furthermore, the maximal stimulatory effects of 5 -hydroxytryptamine on peristaltic performance were not greater than spontaneous variations in performance in any group of animals, except with tryptophan-fed control rats, when the effects of the amine on peristalsis in situ were greater than spontaneous variation.

40|$|The human {{placenta}} produces several hypophysiotropic factors that {{participate in the}} control of <b>local</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion. In particular, previous reports showed that inhibin and activin modulate both GnRH release and hormonal effect in cultured {{human placenta}}l cells. The present study evaluated the possible correlations among the synthesis and cellular distribution of inhibin, activin, and GnRH in placental villi at term. mRNA coding for inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunits and GnRH were localized in human placenta at term by in situ hybridization using the corresponding cDNA probes. Autoradiograms revealed that some placental cells express inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit and GnRH mRNAs. A common localization of the three hormonal mRNAs {{has been found in}} the inner part of the villi. Using affinity-purified polyclonal antisera, immunocytochemical studies confirmed that in placental villi at term, immunoreactive inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunits and GnRH had a distribution that was superimposable in several areas. Both the outer layer and the inner trophoblasts contained immunoreactive hormonal products. The present data show that some placental cells at term can produce and release inhibin, activin, and/or GnRH.

40|$|A {{long period}} of silk {{viability}} is critical for a good seed setting rate in maize (Zea mays L.), especially for inbred lines and hybrids with a long interval between anthesis and silking. To explore the molecular mechanism of silk viability and its heterosis, three inbred lines with different silk viability characteristics (Xun 928, Lx 9801, and Zong 3) and their two hybrids (Xun 928 ×Zong 3 and Lx 9801 ×Zong 3) were analyzed at different developmental stages by a proteomic method. The differentially accumulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and classified into metabolism, protein biosynthesis and folding, signal transduction and hormone homeostasis, stress and defense responses, and cellular processes. Proteins involved in nutrient (methionine) and energy (ATP) supply, which support the pollen tube growth in the silk, were important for silk viability and its heterosis. The additive and dominant effects at a single locus, as well as complex epistatic interactions at two or more loci in metabolic pathways, were the primary contributors for mid-parent heterosis of silk viability. Additionally, the proteins involved in the metabolism of anthocyanins, which indirectly negatively regulate <b>local</b> <b>hormone</b> accumulation, were also important for the mid-parent heterosis of silk viability.

40|$|Neuroendocrine {{research}} has altered the traditional perspective of white adipose tissue (WAT) as a passive store of triglycerides. In addition to fatty acids, WAT produces many hormones and {{can therefore be}} designated as a traditional endocrine gland actively participating in the integrative physiology of fuel and energy metabolism, eating behaviour and the regulation of hormone secretion and sensitivity. WAT is controlled by humoral factors, para- and intracrine factors and by neural regulation. Sympathetic nerve fibres innervate WAT and stimulate lipolysis, leading {{to the release of}} glycerol and free fatty acids. In addition, recent research in rats has clearly shown a functional parasympathetic innervation of WAT. There appears to be a distinct somatotopy within the parasympathetic nuclei: separate sets of autonomic neurones in the brain stem innervate either the visceral or the subcutaneous fat compartment. We therefore propose that the central nervous system (CNS) {{plays a major role in}} the hitherto unexplained regulation of body fat distribution. Parasympathectomy induces insulin resistance with respect to glucose and fatty acid uptake in the innervated fat depot and has selective effects on <b>local</b> <b>hormone</b> synthesis. Thus, the CNS is involved not only in the regulation of hormone production by WAT, but also in its hormone sensitivity. The developments in this research area are likely to increase our insights in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus type 2 and lipodystrophy syndrome...|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{is made of}} {{the hypothesis}} that endogenous 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) serves as a <b>local</b> <b>hormone</b> regulating ciliary activity in the lamellibranch gill. These cilia are sensitive to exogenous 5 -HT and respond to it by a prompt, sustained, and reversible rise in beat frequency; {{at the same time}} the carbohydrate metabolism is stimulated, as described elsewhere. Control gill contains small but definite amounts of endogenous 5 -HT according to bioassay, fluorometry, and chromatography. The amount can be increased markedly by exposing the isolated gill to the precursor substance 5 -hydroxytryptophan but not l-tryptophan. As the tissue level of 5 -HT rises, the spontaneous beat frequency also rises. Both remain elevated for hours and perhaps for days. The gill of Mytilus edulis is richer than the gill of Modiolus demissus in both endogenous 5 -HT and effective 5 -hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase activity. Modiolus gill lacks the 5 -hydroxyindole oxidase by which Mytilus gill destroys 5 -HT. What if any mechanism exists in Modiolus for degrading 5 -HT is not known, but monoamine oxidase is not present. The 5 -HT content of Mytilus and Modiolus gill cannot be modified by treatment with reserpine or α-methyl-dopa. Which cells of the gill synthesize and destroy 5 -HT has not been established, but these observations support the concept that the physiological activity of lamellibranch gill cilia is controlled by a serotonergic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptides, {{growth factors}} and cytokines are {{expressed}} in reproductive organs and tissues, where they interact with afferent endocrine messages to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation, <b>local</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion and vascular function. These events regulate complex processes such as gonadotropin pulsatility, ovulation, implantation and parturition. During reproductive life, a number of neuropeptides produced within the hypothalamus play a modulatory role in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, hence characterizing a hypothalamic paracrine system. The pituitary gland is a source and target of inhibin-related proteins, and these typical 'gonadal' products, once secreted by the pituitary cells, acquire the function of paracrine modulators of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. In the ovary, the effect of gonadotropins is locally modulated by growth factors acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner, although their precise role in folliculogenesis remains uncertain. Numerous local factors {{are involved in the}} control of endometrial growth, differentiation, receptivity and menstruation. Alterations in the paracrine endometrial system may underlie pathological processes such as infertility or endometrial neoplasia. The human placenta and its related membranes produce cytokines, hormones and growth factors that participate in the control of gestational development {{as well as in the}} maternal-fetal adaptation to gestational diseases. There is increasing evidence that paracrine signaling plays a fundamental role in all spheres of female reproductive function, and future research will concentrate on clarifying which of these local mechanisms play a decisive role in both physiology and disease, thus giving rise to new therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that normal human keratinocytes express muscarinic receptors, and that acetylcholine induces attachment of these cells to each other. We have now studied {{the ability of}} human keratinocytes to synthesize, secrete, and degrade acetylcholine. To detect and localize the synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase and degrading enzyme acetylcholinesterase, cultured cells and cryostat sections of normal human skin were pre-incubated with specific mono- clonal antibodies and stained with an avidin-biotin complex/alkaline phosphatase. The choline acetyltransferase activity was assessed by the conversion of [3 H]acetyl CoA to [3 H]acetylcholine, and newly synthesized [3 H]acetylcholine was detected using thin-layer chromatography. The acetylcholinesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Both cholinergic enzymes were present in cultured keratinocytes, and in basal, spinous and granular epidermal cell layers. Choline acetyltransferase was visualized {{in the vicinity of}} cell nuclei, and acetyicholinesterase was observed in or near cell membranes. Newly synthesized acetyicholine was detected in both cell homogenates and culture supernatants. The estimated Vmax of the synthesis of labeled acetylcholine by' homogenized keratinocytes was about 20 pmoles acetylcholine produced/mg protein/mm at 37 °C. A single keratinocyte synthesized a mean of 2 × 10 - 17 moles, and released 7 × 10 - 19 moles acetylcholine per minute. Both cell homogenates and culture supernatants exhibited similar acetylcholinesterase activities indicating that human keratinocytes secrete acetyicholinesterase, too. Thus, we have demonstrated that normal human keratinocytes possess choline acetyl-transferase and acetylcholinesterase, and synthesize, store, release, and degrade acetylcholine. Because human keratinocytes can also respond to acetylcholine, we believe that keratinocyte acetylcholine works in the epidermis as a <b>local</b> <b>hormone...</b>|$|E
