5|$|The Red Army's winter counter-offensive {{drove the}} Wehrmacht from Moscow, {{but the city}} was still {{considered}} to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first {{appeared to be in}} shock due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to reduce the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk <b>landbridge</b> and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper {{at the end of the}} Second Battle of Smolensk.|$|E

50|$|Cheonjiyeon Waterfall is a {{waterfall}} on Jeju Island, South Korea. Literally, the name Cheonjiyeon means sky (Ch'eon) connected with land (ji). It {{is one of}} the main tourist attractions on Jeju-do. It is 22 m high and 12 m wide. Though water always falls in one particular area, depending on the amount of recent rain, the water may spread out. At the bottom of the waterfall is an artificial pond that is 20 m deep. Two small dams help keep the water at a specific level. Large volcanic rocks form <b>landbridges</b> that allow tourists to pose for photographs in front of the falls. These falls are characterized by its trachyte andesite rocks. The source of Cheonjiyeon Waterfall is a spring that comes out of the floor of the Somban Stream.

25|$|Fossilized pollen of Nepenthes-like plants {{living on}} the {{northern}} Tethys Sea from 65 to 35 million years ago indicate that then-warmer Europe may have been where the proto-Nepenthes developed, and then escaped to Asia and India as Africa collided with Europe and the ensuing climate change wiped out the ancestral species in the original habitat. 20 million years ago, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi and possibly even the Philippines were connected to mainland Asia, providing a bridge for the colonization of most sites of Nepenthes species radiation. The extensive <b>landbridges</b> in the area 20,000 years ago during the ice age would have provided access to the remaining sites of Nepenthes populations in Oceania. The main complication with this hypothesis {{is the presence of}} Nepenthes on the distant islands of Seychelles and Madagascar. It has been proposed that the seeds were transferred by seabirds and shorebirds, which rest during their migrations in swampy habitats and may have inadvertently picked up the seeds. This hypothesis is possibly reinforced by the success of the lowland swamp-dwelling N.distillatoria in colonizing so many locations.|$|R

While the average temperatures for this route are though to have been lower than the range needed for Formiciinae species, a series of hyperthemal events throughout the Eocene are suggested as aides in the crossing.|$|R
40|$|The endemic fauna of the South Island {{has proven}} to be an ideal taxonomic group to examine the impact of climatic and {{geological}} processes on the evolution of New Zealand's biota since the Pliocene. This thesis examines the phylogeography of McCann's skink (Oligosoma maccanni) in order to provide insight into the relative contribution of Pliocene and Pleistocene processes on patterns of genetic structure in South Island biota. This thesis also investigates the phylogeography of the brown skink (O. zelandicum) to examine whether Cook Strait <b>landbridges</b> facilitated gene flow between the North and South Island in the late-Pleistocene. This thesis also investigates the presence of genealogical concordance across independent loci for the endemic alpine stick insect, Niveaphasma. I obtained mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data (ND 2 and ND 4; 1284 bp) from across the range of both skink species and mtDNA (COI; 762 bp) and nuclear sequence data (EF 1; 590 bp) from across the range of Niveaphasma. I used DGGE in order to resolve nuclear EF 1 alleles and examined phylogeographic patterns in each species using Neighbour-Joining, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods. Substantial phylogeographic structure was found within O. maccanni, with divergences among clades estimated to have occurred during the Pliocene. Populations in the Otago/Southland region formed a well-supported lineage within O. maccanni. A genetic break was evident between populations in east and west Otago, while north-south genetic breaks were evident within the Canterbury region. There was relatively minor phylogeographic structure within O. zelandicum. Our genetic data supports a single colonization of the North Island by O. zelandicum from the South Island, with the estimated timing of this event (0. 46 Mya) consistent with the initial formation of Cook Strait. There was substantial genetic structuring identified within Niveaphasma, with a well-supported lineage present in the Otago/Southland region. There was also a genetic break between populations in Canterbury and eastern Otago with those in central Otago and Southland. The genetic data provided strong genealogical concordance between mtDNA haplotypes and nuclear alleles suggesting an accurate depiction of the historical isolation identified between the major clades of Niveaphasma. This finding offers compelling evidence for the use of nuclear gene phylogeography alongside mtDNA for future evolutionary studies within New Zealand...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{significant}} {{debate over the}} date of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian continent. Until the 1950s it was often believed that arrival of the first Aboriginal people was within the last 10,000 years. In the 1950s, the dates were extended to the last Ice Age, based upon falling sea-levels at that period {{and the existence of}} <b>landbridges</b> linking the islands of the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Continental Shelf with Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. The discovery and use of C14 dating extended the dating to 40,000 years at Lake Mungo, and this was the date most frequently given. However, more recently, the analysis of sea levels has shown that coastlines 40,000 years ago were not as exposed as they were 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The submergence of the earliest sites of occupation due to rising sea levels has meant that the earliest archaeological signature may in fact represent occupation much later than the initial time of arrival. The difficulty in establishing a date of arrival earlier than 50,000 years has been compounded by the widespread use of radiocarbon dating and the supposed [...] "radiocarbon barrier" [...] which establishes 40,000 years as a limit to which C14 dates can be easily and reliably extracted. This limitation has prompted many archaeologists, including Rhys Jones and Alan Thorne, to include thermoluminescence dating methods in their studies of early occupation sites. It is argued that 60,000 to 70,000 years best fits the evidence from the Human genome diversity project {{and a number of other}} new dating technologies. Some have proposed dates extending back 100,000 to 120,000 years, but these dates are criticised on technical grounds and are not accepted by most scientists. A recent study by Eske Willesev of the University of Copenhagen, of the genome of an Aboriginal man from the Western Australian Goldfields confirms that the Aboriginal population separated from the early human stock 70,000 years ago, in Africa or from Oman, and travelled fairly rapidly across south and south eastern Asia to arrive in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, before a second wave travelled into Europe and Asia, receiving some input from the Aboriginal people who had already made that journey.|$|R

40|$|In two volumes. The Hienuki River, {{located in}} Iwate Prefecture, Japan, {{originates}} on Mt. Hayachine, and joins the Komata River at a confluence downstream from the Hayachine dam. Construction of the Hayachine dam on the Hienuki River {{was completed in}} 2000. Previous to this study little research had been done on these rivers. This study found the overall species diversity of aquatic insects to be high in both the Hienuki and Komata Rivers. Twenty-five families, 50 genera, and 125 species of Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Tricoptera (caddisflies) were identified. Among them, two families and 15 genera are unknown in North America. Many taxa may have immigrated into the sampling area from the north (Hokkaido, Sakhalin and Kamchatka) or south (Honshu) through <b>landbridges</b> during the Pleistocene. The aquatic community was negatively affected by the Hayachine dam at the outlet, but recovery was seen within 4 km. Water chemistry was similar both upstream and at the outlet. Among the causes of community change may have been (1) the elimination of drifting aquatic insect fauna from upstream, (2) fluctuation of water flow and (3) destruction and alteration of food sources. The changes in food sources included (1) changes in algal growth and (2) reduction of coarse particulate organic material, (settled out in the reservoir) {{which resulted in the}} elimination of shredders. Flow manipulation may have caused the alteration of the algal community at the outlet, which in turn caused a reduction of scrapers. Furthermore, the abundance of blackfly larvae increased as the abundance of the caddisfly species (Hydropsyche orientalis Martynov) gradually decreased beginning in late May 2002. This decrease may have been the result of competition, since both blackflies and Hydropsyche are filter feeders. Cyanobacteria species that were commonly found in subaerial and aerial habitats were abundant at the outlet from late May 2002. This suggests that low water and fluctuation in water levels occurring between the middle and end of May 2002 had an effect on the cyanobacteria community. The presence of blackfly larvae and hydropsychid larvae are characteristic of the outlet of natural lakes. Their presence at the outlet of the Hayachine dam indicates a similarity with natural lakes. This study showed that species diversity and community similarity indices may be unsuitable for ecological study. Species diversity indices showed little species richness at each site, and tended to focus attention on the few most dominant species. Community similarity indices generally showed the similarity between upstream and downstream mayfly and the overall communities (mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies combined). However, these indices failed to detect differences for the caddisfly community. In addition, these indices were unable to quantify (1) the impact of the dam at the outlet and (2) recovery downstream. Rank abundance curves and tables may provide better pictures of species diversity and the community change of aquatic insects and thus be preferable to these indices. It is concluded from this study that the surface-release features of Hayachine dam prevented the extreme damage that is done to river communities by hypolimnion dams. Hayachine dam appears to be similar to a natural lake on a river, where changes appear to be minimal, and recovery is very rapid - within about 4 km, compared to lOO's of km in the case of dams with hypolimnion drains. It is recommended that {{from the point of view}} of natural communities, dams installed in geographic areas with large seasonal fluctuations in temperature should be designed with surface or temperature regulated release. This recommendation is especially critical in areas where winter temperatures drop below 4 °C and reservoirs and lakes are stratified...|$|R
