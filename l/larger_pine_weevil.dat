40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (<b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil)</b> and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (black vine weevil) cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. <b>Large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. Black vine weevil larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the vine weevil in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications. Initial interaction experiments against the black vine weevil did not show similar results to previous publications. However, larvae used in previous publications were younger than in this investigation which may indicate that interactions are dependent on larval age...|$|R

However, weevils developing in stumps of felled trees can be killed by entomopathogenic nematodes applied to soil around the stumps and this method of control has been used at an operational level in the UK and Ireland. We investigated the factors affecting the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes in {{the control of the}} <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> spanning 10 years of field experiments, by means of a meta-analysis of published studies and previously unpublished data. We investigated two species with different foraging strategies, the ‘ambusher’ Steinernema carpocapsae, the species most often used at an operational level, and the ‘cruiser’ Heterorhabditis downesi. Efficacy was measured both by percentage reduction in numbers of adults emerging relative to untreated controls and by percentage parasitism of developing weevils in the stump. Both measures were significantly higher with H. downesi compared to S. carpocapsae. General linear models were constructed for each nematode species separately, using substrate type (peat versus mineral soil) and tree species (pine versus spruce) as fixed factors, weevil abundance (from the mean of untreated stumps) as a covariate and percentage reduction or percentage parasitism as the response variable. For both nematode species, the most significant and parsimonious models showed that substrate type was consistently, but not always, the most significant variable, whether replicates were at a site or stump level, and that peaty soils significantly promote the efficacy of both species.

40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} damaging pests in forestry across Northern Europe. Its larvae develop in coniferous tree stumps on clearfell sites and adult weevils feed on seedlings that are replanted on these sites, causing substantial mortality. As the drive towards achieving the sustainable management of natural resources increases, biological control agents are being considered as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Though such agents have great potential for contributing towards a reduction in the ecological impact of pest insect control, they must also be investigated for any potentially damaging effects they may have in whichever context they are being employed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN; Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis downesi) are currently being inundatively applied to tree stumps on coniferous clearfell sites in the UK and Ireland as biological control agents against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> The aim of the laboratory and field-based experiments and field sampling of clearfell sites that were carried out for this thesis was to investigate the risks associated with this use of EPN in this setting.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} odour {{responses}} of insect olfactory (or odorant) receptor neurons (ORN) of blowfly (Calliphora vicina), mosquito (Aedes communis), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis) and <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis). A power-law dependence (similar to Stevens' law in psychophysics) was obtained for the action potential rate of ORN responses vs. odour concentration in measurements with metal microelectrodes from blowfly ORNs and an analysis system was developed for the extracellularily recorded action potentials (or nerve pulses). Odour exposure sequences were used to study action potential rates quantitatively as a function of odour concentration in air exposure. For an odour exposure sequence, a known initial amount of the odour compound in a filter paper inside a Pasteur pipette at the beginning of repeated exposures caused a gradual dilution of the odour concentration in the exposure sequence. The concentration at each exposure was calculated according to the discrete multiple headspace extraction and dilution (DMHED) method. The estimated odour concentration was assumed to obey in the method an exponential law with respect to the exposure number in the sequence. Despite that many uncontrollable parameters remain for measuring quantitatively the characteristics of the ORNs, the results obtained, e. g., sensitivity, specificity, adaptability, and the power-law realation are both biologically and technically very interesting. A time-to-voltage converter (TVC) was utilized for the response analysis in determining action potential intervals originating from a single ORN. A precision analysis of TVC was also performed. With the mosquito (Aedes communis), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis) and <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis) antennae were tested for inhibitory and excitatory effects to find out repellents and attractants. Human sweat was found to cause strong stimulus exposure in the responses of the mosquito ORNs and Neutroil® caused inhibitory responses in <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> ORNs, respectively. The power-law exponents for blowfly ORNs were about 0. 19 in the case of 1 -hexanol (HX), 0. 065 in the case of 1, 4 -diaminobutane (14 DAB) and 0. 32 in the case of butyric acid (BA).

40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hylobius abietis, is {{a serious}} threat to {{reforestation}} in Europe that necessitates routine use of chemical insecticides. Application of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) to the coniferous tree stumps in which weevils breed has the potential to reduce the use of chemical pesticides. During field trials to assess the efficacy of nematodes against <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> non-target beetles were also identified and quantified on 10 sites (14 trials). Nematodes were applied to stumps between June and July. Emergence traps captured beetles exiting from nematode-treated and untreated control stumps. Four trials were monitored in the months immediately following nematode application and ten were monitored the year after nematode application. A total of 65 species of non-target beetles were recovered, including 11 saproxylic species. We found no evidence of an effect of applied EPN on non-target beetle species richness, abundance, species richness per individual collected, or Shannon’s entropy (H’) either immediately or a year after nematode application, when more wood-specialists were recorded. As expected, there were marked differences between sites and/or tree species in the populations of non-target beetles recovered.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on three inter-related studies: the first part deals with the {{microbial}} consortium, the identification of microbes and their volatiles, the second part deals with the study of bio-chemical control methods of two conifer pests; the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis (L.) and the root rot fungi Heterobasidion spp., and the third part describes the production of styrene by a fungus using forest waste. The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis L.) is an economically important pest insect of conifers in reforestation areas of Europe and Asia. The female weevils protect their eggs from feeding conspecifics by adding frass (mixture of weevil feces and chewed bark) along with the eggs. In {{order to understand the}} mechanism behind frass deposition at the egg laying site and to find repellents/antifeedants for <b>pine</b> <b>weevils,</b> microbes were isolated from the aseptically collected <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> frass. Microbial produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were collected by solid phase micro extraction and analyzed by GC-MS after cultivating them on weevil frass broth. The major VOCs were tested against <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> using a multi-choice olfactometer. Ewingella sp., Mucor racemosus, Penicillium solitum, P. expansum, Ophiostoma piceae, O. pluriannulatum, Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida sequanensis were identified as abundant microbes. Styrene, 6 -protoilludene, 1 -octene- 3 -ol, 3 -methylanisole, methyl salicylate, 2 -methoxyphenol and 2 -methoxy- 4 -vinylphenol were the VOCs of persistently isolated microbes. In behavioral bioassay, methyl salicylate, 3 -methylanisole and styrene significantly reduced the attraction of <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> to their host plant volatiles. Heterobasidion spp. are severe pathogenic fungi of conifers that cause root and butt rot in plants. Bacterial isolates were tested for the antagonistic activity against fungi on potato dextrose agar. Bacillus subtilis strains significantly inhibited the growth of H. annosum and H. parviporum. Styrene is an industrial chemical used for making polymeric products, currently produced from fossil fuel.

50|$|In {{addition}} to being an efficient disperser, P. pinaster is known to produce oleoresins, such as oily terpenes or fatty acids, which can inhibit other species within the community from growing. These resins are produced as a defense mechanism against insect predators, such as the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> According to an experiment done in Spain, the resin canal density was twice as high in the P. pinaster seedlings attacked by the weevils compared to the unattacked seedlings. Since P. pinaster {{has the ability to}} regulate their production of defense mechanisms, it can protect itself from predatory in an energy-efficient manner. The resins make the P. pinaster less vulnerable to damage from insects, but they are only produced in high concentrations when P. pinaster is under attack. In other words, P. pinaster does not waste energy producing resins in safe conditions, so the conserved energy can be used for growth or reproduction. These characteristics enhance the ability of P. pinaster survive and flourish in the areas it invades. Both the traits of P. pinaster and the habitat in South Africa are conducive to the success of P. pinaster in this region of the world.|$|R

Juvenile trees of Pinus pinaster andP. radiata were exposed to herbivory by two major pest threats, the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis (a bark-fee- der) and the pine processionary caterpillar Thaumetopoea pityocampa (a folivore).

Stem chewing by the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> increased concentrations of non-volatile resin, volatile monoterpenes, and (marginally) polyphenolics in stem tissues.

We studied, in 17 half-sib Pinus pinaster families, (i) the effect of MeJa application on plant growth and on the induction of diterpenoid resin in different sections of the stem; (ii) whether MeJa-induced defences increase the resistance of living pine juveniles against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis in an in vivo bioassay and (iii) the induction of resin content after weevil wounding. Resin concentration was greater in the upper section of the stem compared with basal sections in both MeJa-induced and non-induced seedlings.

MeJa-induction was effective against the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> as induced seedlings were 21 % less damaged than control plants.

The proposed approach integrates information from different sources. Occurrence data of insect pests were collected from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), climatic variables for present climate and future scenarios were sourced, respectively, from WorldClim and from the Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and distributional data of host tree species were obtained from the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC), within the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). The potential habitat of the target pests was calculated using the machine learning algorithm of Maxent model.

40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis is {{a serious}} pest of {{reforestation}} in northern Europe. Development {{takes place in the}} stumps of felled conifer trees and emerging adults feed on and kill newly planted trees. Application of entomopathogenic nematodes around tree stumps has been shown to reduce the emergence of adult weevils. In order to target application at the most susceptible stage, the susceptibility of larvae and pupae to Heterorhabditis downesi and Steinernema carpocapsae was compared in a close-contact assay on filter paper. An average of 95. 8 % of larvae were killed by H. downesi and 82. 1 % by S. carpocapsae while only 16. 3 and 15. 0 % of pupae were killed by these two species, respectively. However, many of the H. abietis that were exposed as pupae died after metamorphosis to callow adult, with mortality of pupae and callow adults combined reaching 62. 5 % for H. downesi and 69. 9 % for S. carpocapsae. For both nematode species significantly more insects died as larvae than as either pupae or pupae/callow adults. When pupae were exposed to infective juveniles (IJs) for 2 days and were then washed while still pupae to remove surface IJs, adults were later found to be infected indicating that IJs can infect pupae, survive metamorphosis and subsequently kill adults...|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} {{are being}} applied to tree stumps on coniferous clearfell sites in Europe for inundative biological {{control of the}} <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis; Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major forestry pest. We investigated the risk that two nematode species, Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis downesi (Nematoda: Rhabditidae), present to longhorn beetle Rhagium bifasciatum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a service-providing, non-target saproxylic insect on clearfell sites. In a Petri dish assay, larvae of R. bifasciatum were less susceptible (LC 50 24 – 42) than pupae or adults (LC 50 ≤ 10) to infective juveniles (IJs) of S. carpocapsae and H. downesi. S. carpocapsae and H. downesi reproduced within R. bifasciatum larvae, pupae and adults, with up to 130, 000 IJs emerging per insect. When we applied 1. 8 million IJs (half the number recommended per tree stump containing <b>pine</b> <b>weevil)</b> to deadwood logs in laboratory and field experiments, both nematode species infected more than 50 % of R. bifasciatum within the logs. Field application at a lower, more realistic rate (18, 000 IJs per log) resulted in 0 – 11 % infection. The two nematode species caused similar rates of infection within logs and infected R. bifasciatum larvae more than 4 cm deep within the wood. On six clearfell sites sampled one to twelve months after S. carpocapsae had been inundatively applied to tree stumps for suppression of <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> < 10 % of deadwood logs contained infected R. bifasciatum and < 4 % of 1989 R. bifasciatum individuals in logs were infected. Infection was recorded a year after nematodes had been applied, however, suggesting that nematodes were recycling within logs in the field. Incidence of R. bifasciatum infection decreased significantly with increasing distance between a log and the nearest treated tree stump. Thus, our results indicate that entomopathogenic nematodes can infect and recycle in R. bifasciatum, but that the risk to this and other saproxylic non-target insects {{is limited by the}} targeted application of nematodes to tree stumps...|$|R
40|$|Methyl jasmonate (MeJa) is a plant {{chemical}} elicitor {{which has}} been used to artificially induce chemical defensive responses and resistance against herbivores in many plant species in recent decades. In this paper, we studied the effect of exogenous MeJa application at different concentrations (0, 5, 50, and 100 mM) on growth, chemical defenses and resistance against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis L in one year old Pinus pinaster Ait. seedlings. We also investigated whether the local application of MeJa on a basal branch would distally elicit defensive responses or growth reductions on the opposite branch and on the upper main stem. Exogenous application of MeJa induced resin accumulation in the stems, and enhanced resistance against H. abietis. The resin content in plants treated with 100 mM was nearly two-fold greater, and the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> consumed 80 % less phloem than in control plants. However, concentration of total phenolics in needles was lower in plants treated with the higher MeJa dose, probably because of a local toxic effect. We did not detect any effect of MeJa application on plant growth traits. In addition, the application of MeJa on the experimental branches did not significantly affect the resin content, nor growth rates of the opposite untreated control branches. However, the application of MeJa on the experimental branches significantly increased the resin content in the stem and total phenolics in the needles in the apical stem section of the seedling. These results suggest that the systemic effect of the MeJa induction is restricted to the most valuable parts of the seedlings, and should be considered in further studies aimed to understand the systemic resistance of conifers.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{evolutionary}} {{success of}} phytophagous insects could result from their adaptation to different host-plants. Alternatively, the diversification of widespread species might {{be driven by}} adaptation along environmental gradients. To disentangle the respective roles of host-plant versus abiotic environmental variables acting on the genome of an oligophagous insect, we performed a genome scan using 83 unlinked AFLP markers on larvae of the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> collected on two host-plants (pine and spruce) in four forestry regions across Europe. Results At this large geographic scale, the global genetic differentiation was low {{and there was no}} isolation by distance pattern, suggesting that migration is overwhelming genetic drift in this species. In this context, the widely used frequentist methods to detect outliers (e. g. Dfdist), which assume migration - drift equilibrium are not the most appropriate approach. The implementation of a recently developed Bayesian approach, conceived to detect outliers even in non-equilibrium situations, consistently detected 9 out of 83 loci as outliers. Eight of these were validated as outliers by multiple logistic regressions: six correlated with environmental variables, one with host-plant and one with the interaction between environmental variables and host-plant. Conclusion These results suggest a relatively greater importance of abiotic environmental variables, as opposed to factors linked with the host-plant, in shaping genetic differentiation across the genome in this species. Logistic regression allows the nature of factors involved in locus-specific selection to be precisely identified and represents another step forward in the process of identifying adaptive loci. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis (L.), LPW, {{is a major}} pest {{of trees}} in replanted {{coniferous}} forests in northern Europe. The use of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) applied against developing stages for population suppression is increasingly recognized as an effective alternative to plant protection using chemical pesticides. Here, we report results {{from a series of}} trials we conducted over 2 years using two species of EPN, Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) and Heterorhabitis downesi (Stock, Griffin, and Burnell) with different foraging strategies. Trials were conducted at lodgepole pine sites in Ireland on both mineral and peat soil type. EPN suspension was applied to the stumps of felled pine trees, and EPN efficacy was determined afterwards by directly assessing parasitism rates after debarking one quarter of the stumps and by collecting emerging adult weevils from traps erected over other treated and control stumps. Our results suggest that both species of EPN are equally effective in suppressing LPW populations to below the current, informal thresholds of economic damage. EPN were equally efficient in controlling LPW in peat and in mineral (lithosols/regosols and acid brown earth/brown podzolics) soils. Weevil density and distribution within pine stumps in peat versus mineral sites can explain patterns of LPW parasitism and suppression. Our results also suggest that infestation level (number of weevils per stump) can be an important factor in forecasting EPN application success as there is evidence of negative density-dependent parasitism when weevil densities were high. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelber...|$|R
40|$|In {{biological}} control programmes introduced natural enemies compete with indigenous enemies for hosts {{and may also}} engage in intraguild predation when two species competing for the same prey attack and consume one another. The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hylobius abietis L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an important pest of coniferous reforestation in Europe. Among its natural enemies, the parasitoid Bracon hylobii Ratz. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and entomopathogenic nematodes have potential as {{biological control}} agents. Both parasitoid and nematodes target the weevil larvae and, hence, there is potential for competition or intraguild predation. In this study, we examine the interaction of B. hylobii with the nematode Heterorhabditis downesi Stock, Griffin and Burnell (Nematode: Heterorhabditidae), testing the susceptibility of larvae, pupae and adults of B. hylobii to H. downesi and whether female parasitoids discriminate between nematode-infected and uninfected weevils for oviposition. In choice tests, when weevils were exposed to nematodes 1 – 7 days previously, no B. hylobii oviposited on nematode-infected weevil larvae. Up to 24 h, healthy weevils were {{twice as likely as}} nematodeinfected ones to be used for oviposition. Bracon hylobii females did not adjust clutch size; nematode-infected hosts were either rejected or the parasitoid laid a full clutch of eggs on them. When nematodes were applied to the parasitoid feeding on weevil larvae, the nematodes parasitized the parasitoid larvae, there was a reduction in cocoon formation and fewer cocoons eclosed. Eclosion rate was not reduced when nematodes were applied to fully formed cocoons, but nearly all of the emerging adults were killed by nematodes...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in biological control has been reflected during last decades in a big number of scientific publications, books and symposia. However, biocontrol commercial application at a European level is limited and biological control products are not currently available for the control of important pests and diseases that cause high economic losses. The objective of the European project BIOCOMES is to develop 11 new biocontrol products to control key pests and diseases present in agricultural and forestry crops, as a suitable and environmental-friendly alternative strategy to chemical products. BIOCOMES includes 13 private companies (most of them SEMs) and 14 research centres from 14 different countries, working together to develop tools and give solutions to the Integrated Pest Management in Europe. Main targeted pests and diseases are: gypsy moth and <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> in forestry, tomato leaf miner, potato moths, whitefly in vegetables, aphids in fruit tree crops, cabbage moth, brown rot in stone fruit, fungal root diseases in nurseries, Fusarium in cereals, soil-borne Verticillium wilt in Brassica and powdery mildew in cereals. Developed biocontrol products are parasitoids, entomopathogenic nematodes, viruses, bacteria and fungi, {{and at the end}} of the project, most of them will be at a stage close to market implementation. Brown rot in stone fruit is the only postharvest disease studied in BIOCOMES and the objective is to complete the development of the biocontrol agents Penicillium frequentans 909 (INIA) and Bacillus subtilis CPA- 8 (IRTA) to obtain products that provide an effective strategy to control brown rot in stone fruit production...|$|R
40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} damaging pests in forestry across Northern Europe. Its larvae develop in coniferous tree stumps on clearfell sites and adult weevils feed on seedlings that are replanted on these sites, causing substantial mortality. As the drive towards achieving the sustainable management of natural resources increases, biological control agents are being considered as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Though such agents have great potential for contributing towards a reduction in the ecological impact of pest insect control, they must also be investigated for any potentially damaging effects they may have in whichever context they are being employed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN; Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis downesi) are currently being inundatively applied to tree stumps on coniferous clearfell sites in the UK and Ireland as biological control agents against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> The aim of the laboratory and field-based experiments and field sampling of clearfell sites that were carried out for this thesis was to investigate the risks associated with this use of EPN in this setting. To this end, the persistence of EPN in soil and bark after application to clearfell sites was recorded and attempts were made to investigate the possibility of hybridisation occurring between an exotic and a native Steinernema strain. Effects of EPN on some important non-target insects on clearfell sites, the service-providing wood decomposer Rhagium bifasciatum and the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> parasitoid Bracon hylobii were also assessed in laboratory and field experiments. EPN presence in soil samples collected around tree stumps on clearfell sites five months, one year and two years after application of EPN decreased significantly from year one to year two. EPN presence on all sites sampled two years post EPN application was relatively low (less than 7 % positive soil samples). A similar trend was observed for EPN persistence under the bark of stumps. No EPN at all were detected two years after application on those sites treated on a small scale by manually applying nematodes. EPN persistence appeared to be better predicted by tree stump species (which in turn is indicative of the number of <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> developing within them) compared to soil type. Spread of nematodes was limited mostly to a 40 cm radius around stumps and little evidence of EPN presence in untreated areas was found on any of the investigated sites. While some spread of EPN to areas adjoining two of the sites occurred, there was no evidence of establishment off-site. (Chapter III). Attempts to distinguish between an indigenous and an exotic strain of S. feltiae and their hybrid using two molecular methods (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism or AFLP and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism or RFLP) were confounded by methodological obstacles. However, RFLP analysis of the strains did indicate a high rate of intraspecific and even intrastrain variation for S. feltiae. Using this method it was also possible to tentatively identify a field-isolated Steinernema sp. as Steinernema kraussei, though two other unidentified isolates could not be assigned to a particular species (Chapter IV). The saproxylic beetle community in deadwood other than tree stumps on Irish clearfell sites appears to be dominated by the longhorn beetle Rhagium bifasciatum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae; Fabricius 1775). Both S. carpocapsae and H. downesi invaded decomposing logs and infected all stages of this species within logs when applied directly to them. However, infection only occurred to a large extent (> 50 % of insects) if the applied dose of EPN was half that applied to tree stumps (1. 8 million IJs) to control the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> and infection was also significantly lower when such logs were incubated in the field rather than the laboratory. R. bifasciatum individuals were infected in all regions of logs and baiting of wood samples revealed that IJs were penetrating logs to their very centre, indicating high mobility and infectivity of IJs within this substrate. S. carpocapsae emerged in numbers of 1, 000 IJs or more per week for up to eight weeks after first emergence while H. downesi emergence had effectively ceased by the fifth week. A substantial number of live S. carpocapsae IJs remained in host cadavers even after eight weeks of emergence. Infection of R. bifasciatum was also recorded on three clearfell sites to which EPN had been applied around tree stumps previously (only a single infected larva found on one of the sites). Wood samples from some of these logs contained high numbers of EPN IJs (> 6, 000), suggesting that EPN were recycling within logs. However, since infection of R. bifasciatum decreased significantly as the distance between a log and treated tree stumps increased it appears that the risk to this serviceproviding non-target insect can be minimised by being as accurate as possible when applying nematodes. (Chapter V). The ectoparasitoid wasp Bracon hylobii Ratz. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is closely associated with the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> and may therefore be at risk if EPN are applied against the latter (eggs laid on EPN-infected host larvae do not develop to adulthood). Female wasps did not parasitise dead hosts in standard trials (small bark patch [2. 25 cm 2]; host either freeze-killed or killed by EPN). However, naive wasps parasitised hosts that were moribund (i. e. those that died of EPN-infection within the 24 h period they were offered to wasps) significantly less frequently than either healthy control hosts or infected hosts that survived the 24 h trial period. Experienced wasps (one egg laying experience) parasitised all of these host types with similar frequency. Behavioural observations provided no evidence of wasps locating heavily infected or dead hosts and then rejecting them. Heavily infected hosts that died within the 24 h trial period during which they were offered to wasps tended to move less than their surviving counterparts and wasp oviposition was significantly correlated with host movement and host feeding during trials. NaЇve wasps were significantly less likely to parasitise hosts that had their mandibles glued shut than those that did not (this had no effect on parasitism by experienced wasps). Thus, it is suggested that vibrations caused by these host activities were the most important cue driving host location and/or host acceptance in B. hylobii. In continuous 30 minute observation of trials in which wasps were offered a host at the centre of a large bark patch (20. 25 cm 2), experienced wasps spent more time close to the host when it was moving and were also significantly more likely to approach the host when it was moving, indicating a vibrotaxic response. Moreover, they only were attracted to dead hosts (freeze-killed or killed by EPN) when the bark covering them was being scratched manually from below to simulate host movement. Some experienced wasps parasitised freeze-killed and EPN-killed hosts when an artificial vibrational stimulus was added in this way and the dead host was moved about inside its chamber. B. hylobii also parasitised hosts the species is not known to be associated with, including larvae of longhorn beetle R. bifasciatum and waxmoth larvae (Galleria mellonella). These results suggest that wasp foraging behaviour, host acceptance and oviposition success is most affected by vibrational cues and that naïve wasps are less likely to locate moribund hosts that move and feed less due to infection with EPN. The risk is expected to be further mediated in a field situation where wasps are likely to encounter several hosts in one host patch and more likely to be attracted to those hosts that are healthy and producing more or stronger vibrational and volatile cues compared to moribund hosts (Chapter VI). In summary, persistence and spread of EPN after application to tree stumps on clearfell sites was low and there was no evidence of a substantial impact on non-target insects. It can therefore be concluded that the overall risks associated with the use of EPN as an inundative biological control agent against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> are low...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During their lifetime, conifer {{trees are}} exposed to {{numerous}} herbivorous insects. To protect themselves against pests, trees have developed a broad repertoire of protective mechanisms. Many of the plant’s defence reactions are activated upon an insect attack, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not entirely understood yet, in particular in conifer trees. Here, we present {{the results of our}} studies on the transcriptional response and the volatile compounds production of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) upon the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis) feeding. Results Transcriptional response of Scots <b>pine</b> to the <b>weevil</b> attack was investigated using a novel customised 36. 4  K Pinus taeda microarray. The weevil feeding caused large-scale changes in the pine transcriptome. In total, 774 genes were significantly up-regulated more than 4 -fold (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05), whereas 64 genes were significantly down-regulated more than 4 -fold. Among the up-regulated genes, we could identify genes involved in signal perception, signalling pathways, transcriptional regulation, plant hormone homeostasis, secondary metabolism and defence responses. The weevil feeding on stem bark of pine significantly increased the total emission of volatile organic compounds from the undamaged stem bark area. The emission levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were also increased. Interestingly, we could not observe any correlation between the increased production of the terpenoid compounds and expression levels of the terpene synthase-encoding genes. Conclusions The obtained data provide an important insight into the transcriptional response of conifer trees to insect herbivory and illustrate the massive changes in the host transcriptome upon insect attacks. Moreover, many of the induced pathways are common between conifers and angiosperms. The presented results are the first ones obtained by the use of a microarray platform with an extended coverage of pine transcriptome (36. 4  K cDNA elements). The platform will further facilitate the identification of resistance markers with the direct relevance for conifer tree breeding...|$|R

The new species is characterised by a relatively small body length of ca 583 μm (females) and 578 μm (males), a lateral field with two incisures, presence of a small vulval flap and a conoid female tail with a rounded or pointed terminus. Males have stout spicules with a disc-like cucullus and seven caudal papillae arranged as a single midventral precloacal papilla, one precloacal pair and two postcloacal pairs. In the character of the lateral field, B. antoniae sp. n. comes close to B. abietinus, B. rainulfi and B. hylobianum, whilst spicule characters place it within the piniperdae-group sensu Ryss et al.
