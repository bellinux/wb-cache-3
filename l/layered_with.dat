A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute saw the home side progress in a match <b>layered</b> <b>with</b> controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were all sent off in the space of ten minutes, the latter for hurling back a coin at the crowd. Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled out, before Tony Adams scored the winning goal of the match.|$|E
5|$|Kilve has {{the remains}} of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found to be rich in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are <b>layered</b> <b>with</b> {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E

The results are shown that these test methods and the diffussion rate of moisture through air <b>layers</b> <b>with</b> opened edges are satisfactory. The experimental results indicate that the air <b>layers</b> <b>with</b> opened edges of thickness not less than 2 cm have enough the effect of removal moisture when the height of the air <b>layers</b> <b>with</b> opened edges is 1. 8 m.

The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are <b>layered</b> <b>with</b> compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
