In addition, the total nitrogen (TN) load and its spatial characteristics in the Songliao Basin were estimated and analyzed with our estimation platform. Analysis of the estimation platform demonstrated that it is well suited to nonlinear mapping and spatial analysis. The estimation of NPS in the Songliao Basin revealed that the TN load generally decreased in the basin from 1980 to 2000. In addition, the TN load in the Songliao Basin was characterized by being significantly influenced by loads in neighboring zones. Concerning administrative areas, the TN load in Jilin Province was the highest in 1985 and 1995, while it was highest in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region in 2000.

3000|$|Variations in fluid {{velocity}} {{on various}} flow paths in discretely fractured geothermal reservoirs like {{those found in}} Enhanced/Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) {{have a significant effect}} on the thermal performance of a reservoir. One source of variations in fluid flow is from spatial aperture variations in the fractures. EGS reservoirs are developed in hot rock with low permeability and porosity to extract a portion of the stored thermal energy contained in the rock mass. A reservoir is stimulated by pressurization to open existing sealed fractures (hydro-shearing) or induce new ones by hydraulic fracturing where water may be pumped into and out of the fractured reservoir using a connected set of injection and production wells to “farm” or extract the stored thermal energy. While convective heat transport is the dominant mode of transport within the fractures, it is inherently coupled to conductive heat transport from the surrounding bulk rock. Because of the low thermal diffusivity of the host rock (of order 10 ^- 6 m 2 /s), only a small region surrounding the fracture network is effective for heat extraction. Given the finite areal extent of the fracture network, extended use will locally cool down the reservoir. The mass <b>loading</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> usually expressed as the total flow rate <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> fracture surface <b>area</b> is a critical parameter that often scales directly with the rate of thermal drawdown.

Wildfires across all major biome types globally consume about 5 % of net annual terrestrial primary production per annum, and release about 2 - 4 Pg C per annum, of which approximately 0. 6 Pg C comes from tropical deforestation and below-ground peat fires. The global figure is equivalent to about 20 - 30 % of global emissions from fossil fuels. Tropical savannas comprise the largest areas burned and greatest emissions sources from vegetation wildfires. Fires in Mediterranean forests and shrublands, tropical forests and boreal forests are also significant sources of emissions because they are generally characterised by much higher fuel <b>loads</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> compared with grasslands. Improved satellite data and sophisticated biogeochemical modeling enables emis-sions assessments on a global scale with fine spatial and temporal resolution. Emissions estimates are still comparable to those based on older inventory-based techniques, but uncertainties remain large. Fires increase during El Niño periods because parts of the tropics where humans use fire as a tool for deforestation experience drought conditions. These spikes contribute to the inter-annual variability of CO 2 and CH 4 observed in the atmosphere.

These values were used in a computer model (SAP 2000 and SAFE softwares) to find the best suitable foundation in each site. The model suggests that spread or continuous and raft (if basement is used for building with many floors) are suitable for Mosul. For Baghdad, spread and raft type of foundations are suitable. While, for Basrah, raft foundation type are to be used in some areas where building should be less than three floors and for other areas, deep foundation (piles or pier) can only to be used.

40|$|I {{was digging}} through my archives, and I came across this article that I wrote in 1993. It is still useful {{today as it}} was years ago. "If you're not using {{composite}}s, you're getting beat by people who are. " That was a quote out of a catalog from a company which specializes in selling composite materials to competition model airplane fliers. In most respects, the quo-tation is true. But I've always wondered, just how much benefit is the average modeler getting out of the use of composites. I started thinking about this several years ago, so at that time, I dug out one of my old engineering textbooks that had a chart in it com-paring the strength-to-weight ratios of several materials. Table 1 is that chart, with one exception; I added the data on balsa wood, because that is still the material of choice for model rocketeers, and competitive fliers in particular. To make sense of the table, you need to know what all the Greek symbols mean. Column 1 is the type of material. Col-umn 2 shows "σ avg " for each material. Sigma (σ) is the symbol representing the maximum applied <b>load</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> that the material can withstand without failing. There are three types of stresses being average here to obtain the average value shown in the table. Figures 1 shows these types of stresses, and {{what would happen to the}} material under destructive failure. Stress is independent of the material used. That is, two different materials (i. e., steel and wood) will have the same internal stresses if they have the same physical size and are being acted on by identical forces.

40|$|Transport of {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus from agricultural and urban landscapes to surface water bodies can cause adverse environmental impacts. The main objective of this long-term study was to quantify and compare contaminant transport in agricultural drainage water and urban stormwater runoff. We measured flow rate and contaminant concentration in stormwater runoff from Willmar, Minnesota, USA, and in drainage water from subsurface-drained fields with surface inlets, namely, Unfertilized and Fertilized Fields. Commercial fertilizer and turkey litter manure were applied to the Fertilized Field based on agronomic requirements. Results showed that the City Stormwater transported significantly higher <b>loads</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of ammonium, total suspended solids (TSS), and total phosphorus (TP) than the Fertilized Field, but nitrate load was significantly lower. Nitrate load transport in drainage water from the Unfertilized Field was 58 % of that from the Fertilized Field. Linear regression analysis indicated that a 1 % increase in flow depth resulted in a 1. 05 % increase of TSS load from the City Stormwater, a 1. 07 % increase in nitrate load from the Fertilized Field, and a 1. 11 % increase in TP load from the Fertilized Field. This indicates an increase in concentration with a rise in flow depth, revealing that concentration variation was a significant factor influencing the dynamics of load transport. Further regression analysis showed the importance of targeting high flows to reduce contaminant transport. In conclusion, for watersheds similar to this one, management practices should be directed to load reduction of ammonium and TSS from urban areas, and nitrate from cropland while TP should be a target for both...|$|R
40|$|By {{processing}} {{spent fuel}} {{to remove the}} actinides, the thermal properties of the resulting high-level waste are substantially altered. In particular, the {open_quotes}thermal half-life{close_quotes} of the waste is reduced from centuries to about 30 years. This paper evaluates a High-Efficiency Waste Emplacement Concept (HEWEC) that {{takes advantage of the}} decrease in thermal half-life. The HEWEC is based on the observation that the waste <b>loading</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of a repository is potentially limited by maximum allowable temperatures at several locations: the waste package (very near field), the rock surrounding the package and emplacement drifts (near field), and the large bulk of surrounding rock (far field). The first two are controlled by decay heat generated within years or decades of waste emplacement, primarily resulting from the fission products but with significant contributions from actinides. Far-field temperatures are controlled by decay heat generated over centuries, primarily from the actinides. While the critical temperature limit for spent nuclear fuel typically occurs within the package, it is close to limits in all other locations. However, if spent fuel without actinides (i. e., high-level waste) is emplaced in the repository, far-field temperatures no longer approach the limits, and waste loading is restricted by temperatures in near-field and very-near-field locations. If the repository is fully ventilated during operation, sufficient total decay heat can be removed to allow significantly more waste to be loaded in a <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> without exceeding temperature limits. Evaluation of HEWEC is based on analysis of several existing thermomechanical studies. It appears possible to increase the equivalent amount of waste loaded in a <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of a repository by about a factor of 4. 7 and application of the HEWEC precepts to unreprocessed spent fuel is not as effective, potentially increasing repository loading by only a factor of 1. 2...|$|R
30|$|Radiographic {{protocols}} of {{the knee}} in flexion {{have been shown to}} improve the detection of JSN by providing better exposure of the location of the greater cartilage changes in the posterior area of the femoral condyles [11 – 14]. The flexion weight-bearing radiograph is commonly used and is reportedly markedly better than the conventional radiograph in evaluating detection of JSN and disease severity [15, 16]. The contact zones of femorotibial articulation shift in both area and location as flexion occurs. As the knee is flexed during the stance phase of gait, the femorotibial contact area moves posteriorly and decreases in size. With greater <b>loads</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of <b>area,</b> the cartilage is more susceptible to degeneration in the contact zones of flexion. Because of this, the sensitivity and specificity of the flexion weight-bearing radiograph is markedly better than the conventional extension radiograph [15, 16]. In other words, the extension view risks underestimation in diagnosing OA compared to the flexion view.|$|R
