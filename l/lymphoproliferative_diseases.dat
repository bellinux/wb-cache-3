40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM: Pediatric liver {{transplant}} recipients {{are at high}} risk of Epstein-Barr virus infection. However the incidence of clinical symptoms and the graft function at the time of acute infection remains poorly documented. The aim {{of this study was to}} monitor the clinical and biochemical events associated with primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. METHODS: Clinical and biological patterns associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection were prospectively searched in 38 {{liver transplant}}ed children. Polymerase chain reaction and anti-Epstein-Barr virus IgM antibodies were used at regular intervals to detect the timing of primary infection. RESULTS: Five children (13 %) had pretransplant immunity, 26 (68. 5 %) developed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection 15 to 90 days after transplantation and seven (18. 5 %) remained Epstein-Barr virus negative. The four patients with clinical symptoms at the time of infection subsequently developed post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> A single post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> occurred in non-symptomatic patients (overall incidence 13 %). No mortality was associated with post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> Two asymptomatic patients had abnormal liver function tests possibly related to primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. CONCLUSION: Epstein-Barr virus primary infection occurs in 80 % of seronegative patients within 3 months after OLT.

40|$|Autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> {{share some}} {{etiologic}} mechanisms. The {{origin of the}} diseases is complicated process that involves an accumulation of hereditary and somatic mutations in a hematopoetic cell, which thanks to changed activity overcomes different growth and survival control checkpoints. Such mutations are for example those located in genes coding for transcription factors, apoptotic signaling molecules, costimulatory molecules and secreted exctracellular molecules. All these molecules influence the balance between survival and programmed cell death. Their dysregulated expression enables the cell to overcome defensive mechanisms of the immune system. Therefore, autoimmune and malignant cells are able to survive though, under usual circumstances, they would be selected.

40|$|We have {{conducted}} a study of a novel monoclonal A 3 antibody raised by means of hybridoma biotechnology. The study was performed with malignant cells of the patients with various lymphoproliferative disorders, and persons with nonmalignant diseases, as compared with intact lymphocytes from healthy people, using a method of immunocytochemical staining and indirect immunofluorescence technique. It was found that in cases of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> with low proliferation rates, as based on the numbers of Ki- 67  positive cells, {{as well as in}} non-malignant blood diseases, the A 3 antigen was localized in nucleoli, and it was visualized as focal fluorescence. In malignant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> with high proliferation indexes, the number of brightly fluorescent foci is observed, with formation of necklace-like structures within the nucleolar structures. The obtained data point to a diagnostic significance of A 3 Mab in assessment of cellular proliferative rates in patients with various <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases.</b> It was established that, in contrast to Ki- 67, the proliferation stage could be determined for each cell, according to the number of fuorescent foci in nucleoli.

Higher levels of c-myc mRNA expression were observed in lymphomas as compared with pseudolymphomas (p greater than 0. 05). No significant differences in c-myc mRNA values were detected between B and T cell pseudolymphomas.

40|$|Germline {{mutation}} of the linker for {{activation of}} T cells (LAT) gene at the phospholipase C-γ 1 (PLC-γ 1) -binding site {{leads to a}} fatal <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> in mice. The hyperactivated T cells that develop in these mice have defective T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) -induced calcium flux but enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. We used genetic analysis to investigate genes whose products might suppress MAPK activation and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> in LAT mutant mice. B-lymphocyte adaptor molecule of 32 kDa (Bam 32) is a known mediator of MAPK activation in B cells. We recently reported that in CD 4 + T cells, Bam 32 deficiency decreased MAPK activation and specifically extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling, following TCR stimulation. By crossing the Bam 32 null mutation onto the LAT knock-in background, {{we found that the}} Bam 32 null mutation delayed the onset and decreased the severity of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> in LAT knock-in mice. The pulmonary lymphocyte infiltration seen in LAT knock-in mice was also markedly decreased in double-mutant mice. Additionally, Erk activation was diminished in LAT knock-in Bam 32 knockout CD 4 + T cells. To more accurately determine the role of Erk in this delay of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease,</b> we also bred a transgenic, hypersensitive Erk allele (the Erk 2 sevenmaker mutant) onto the LAT knock-in Bam 32 knockout double-mutant background.

40|$|Genetic {{abnormalities}} predisposing to autoimmunity generally act in {{a cooperative}} manner affecting one or several mechanisms regulating immunological tolerance. In addition, many of these genetic abnormalities are also involved {{in the development of}} <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases.</b> In the present study, we have determined the possible cooperation between deficiencies in members of the Cip/Kip family of cell cycle regulators (p 21 (WAF 1 /Cip 1) or p 27 (kip 1)) and the overexpression of human Bcl- 2 in B lymphocytes in the induction of autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> in non-autoimmune C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. Unlike single mutant mice, B 6. p 21 (-/-) mice transgenic for human Bcl- 2 in B cells developed a lethal autoimmune syndrome characterized by the production of autoantibodies, the prominent expansion of memory B and CD 4 (+) T cells and the development of severe glomerular lesions resembling IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, these mice presented a high incidence of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Such genetic cooperation in the induction of autoimmunity was not observed in B 6. p 27 (-/-) mice transgenic for human Bcl- 2 in B cells. Altogether, what we have demonstrated here is the existence of preferential interactions among particular regulators of the G(1) /S transition of the cell cycle and B-cell survival in the induction of systemic autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a common}} and serious {{complication}} of organ transplantation. It is well documented {{that the risk of}} its development increases with the level of immunosuppression. Less is known about its incidence, prevalence, timing, and prognosis. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of all patients with <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> after renal transplantation documented in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry from 1970 to March 2003. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven cases of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> occurred in 15, 930 allografts in 13, 516 recipients. There has been a steady increase in its incidence and prevalence each decade since 1970. Cases cluster into an early group (< 2 years after transplantation) and a late group (5 - 10 years after transplantation). Risk factors include exposure to a calcineurin inhibitor, but there was no increased risk in those treated with anti-T-lymphocyte antibodies. Patient survival was poor: 51 % at 1 year and 39 % at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> is an increasingly common problem after renal transplantation, and the outcome is poor. Measures to reduce its incidence might include reduction of long-term immunosuppression exposure. Established disease has a high short-term mortality, and new treatment options, such as anti-B-lymphocyte monoclonal antibodies, should be aggressively pursued...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -associated post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{life-threatening}} complication following {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction to evaluate EBV-genome copy numbers based on a nested polymerase chain reaction and an end-point dilution was used.

The results demonstrate that EBV reactivations with more than 1, 000 EBV-genome copies measured in 10 (5) {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were observed in 31 patients (25. 2 %). Three patients developed <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> with extremely high EBV-genome copies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (> 100, 000 copies/ 10 (5) cells) and plasma. After combined antiviral and immune therapy two of three patients showed a dramatic decrease of EBV load and survived, while the third patient died of lymphoma. A subclinical EBV reactivation was observed in 24 cases (19. 5 %) with EBV-genome copies in 10 (5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells ranging between 2, 500 and mostly 10, 000. After reduction of immunosuppression the EBV levels normalized. In four patients, the high copy number of > or = 80, 000 copies/ 10 (5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma positivity prompted us to start pre-emptive therapy with rituximab and cidofovir for prevention of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> After drug administration the high EBV load was reduced remarkably.
