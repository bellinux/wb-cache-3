50|$|Electronic {{systems are}} {{sometimes}} used by retailers. Each shopping cart is fitted {{with an electronic}} <b>locking</b> <b>wheel</b> clamp, or 'boot'. US Patent No. 5598144A. A transmitter with a thin wire is placed {{around the perimeter of}} the parking lot, and the boot locks when the cart leaves the designated area. Store personnel must then deactivate the lock with a handheld remote to return the cart to stock. Often a line is painted in front of the broadcast range to warn customers that their cart will stop when rolled past the line. However, these systems are very expensive to install and although helpful are not foolproof. The wheels can be lifted over the electronic barrier and/or pushed hard enough that the locks break. There are also safety concerns if the person pushing the trolley is running, and also if the trolley doesn't lock and is taken onto a road, locking due to magnetic materials under the road. Some cities have required retailers to install <b>locking</b> <b>wheel</b> systems on their shopping carts. In some cases, electronic systems companies have encouraged passage of such laws to create a captive audience of potential customers.|$|E

50|$|As the {{automobile}} was introduced and became popular, cars {{also became a}} target for thieves and for a new concept that became known as joyriding. A variety of after-market security devices were introduced. An early invention were <b>locking</b> <b>wheel</b> clamps or chocks that owners could shackle {{onto one of the}} car's road wheels as a hobble, making it impossible to roll the vehicle unless the entire wheel was removed. Between 1914 and 1925 there were at least 25 patents related to wheel locks that attached on the tire and spoke wheel. These devices were available in many sizes from a number of manufacturers (including several patented by Miller-Chapman), and became popular during the early 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|The M40 {{is shaped}} like a long tube with an M8C [...]50 cal {{spotting}} rifle above. The spotting rifle fires a round whose trajectory closely matches that of the 105 mm round and gives off {{a puff of smoke}} on impact with the target. On the left side, there is an elevating wheel, in the center of which is the trigger wheel used to fine adjust the elevation {{and at the same time}} firing the spotting rifle when pulled, and the gun when pushed. The mounting is a tripod, but the front leg has a castering wheel. On top of the mount is a traverse wheel.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} obtain information on the tire-to-surface friction coefficients available in aircraft braking during the landing run. The tests were made with a C- 123 B airplane on both wet and dry concrete and bituminous pavements and on snow-covered and ice surfaces at speeds from 12 to 115 knots. Measurements were made of the maximum (incipient skidding) friction coefficient, the full-skidding (<b>locked</b> <b>wheel)</b> friction coefficient, and the wheel slip ratio during braking...|$|R
50|$|It {{could be}} {{regarded}} as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin, C.1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction; with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, {{the design of the}} coaxial escapement is more akin to that of another Robin variant, the Fasoldt escapement, which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.The latter escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two escape wheels of differing diameters. The smaller impulse wheel acts on the single pallet {{at the end of the}} lever, whilst the pointed lever pallets lock on the larger wheel.The balance engages with and is impelled by the lever through a roller pin and lever fork. The lever 'anchor' pallet locks the larger wheel and, on this being unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is 'dead', with the 'anchor' pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet.As with the duplex, the <b>locking</b> <b>wheel</b> is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.|$|E
50|$|Wheel speed sensors {{mounted on}} {{front and rear}} wheel {{constantly}} measure the rotational speed of each wheel and deliver this information to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU detects {{on the one hand}} if the deceleration of one wheel exceeds a fixed threshold {{and on the other hand}} whether the brake slip, calculated based on information of both wheels, rises above a certain percentage and enters an unstable zone. These are indicators for a high possibility of a <b>locking</b> <b>wheel.</b> To countermeasure these irregularities the ECU signals the hydraulic unit to hold or to release pressure. After signals show the return to the stable zone, pressure is increased again. Past models used a piston for the control of the fluid pressure. Most recent models regulate the pressure by rapidly opening and closing solenoid valves.While the basic principle and architecture has been carried over from passenger car ABS, typical motorcycle characteristics have to be considered during the development and application processes.One characteristic is the change of the dynamic wheel load during braking. Compared to cars, the wheel load changes are more drastic, which can lead to a wheel lift up and a fall over. This can be intensified by a soft suspension. Some systems are equipped with a rear wheel lift off mitigation functionality. When the indicators of a possible rear lift off are detected, the system releases brake pressure on the front wheel to counter this behavior.Another difference is that in case of the motorcycle the front wheel is much more important for stability than the rear wheel. If the front wheel locks up between 0.2-0.7s, it loses gyrostatic forces and the motorcycle starts to oscillate because the increased influence of side forces operating on the wheel contact line. The motorcycle becomes unstable and falls.|$|E
40|$|An artificial, {{manually}} positionable {{elbow joint}} {{for use in}} an upper extremity, above-elbow, prosthetic is described. The prosthesis provides a locking feature that is easily controlled by the wearer. The instant elbow joint is very strong and durable enough to withstand the repeated heavy loadings encountered by a wearer who works in an industrial, construction, farming, or similar environment. The elbow joint of {{the present invention comprises}} a turntable, a frame, a forearm, and a locking assembly. The frame generally includes a housing for the locking assembly and two protruding ears. The forearm includes an elongated beam having a cup-shaped cylindrical member at one end and a <b>locking</b> <b>wheel</b> having a plurality of holes along a circular arc on its other end with a central bore for pivotal attachment to the protruding ears of the frame.

40|$|Today the {{technological}} developments on the car's security system flourished, {{especially in the}} braking system.

Because based on the research, which has locking wheels during braking will cause the risk of accidents is greater. <b>Locking</b> <b>wheel</b> will cause the car skidded, especially on wet roads or on snowy roads. Therefore Antilock Braking System is an important safety system on the car, it would be dangerous if the braking system is damaged. Antilock Braking System have their own security system to detect any damage to the system. But this system only detects electrical damage to the Antilock Braking System, whereas mechanical damage to the ABS system can not be detected. Mechanical damage which may be found on the ABS system, among others: loss of pump efficiency, fluid leaks, the air blister in the oil, and loss of brake efficiency. In this final task will be given a simulation of the fourth mechanical damage. This simulation aims to find out whether the above four damage affects slip rate, vehicle speed, wheel speed, and distance to stop the vehicle after the brakes with Antilock Braking System damaged.
