Isn't there, just! that's all you know about it, my good fellow. Now I'll give you one example. One day, the inspector came in and told us {{there were a lot of}} blacks camping out on our estate down by the Warramidgee river. So we jumped on our horses like a shot, went down there immediately, and began dispersing them. We didn't fire at them, because the grass and ferns and things were very high, and we might have wasted our ammunition; but we went at them with native spears, just for all the world like pig-sticking. You should have seen those black fellows run for their lives through the long grass--men, women, and little ones together. We rode after them, full pelt; and as we came up with them, one by one, we just rolled them over, helter-skelter, as if they'd been antelopes or bears or something. By-and-by, after a good <b>long</b> <b>charge</b> or two, we'd cleared the place of the big blacks altogether; but the gins and the children, some of them, lay lurking in among the grass, you know, and wouldn't come out and give us fair sport, as they ought to have done, out in the open: children will pack, you see, whenever they're hard driven, exactly like grouse, after a month or two's steady shooting. Well, to make them start and show game, of course we just put a match to the grass; and in a minute the whole thing was in a blaze, right down the corner to the two rivers. So we turned our horses into the stream, and rode alongside, half a dozen of us on each river; and every now and then, one of the young ones would break cover, and slide out quietly into the stream, and try to swim across without being perceived, and get clean away into the back country. Then we just made a dash at them with the pig-spears; and sometimes they'd dive--and precious good divers they are, too, those Queenslanders, I can tell you; but we waited around till they came up again, and then we stuck them as sure as houses. That's what we call dispersing the natives over in Queensland: extending the blessings of civilization to the unsettled parts of the back country." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{fault with}} all {{lead acid batteries}} is the requirement for an excessively <b>long</b> <b>charge</b> time arising from a two-stage process: bulk charge and float charge. All lead acid batteries, irrespective of type, are quick to charge to 70% of capacity within 2 or 3 hours, but require another 9 to 10 hours to [...] "float charge" [...] after the initial charge. If users fail to float charge, battery capacity is dramatically reduced. All types of batteries have a [...] "memory" [...] in that every time a user charges to less than 100% charge, battery capacity is shortened. A lead acid battery could reach 4,600 cycles if it were kept on a shelf and kept at the right state of charge. To ensure a life of 8 years, a lead acid battery should be kept at full charge when stored (or dry), and, when working, kept at depth of discharge of less than 20%. In addition, its discharge rate should be not {{more than three hours}} and its charge rate should be not more than three hours (C0.333), and it should be float charged properly. With less careful use, a lifetime of two to three years or 700-800 cycles might be expected, dependent upon the use environment.|$|E

As a promising alternative, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest because of their distinctive photovoltaic properties [1 – 5].

Organo-metal halide perovskites are direct-bandgap materials with high carrier mobility, <b>long</b> <b>charge</b> diffusion, and large absorption coefficients [9 – 12].

40|$|The {{effect of}} charge {{geometry}} on the structural response of right circular cylinders, subjected to internal blast loading, was investigated. Thin-walled, seamless {{304 stainless steel}} cylinders were subjected to blast loads from partially confined bare cylindrical PE 4 charges with different diameter and aspect ratios(charges length to charge diameter). The diameters of interest were: 25 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 3). 30 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 1. 6). 35 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 1. 1). 40 mm (aspect ratios of 0. 5 - 0. 9). The effect of aspect ratio, for the constant diameter or constant mass cases, on the structural response of the cylinders (that is, diametric deflection, axial impulse, and axial shortening) is reported. Cylindrical charges with an aspect ratio of 1, were compared to spherical charges of equivalent mass. For charges with constant diameter with varying length: The diametric deflection increased with increasing aspect ratio. The axial shortening increased with increasing aspect ratio. The axial impulse increased with increasing aspect ratio. For charges with constant mass with varying diameter and length: The <b>long</b> <b>charges</b> (that is, charges with aspect ratios greater than 1) caused larger diametric deflections than their mass equivalent short (that is, charges with aspect ratios less than 1) charges. This is because the <b>long</b> <b>charges</b> had more side effective charge mass (that is, {{the mass of the}} charge that contributes directly to the diametric deflection of a cylinder) than the shorter charges. The short charges transferred more axial impulse to the ballistic pendulum, because they had more axial effective charge mass (that is, the mass of the charge that contributes directly to the axial impulse that is transferred to a ballistic pendulum) than their mass equivalent <b>long</b> <b>charges.</b> It was observed that a lighter charge can diametrically deflect a cylinder more effectively than a heavier charge, if its side effective charge mass is greater than that of the heavier charge. The structural responses of the cylinders obtained from cylindrical charge detonations were greater than those obtained from the mass equivalent spherical charge detonations. The deflections resulting from the cylindrical charges were also more localised compared to the spherical charges...|$|R
