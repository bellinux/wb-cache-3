50|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is {{an important}} health issue for children all around the world. The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (i.e., BLLs ≥ 10 µg/dL) among newly resettled refugee children is substantially higher than the 2.2% prevalence for US children. A 2001 Massachusetts study found as many as 27% of newly arrived refugee children with elevated BLLs, making refugees {{one of the highest}} risk groups. Refugees may be exposed to lead from a number of sources which can include: leaded gasoline, herbal remedies, cosmetics, spices that contain lead, cottage industries that use lead in an unsafe manner, and limited regulation of emissions from larger industries. The detrimental effects of lead on children may occur with no overt symptoms and blood lead testing {{is the only way to}} determine exposure or poisoning. Lead poisoning is typically treated by identifying the <b>lead</b> <b>source,</b> eliminating that source, and regularly receiving testing to ensure that blood lead levels are decreasing. For extremely high blood lead levels (i.e., BLLs ≥ 45 µg/dL), chelation therapy may recommended for refugee children. The CDC recommends lead testing for newly arrived refugee children younger than 16 years of age. Guidelines for testing vary among states, ranging from testing children younger than six years of age to the CDC age limits of testing those younger than 16 years of age.|$|E

Methods The authors analyzed childhood blood lead surveillance data from 1994 through 1995 and case management protocols from six states that reported the results of all blood lead tests. The study included 2109 children aged 2 years or younger who had a venous blood lead concentration of 10 – 19 µg/dL (0. 48 – 0. 96 μmol/L) and a follow-up venous blood lead test within 3 to 12 months. Results Overall, blood lead concentrations increased by 0. 25 µg/dL (0. 01 μmol/L) between the time of the initial elevated blood lead test and the follow-up test, but concentrations declined by 1. 96 µg/dL (0. 09 μmol/L) among children covered by a case management protocol that included a home visit and by 0. 92 µg/dL (0. 04 μmol/L) among those covered by a protocol that included a <b>lead</b> <b>source</b> investigation.

All village doctors were interviewed face-to-face using a “What do you know” test questionnaire focusing on prevention strategies and <b>lead</b> <b>sources</b> in rural children. Results A total of 287 (96. 6 %) village doctors completed the survey in full. Most village doctors had an appropriate degree of general knowledge of lead poisoning; however, they had relatively poor knowledge of <b>lead</b> <b>sources</b> and prevention measures. Village doctors with an undergraduate level education scored an average of 2. 7 points higher {{than those who had}} a junior college level education (p[*]=[*] 0. 033).
