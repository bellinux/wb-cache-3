5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy.

That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demands of the people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
