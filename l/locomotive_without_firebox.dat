50|$|In 1881, the Cape Government Railways placed {{six more}} 1st Class tank-and-tender {{locomotives}} with a 4-4-0 American type wheel arrangement in {{service on the}} Midland System. These engines were built as tender <b>locomotives,</b> <b>without</b> on-board coal bunkers and with permanently attached coal and water tenders.|$|R
50|$|A {{cab unit}} is a carbody unit with a driving cab, or crew compartment. Thus, a cab unit is also always an A unit (a {{locomotive}} with a cab). By contrast, a carbody unit {{can be either}} an A unit, or a B unit (a <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> a cab).|$|R
50|$|In 1881, the CGR placed {{six more}} 1st Class tank-and-tender {{locomotives}} in service on its Cape Midland system. These were built by Neilson and Company as tender <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> on-board coal bunkers and with permanently attached coal and water tenders. Two of them became SAR Class 01 in 1912.|$|R
50|$|The Big Boys are {{articulated}} {{like the}} Mallet <b>locomotive</b> design, though <b>without</b> compounding. They {{were designed for}} stability at 80 mph. They were built with a wide margin of reliability and safety, as they normally operated well below that speed in freight service. Peak horsepower was reached at about 35 mph; optimal tractive effort, at about 10 mph. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> the tender was the longest engine body of any reciprocating steam locomotive in the world.|$|R
50|$|In Russia, the 2-8-0 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was represented by}} the prerevolutionary Sch (Shuka-pike) class. These two-cylinder compound <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> superheaters were declared the standard Russian freight locomotive in 1912, but since they were relatively low-powered, they were only useful on easier lines without steep gradients such as the Saint Petersburg-Moscow route.|$|R

50|$|James I'Anson Cudworth (12 January 1817 - 22 October 1899) was Locomotive Superintendent of the South Eastern Railway (SER). He {{served in}} this {{capacity}} from 1845-76. He is notable for designing a successful method for burning coal in steam <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> significant emission of smoke, and for introducing the 0-4-4T wheel arrangement to English railways.|$|R
5000|$|Gurney's {{daughter}} Anna Jane {{appears to}} have engaged in considerable promotion of her father's claim to various of his inventions; the inscription on his gravestone reads: [...] To his inventive genius the world is indebted for the high speed of the <b>locomotive,</b> <b>without</b> which railways could not have succeeded and {{would never have been}} made.|$|R
50|$|The fleet stayed intact until 1951, {{when two}} EF-1s were retired - E51A+B and E68A+B. Two units of an EF-2 were retired in 1954, and the {{remaining}} numbers held steady until the mid-1960s, when old age began to take its toll. Locomotives were patched-up until un-repairable, and units within were swapped between <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> being renumbered.|$|R
50|$|Direct Rail Services has {{procured}} the Class 88 {{to serve}} as a mixed-traffic locomotive, capable of operating both passenger and freight services. Primarily they will be used to enable DRS to haul freight using electric <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> the need to hire in electric traction from other operators. However, as with the Class 68, they will also be capable of operating passenger trains.|$|R

50|$|From 1920, the cab side of Great Western Railway (GWR) steam {{locomotives}} bore {{a letter}} on a coloured disc, which enabled staff to quickly assess {{the capabilities of}} <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> the need to check tables of data. The letter showed the power classification, and the coloured disc showed the weight restriction. This system continued after the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways.|$|R
50|$|A B unit, in {{railroad}} terminology, is {{a locomotive}} unit (generally a diesel locomotive) {{which does not}} have a driving cab or crew compartment, and must therefore be controlled from another, coupled locomotive with a driving cab (an A unit). The terms booster unit and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> driving cabs are rare.|$|R
50|$|From 1988 onwards, the batch {{known as}} Class 243.8 was fitted with {{multiple}}-unit train control equipment. After these had been delivered, a further 109 <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> multiple unit train control were delivered till December 1990, resulting in Deutsche Reichsbahn having {{a fleet of}} 636 Class 243 locomotives at their disposal. 243 659 was the very last Class 243 locomotive to be commissioned, entering service on 2 January 1991.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{introduction}} of computers/IT in the late 1960s it became necessary to revise the numbering schemes, as the old numbers could not tell whether a class 10 might be a steam or an electric <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> including the prefix letters, which were difficult to process by computers of the day. Another problem was both class and ordering numbers could vary in length under the old system.|$|R
50|$|On steam <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> {{a second}} {{independent}} brake system (like e.g. a compressed-air brake, vacuum brake or steam brake) for the engine, {{in addition to}} the usual counterweight or fixed brake, the countersteam brake was used as a braking system. Today, steam locomotives generally have to have two independent brake systems in order to be licensed, so that the countersteam brake is not viewed as a braking system, but is nevertheless still used.|$|R
50|$|Like their predecessors, the {{condensing}} and Clara Class locomotives, {{they were}} equipped with sheet-metal casing {{above and below}} their running boards. This was to protect the motion and bearings, as well as working parts of the J. Hawthorn-Kitson valve gear which protruded above the running boards, from wind-blown sand. The bottom encasement was hinged to allow {{easy access to the}} motion. The picture alongside shows a Scotia Class <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> this casing.|$|R

[...] "I have passed down the great rivers of the world without a thought of salmon, and I have driven through the forest lands and across the mountains behind a giant <b>locomotive,</b> <b>without</b> a thought of the beasts which might be lurking there, waiting to be killed. My only desire has been to reach the next place {{where men and women}} were." ...|$|R
50|$|Searsport is Maine's {{second largest}} deep water port and is ideally located {{from the point}} of view of railroad, wood {{products}} and other development interests.http://www.maine.gov/local/waldo/searsport Indeed, the town became the Penobscot Bay shipping terminus for the Northern Maine Seaport Railroad, a line opened in 1905 by the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, which sent potatoes, timber and other products from here by boat, and loaded coal for use by its <b>locomotives,</b> <b>without</b> having to arrange rates with the Maine Central Railroad.|$|R
50|$|The {{track was}} {{originally}} laid direct on the ground, but this quickly proved unsatisfactory and {{some form of}} ballast was essential, to spread the load and to retain the track in its proper position. The natural ground is rarely strong enough to accept the loading from <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> excessive settlement, and a layer of ballast under the sleeper reduces the bearing pressure on the ground. The ballast surrounding the sleepers also tends {{to keep them in}} place and resists displacement.|$|R

5000|$|An Act of Parliament {{was secured}} in 1844 for the [...] "Treffry Estate Railway, or Newquay Railway", {{and this may}} have been due to the greater {{involvement}} in public works of the Newquay line construction. (A further Act, the Treffry's Estate (Newquay Railway) Act of 1857 confirmed the right of the Trustees to operate and maintain the lines already built, but allowed the abandonment of some sections authorised but not built; this latter Act forbade the use of <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> the approval of the Board of trade.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-In Indian railway one of {{the most}} {{problems}} is the accident. These problems regarding the trains and their corresponding tracks can be solved very easily. In this model, we have used two RF based sender and receiver kits to provide the necessary functions to the train locomotives. So now when the two trains are anywhere near, the paddle brakes provided stops either of the two <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> causing accidents. The project implemented by us is actually very much possible to be implemented on a larger and real scale. I...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Locomotives</b> <b>without</b> leading {{trucks are}} {{generally}} regarded as unsuitable for high speed use. The British Railway Inspectorate condemned the practice in 1895, following an accident involving two 0-4-4s at Doublebois, Cornwall, on the Great Western Railway. Other designers, however, persisted with the practice and the famous 0-4-2 Gladstone class passenger expresses of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway remained in trouble-free service until 1933. A single leading axle (known as a pony truck) increases stability somewhat, while a four-wheel leading truck is almost essential for high-speed operation.|$|R
50|$|In early 1944, the American Army {{provided}} six battalions {{of dedicated}} railway troops, about 4,700 men. By October 1944 they had raised {{the capacity to}} 4,400 tonnes and by January 1946 to 7,300 tonnes a day. This was possible by the increase in staff from two British, or Indian, officers to twenty seven experienced American railroad men on the same length of line {{and the introduction of}} more powerful American and Canadian <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Without</b> the trebling of capacity, the supply of Chinese troops in China {{would not have been possible}} once the Japanese attacked India and the Fourteenth Army counterattacked.|$|R
5000|$|By 1895 some {{drivers of}} early {{lightweight}} steam-powered autocars assumed that {{these would be}} legally classed as a horseless carriage and would therefore be exempt from {{the need for a}} preceding pedestrian. A test case was brought by motoring pioneer John Henry Knight, who was subsequently convicted with using a <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> a licence. The Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 lifted some of the restrictions introduced by the 1865 Act, notably raising the speed limit for [...] "light locomotives" [...] under 3 tonnes to 14 mph. The speed limit was lifted again by the Motor Car Act 1903 to 20 mph.|$|R
50|$|The engines had plate frames, Walschaerts valve gear, Belpaire <b>fireboxes</b> <b>without</b> {{combustion}} chambers and were superheated. They were delivered with Type MP1 tenders {{which had a}} coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal.|$|R
50|$|In {{exception}} to the general type, this Garratt locomotive had internal cylinders, and is {{more in line with}} other tramway locomotives in The Netherlands. The coal and water storage is located on the bogies. The water tanks were located below the running boards, to ensure pressure as applied to all axles even when running empty. Additionally, this allowed for unobstructed views from the cabin. The valve gear is of the Verhoop system. The two traction bogies, which were in fact <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> a boiler and cabin, were in their basic design and layout identical to B locomotives LTM 21-35. Pistons, valves and rods were identical.|$|R
50|$|The Basel Connecting Line, {{including}} railway Basel Baden station, Basel SBB {{station and}} Basel marshalling yard is equipped for Swiss <b>locomotives</b> <b>without</b> special technical equipment {{and can be}} used by services from Germany. The line is equipped with the German intermittent cab signalling system (Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung) and the Swiss train protection system (Integra-Signum). Trains runs on the right, unlike elsewhere in the SBB network, {{in order to avoid the}} need to switch sides at Basel Baden station. The overhead line can be used by trains with both Swiss and German pantographs (maximum lateral deviation of 200 mm). The border between the overhead electrification systems is at the property boundary.|$|R
5000|$|Blüchers {{performance}} {{was described in}} the second 1814 volume of the Annals of Philosophy. The item started by recording a rack locomotive at Leeds (probably Salamanca) and continued: [...] "The experiment succeeded so well at Leeds, that a similar engine has been erected at Newcastle, about a mile north from that town. It moves {{at the rate of}} three miles an hour, dragging after it 14 waggons, loaded each with about two tons of coals; so that in this case the expense of 14 horses is saved by the substitution of the steam-engine". The item continues to mention a <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> a rack wheel (probably Puffing Billy at Wylam).|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot a railway line in Connecticut. At his own {{suggestion}} William Shatner did his own stunts, including standing atop an F40PH. Years later Shatner called the stunt [...] "the most truly dangerous stunt I ever did" [...] and couldn't imagine [...] "what he was thinking" [...] in suggesting it. Shatner {{compared it to}} the work he'd done in Kingdom of the Spiders, and wondered which was worse: [...] "standing {{on top of a}} speeding <b>locomotive</b> <b>without</b> any kind of safety cable or gluing tarantulas to your face?" [...] Jack Sessums worked on the miniature effects and had his work profiled in TV Guide.|$|R
