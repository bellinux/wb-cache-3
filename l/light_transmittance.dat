25|$|Fullerenes are {{sparingly}} soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 {{have a deep}} purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> and causing the purple to brown color change.|$|E
25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E

As a result, flexible, thermally stable, and optically transparent NFC/resin nanocomposites were obtained. At the same NFC content, the nanocomposites using lower Young’s modulus matrix resin exhibited higher thermal stability than using higher Young’s modulus matrix resins [26].|$|R

LCSTs of nanogels were measured through turbidimetric measurement. The concentration for each Aurod@pNIPAAm-PEGMA nanogel in the deionized water was maintained at 1 mg/mL. The <b>light</b> <b>transmittances</b> at 600 nm were then measured by an UV–vis spectrophotometer (TU- 1901, Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the high-performance coatings, a secondary layer of perforated aluminum louvers is hung from the glass to create a double skinned façade. The interstitial cavity created by these two layers creates a convective stack-effect, drawing cool air in through {{the underside of the}} building and hot air out {{at the top of the}} structure near the roof. The perforated louvers provide extensive primary sun protection in closed condition. They reduce up to 70% of solar heat gain at its peak load, yet still provide 15% of <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> through the perforations.Given the intensity of the tropical sunlight, field measurements have calculated that this 15% <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> in closed mode is sufficient natural lighting to perform routine office functions without the need for secondary artificial lighting in most (75%) of spaces.|$|E

The use of a magnetic material can lead to important implications once magneto-optical activity is activated {{through the application of}} an external magnetic field. The physical model and the numerical study presented here introduce the concept of magnetically tunable plasmonic vortex lens, namely a magnetoplasmonic vortex lens, which ensures a tunable selectivity in the polarization state of the generated nanostructured beam. The presented system provides a promising platform for a localized excitation of plasmonic vortices followed by their beaming in the far-field with an active modulation of both <b>light's</b> <b>transmittance</b> and helicity...|$|R

In fact the new device allows for varying both the tilt angle and the lamella extension. The performances of lamella systems equipped with such a device was evaluated in combination with different glazing systems and compared to adjustable but not extensible systems. Beam and diffuse solar and <b>light</b> <b>transmittances</b> were calculated for different solar positions and the effective monthly averaged solar factor was derived for different sites.

30|$|The grinder {{treatment}} in water {{resulted in the}} efficient fibrillation of wood pulp fibers into NFCs, which demonstrated promising characteristics as reinforcement material for optically transparent composites. Since the NFCs form aggregates of semi-crystalline extended cellulose chains, NFC/acrylic resin composites showed low thermal expansion coefficients, while maintaining its ease of bending [12]. When a dissolving pulp was subjected to various passes through grinder treatment and the obtained NFCs were used to make NFC/acrylic resin composites, the <b>light</b> <b>transmittances</b> of the composite films increased to 80  % up to five grinder passes. However, because partial depolymerization {{and a decrease in}} cellulose I crystallinity took placed on NFCs during the grinder treatment, mechanical strengths and thermal stability of the NFC/acrylate resin composites decreased with increasing grinder pass number [14]. Hemicelluloses as matrix substances in wood pulps showed an important role in nanofibrillation process using grinding treatment. In fact, hemicelluloses provide adhesion between NFCs, contributing to reduction of thermal expansion and enhancement of mechanical properties in NFC/acrylate resin composites [15].|$|R

50|$|DCPIP {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the rate of photosynthesis. It is part of the Hill {{reagents}} family. When exposed to light in a photosynthetic system, the dye is decolorised by chemical reduction. DCPIP has a higher affinity for electrons than ferredoxin and the photosynthetic electron transport chain can reduce DCPIP as a substitute for NADP+, that is normally the final electron carrier in photosynthesis. As DCPIP is reduced and becomes colorless, the resultant increase in <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> can be measured using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} acrylic glass {{can have the}} high light {{transmission}} and optical quality of glass. Acrylic is also light weight, compared to glass, and is shatter-resistant, making acrylic an attractive choice for framing large, oversized works of art. In general, acrylic sheet scratches easily and retains a static charge, which can be problematic when framing pastels or charcoals. Some manufacturers, add dyes to acrylic glass to filter the UV <b>light</b> <b>transmittance,</b> and its surface can also be treated with both anti-static and anti-reflective coatings.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} an {{experiment}} in which spectrophotometry is used is {{the determination of the}} equilibrium constant of a solution. A certain chemical reaction within a solution may occur in a forward and reverse direction where reactants form products and products break down into reactants. At some point, this chemical reaction will reach a point of balance called an equilibrium point. In order to determine the respective concentrations of reactants and products at this point, the <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> of the solution can be tested using spectrophotometry. The amount of light that passes through the solution is indicative of the concentration of certain chemicals that do not allow light to pass through.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types and}} grades {{of glass and}} {{different}} window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows. The type of glazing is an important issue, expressed by its VT coefficient (Visual Transmittance), also known as visual <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> (VLT). As the name suggests, this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window. A low VT (below 0.4) can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room.

Then, a convolution of SH functions and the scattering function of a hair strand is precomputed. This allows us to efficiently compute the intensity at a point on the hair. However, the computation of the transmittance is very time-consuming. We address this problem by using a voxel-based approach: the transmittance is computed by using a voxelized hair model. We further accelerate the computation by sampling the voxels. By using our method, we can render a hair model consisting {{of tens of thousands}} of hair strands at interactive frame rates...|$|R

50|$|Thick {{cover crop}} stands often compete well with weeds during the cover crop growth period, and can prevent most germinated weed seeds from {{completing}} their life cycle and reproducing. If the cover crop is {{left on the}} soil surface rather than incorporated into the soil as a green manure after its growth is terminated, it can form a nearly impenetrable mat. This drastically reduces <b>light</b> <b>transmittance</b> to weed seeds, which in many cases reduces weed seed germination rates (Teasdale 1993). Furthermore, even when weed seeds germinate, they often run out of stored energy for growth before building the necessary structural capacity {{to break through the}} cover crop mulch layer.
