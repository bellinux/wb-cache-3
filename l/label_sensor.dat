40|$|Body-area {{networks}} of pervasive wearable devices are increasingly used for health monitoring, personal assistance, entertainment, and home automation. In an ideal world, a user would simply wear their desired set of devices with no configuration necessary: the devices would discover each other, {{recognize that they}} are on the same person, construct a secure communications channel, and recognize the user to which they are attached. In this paper we address a portion of this vision by offering a wearable system that unobtrusively recognizes the person wearing it. Because it can recognize the user, our system can properly <b>label</b> <b>sensor</b> data or personalize interactions. Our recognition method uses bioimpedance, a measurement of how tissue responds when exposed to an electrical current. By collecting bioimpedance samples using a small wearable device we designed, our system can determine that (a) the wearer is indeed the expected person and (b) the device is physically on the wearer’s body. Our recognition method works with 98 % balanced-accuracy under a cross-validation of a day’s worth of bioimpedance samples from a cohort of 8 volunteer subjects. We also demonstrate that our system continues to recognize a subset of these subjects even several months later. Finally, we measure the energy requirements of our system as implemented on a Nexus S smart phone and customdesigned module for the Shimmer sensing platform. 1...|$|E

Elevated humidity levels or water leakages cause tremendous costs in our society, such as in construction industries and in transportations.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network can {{be defined}} as a network of {{integrated}} sensors responsible for environmental sensing, data processing and communication with other sensors and the base station while consuming low power.

Anomaly detection techniques are used to detect such activities over the network that do not conform to the normal behavior of the network communication.

40|$|Activity {{recognition}} aims {{to identify}} and predict human activities based {{on a series of}} sensor readings. In recent years, machine learning methods have become popular in solving activity recognition problems. A special difficulty for adopting machine learning methods is the workload to annotate a large number of sensor readings as training data. <b>Labeling</b> <b>sensor</b> readings for their corresponding activities is a time-consuming task. In practice, we often have a set of labeled training instances ready for an activity recognition task. If we can transfer such knowledge to a new activity recognition scenario that is different from, but related to, the source domain, it will ease our effort to perform manual labeling of training data for the new scenario. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework based on automatically learning a correspondence between different sets of sensors to solve this transfer-learning in activity recognition problem. We validate our framework on two different datasets and compare it against previous approaches of activity recognition, and demonstrate its effectiveness...|$|R

The sensor chip provides a biocompatible surface with low non-specific binding, but it also presents some problems, such as steric effect and re-binding which may bias the kinetic measurement. In the present study, the effect of hydrogel matrix on protein-protein interaction was investigated. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins were used as the model system.

The use of MDCC-PBP as a phosphate sensor has been extensively characterised (Brune et al., 2001) and used widely {{in the study of}} motor proteins, including helicases (e. g., Dillingham et al., 2000; Martinez-Senac and Webb, 2005; Tomko et al., 2007). One of the advantages of the MDCC-PBP sensor is that Pi binding is rapid and tight: at 5 µM MDCC-PBP (pH 7. 0, 5 °C), the observed rate of fluorescence change has a limiting rate of 150 /s and a KD of 0. 1 µM (Webb 2003). Because we measured a steady-state accumulation of Pi, the observed rates were not limited by the KD and the signal was linear with Pi concentration at all temperatures (see below). The maximal ATPase rates measured under our experimental conditions (≤ 1200 µM ATP) were not rate-limited by the Pibinding rate (Webb, 2003).

40|$|In the {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) for electric field measurement system under the High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission lines, {{it is necessary to}} obtain the electric field distribution with multiple sensors. The location information of each sensor is essential to the correct analysis of measurement results. Compared with the existing approach which gathers the location information by manually <b>labelling</b> <b>sensors</b> during deployment, the automatic localization can reduce the workload and improve the measurement efficiency. A novel and practical range-free localization algorithm for the localization of one-dimensional linear topology wireless networks in the electric field measurement system is presented. The algorithm utilizes unknown nodes’ neighbor lists based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to determine the relative locations of nodes. The algorithm is able to handle the exceptional situation of the output permutation which can effectively improve the accuracy of localization. The performance of this algorithm under real circumstances has been evaluated through several experiments with different numbers of nodes and different node deployments in the China State Grid HVDC test base.

40|$|Detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) have unique {{physical}} and chemical properties that make them invaluable in many applications. However, DNDs are generally assumed to show weak fluorescence, if any, unless chemically modified with organic molecules. We demonstrate that detonation nanodiamonds exhibit significant and excitation-wavelength-dependent fluorescence from the visible to the near-infrared spectral region above 800 nm, even without the engraftment of organic molecules to their surfaces. We show that this fluorescence depends on the surface functionality of the DND particles. The investigated functionalized DNDs, produced from the same purified DND as well as the as-received polyfunctional starting material, are hydrogen, hydroxyl, carboxyl, ethylenediamine, and octadecylamine-terminated. All DNDs are investigated in solution and on a silicon wafer substrate and compared to fluorescent high-pressure high-temperature nanodiamonds. The brightest fluorescence is observed from octadecylamine-functionalized particles and is more than 100 times brighter than the least fluorescent particles, carboxylated DNDs. The majority of photons emitted by all particle types likely originates from non-diamond carbon. However, we locally find bright and photostable fluorescence from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond in hydrogenated, hydroxylated, and carboxylated detonation nanodiamonds. Our results contribute to understanding the effects of surface chemistry on the fluorescence of DNDs and enable the exploration of the fluorescent properties of DNDs for applications in theranostics as nontoxic fluorescent <b>labels,</b> <b>sensors,</b> nanoscale tracers, and many others where chemically stable and brightly fluorescent nanoparticles with tailorable surface chemistry are needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} design of an {{autonomous}} vehicle CAD toolchain, which captures formal descriptions of driving scenarios {{in order to develop}} a safety case for an autonomous vehicle (AV). Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants, and the specification of formal correctness requirements. A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate <b>labeled</b> <b>sensor</b> data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on five autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95 % of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors that lead to unrealistic environment behavior...|$|R

40|$|Big {{sensor data}} provide {{significant}} potential for chemical fault diagnosis, which involves the baseline values of security, stability and reliability in chemical processes. A {{deep neural network}} (DNN) with novel active learning for inducing chemical fault diagnosis is presented in this study. It is a method using large amount of chemical sensor data, which {{is a combination of}} deep learning and active learning criterion to target the difficulty of consecutive fault diagnosis. DNN with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be developed through deep learning to learn a suitable feature representation from raw sensor data in an unsupervised manner using stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) and work through a layer-by-layer successive learning process. The features are added to the top Softmax regression layer to construct the discriminative fault characteristics for diagnosis in a supervised manner. Considering the expensive and time consuming <b>labeling</b> of <b>sensor</b> data in chemical applications, in contrast to the available methods, we employ a novel active learning criterion for the particularity of chemical processes, which is a combination of Best vs. Second Best criterion (BvSB) and a Lowest False Positive criterion (LFP), for further fine-tuning of diagnosis model in an active manner rather than passive manner. That is, we allow models to rank the most informative sensor data to be labeled for updating the DNN parameters during the interaction phase. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in two well-known industrial datasets. Results indicate that the proposed method can obtain superior diagnosis accuracy and provide significant performance improvement in accuracy and false positive rate with less <b>labeled</b> chemical <b>sensor</b> data by further active learning compared with existing methods...|$|R

Opportunistic meetings In an office environment, unplanned interactions {{play an important role in}} the exchange of information as well as for the social cohesion of a group, their importance should not be neglected, as they are often instrumental to the organization [10]. In contrast to simply spontaneous encounters, opportunistic meetings occur where one person has a reason to talk with another but has not arranged to meet in advance and thus either seeks them out or waits until an encounter occurs by chance to raise the issue [9]. However, there is always the danger that the encounter might not take place (or not in a timely manner), leaving the issue unaddressed. In this paper we consider how such meetings, referred to here as IFFI’s (for ‘informal faceto-face interactions’), might be facilitated. In the first place by alleviating the burden of finding an appropriate time and place to meet while taking into account each person’s constraints and activities. Facilitating IFFI’s differs from making a rendezvous, since it enables a deep interleaving with current ongoing activities so as to support the setting-up of an interaction in near real-time.

These dispensers advance individual or multiple-row labels and remove them from their lining similar to a manual dispenser, but instead of manually pulling on the liner, label advancement occurs when a trigger on the dispenser detects {{the absence of a}} label, such as when the operator removes the <b>label.</b> The <b>sensor</b> then closes the circuit and engages the motor, dispensing the next <b>label</b> until the <b>sensor</b> once again detects the label which opens the circuit.The first electric dispenser was designed with the limit switch on the left of a 16" [...] wide machine. 4-up multiple-row labels were loaded into the machine and once activated would advance one row of labels.

40|$|Background: The single leg squat (SLS) is {{a common}} lower limb {{rehabilitation}} exercise. It is also frequently used as an evaluative exercise to screen for {{an increased risk of}} lower limb injury. To date athlete / patient SLS technique has been assessed using expensive laboratory equipment or subjective clinical judgement; both of which are not without shortcomings. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) may offer a low cost solution for the objective evaluation of athlete / patient SLS technique. Objectives: The aims of this study were to determine if in combination or in isolation IMUs positioned on the lumbar spine, thigh and shank are capable of: (a) distinguishing between acceptable and aberrant SLS technique; (b) identifying specific deviations from acceptable SLS technique. Methods: Eighty-three healthy volunteers participated (60 males, 23 females, age: 24. 68  + / −  4. 91 years, height: 1. 75  + / −  0. 09 m, body mass: 76. 01  + / −  13. 29 kg). All participants performed 10 SLSs on their left leg. IMUs were positioned on participants’ lumbar spine, left shank and left thigh. These were utilized to record tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data during all repetitions of the SLS. SLS technique was labelled by a Chartered Physiotherapist using an evaluation framework. Features were extracted from the <b>labelled</b> <b>sensor</b> data. These features were used to train and evaluate a variety of random-forests classifiers that assessed SLS technique. Results: A three IMU system was moderately successful in detecting the overall quality of SLS performance (77  % accuracy, 77  % sensitivity and 78  % specificity). A single IMU worn on the shank can complete the same analysis with 76  % accuracy, 75  % sensitivity and 76  % specificity. Single sensors also produce competitive classification scores relative to multi-sensor systems in identifying specific deviations from acceptable SLS technique. Conclusions: A single IMU positioned on the shank can differentiate between acceptable and aberrant SLS technique with moderate levels of accuracy. It can also capably identify specific deviations from optimal SLS performance. IMUs may offer a low cost solution for the objective evaluation of SLS performance. Additionally, the classifiers described may provide useful input to an exercise biofeedback application...|$|R
