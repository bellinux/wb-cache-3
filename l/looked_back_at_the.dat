5|$|Salmon {{agreed not}} to {{broadcast}} the episode at Christmas. It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000, forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The One Foot In The Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hit sitcom. The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, WWE {{produced}} a DVD called The Monday Night Wars. Two hours in length, the DVD left {{out a large}} portion of the wars, breaking off around 1997 before jumping straight to the post-WCW era of WWE. The objectivity of the DVD's content was questioned, as some believed the documentary was simply telling the WWE side of the story. On August 25, 2009, WWE released The Rise and Fall of WCW on DVD. The DVD <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> roots of WCW during the days of GCW and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, to the glory days of Monday Nitro and the nWo, and to its demise and sale to WWE. This DVD included several new interviews from Vince McMahon, Jim Crockett, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Bill Goldberg, as well as many of those responsible for running the NWA and WCW. Archive interviews were included from former WCW talent such as Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, due to their respective contracts with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling not allowing them to provide fresh interviews for WWE. In 2014, WWE Network released a new documentary series, The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW, covering a much broader scope of the wars than the previous Monday Night Wars DVD, as well as providing more equal viewpoints for both WWE and WCW.|$|E

50|$|The {{programme}} won several awards {{including the}} Sony Gold for comedy. A second series was broadcast in 1994 under <b>the</b> title A <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>At</b> <b>The</b> Future, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> years 2001, 2005, 2010, 2021, 2025 and 2099 {{from the standpoint}} of New Year's Eve 2099.|$|R
500|$|In 2015, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> episode {{fourteen}} years later.

500|$|The {{first officer}} {{described}} the snowfall as [...] "not heavy, no large flakes." [...] He told authorities that snow was sliding off the jet and {{the nose of}} the airplane was coated in a watery layer. He used a light positioned on the wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off. Neither he or the pilot saw any evidence of contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing. He told investigators that he checked the wings [...] "maybe 10 times, but at least 3." [...] He said that he did not consider the snowfall heavy, and he did not recall any wind blowing the snow. The first officer stated that as they taxied, they <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wings several times. Near the time of the takeoff, he said [...] "looks good to me, black strip is clear." ...|$|E
500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera after crashing through the fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>At</b> <b>The</b> Nineties was a British comedy {{radio series}} first {{broadcast}} on BBC Radio 4 in 1993.

500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{there are}} thirty-five verses which mention salt. One of these {{mentions}} Lot's wife, who {{was turned into}} a pillar of salt when she <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem, he is said to have [...] "sown salt on it," [...] probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. [...] "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" [...] (Job 6:6). In the New Testament, six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus referred to his followers as the [...] "salt of the earth". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to [...] "let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" [...] (Colossians 4:6). Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary" [...] in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.|$|E
500|$|Madonna had {{promoted}} the album throughout 1983–84 by performing {{a series of}} [...] "track dates", one-off gigs. These shows were done at New York City and London clubs like Danceteria and Camden Palace and on American and British television programs like American Bandstand and Top of the Pops. On American Bandstand, Madonna performed the track [...] "Holiday" [...] and told interviewer Dick Clark that she wanted [...] "to rule the world." [...] John Mitchell from MTV said that the appearance [...] "remains {{one of her most}} legendary." [...] The album's singles were later performed on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It was Madonna's first concert tour and visited North American dates. The Virgin Tour received mixed reception from critics, but was a commercial success. As soon as the tour was announced, tickets were sold out everywhere. Macy's New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves. After its end, the Virgin Tour was reported to have grossed over $5million ($million in [...] dollars), with Billboard Boxscore reporting a gross of $3.3million ($million in [...] dollars). The tour was recorded and released in VHS, as [...] Later authors have <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tour and commented that it was clear that [...] " [...] was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." [...] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss noted the clothes and fashion in the tour and said, [...] "Virgin Tour established Madonna as the hottest figure in pop music." ...|$|E

"We've <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{last two}} or three runs and noticed that a {{programme}} can get swallowed up by one monster film– a bit like one of those Yes albums from the 1970s where side one is just one track– so we're trying to calm down the prog-rock side. We'll inevitably still have big films, because it's {{the only way you can}} enjoy the three of them cocking about together, but they'll be shorter overall, and alongside we'll be inserting two- or three-minute punk songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV {{reviewed}} the two-part season finale {{as part of}} a Throwback Thursday special on the site on August 27. Gavin <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> season closer fondly, calling it [...] "sensational." [...] He also said that the show [...] "knocked this one out of the park." [...] It had such a high-stakes dilemma that soared the show to new heights, proving it could be exciting and emotional all at the same time. The actors delivered their best performances and the writing was just amazing. We have John Gray to thank for this wonderful show and for writing this wonderful episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972 the {{economist}} James Tobin proposed {{a tax on}} all spot conversions of one currency into another. The so-called Tobin tax is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. Tobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the Bretton Woods system effectively ended. In 2001, James Tobin <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1994 Mexican peso crisis, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and said: [...] " [...] tax [...] on foreign exchange transactions... dissuades speculators as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis. If this money is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase interest rates for their currency to still be attractive. But high interest is often disastrous for a national economy, as the nineties' crises in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia have proven...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lot {{refused to}} give his guests to the {{inhabitants}} of Sodom and, instead, offered them his two virgin daughters [...] "which have not known man" [...] and to [...] "do ye to them as [...] good in your eyes". However, they refused this offer, complained about this alien, namely Lot, giving orders, and then came near {{to break down the}} door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city. Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the city), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their escape, one angel commanded Lot to [...] "look not behind thee" [...] (singular [...] "thee"). However, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with brimstone and fire from the Lord, Lot's wife <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city, and she became a pillar of salt.|$|E
