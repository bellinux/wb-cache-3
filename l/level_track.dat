25|$|In 1970, Chai Wan on eastern Hong Kong Island was {{developed}} into a residential and industrial area, which greatly increased the traffic demand to Central.

The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the lower <b>level</b> <b>tracks</b> were always intended to be relay tracks.

500|$|Construction of {{the line}} from Wimbledon to Sutton was slower. Work started at Wimbledon in October 1927, but {{property}} purchases were not completed {{until the middle of}} 1928 and the contractor, Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons, did not begin work at Sutton until July 1928. The landscape traversed by the line is undulating and rises from about [...] above sea-level at Wimbledon to about [...] at Sutton. Designed for operation exclusively by the electric multiple unit, extensive embankments and cuttings were constructed and steep gradients up to 1in44 (2.27%) and tight-radius curves were employed.

As work on the final section of track to Stockton's quayside was still ongoing, the train halted at the temporary passenger terminus at St John's Well 3 hours, 7 minutes after leaving Darlington. The opening ceremony was considered a success and that evening 102 people sat down to a celebratory dinner at the Town Hall.|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} sidings {{on the line}} which were {{available}} for public use. Churn Siding was located between Paddock Wood and Horsmonden stations. The siding was on the up side of the line. It was accessed by a facing connection in each direction. A siding at the Horsmonden end served a brickworks. Although some sources state that Churn Siding was out of use by 1940, photographs show that {{it was still in}} use in 1951 and it was named in the closure notice. Towards the end of the line's existence, Churn Siding was used for storage of wagons. The siding was located {{at the start of the}} 1 in 78 climb to Horsmonden. If wagons had to be left on the running line while shunting took place, they had to be left on the Paddock Wood side of the level crossing, where there was <b>level</b> <b>track.</b> Pattenden Siding was located between Goudhurst and Cranbrook stations, just after milepost 42 and thus [...] from Paddock Wood. The siding was located on the down side of the line. was accessed by a trailing connection in the down direction (towards Hawkhurst). Its main use was to import shoddy which was used as fertiliser for hop gardens.|$|E

Steam {{locomotives}} worked the section east of Annfield, {{and in the}} western section inclines were worked by stationary engines or gravity, with horses hauling waggons over <b>level</b> <b>track.</b> The lime kilns and the line between Stanhope and Carrhouse closed in 1840, and with the Stanhope to Annfield section losing money, the insolvent railway company was dissolved on 5 February 1841. The northern section became the Pontop and South Shields Railway and the southern section from Stanhope to Carrhouse was bought by the newly formed Derwent Iron Company at Consett, renamed the Wear & Derwent Railway, and used to transport limestone from quarries in the Stanhope area to its works at Consett. The Weardale Extension Railway ran from Waskerley on the Wear & Derwent to Crook on the BA and included the Sunniside Incline worked by a stationary engine. Sponsored by the Derwent Iron Company, the [...] line was built by the S and opened on 16 May 1845. A passenger service started to Hownes Gill and Stanhope (Crawley) on 1 September 1845; the Stanhope service was withdrawn {{at the end of}} 1846. Travelling north from Crook the carriages and waggons were drawn up the Sunniside Incline, a locomotive hauled the mixed train to Waskerley Park Junction, then they were let down Nanny Mayor's Incline and a locomotive took them forward. When returning, regulations required that the carriages run loose down the Sunniside Incline and they were let to run into Crook station, controlled by the guard using the carriage brakes. Later, a [...] viaduct replaced the two inclines at Hownes Gill ravine on 1 July 1858. A deviation replacing Nanny's Mayor's Incline and a curve that allowed trains from Crook direct access to Rowley opened for freight on 23 May 1859 and for passenger traffic on 4 July 1859.|$|E

Pedestrians are detected and segmented using a dynamic background model combined with motion detection and brightness and color distortion analysis. Two <b>levels</b> of <b>tracking</b> have been implemented: the image <b>level</b> <b>tracking</b> and the ground-plane <b>level</b> <b>tracking.</b> Several target cues are used to disambiguate between possible candidates of correspondence in the tracking process: spacial and temporal estimation, color and object height. A simple and robust solution for image occlusion monitoring and grouping management is described. Experiments in tracking multiple pedestrians in a dual camera setup with common field of view are presented. 1...|$|R

2500|$|This {{kinematic}} description makes {{a number}} of simplifying assumptions since it neglects forces. [...] For one, it assumes that the rolling resistance is zero. [...] A wheelset (not attached to a train or truck), is given a push forward on a straight and <b>level</b> <b>track.</b> [...] The wheelset starts coasting and never slows down {{since there are no}} forces (except downward forces on the wheelset to make it adhere to the track and not slip). [...] If initially the wheelset is centered on the railroad track then the effective diameters of each wheel are the same and the wheelset rolls down the track in a perfectly straight line forever. [...] But if the wheelset is a little off-center so that the effective diameters (or radii) are different, then the wheelset starts to move in a curve of Radius R (depending on these wheelset radii, etc.; to be derived later on). [...] The problem is to use kinematic reasoning to find the trajectory of the wheelset, or more precisely, the trajectory of the center of the wheelset projected vertically on the roadbed {{in the center of the}} track. [...] This is a trajectory on the plane of the level earth's surface and plotted on an x-y graphical plot where x is the distance along the railroad and y is the [...] "tracking error", the deviation of the center of the wheelset from the straight line of the railway running down the center of the track (midway between the two rails).|$|E
