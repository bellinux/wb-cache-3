5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū began {{recovering}} her Midway strike {{force at}} around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, {{when the first}} attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the Hornet. They attempted a torpedo attack on Soryū, {{but all of the}} American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> surviving aviator treading water.|$|E

Slightly damaged during a {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where she was damaged by several shells but managed {{to make it back}} to port with the remnants of the Russian Fleet, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur, Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never raised her.

The CD and vinyl came with lyrics printed on the back of replica Polaroids. Only nine Polaroids came in a set, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> to have to obtain another set to accumulate all thirteen songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions {{and put out}} wildfires along the storm's path. A fallen tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In northeast North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes {{near the city of}} Peletier. Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000.|$|E

5|$|Although {{effects from}} Igor were {{observed}} in Bermuda for several days, relatively little rain fell, with the highest amount being 3.19in (81mm). Winds {{proved to be the}} most significant factor; sustained winds reached 91mph (146km/h) and gusts peaked at 117mph (188km/h) at an unofficial AWOS station on St. David's Lighthouse. Additionally, a storm surge of 1.75ft (0.53m) took place in St. George's, this combined with tides to produce a storm tide of over 4ft (1.22m). As the storm arrived, the island's airport was shut down earlier than originally planned due to the threat of tornadoes. Against initial fears, Igor left relatively little damage across Bermuda. The most significant impact was from downed trees and powerlines which cut power to 27,500residents. A few emergency rescues had to be made during the storm but no injuries took place. The causeway-bridge connecting St. George’s Islands to the main island of Bermuda sustained minor damage, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> lane closed for several days. Waves over 15ft (4.6m) battered the coast, breaking several ships from their moorings and tossing them into rocks. Officials in Bermuda stated that the biggest loss from Igor would be lessened tourism revenue following a mass exodus prior to the hurricane's arrival. Throughout the islands, damage from the storm was less than $500,000.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|He entrenched his {{position}} in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd, the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh. After killing Ealdred's successor Eadulf in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings Harthacnut and Edward, assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control of the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s, {{and there is some}} evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the Scotland adventure earned him a place in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Siward died in 1055, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> son, Waltheof, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. St Olave's church in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward.|$|E

5|$|In Acapulco, {{the storm}} {{produced}} strong waves and heavy rain, leaving coastal streets {{with up to}} 16inches (405mm) of water. The heavy rainfall flooded 200houses and caused a mudslide, resulting {{in the death of}} a seven-year-old boy. Flooding also occurred at the airport in Acapulco, though service was not interrupted. Offshore, strong waves capsized a boat, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> person missing. Heavy rainfall in the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, overflowed a canal, forcing over 500people to evacuate their homes. 500acres (2km2) of crops were destroyed by Lane in Michoacán. Road and airport damage in Colima totaled to about $30million (2006MXN, $2.7million 2006USD). In Cajón de Peña, Jalisco, rainfall totaled to 7.36inches (187mm). One man died in Pueblos Unidos after being knocked over by strong winds. Throughout Jalisco, 109people had to evacuate their homes due to landslides and heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, <b>leaving</b> <b>one</b> of their own behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness {{the next morning to}} stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary.

Tropical Storm Colin led to one drowning death, and rip currents produced by Tropical Depression Five killed two people. Hurricane Danielle passed east of Bermuda while Earl moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States and into Nova Scotia throughout late August, resulting in 2 and 8 deaths, respectively. In early September, Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding across Texas and killed 8 people. The strongest hurricane of the year, Igor, killed four as it traversed the Atlantic and across Newfoundland. Latin America was hard hit by Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew, with 22 and 126 deaths, respectively. In late September, Tropical Storm Nicole produced torrential rainfall from the Caribbean into the U.S. East Coast, resulting in 16 fatalities. Hurricane Paula caused a tourist to drown offshore Cozumel in mid-October, while Hurricane Richard left two dead in Belize later that month. The season concluded with Tomas which caused 35 fatalities along its track through the Caribbean and into the Atlantic.|$|E
