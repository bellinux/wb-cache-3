5|$|Jill {{is later}} kidnapped by Colin, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} released from jail. He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, {{the meaning of the}} music box continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let go of it.|$|E

25|$|Busch was {{released}} from Roush Racing {{at the end of}} 2005 and joined Penske Racing South in 2006. Busch had asked team owner Jack Roush to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of his contract {{at the end of the}} 2005, but Roush initially refused. However, after Chip Ganassi released Jamie McMurray from his 2006 contract, Roush decided to release Busch when Roush learned that Busch already signed a contract with Roger Penske before the season ended. Busch's last race with Roush-Fenway Racing and 2005 was at Texas before the final two races; because he was parked by NASCAR for an incident with the police (see below). Busch appealed and a misunderstanding on the police's part was cleared before the races but nonetheless the parking penalty was held in place.|$|E

25|$|Despite these problems, 76 men crawled {{through to}} freedom, until at 4:55a.m. on 25 March, the 77thman was spotted {{emerging}} {{by one of}} the guards. Those already in the trees began running, while a New Zealand Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent VC who had just reached the tree line stood up and surrendered. The guards had no idea where the tunnel entrance was, so they began searching the huts, giving men time to burn their fake papers. Hut 104 {{was one of the last}} to be searched, and despite using dogs the guards were unable to find the entrance. Finally, German guard Charlie Pilz crawled back through the tunnel but found himself trapped at the camp end; he began calling for help and the prisoners opened the entrance to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> finally revealing its location.|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna {{announced}} a competition {{to write a}} national anthem for Mexico. The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals. Francisco González Bocanegra, a talented poet, {{was not interested in}} participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem. His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé's poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends. Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents' house, locked him into the room, and refused to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> until he produced an entry for the competition. Inside the room in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work. After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation under the door. After Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote. González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854.|$|E
25|$|Kazembek {{started his}} career as a {{linguist}} by translating Christian books into Oriental languages. In addition to the languages he already knew, he learned French, German and Tatar. In 1825, he received an invitation to complete his bachelor's degree in London. However the Russian government refused to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the country, fearing that Kazembek would choose to stay and work in England upon graduation. Instead by Imperial decree he was appointed as a teacher of the Tatar language in Omsk, thus being held away from his academic instructors. He never made it to Omsk as, while staying in Kazan due to an illness, Kazembek met historian Karl Fuchs and was invited by him to pass an academic test to determine Kazembek's eligibility to teach Arabic and Persian at Kazan University. The test was passed and Kazembek was hired as a senior teacher. In 1828, he was chosen {{to be a member of}} the Royal Asiatic Society and became head of the newly established Faculty of Turkic languages at Kazan University. In 1831, he attained a master's degree after writing an academic essay called Views on the History and Vocabulary of the Arabic Language (in Persian). In 1835 he was admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences as a Corresponding Member. In 1837, he earned a Ph.D. degree at Kazan University. In 1839, he wrote a detailed work called Grammar of the Turco-Tatar language (at that time, most Turkic languages were regarded as dialects of one single language unit often referred to as 'Tatar' or 'Turco-Tatar'), where he compared Ottoman Turkish, Azeri and various dialects of Tatar in terms of their phonology, morphology, and syntax and for which he received the Demidov Prize. The second edition of this book was published in 1846 and incorporated the author's latest research in the field. It became popular in Western Europe, being the richest academic source on the Turkic languages at that time, and was used in universities as a primary reference book until 1921, when Jean Deny published his Grammar of the Turkish language (Ottoman dialect).|$|E

500|$|During {{the scene}} in which the Doctor and Rory are talking after Rory has <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the Pandorica, one of the stone Daleks was {{originally}} supposed to move, operated by Haynes himself. However, the scene was cut from the final episode. A stunt performer for Smith performed the sequence in which a future version of the Doctor who had been shot by a Dalek fell down the museum stairs; he did the stunt three times before Haynes captured the angles and shots he wanted. On the DVD commentary, Haynes stated that the shot in the episode is mostly the first take. River's costume in the episode was intended to resemble both the costumes of Princess Leia and Han Solo in the Star Wars films, so she appeared like a [...] "female Han Solo".|$|E
500|$|The idea of Skinner and Krabappel {{becoming}} a couple {{had been around}} since the days when Mike Reiss and Al Jean were show runners. The episode's writer Rachel Pulido took some of the inspiration for this episode from [...] "Bart the Lover", specifically Mrs. Krabappel's line to Bart about refusing to date Principal Skinner because, [...] "his mommy won't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> to play". The Mathmagician is based on Bill Gates. The cakes in Agnes Skinner's cake book were designed to accurately resemble the real life versions of them. Homer using his megaphone to talk to Marge and Lisa, who were standing next to him, was ad-libbed by Dan Castellaneta. A deleted scene featured an awkward moment at Martin's party, between Bart, Milhouse and Martin, when the latter introduces the two to his parents.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Norman Osborn {{arrives at}} the {{warehouse}} to supervise an experiment on Marko. Restrained Marko will be given subdermal silicon transplants giving him a hardened untraceable silicon armor. Dr. Octavius says that the experiment has too many flaws but Osborn commands him {{to go with it}} anyway. The experiment malfunctions and the silicon violently mutates him. His body evaporates into sand and Octavius, terrified, thinks he has just killed him. Suddenly, Marko reshapes himself, still made of sand, and viciously thrashes against the walls for them to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> Hammerhead and Osborn take him outside in their limousine, where Marko is able to reform himself in his old appearance. When they tell him he will work for [...] "the Big Man," [...] but he decides to go alone and leaves. Hammerhead is fine with that as it means they will now have a distraction for Spider-Man.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson {{scholar and}} poet Anthony Hecht finds {{resonances}} in Dickinson's poetry {{not only with}} hymns and song-forms but also with psalms and riddles, citing the following example: [...] "Who is the East?/ The Yellow Man/ Who may be Purple if he can/ That carries the Sun./ Who is the West?/ The Purple Man/ Who may be Yellow if He can/ That <b>lets</b> <b>Him</b> <b>out</b> again." ...|$|R

500|$|Louis Agassiz was a Swiss-born {{scientist}} at Harvard University who, by 1896, {{had established a}} reputation for [...] "lock a student up {{in a room full}} of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained." [...] Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, David Starr Jordan, Addison Emery Verrill, and Burt Green Wilder. American literary critic Robert Scholes traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and Samuel Hubbard Scudder. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction. Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} white vigilantes, {{who had become}} a mob by this time, seized Sam Carter, a local {{blacksmith}} and teamster who worked in a turpentine still. They tortured Carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner. Carter led the group to the spot in the woods where {{he said he had}} taken Hunter, but the dogs were unable to pick up a scent. To the surprise of many witnesses, someone fatally shot Carter in the face. The group hung Carter's mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area. Some in the mob took souvenirs of his clothes. Survivors suggest that John Bradley fled to Rosewood because he knew he was in trouble and had gone to the home of Aaron Carrier, a fellow veteran and Mason. Carrier and Carter, another Mason, covered Bradley {{in the back of a}} wagon. [...] Carter took Bradley to a nearby river, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the wagon, then returned home to be met by the mob; they had reached him led by dogs following Bradley's scent.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 documentary, Living with Michael Jackson, {{the singer}} {{revealed}} to journalist Martin Bashir that Bubbles had become overly pugnacious. He was removed to an animal sanctuary over fears he might attack Jackson's newborn son, Prince Michael II. Jackson subsequently bought two more baby chimpanzees, Max and Action Jackson; the public believed these two chimpanzees were also Bubbles. [...] Bubbles' removal {{was a source}} of regret for the musician, who stated that the animals could live for up to 60 years. During the interview, Bashir was also told of how Jackson had planned to hold a [...] "celebrity animal party" [...] for Bubbles. Cheeta, the chimpanzee from Tarzan, Benji and Lassie were to be invited. Bubbles was relocated to Bob Dunn's ranch in Sylmar, California. [...] "Bubbles is an adult chimp and a wild animal," [...] Dunn stated at the time. [...] "We don't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> to play." [...] According to CNN, the chimpanzee would be visited by Jackson and his children, who also played with the other animals while at the Californian ranch. [...] "He still acts like a kid around them", Dunn added, referring to the musician. The Washington Times, however, claimed Bubbles was not visited by Jackson, despite the singer's representative stating beforehand that the entertainer would like to meet with the animal again. Shortly afterward, in December 2003, it was claimed that Bubbles had attempted suicide. The chimpanzee was supposedly taken to a hospital in time to be saved.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{revolves}} around the fantasy of a computer store employee, as he dreams about a relationship with Carey. Throughout the video, the pair is seen to have a pillow fight; play laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars; and throw a frisbee. The video also features Carey in various revealing outfits. The video begins with a small Compu Nerd Volkswagen, parodying Geek Squad, pulling up into the driveway of Carey's large manor. As the employee introduces himself, Carey flippantly refers {{to him as a}} [...] "CompuNerd", and asks him to follow her to the broken computer. As he attends to it, Carey removes her robe, and enters her large closet, leaving McBrayer to begin his fantasy with her. The first scene is of Carey wearing a tight pink number, laying seductively on the bed, as the computer employee plays with an electric guitar. He joins her on the bed, and she begins playfully spanking him as the two enter a pillow fight. Another scene is interspersed, of Carey sporting a mini silver dress, with tall socks and heels, flaunting her body. The fantasy then adapts to a new scenery, of the pair dressed in medieval clothing, while walking a unicorn, followed by the duo in a large room in the mansion, racing electronic cars. As they proceed to play laser tag, they are shown outside, laying on a picnic bed, with Carey dressed in a [...] "naughty school girl outfit". They both get up, and begin to throw a frisbee, before relocating in front of the main stairwell in the mansion. The final scenes of the fantasy are of Carey, wearing a shortened red gown, standing atop the staircase, and McBrayer climbing on his knees while carrying flowers. All the scenes begin to fade, with the last being Carey feeding him by hand by the refrigerator, as he wakes up with Carey, now dressed, poking him. She tells the employee that security will <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> when he is finished, and leaves him while he is still fantasizing about her.|$|E
