25|$|Most modern sewing {{machines}} use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, {{which consists of}} two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally {{through the hole in}} the needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. Walter Hunt invented the first <b>lock-stitch</b> sewing machine in 1833. Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention. In 1846, Elias Howe secured a patent on an original <b>lock-stitch</b> machine, and failed to manufacture and market it. Isaac Singer infringed on Howe's patent to make his own machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.|$|E

Small vertical holes are punched through the far left-hand edge of each signature, and then the signatures are sewn together with <b>lock-stitches</b> to form the text block. Oversewing {{is a very strong}} method of binding and can be done on books up to five inches thick. However, the margins of oversewn books are reduced and the pages will not lie flat when opened.|$|R

During World War II it {{introduced}} the Wilson Duke football, featuring the best leather, ends that were hand-sewn, <b>lock-stitch</b> seams, and triple lining, which was adopted {{as the official}} ball of the National Football League.|$|E
30|$|When the multi co-linearity {{effect was}} analyzed, it was {{observed}} that there are inter-relationships between the following variables. 1) stitch density and tension in <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 needle-thread, chain-stitch 401 needle-threads and chain-stitch 401 looper-thread, and 2) fabric thickness and tension in <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 needle-thread and chain-stitch 401 needle-thread.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} new parameter; thread tension being experimented using standard procedures for two main types of stitches namely <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401. For both stitches, thread tension affects significantly in determination of thread consumption. In case of chain-stitch 401, there are combined effects of thread tensions together with fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering {{the properties of}} the stitch. The analysis of <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 shows a joint effect of thread tension and yarn count to the consumption of the needle thread. In comparison, inclusion of proposed thread tension variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401. Once tension parameter is included in the formulae, apparel manufacturers need to optimize and measure the tension during garment pre-production stage as specified for the geometric requirement of the stitch. The average tension value set for a given stitch under selected stitch density can be measured using MLT Wesco tension meter and that figure need to be substituted in calculating the thread consumption. If researchers are able to introduce a standard table which represents average tension values which determine the correct geometry of the stitches under different stitch density levels, industry personnel or software system can easily refer such table and substitute the tension values to the proposing formulae.|$|E
30|$|Prediction of {{sewing thread}} {{consumption}} requires an accurate {{method of calculation}} since {{it relates to the}} cost of manufacturing and distribution of apparel products. Previous researchers highlighted problems in existing thread consumption calculation methods; i.e. limitations in existing formulae which cause inaccurate predictions of thread amount needed for sewing operations. The existing methods of consumption calculations exhibit significant error percentages due to the ignorance of important parameters which affect on thread consumption. This paper investigates on correlation of thread tension to thread consumption of <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401. The existing thread consumption formulae are optimized by considering a new parameter; thread tension, using regression analysis and geometrical modeling techniques. For the chain-stitch 401, results indicate that the thread tension significantly affects in determination of the thread consumption. The error analysis of proposed formulae was performed to indicate that the proposed formulae more accurate compared to the available methods of predicting sewing thread consumption. In addition, there are combined effects of thread tensions together with parameters such as fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering the properties of the stitch. In comparison, inclusion of the proposed thread tension variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review theoretical and practical approaches of sewing thread consumption prediction methods based on the literature and to propose new method incorporating thread tension parameter. Thread consumption formulae were derived by investigating the effect of thread tension for two basic types of stitches namely <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401. Accuracy of those optimized formulae was measured through an error analysis by comparing theoretical and actual thread consumption values. The error percentage values of the newly developed formulae were compared with the other methodologies developed by other researchers and sewing thread manufacturers for calculating sewing thread consumption.|$|E
30|$|In {{previous}} studies by Rengasamy and Samuel (2011) on needle thread tension for <b>lock-stitch</b> 301, four tension peaks have been signified {{by measuring the}} online tension of stitch formation. They reported that the threads are extended dynamically at the tension peaks mainly when needle descends and penetrate through the fabric during the stitch formation (Rengasamy & Samuel 2011). Especially in stitch tightening; the last step of the stitch formation produces highest tension peak also apply an extension to the sewing thread (Weimer & Mitschang 2001; Rengasamy & Samuel 2011). Thread tension was identified {{as one of the}} important parameters which influence the quality of the seam in garment construction. Krishnan and Kumar (2010) have attempted developing reliable tension measuring devices to measure on-line tension of the running thread. Ferreira et al. (1994 a, [b], [c]) have studied thread tension on lock stitch sewing machine and investigated the tension behavior of both the needle-thread and bobbin-thread.|$|E
30|$|Some {{researchers}} have approached theoretical {{techniques such as}} neural networks, statistical and geometrical methods to calculate sewing thread consumption (O'Dwyer & Munden 1975; Hayes 2001; Kennon & Hayes 2000; Jaouadi et al. 2006; Ukponmwan et al. 2000; Amirbayat & Alagha 1993). Jaouachi et al. (2012) developed a method to calculate the consumption of the sewing thread of jean pant using taguchi design analysis. The recent efforts of thread consumption research (Jaouachi et al. 2012; Rasheed et al. 2014; Ghosh & Chavhan 2014) demonstrate that still researchers tend to examine on better formulae to minimize the errors occur in using the existing formulae. However, thread tension has not been taken as a parameter {{for any of the}} above studies. This study investigates the influence of thread tension to the thread consumption of <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401 while incorporating the parameters which had been already been examined by previous authors (Jaouachi et al. 2012; Rasheed et al. 2014; Ghosh & Chavhan 2014).|$|E
30|$|Curve fitting {{techniques}} and {{multiple linear regression}} analysis were conducted using SPSS 16 16 statistical package to evaluate the influence of thread tension for thread consumption. All the regression models were accepted only when following conditions were satisfied. 1) R 2 [*]>[*] 0.75, 2) significance of the model is accepted through the p value[*]<[*] 0.05 at 95 % confidence level, 3) Corresponding coefficient for the variables should be individually significant at 95 % confidence level, 4) VIF values for checking multi-collinearity of independent variables should be greater than 5 to decide that variables got multi-collinearity effect, and 5) acceptance from the residual analysis for the model fitted. The study was carried out to analyze the correlation between thread tension and thread consumption of two different stitches. The thread consumption was denoted as D in millimeters per 10  cm stitching length for a given thread in a given stitch. As example, D 301, needle denotes the consumption (in millimeters) of needle thread for <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 once it has been made 10  cm stitch length.|$|E
30|$|As per the {{stitches}} selected; <b>lock-stitch</b> 301 and chain-stitch 401, recommended thread {{types of}} poly/poly core-spun threads (with polyester continuous filament core and polyester staple wrap) were used. Yarn {{count of the}} thread was taken instead of the thread ticket number value to minimize the approximation errors occurring in ticket number calculations. Fabric thickness was measured following the test standard of BS 2544, methods for determination of thickness of textile materials (British standards institution 1987). Yarn counts of threads were measured using ASTM D 1907, standard method of test for yarn number by the skein method (ASTM International 1997). Thread consumption and average thread tension were measured using MLT Wesco tension and length meter with the accuracy up to 1  mm and 0.1 cN respectively. Consumption values measured using length meter were verified through stitch unraveling method. Actual thread lengths were measured using crimp tester adhering to the procedures in the test standard ASTM D 3883, standard test method for yarn crimp and yarn take-up in woven fabrics (ASTM International 2012). All the tension values were measured at the positions closer the needle as specified in the tension meter manual.|$|E
40|$|Provision of {{innovative}} treatment solutions to various problems {{has always been}} the motto of medical scientific brains. Dentistry is no exception to this endeavor. The acceptance of advances in material science has really helped this cause. Ribbond is one such material, which has occupied an important place in the dentist's repertoire. It is bondable fibre reinforced material, made from the same ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and ceramic fibers used to make bulletproof vests. The key to Ribbond's success is its patented leno weave. Designed with a <b>lock-stitch</b> feature, it effectively transfers forces throughout the weave without stress transfer back into the resin, providing excellent manageability characteristics. Having virtually no memory, Ribbond adapts to the contours of the teeth and dental arch. It is translucent, practically colorless and disappears within the composite or acrylic without show-through offering excellent esthetics. Ribbond's fibers are the standard in biocompatibility. The same material is also used in the construction of artificial hip and knee joints. By virtue of such wide spectrum of intended properties, it enjoys varied applications in day to day dentistry like: endodontic posts,periodontal splints, aesthetic space maintainers,bondable briges and single bridges and orthodontic retainers. This paper is an attempt to showcase the versatility and applicability of this wonderful material in day-to-day dental practice...|$|E
