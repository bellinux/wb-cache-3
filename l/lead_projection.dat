40|$|AbstractBeamforming is {{a spatial}} {{filtering}} based source reconstruction method for EEG and MEG {{that allows the}} estimation of neuronal activity at a particular location within the brain. The computation of the location specific filter depends solely on {{an estimate of the}} data covariance matrix and on the forward model. Increasing the number of M/EEG sensors, increases the quantity of data required for accurate covariance matrix estimation. Often however we have a prior hypothesis about the site of, or the signal of interest. Here we show how this prior specification, in combination with optimal estimations of data dimensionality, can give enhanced beamformer performance for relatively short data segments. Specifically we show how temporal (Bayesian Principal Component Analysis) and spatial (<b>lead</b> field <b>projection)</b> methods can be combined to produce improvements in source estimation over and above employing the approaches individually...|$|R

Instead, the braces for the upper yards run to another mast and thence to the deck. On the aftermost mast, this may mean they have to be led forwards instead of backwards.

40|$|To {{find out}} the thermal {{threshold}} for coral bleaching, sea surface temperature (SST) data prior to, {{during and after the}} 1998 coral bleaching events in the Andaman Sea, Nicobar Sea, Lakshadweep Sea, Gulf of Mannar and Gulf of Kachchh obtained from NOAA/NASA satellite were plotted. From these plots, the Degree Heating Month (DHM) accumulations of the SST hotspot anomalies were estimated. The warming during the years 1985 - 2005 was correlated with Multivariate El Nino/Southern Oscillation Index (MEI). The results show increase in SST and MEI in all the five regions during the years of strong El Nino events. Coral bleaching occurred when the summer SST maxima exceeded 31 oC and remained high for more than 30 days.

40|$|Similarity between {{partners}} entails positive {{consequences for}} cooperative interactions. But do people rely on this assumption to construe egocentric judgments about others? Five experiments examined {{the possibility that}} people project onto their partners {{because they believe that}} similarity to the self leads to success in cooperation. Studies 1 a and 1 b show that people hold an egocentric similarity belief in cooperation. Studies 2 a and 2 b test the existence of this belief in more indirect ways. The next three studies manipulate the applicability of the similarity belief and investigate its impact on projection. Study 3 finds that cooperation no longer <b>leads</b> to <b>projection</b> when participants expect a low probability of success. Study 4 replicates this effect in a real cooperative setting. Finally, Study 5 shows that projection occurs only when participants expect their characteristics to be responsible for the success of cooperation.
