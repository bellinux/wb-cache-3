As variedades apresentaram porcentagens diferentes de número de caules com presença (cheios) ou ausência (ocos) de tecido medular. Algumas mostraram superioridade dos caules cheios em relação aos caules ocos para as características de peso, porcentagem de fibra sobre peso de caule verde, diâmetro e comprimento de caule, porém não apresentaram diferenças para as características de porcentagem de fibra sobre peso de caule seco e comprimento de fibra. Para fineza de fibra, somente a variedade tatsuka-kairyo revelou uma superioridade dos caules ocos em relação aos cheios. Considerando-se os caules cheios e os ocos separadamente para cada variedade, as variedades, comparadas duas a duas, tiveram comportamento diferente com relação às características estudadas. As variedades saikeiseishin-shun, E 49 - 63 o tatsuka-kairyo, tanto para caules cheios como para ocos, revelaram os maiores valores para as características estudadas, com exceção para fineza de fibra, cujos valores foram os mais baixos, devendo ser escolhidas em futuros trabalhos de melhoramento.

40|$|The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hu¨ bner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), {{is a major}} pest of maize, Zea mays L., in many {{temperate}} {{parts of}} the world. Genotype-by-environment interaction effects can make relative performance unpredictable and may hamper selection for resistance to European corn borer. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of environment on genotypic reaction to European corn borer resistance in maize. A set of 12 maize inbred lines was chosen to represent a range of European corn borer responses. Eleven testing environments ranged from Delaware, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, to Mississippi. For <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stalk</b> tunneling, environmental and genotypic main effects (estimated by restricted maximum likelihood) were 3 ̆e 20 - and 10 -fold larger than their interaction effect, respectively. Length of tunneling means for genotypes (across environments) ranged from 10. 1 to 35. 4 cm. Several putatively resistant genotypes grouped with the susceptible checks, B 73 and Mo 17. By breaking factors and the interaction into single degree of freedom components, we observed that GEMS- 0001 had significant crossover interactions toward less susceptibility in both Mississippi and the Nebraska environments. Environments displaying several crossover interactions indicated that European corn borer screening at these sites would not necessarily apply to other locations, whether due to small differences in experimental conduct and/or environmental effects. The five most resistant genotypes were fairly consistent across environments. Because all environments except Illinois used larvae from the same insectary, and these environments differed in damage intensity and rankings, it is unlikely that insect biotype was a factor contributing to genotype-by-environment effects...|$|E

40|$|Zinc as {{an element}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most limiting nutrients for crop production, mainly for cereals in the arid areas of the world. The article explores the impact of zinc salts at different concentrations on the course of physiological biochemical processes, germination and development of nine investigated hybrids of maize. In particular, we investigate how zinc nitrate solutions influence physiological biochemical processes of different maize hybrids. It is established that high concentration of zinc salt solution can arrest or inhibit processes of plants growth, exerting an effect typical of heavy metals. The influence of 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % of zinc nitrate aqueous solution on the content of chlorophyll and number of seeds on the stalks of different corn hybrids was studied. The results of experiments in which germinating seeds were placed in Petri dishes containing 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % nitrate zinc solutions showed that zinc in these quantities stimulates the synthesis of chlorophyll in the leaves in all studied hybrids, thereby stimulating plant growth. Thereafter, low concentrations of salt solutions of the same element stimulated all development processes. Zinc enters the active enzyme centers and participates directly in chlorophyll synthesis. The spray of solutions as foliar fertilizers at critical stages of corn growth increases the number of seeds, the diameter and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stalk</b> in the early ripening hybrids group, compared with the control. It was shown that lack of zinc affects the formation of seeds. The results of the field experiments showed that corn foliar feeding with 0. 01 % sodium nitrate increased productivity of the studied hybrids. Symptoms of zinc deficiency develop throughout the whole plant or are localized on the old lower leaves. At first, brownish grey and purple-coloured spots appear on the leaves of the lower and middle layers and then spread over the rest of the plant. The tissue of the areas like these simply dies off. Zinc deficiency had a negative effect on seeds production. From the results of experiments it follows that there are fluctuation of chlorophyll in maize hybrids when germinated in 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % salts solutions of zinc nitrate, and that the resistance of the plants to fungus and bacterial infections is strengthened when their seeds are previously treated with nitric acid zinc at 0. 01 % concentration...|$|E
40|$|Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is a luscious and {{important}} tropical fruit crop. It {{belongs to the}} family Myrtaceae; is ever green and hardiest among all the tropical fruit trees and exceeds most other fruit crops in productivity and adaptability and is richest source of vitamin C. The research {{studies were carried out}} at Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agricultural, Faisalabad and the objectives to determine guava genetic diversity using morphological and DNA markers based approaches and to develop vegetative propagation system to avoid clonal degradation of guava. Tree parameters like growth habit, leaf shape, flowering, fruit and seed was recorded in two districts Faisalabad and Sheikhupura according to the plant descriptor. Ten plants from each accession of guava were selected for tree, leaf, fruit, flower and seed morphological analysis. Data was registered from 25 leaves/flowers/fruits/seed per accession. 15 to 20 young leaves per accession of guava were collected for DNA extraction following CTAB protocol. The extracted DNA was subjected to SSR analysis. For clonal propagation softwood cuttings from five year old trees were prepared from the tips of current season growth. IBA (0, 2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 ppm) was used to treat cuttings for root induction. The data collected was subjected to different statistical software. During the survey 37 accessions of guava were collected from two major growing areas of district Faisalabad and Sheikhupura for phenotypic genetic variation analysis. Multivariate analysis principal component indicated high diversity for accessions Mota gola, Khata gola, Rough gola, Bangladeshi gola and Surahi in district Faisalabad and Mota gola, Larkana gola, Desi gola, Gola and Sadabahar gola were most diverse accessions in district Sheikhupura. The combined analysis of accessions of both districts indicated Mota gola (SKP), Mota gola (FSD) belonging two different orchards, Bangladeshi gola(FSD), Rough gola (FSD), Surahi (FSD), Moti surahi (SKP), Gola (SKP) and Gola (SKP) (belonging two different orchards) as most divergent accessions. Among tree parameters like, young shoot color, fully developed leaf shape of tips, fully developed leaf shape of base, fully developed leaf color,fully developed leaf curvature in cross section, thickness of outer flesh in relation to core diameter, fruit length, fruit width, fruit juiciness, fruit <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stalk,</b> fruit length/width ratio, fruit relief of surface, fruit size of sepal, fruit sweetness, fruit diameter of calyx cavity in relation to that of fruit and fruit ridged collar around calyx cavity and seed size was the most diverse phenotypic markers for guava accessions identification. The phenotypic and genotypic based dendrograms grouped guava accessions into two main groups and many sub groups and sub groups. High diversity was found in all accessions especially Mota gola (SKP) was the most diverse phenotype among all accessions of both districts and Gola (SKP) had most diverse genotype on genetic basis. Sadabahar gola (SKP), Gola (SKP), Gola (FSD), Choti surahi (SKP) and Surahi (FSD) were found quite phenotypic diverse accessions in morphological analysis, and Bangladeshi gola (FSD), Lal gola (FSD), Larkana gola (FSD), Gola (SKP), Moti surahi (SKP) and Sadabahar gola (SKP) were quite genetically diverse accessions on the basis of genetic markers variation analysis. As for as clonal propagation is concerned highly significant results were obtained for all the parameters (number of rooted cuttings, sprouting % age, average number of roots per cuttings, average root length (cm) and survival % age) and all concentrations (0, 2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 ppm) for rooting of softwood cuttings treated with IBA and NAA. Highly significant results were obtained with 4000 ppm IBA and 2000 ppm of NAA and IBA performed the best for rooting of softwood cuttings in comparison with NAA. This study revealed the great potential of morphological and genetic variation and clonal propagation technique in guava.

The control <b>of</b> the African <b>stalk</b> borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in {{sugarcane}} {{fields of}} KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa has proved problematical. Researchers at the South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI) have since 1974 been intensively investigating various means {{of controlling the}} pest. Among the methods of control currently being investigated are biological control, chemical control, production of more resistant varieties and crop management. These investigations, however, require many years of experimentation before any conclusions can be made. In order to aid the research currently being {{carried out in the}} Entomology Department at SASRI (to investigate biological control strategies, insecticide application strategies and the carry-over decision), a simulation model of E. saccharina growth in sugarcane has been formulated. The model is cohort-based and includes the effect of temperature on the physiological development of individuals in each life-stage of the insect. It also takes into account the effect of the condition of sugarcane on the rate of E. saccharina infestation, by making use of output from the sugarcane growth model CANEGRO. Further, a crop damage index is defined that gives an indication of the history of E. saccharina infestation levels during the sugarcane’s growth period. It is linked to the physiological activity of the borer during the period spent feeding on the stalk tissue. The damage index can further be translated into <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stalks</b> bored and hence the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>stalk</b> <b>length</b> bored can be calculated at each point in the simulation using the total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stalks</b> calculated in the CANEGRO model. Using an industry accepted relationship between percent stalks damaged and reduction in sucrose content of the crop, reductions in losses in the relative value of the crop when the various control measures are implemented can be compared.

Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|R

40|$|Production: Sugarcane is a {{perennial}} tropical grass that originated in southeast Asia, {{was introduced to}} Hawaii by Polynesian cultures, and brought to the Americas by European colonists. Sugarcane is produced by planting one-meter <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>stalks</b> horizontally in the soil. New roots and shoots are regenerated each year from nodal bands. The first year's crop is called "plant cane " and is harvested {{a year or more}} after planting. In succeeding years, stubble or "ratoon crops " are harvested from the regrowth. Yields decline with successive stubble crops. Land is commonly rotated to other crops before sugarcane is replanted. Field production and milling are closely linked because both require high capital investments and attentive management. Poor weed control impacts tonnage in the field and sucrose recovery in the mill. Products: Sugarcane stalks are crushed to extract juice, which is then boiled and evaporated to produce a thick syrup from which sugar granules form. Sugarcane also produces two byproducts: molasses and bagasse. Molasses is a thick syrup from which no more sugar can be removed and is used as a livestock feed or is fermented into fuel alcohol or interesting beverages. Bagasse is the fiber constituent remaining after the juice is expressed. Bagasse is burned for steam generation to power the mill equipment and generate electricity. Excess bagasse is used in industrial fiber products...|$|R

5000|$|Salvia interrupta has apple-green {{three-lobed}} {{leaves of}} various sizes, with short white {{hairs on the}} underside, with the plant appearing to grow in a basal rosette. The flower stalks grow to 2 ft, with verticils of 5 - 10 flowers growing on small peduncles that are widely spaced along the stalk. The spacing explains the plant's epithet, [...] "interrupta", and contributes to the elegance <b>of</b> the flower <b>stalk.</b> The nearly 4cm flowers are large and violet, with a wide lower lip that has at its center two distinct white lines leading insects to the pollen and nectar glands inside. The stalks are square when young, becoming round when mature, with two distinct dark purple-brown lines running up the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stalk.</b> The plant is sometimes confused with Salvia candelabrum, which has undivided leaves [...] as compared to S. interrupta, due to the similarity <b>of</b> the flower <b>stalks.</b> Salvia ringens also looks similar to S. interrupta— it has longer petioles and repeat blooms more frequently.|$|R
40|$|Hemp is {{an annual}} crop grown for the {{production}} of fiber. It is sown in the spring like small grain and produces a thick stand <b>of</b> slender unbranched <b>stalks,</b> growing usually to a height of 6 to 10 feet. The fiber is found extending the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stalk,</b> between the thin bark on the outside and the woody central pith on the inside. To obtain, the fiber the stalks are retted (partially decomposed) and then put through machines that separate the fiber from the rest <b>of</b> the <b>stalk.</b> Although hemp has been grown in the United States since early colonial days the acreage of this crop has not been very extensive. Due primarily to competition from cotton, jute, sisal and abaca (Manila fiber) domestic hemp production declined until a low of 1, 200 acres was reached in 1933. Since 1939, because of the stimulation of an increased demand due to war conditions, production has again increased. In 1942 there were about 7, 500 acres grown for fiber in Wisconsin, 5, 000 in Kentucky, 600 in Minnesota and 500 in Illinois...|$|R

40|$|WE have {{recently}} shown 1, 2 that β-mercaptoethanol (a strongly reducing -SH-containing substance) markedly inhibits morphogenetic movements (gastrulation, closure of neural plate) in amphibian eggs. The oxidized counterpart of β-mercaptoethanol (dithiodiglycol) produces a thickening of the neural plate; {{the same type}} of abnormalities can be obtained with other thiol reagents, iodoacetamide and chloropicrine for example 3. Another interesting action of β-mercaptoethanol is the complete inhibition of cap formation in anucleate fragments of the alga Acetabularia, without appreciable effect on the growth in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stalks</b> 4. It is a surprising fact that β-mercaptoethanol exerts strongly inhibitory effects on morphogenesis in biological systems so different as amphibian eggs and Acetabularia; the purpose of this communication is to summarize the results obtained in further experiments made on Acetabularia, amphibian eggs and regenerating animals (axolotl tadpoles, planarians). © 1959 Nature Publishing Group.
