40|$|Some {{would say}} that <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> are the dinosaurs of {{planning}} policy. And indeed, in almost every country in continental Europe <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> emerged as main instruments in the earliest/almost prehistoric periods of organic planning legislation. But unlike the dinosaurs, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> have managed to survive {{in most of these}} countries and they have adapted successfully until now as some kind of living fossils. That is why we prefer to see them as crocodiles. Like crocodiles, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> appear quite frightening because of their non contemporary unattractive look and their lethal/legal power. Unfortunately, similar to the gradual extinction of crocodiles because of climate change, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> seem to become endangered and mainly too because of drastic changes in contextual factors. Since their features seem rather unappealing at first sight, acolytes of crocodiles as well as <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> rarely raise their voices in the debate about their survival. However, this contribution wants to change strategy. It consciously ignores the characteristics of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> that might make them vulnerable. Instead, it addresses three main contextual aspects of its questionable survival. In other words it focuses on the destructive ways in which planners, policy makers and citizens more and more position <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> as planning instruments. First, planners and policy makers seem to have almost blind faith in the power of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans.</b> The latter are still too often considered, by planners as well as policy makers, as the universal solution of each planning process. This dogmatic belief burdens <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> with impossible expectations since it ignores the original ambition of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans,</b> namely offering a framework for the assessment of building permits. It also neglects the role and position of other policy instruments in consolidating the outcomes of a planning process. Secondly, convinced of the robustness of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans,</b> {{in the last two decades}} policy makers in closely related policy domains such as for instance environmental, nature conservation and cultural heritage policy, have legally linked their own sectoral assessment tools to the approval process of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans.</b> Despite the integrating character of planning, this strategy has led primarily to a formal overload of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> with sectoral policy goals what makes them obese and vulnerable. Finally, the sensitivity of individual citizens for interference of government in their private property rights has grown tremendously, even when this interference is inspired by public interests. The combination of government’s preference for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> as a tool to limit these rights on the one hand and the vulnerability of these plans because of the lethal amount of linked sectoral policies on the other hand, make <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> ideal subjects for judicial procedures. Already weakened because of the combination of the first two aspects, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> are easy preys. Before officially declaring <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> extinct, this contribution pleads for a drastic sanitation of the societal and political context in which <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> have to function. We want to prevent these crocodiles from extinction because, in our opinion, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> still have an optimistic and meaningful life expectancy. But as crocodiles have adapted to and need a specific climate, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> need to be strictly used for the purposes they were generated for originally...|$|R

Local <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> is well suited to play a critical leadership role in addressing the {{effects of climate change}} by encouraging change in development patterns to reduce GHG emissions and their impacts. Although some studies have begun to discuss the role of local <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> in climate change, little research has been conducted to determine how to convert the concepts of climate change into local <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> tools and empirically integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies into local <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} examine how <b>land</b> <b>use</b> relates to reduction of greenhouse gas emission.

In my research I sought {{to develop a new}} spatial approach to improve the implementation of flood-risk-based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> that can be used by local governments. In Australia, strategies for floodplain management to reduce and control flooding are best implemented at the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> stage. Flood-risk-based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> results in sustainable land management activities, including floodplain management. Flood-risk-based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> is largely dependent on flood behaviour across the land development areas, which can be documented in the form of planning zones that warn <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planners about the flood-threatened area. However, these are often out-dated so do not reflect the influence of recent <b>land</b> <b>use</b> changes. This is particularly for peri-urban areas (largely focus on riverine floods) and expensive to update. Developing a new approach based on geospatial science facilitates the implementation of flood-risk-based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> process and can provide a better approach for local governments in terms of cost, accuracy and ease of updating.
