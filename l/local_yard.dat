500|$|A National Historic District west of Downtown, Browne's Addition was Spokane's first prestigious address, {{notable for}} its array of old mansions built by Spokane's early elite in the Queen Anne and early American Craftsman styles. The area houses the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture. In {{northeast}} Spokane, the Hillyard neighborhood began in 1892 as the chosen site for James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway yard, placed outside Spokane city limits to avoid [...] "burdensome taxes." [...] The downtown Hillyard Business District, located on Market Street, {{was the first}} Spokane neighborhood listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the former town's houses were built to house railroad workers, mainly immigrant laborers working in the <b>local</b> <b>yard,</b> who gave Hillyard an independent, blue-collar character. Hillyard has become a home for much of Spokane's growing Russian, Ukrainian, and Southeast Asian communities.|$|E
500|$|Train {{service at}} Great Notch {{originated}} {{with the introduction}} of the Caldwell Railway, a service that went from the community of Caldwell, New Jersey to the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway. Twelve trains a day served Caldwell, Verona and Overbrook Hospital. The station at Great Notch was deemed Caldwell Junction, inferring the junction between the two railways. The Great Notch station depot was built in 1905 for the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway, a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad. The station was built as a green-red [...] "type five" [...] frame structure. While the main building was 12' × 28' × 18' in size, the station also included an old boxcar used as a tool house. The box car was only 12' × 45' and served the station for several decades. The station was just east of the [...] "GA" [...] signal tower, which was built in 1900 to serve the junction of the Greenwood Lake Railway and its Caldwell Branch, heading eastward for the communities of Cedar Grove, Verona, Caldwell and Essex Fells. The station also served a <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> for train storage for the branch line via a wye. At Essex Fells, connections could be made for train service to Morristown via the Morristown and Erie Railroad. [...] The Caldwell Railroad diverged from the current New Jersey Transit line about 1/4 mile west of the New Jersey Transit Great Notch station and followed its own route to Caldwell. The station at Great Notch {{was more than just a}} building for people at the railroad. The station had a large water tower next to GA Signal and a potbelly stove. The station was tended by a husband and wife combination, serving the locals their daily newspapers and their mail. Great Notch did not receive mail delivery until the mid-1950s.|$|E
50|$|The Ribambelle is {{a gang of}} {{friendly}} kids who attend the same school in a typical mainland European town, probably in France. They hang out in a <b>local</b> <b>yard,</b> their HQ being a battered, abandoned bus. To ensure their privacy, a variety of hidden traps have been laid around the ground to discourage intruders.|$|E
50|$|A boat {{building}} industry began, with <b>local</b> <b>yards</b> first constructing Zulu’s and from 1903 steam drifters. In 1907 one yard employed fifty men {{and launched a}} drifter every month or so but this business in drifters had dried up by 1915, though the yard continued to produce salmon cobles.|$|R

50|$|The yard didn't escape {{recognition}} by famous dignitaries. President Harry S Truman was escorted by then Governor J. Howard McGrath when Truman toured the yard. Navy Secretary James Forrestal on September 1, 1945 wrote to T.J. Walsh, {{the head of}} the company, praising the work of the <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> and saying that it was preeminent in building the great arsenal that helped save the world.|$|E
50|$|In addition, with a {{fleet of}} 74 rail {{vehicles}} in the <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> to cover at least double the 10.7 miles (17.2 km) system length, {{and with all the}} basic facilities and capital equipment needed for the functioning in place, it is indispensable that the train be extended as it was originally intended to include higher-density areas of the central district for it to be operationally successful and sustainable.|$|E
50|$|The town {{came about}} {{due to the}} Great Northern Railway and was named for James J. Hill, then-head of the {{railroad}}. Between 1904 and 1912, many of the town's houses were built, to house railroad workers working in the <b>local</b> <b>yard.</b> Hillyard was {{the home of the}} Great Northern's famed shops where locomotives were manufactured, repaired, and refurbished. At the time, the Hillyard shop was the largest in the nation.|$|E

50|$|Amherst Island at {{mid-19th century}} was a mixed economy of farming wheat and barley, {{fishing in the}} Bay of Quinte, sailing the Great Lakes, and {{shipbuilding}} at the <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> of David Tait. Soon, however, the shipyard closed when local forests were depleted; sailing declined as railways won out over water transport; and crop farming gave way to more stable, mixed dairy farming. As the economy changed {{those who could not}} make the transition left, and those who remained behind managed to purchase and expand their farms.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, Knight Island {{traveled}} to Bayou La Batre, Alabama for an extensive $750,000 Dry-Dock Package. During the yard period, major projects {{will be completed}} by <b>local</b> <b>Yard</b> employees from Master Marine Inc. and ships crew. Some of the major projects include: Hull and bilge preservation and painting, Main Engine & Generator replacements, numerous tank inspections, cleanings, and preservations, and painting of interior and exterior surfaces. This Dry-dock will help ensure the Knight Island {{will continue to be}} a viable asset for the US Coast Guard.|$|E
5000|$|La Ribambelle (French for [...] "flock" [...] or [...] "throng") is a Belgian comics {{series about}} {{a gang of}} kids {{living in the same}} neighbourhood. There were two {{versions}} of this strip: Joseph Loeckx (better known under the pen-name of [...] "Jo-El Azara") drew a one-off story in 1958, but the longer-lasting version was that of Jean Roba (best known for Boule et Bill) who created {{a whole new set of}} characters who came from various countries and ethnic backgrounds but lived in the same city. They played in a <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> and even had adventures abroad. Others who contributed to the strip included writers Vicq, Maurice Tillieux and artist Jidéhem.|$|E
25|$|Barrow's {{location}} {{and the availability}} of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels, a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the <b>local</b> <b>yard's</b> specialisation in submarines. The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II, leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow's main industry and employer. Several Royal Navy flagships, the vast majority of its nuclear submarines as well as numerous other naval vessels, ocean liners and oil tankers have been manufactured at the facility.|$|R
50|$|The British Rail Class 14 {{is a type}} {{of small}} diesel-hydraulic {{locomotive}} built in the mid-1960s. Twenty-six of these 0-6-0 locomotives were ordered in January 1963, to be built at British Railways Swindon Works. The anticipated work for this class was trip working movements between <b>local</b> <b>yards</b> and short distance freight trains. The good all-around visibility from the cab and dual controls also made them capable of being used for shunting duties. The order was expanded from 26 to 56 in mid-1963, before work had started on the first order.|$|R
50|$|Steam {{operation}} {{ended at}} the station in 1974 here and the turntable and the roundhouse were demolished in 1975. The <b>local</b> freight <b>yard</b> at the old station was also closed.|$|R
50|$|Just {{three years}} after the fire, in 1892, James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway had arrived in the newly created {{township}} of Hillyard (annexed by Spokane in 1924)—the chosen site for Hill's rail yards, machine shops, and roundhouse because of the area's flat ground. The addition of Hill's railroad resulted in another small population boom. Much of the town was built to house railroad workers, mainly immigrant laborers working in the <b>local</b> <b>yard.</b> The city also had developed a sizable Asian community, mostly Japanese, centered in a district called Chinatown. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads. These railroads in Spokane made it a transportation hub for the Inland Northwest region.|$|E

50|$|At Schreiber, {{the chosen}} spot was the water {{standpipe}} {{at the east}} end of the station platform. When the arriving eastward train stopped at this location, the arriving head-end train crew would disembark and the outgoing crew would board the locomotive. This new crew would then advise the train crew in the caboose by radio that they were on board. The caboose crew would acknowledge this message and advise the new head-end crew if sixty pounds of air pressure was displayed in the caboose air pressure gauge. If this number had been attained, then the caboose crew member would direct the head-end crew to start the train brake testing process which was done at every station during these years. The caboose crew would also note the location of the caboose in relation to a measurement sign and communicate that information to the <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> office and from there to the dispatcher.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s the <b>local</b> goods <b>yards</b> at Catford Bridge, Lower Sydenham, Clock House, Elmers End, West Wickham and Hayes all {{closed as}} did the gas works {{internal}} railway at Lower Sydenham.|$|R

Rail service to Churchville was discontinued in July 1921.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger rail service {{ended at}} the depot in 1967, after {{which it was}} used by the railroads as a {{headquarters}} for their agents and operators. The Keokuk Junction Railway (KJRY) acquired the <b>local</b> <b>yard</b> trackage and switching rights from the bankrupt Rock Island lines, and in 1981 they bought all of the shares of the Keokuk Union Depot Company. The depot {{was used by the}} KJRY as the base for their tourist train operations, and its trolley rides across the Mississippi into Illinois. Pioneer Railcorp acquired the Keokuk Junction Railway's assets in 1996. They used the old depot for storage until 2011 when they conveyed the depot and the adjacent land to the City of Keokuk for 99 years. [...] The city formed the Depot Commission to oversee the management and preservation of the facility. A non-profit organization, the Keokuk Union Depot Foundation, was established the following year to raise the necessary funds to preserve and run the depot.|$|E
