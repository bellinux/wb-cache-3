40|$|AbstractLow {{cyclical}} loadings {{can cause}} failure {{after a very}} high number of cycles in the so-called “Very High Cycle Fatigue” (VHCF) area. Thereby, failure initiates typically below the surface at defects like non-metallic inclusions. The appearance of VHCF failure depends on the microstructure of the material and the loading situation. E. g., a {{quenched and tempered steel}} with a given distribution of non-metallic inclusions may be insensitive to VHCF failure in a low strength condition but very sensitive in a high-strength condition. The present study investigates the influence of tempering temperature on the fatigue resistance of a low alloyed steel. Uniaxial tension-compression fatigue tests (50 Hz/ 1 kHz and R=- 1) were performed on specimens made of 42 CrMo 4, which were tempered at six different temperatures to produce wide a range of ultimate strength. With the decrease in tempering temperature the sensitivity of subsurface crack initiation at inner defects increases. High tempered conditions with Rm < 1400 MPa show no failure between 106 and 109 cycles. Crack initiation almost occurs at the surface as a result of local plasticity and surface defects. The fatigue resistance at 109 cycles (Rw/ 9) matches to the fatigue resistance at 106 cycles (Rw/ 6). The <b>low</b> <b>tempered</b> conditions show a tendency of increasing life scatter and the threshold value for subsurface crack initiation increase with decreasing strength-level. The study indicated that for high-strength heat treatment conditions the difference between the fatigue strength at 106 and 109 increases with decreasing tempering temperature.

As a secondary objective, the microstructure of the HAZ of a TIG welding is to be evaluated. The C 90 is as steel of high hardenability and its base microstructure consists of tempered martensite with a Vickers hardness of 239 HV 10. The main focus in this work has been to sufficiently soften the weld as well as obtaining impact toughness properties within requirements, by implying a {{post weld heat treatment}} procedure. Hardness values cannot exceed 270 HV 10 and impact toughness energy must exhibit an average value above 40 J. Steel samples have been heated to a peak temperature of 1150 ˚C, followed by controlled cooling at 10 and 60 ˚C/s, prior to post weld heat treatment. Tempering at temperatures of 680 and 720 ˚C has been conducted on the post quenched structure for up to three hours and has been performed in an air circulating furnace and in a Smitweld Thermal Cycle apparatus. <b>Low</b> <b>tempering</b> times (up to 1200 s) have been performed in the Smitweld apparatus. Weld hardness and impact toughness requirements was met after three hours of post weld heat treatment at 720 ˚C in an air circulating furnace, producing a hardness value of 253 HV 10 and a Charpy-V energy of 66 J for the parallel quenched at 10 ˚C/s. After some tempering of the structure, the two cooling rates used did not affect hardness values significantly. Tempering at 680 ˚C did not soften the structure sufficiently to meet the criteria, with the lowest measured hardness of 315 HV 10 after three hours. The hardness of the intercrictial zone of the weld was reduced to 246 HV 10 after tempering for three hours at 720 ˚C. Tempering in the Smitweld apparatus softened the structure more efficiently than what was observed in the furnace, producing hardness values of 271 HV 10 after only twenty minutes of tempering at 720 ˚C. It has been suggested that due to substantially higher heating rates obtained by the Smitweld apparatus, <b>low</b> temperature <b>tempering</b> mechanisms may be inhibited or delayed, resulting in a post tempered structure consisting of coarse carbides with large inter particle spacing, contributing little to precipitation hardening. Heating rates obtained by Smitweld is in the same range as those obtainable by the SAG-FW procedure, and the two methods are therefore considered comparable.
