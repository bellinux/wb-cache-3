5|$|On {{the western}} side of the lower reaches of the Kettle Creek watershed, there is an {{underground}} mine complex with 26 sources of acid mine drainage. The acid mine drainage enters Kettle Creek, among other streams in the area and the sources of it have an average discharge of 479 gallons per minute. They also have 304 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> acidity, 44 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> iron, 21 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> aluminum, 8 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> manganese, and 930 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> sulfates. The alkalinity load from the Alvin R. Bush Dam is about 15 times greater than the acidity load from these acid mine discharges.|$|E

5|$|The {{discharge}} of Twomile Run at its mouth ranges from 200 to 10,000 gallons per minute. There are 2.1 to 11.7 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> manganese {{in the waters}} at this location. In 2007, the average pH {{at the mouth of}} the stream was 3.52, with a range of 3.4 to 3.9.

5|$|At these sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively.

The toxicity of aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5.

Some of the least hard waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are those of Little Nescopeck Creek A (3 to 8 milligrams per liter), Conety Run (5 milligrams per liter), and Oley Creek (7 milligrams per liter). However, the largest source of pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is acid mine drainage (AMD).|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E

The total concentration of nitrogen in the lake's waters ranges from 0.34 to 3.1 milligrams per liter, while the concentration of ammonia ranges from less than 0.026 to 3.21 milligrams per liter. The phosphorus concentration ranges from 0.015 to 0.172 milligrams per liter. The waters of Lake Chillisquaque also contain varying amounts of metals. These include calcium, whose concentration ranges from 15.6 to 20.9 milligrams per liter and magnesium, whose concentration ranges from 3.7 to 6.2 milligrams per liter. Additionally, the concentration of copper is less than four milligrams per liter and the lead concentration is less than one microgram per liter.

25|$|One <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other words, for {{the same}} energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient. A larger percentage of the energy available in a <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> alcohol fuel {{can be converted to}} useful work. This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|E
