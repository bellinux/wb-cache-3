40|$|Numerous reports {{demonstrate}} that low intensity, long-day (<b>LD)</b> <b>lighting</b> treatments can promote growth. However, there are conflicting suggestions {{as to the}} mechanisms involved. This study examines the responses of Petunia, Impatiens, and tomato to <b>LD</b> <b>lighting</b> treatments and concludes that no single mechanism can explain the growth promotion observed in each case. Petunia showed the most dramatic response to photoperiod; up to a doubling in dry weight (DW) {{as a result of}} increasing daylength from 8 h d– 1 to 16 h d– 1. This could be explained by an increase in specific leaf area (SLA) comparable to that seen with shading. At low photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD), the increased leaf area more than compensated for any loss in photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area. In Petunia, the response may, in part, have also been due to changes in growth habit. Impatiens and tomato showed less dramatic increases in DW as a result of <b>LD</b> <b>lighting,</b> but no consistent effects on SLA or growth habit were observed. In tomato, increased growth was accompanied by increased chlorophyll content, but this had no significant effect on photosynthesis. In both species, increased growth may have been due to a direct effect of <b>LD</b> <b>lighting</b> on photosynthesis. This is contrary to the generally held view that light of approx. 3 – 4 μmol m– 2 s– 1 is unlikely to have any significant impact on net photosynthesis. Nevertheless, we show that the relationship between PPFD and net photosynthesis is non-linear at low light levels, and therefore low intensity <b>LD</b> <b>lighting</b> can offset respiration very efficiently. Furthermore, a small increase in photosynthesis will have a greater impact when ambient light levels are low...|$|R

40|$|The {{dark matter}} search CRESST-II {{completed}} {{its most recent}} run, Run 32, in 2011. Compared to previous runs, the quantity of data taken in this run increased significantly. In this work, Oxrop, analysis software in use within the CRESST collaboration, is upgraded to analyse this new data. At the same time, Oxrop's internal structure is improved {{so that it can}} now handle data from detectors across different experiments consistently. This upgrade was performed with a view to developing Oxrop's candidacy for use with EURECA, a future dark matter experiment. Oxrop is then used to model CRESST-II data. First, <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> response to scintillation light produced in gamma interactions in CRESST-II's target crystals is examined. A factor influencing detector efficiency is the time constant of scintillation light production, and this <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> examination is performed with a view to extracting the scintillation time constants of the target crystals. A simple model of <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> response of one exponential rise and two exponential decay times is initially considered. It is shown that this simple model does not closely match the <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> response to gamma interactions in the crystal scintillator. Empirical extensions to this expected model are then made, allowing for additional decay times. These extensions allow the <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> response to crystal scintillator interactions to be well modelled, and allow estimates of the millikelvin scintillation time of CaWO 4 and ZnWO 4. This model is then also applied to X-ray interactions directly in the <b>light</b> <b>detectors.</b> It is seen that, even with these model extensions, interactions directly in the <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> still show significant tension with the applied model. This implies that direct calibration of <b>light</b> <b>detectors</b> with X-rays is not possible without a further understanding of <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> response, or that future direct calibrations should be done with optical photons. Position dependent effects in Run 32 calibration data are then studied. A phenomenon that has previously been considered as unrelated to position dependence, the anti-correlation effect between phonon and <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> signals, is shown to exhibit a position dependent effect in at least one light/phonon detector pair under study. Additionally, the collection efficiency of the <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> is shown {{to be related to the}} mean interaction position. Collection efficiency is found to reduce when mean interaction position is close to the cylindrical surfaces of CRESST's CaWO 4 target crystals. The magnitude of the difference in light collection efficiency between surface and bulk interactions is also seen to be correlated with high energy <b>light</b> <b>detector</b> resolution. The WIMP-nucleon cross section limits resulting from the CRESST-II commissioning run (2007) are also reanalysed in this work. The original analysis of the commissioning run accounted only for tungsten recoils in the CaWO 4 crystals used in CRESST-II. Here, interactions from calcium and oxygen nuclei are also accounted for. The resulting WIMP-nucleon cross section limits were improved at light WIMP masses ∼O(10 GeV/c 2). These limits show a mild tension with a recent dark matter analysis of Run 32, particularly for WIMP masses below 10 GeV/c 2. Possible causes of this tension are discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Bolometers {{have proven}} to be good {{detectors}} for the search of neutrinoless double beta decay. By operating at cryogenic temperatures, they feature excellent energy resolution and low background. The detection of the possible light emitted when particles interact in the bolometer is a promising method to lower the background of the experiments. The different amount of light emitted in beta/gamma and alpha interactions, whether due to scintillation or Cerenkov emission, allows to discriminate the two interaction types.
