40|$|Pollution by nitrate and {{pesticides}} has impacts on drinking water reserves and aquatic systems. Nowadays, {{this problem is}} the key point of the European Policy {{with the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 /EC). According to these legislations, Member States are supposed to take measures to limit environmental and toxicological effects caused by nitrate {{and pesticides}} use. This paper presents three different approaches allowing assessment of diffuse (non-point sources) pollution risks of water resources by nitrate and pesticides. The first approach consists on the interpretation of the geomorphopedological information (geologic substratum type, presence of karst phenomena, soil texture, natural drainage, profile development, type and percent of stoniness, soil thickness, …) provided by the Digital Soil Map of Wallonia. Soil physical characteristics are assessed in terms of soil water percolation/infiltration, runoff, pollutants retention, mineralization, and erosion. Second approach consists on the use of spatially distributed mechanistic models. Nitrate <b>lixiviation</b> from agricultural land to groundwater has been simulated from the SWAT model. Pesticide <b>lixiviation</b> from soil to groundwater has been predicted from the one-dimensional, dynamic, multi-layered model named PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales). Model input parameters are mainly extracted from the existing soil physical and physico-chemical, crop and pesticides properties databases. Relevant soil parameters not directly available in existing databases, such as bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, potential evapotranspiration… have been derived from pedotransfers functions. Third approach consists on in situ <b>lixiviation</b> studies by the way of lysimeters. Concentrations measured at the bottom (2 m deep) of lysimeters represent a straight “index of risk” for groundwater and, on the other hand, allow the validation of simulation models used to predict nitrate and pesticides <b>lixiviation</b> risk under different scenarios. The Digital Soil Map of Wallonia, one of the core data source, allows the spatialisation of the predicted <b>lixiviation</b> risk at regional level, providing to the local authorities and the decision makers a tool for the identification of the areas at risk of pollution, where specific monitoring actions and prevention measures for the protection of waters can be implemented...|$|E

In this work, pigments from the anthocyanin group were extracted from purple corn and red corn (Zea Mays L.) varieties and were later characterized.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of an antimicrobial ZnO-glass {{in the form}} of powder and {{in the form of}} sintered pellets were studied in water, artificial seawater, biological complex media such as common bacterial/yeast growth media (Luria Bertani (LB), yeast extract, tryptone), and human serum. It has been established that the media containing amino acids and proteins produce a high <b>lixiviation</b> of Zn 2 + from the glass due to the ability of zinc and zinc oxide to react with amino acids and proteins to form complex organic compounds. The process of Zn 2 + <b>lixiviation</b> from the glass network has been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From these results we can state that the process of <b>lixiviation</b> of Zn 2 + from the glass network is similar to the one observed in sodalime glasses, where Na + is lixiviated to the media first and the fraction of Zn that acts as modifiers (2 / 3) is lixiviated in second place.

40|$|Le {{comportement}} à la <b>lixiviation</b> de solidifiats de boues d'hydroxydes métalliques est étudié dans l'optique du développement de méthodologies pour la modélisation comportementale de la <b>lixiviation</b> de matrices minérales. Une telle modélisation nécessite l'identification et la quantification des phases minérales réagissant au cours de la <b>lixiviation</b> ou contrôlant le relargage des polluants (modèle chimique ou réactionnel). La méthodologie développée base la construction de ces modèles réactionnels sur l'association de tests de <b>lixiviation</b> et d'analyses minéralogiques du matériau. Cette approche combinée vise à établir les liens entre solubilisation des éléments (tests ANC et de dissolition sélective) et la minéralogie des matériaux (DRX et observations MEB-EDS avant et après <b>lixiviation).</b> Le test de dissolution sélective s'avère être un outil particulièrement efficient pour l'identification de ces liens puisqu'il dévoile les principales réactions de dissolution contrôlant la réponse du matériau à une attaque acide (analyse différentielle). The leaching {{behavior of}} metallic hydroxides sludge stabilized/solidified by an hydraulic binder composed of Portland cement and coal fly ashes was studied {{in order to}} develop methodologies for modeling the leaching of mineral wastes. Such a modeling needs to identify and to quantify the mineral phases reacting during the leaching process and those controlling the release of pollutants. The methodology developed in this work proposes to build chemical models by associating leaching tests and mineralogical analysis. This combined approached permits to highlight links between mineralogy (XRD analysis and SEM-EDS observations on leached and unleached materials) and the leaching of elements (ANC test and differential acid neutralization analysis test). The differential acid neutralization analysis test was recognized as a useful test because it exhibits each dissolution reaction occurring during the acid attack of the studied material. Moreover, the targeted analysis of leachates permits to links the release of pollutants to these dissolution reactions. A method based on studying minerals stability in realistic environment using a numerical simulator was developed to identify these reactions. Thus a mineral assemblage was identified for representing each studied material and its response to an acid attack. Simulating the leaching behavior in realistic conditions required to couple this chemical model to a transport model. The development of this transport model was based on the release of soluble species (Na and K) during a Dynamic Monolithic Leaching Test (DMLT). The simulation of this DMLT resulting of the coupling of transport and chemical models, only permits a partial validation of the identified chemical models. Nevertheless, the evolutions of the materials induced by the DMLT being weak, we can t judge of the reliability of long term simulation results. This study of the leaching behavior of mineral matrixes was limited to dissolution/precipitation reactions and to the influence of pH. The proposed methodology should be completed in order to model others kinds of reaction (sorption) and the influences of others parameters (oxidation, carbonation).

Since six years nitric nitrogen <b>lixiviation</b> is followed in six fields located in a silty area in Hesbaye (Belgium), mainly dedicated to vegetable crops. Open-field lysimeters are used, with the aim not to impede agricultural operations. These lysimeters allow the quantitative follow-up of the nitrate <b>lixiviation</b> below the root zone. The aims of the project are the setting up of better agricultural practices with regard to water quality on the one hand, and the adjustement of fertilization advice and {{the assessment of the}} impacts on yields, nitrogen remainder, and nitrate concentration in the water collected {{at the bottom of the}} lysimeter on the other hand.

Among the different options that have been envisioned and explored for minor actinides over the past thirty years, two alternatives currently remain: long term disposal in a safe repository or nuclear wastes ¿burning¿ in a so-called transmutation process, both options being generally ultimately related. To fulfill the needs for long-term disposal, geological-time-resistant materials to be employed have to sustain both <b>lixiviation</b> and self-irradiation. This latter should not turn the material into an amorphous one since <b>lixiviation</b> would then be dramatically enhanced. A good knowledge of radiation damages is thus a key prerequisite to select the proper material.
