A draft contract had been initialled by Alexander but never formally completed and Alexander decided to cease deliveries without notice. The Metropolitan held that the draft contract was valid and had been breached.

25|$|The modern <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is {{primarily}} {{a creature of the}} industrial revolution and the social legislation of the 20th century. However, the foundations of all European contract law are traceable to obligations in Ancient Athenian and Roman law, while the formal development of English law began after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror created a common law across England, but throughout the middle ages the court system was minimal. Access to the courts, in what are now considered contractual disputes, was consciously restricted to a privileged few through onerous requirements of pleading, formalities and court fees. In the local and manorial courts, according to English law's first treatise by Ranulf de Glanville in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a wager of law). They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|Once a person's work {{contract}} is categorised, {{the courts have}} specific rules for determining, beyond the statutory minimum charter of rights, what are its terms and conditions. Analogous rules for incorporation of terms, and implication terms exist as in the ordinary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> However, in Gisda Cyf v Barratt, Lord Kerr emphasised that if it affects statutory rights, the process of construction is one that must be [...] "intellectually segregated" [...] from the general <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> because of the relation of dependency an employee has. In this case, Ms Barratt was told her employment was terminated in a letter that she opened 3 days after its arrival. When, 3 months and 2 days after arrival, she lodged an unfair dismissal claim, the employer argued it was time barred {{on the ground that}} in ordinary contract law one is bound by a notice when a reasonable person would have read a message. The Supreme Court held that Ms Barratt was in time for a claim because she was only bound by the notice when she actually read it. The applicable in employment was different, given the purpose of employment law to protect the employee. From formation to termination, employment contracts are to be construed in the context of statutory protection of dependent workers.|$|E
2500|$|Contract {{implied in}} fact. A person's assent {{to be bound}} by an {{agreement}} can be expressed or implied. In the latter case, assuming the requisite formalities for a valid contract are met, there is a perfectly normal contract.

2500|$|The Willard {{court was}} also wrestling with a 19th-century concept {{of money that}} was quickly {{becoming}} outmoded. This concept, known as [...] "nominalism," [...] assumed that money had an intrinsic value which did not change. The value of a gold coin of a certain size was always the value of such a gold coin, and inflation did not exist. Metallism (using coins of some valuable metal like gold or silver) is a nominalistic money system, one which the United States had moved away from with the National Banking Act of 1863. Nominalism was critical {{to the development of}} the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and the modern industrial economy. Most nations adhered to it until the 20th century but abandoned it thereafter. This trend away from nominalism was under way at the time the Willard case came before the Supreme Court, and it represents the Court's attempt to reconcile this modern economics with contract law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} laws {{will usually}} define status in rem {{so that it}} is recognised wherever the individual may travel subject only to significant public policy limits. Hence, for example, as an aspect of parens patriae, a state will define the age at which a person may marry. If such a limitation could simply be evaded by the young person traveling abroad on a holiday to a country with a lower age limit, this would clearly breach the policy of the [...] "parental" [...] state. The same principle would apply to an adult who wished to create a polygamous marriage or to evade a restriction on consanguinity. In Family Law as opposed to the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contract,</b> there is also a strong case for legal capacity to be universally enforced to limit to ability of individuals to evade normally mandatory rules. The claims of the lex loci celebrationis to apply are weak given that the significance of the location may be no more than the convenience of their laws to those wishing to marry.|$|E

50|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of a European {{civil code}} is, like a national civil code, to deal comprehensively with the core areas <b>of</b> private <b>law.</b> Private law typically {{covered in a}} civil code includes the family <b>law,</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> inheritance, property <b>law</b> and the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Obligations. The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> obligations includes the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> delicts (or torts) and restitution. It was from work on European contract law that the push for a comprehensive European civil code arose. The development of a European civil code has primarily focused on creating a unified <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Thus European civil code is often used in specific reference to the harmonisation <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> <b>law</b> throughout the EU.|$|R
2500|$|The {{payment of}} damages (monetary compensation) {{by a public}} {{authority}} is relevant to legitimate expectation in two ways. First, if the authority has voluntarily paid damages to an individual for breaching a legitimate expectation, the court could hold that the authority has not abused its power and thus {{there is no need}} to compel it to fulfil the expectation. Secondly, it has been suggested that upon finding that the authority has breached a legitimate expectation, instead of ordering the expectation to be given effect, the court could direct that damages be paid. However, a serious difficulty with this proposal is the fact that at present English law does not generally recognize monetary compensation as a remedy for breaches of public law. A person can only obtain damages if he or she also has a parallel cause of action in private law (for example, in the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> or tort), and the non-fulfilment of a legitimate expectation is only likely to give rise to such a cause of action on rare occasions. In R. v. Commissioners of Custom and Excise, ex parte F & I Services Ltd. (2001) Justice Sedley referred to the possibility of damages as a remedy, but commented: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{requirements}} of notice and any disciplinary procedure {{do not apply}} if the employee {{was the one to}} have repudiated the contract, either expressly, or by conduct. As in the general <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> if an employee's conduct is so seriously bad that it manifests to the reasonable person an intention to not be bound, then the employer may dismiss the employee without notice. But if the employer is not justified in making a summary dismissal, the employee has a claim under ERA 1996 section 13 for a shortfall in wages. The same principle, that a serious breach of contract gives the other side the option to terminate, also works in favour of employees. In Wilson v Racher a gardener was bullied by his employer, the heir of Tolethorpe Hall, and gave him a rude telling off for not picking up some string on the lawn. Mr Wilson, the gardener, told Mr Racher [...] "get stuffed, go and shit yourself". The Court of Appeal held that the employer's attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer's own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a [...] "Czar-serf" [...] relationship, Mr Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together, is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital, the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer's failure to follow a doctor's contractual disciplinary procedure. This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.|$|E
2500|$|If an {{enforceable}} agreement – {{a contract}} – exists, {{the details of}} the contract's terms matter if one party has allegedly broken the agreement. A contract's terms are what was promised. Yet {{it is up to the}} courts to construe evidence of what the parties said before a contract's conclusion, and construe the terms agreed. Construction of the contract starts with the express promises people make to one another, but also with terms found in other documents or notices that were intended to be incorporated. The general rule is that reasonable notice of the term is needed, and more notice is needed for an onerous term. The meaning of those terms must then be interpreted, and the modern approach is to construe the meaning of an agreement from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the whole context. The courts, as well as legislation, may also imply terms into contracts generally to 'fill gaps' as necessary to fulfil the reasonable expectations of the parties, or as necessary incidents to specific contracts. English law had, particularly in the late 19th century, adhered to the laissez faire principle of [...] "freedom of contract" [...] so that, in the general <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> people can agree to whatever terms or conditions they choose. By contrast, specific contracts, particularly for consumers, employees or tenants were built to carry a minimum core of rights, mostly deriving from statute, that aim to secure the fairness of contractual terms. The evolution of case law in the 20th century generally shows an ever-clearer distinction between general contracts among commercial parties and those between parties of unequal bargaining power, since in these groups of transaction true choice is thought to be hampered by lack of real competition in the market. Hence, some terms can be found to be unfair under statutes such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 and can be removed by the courts, with the administrative assistance of the Competition and Markets Authority.|$|E
