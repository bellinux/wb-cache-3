5|$|Close to {{the village}} and gorge are Batts Combe quarry and Callow Rock quarry, two of the active Quarries of the Mendip Hills where {{limestone}} is still extracted. Operating since the early 20thcentury, Batts Combe is {{owned and operated by}} Hanson Aggregates. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an on-site <b>lime</b> <b>kiln,</b> which closed in 2009; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99percent carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite).|$|E
5|$|North of CR22, Rutgers Creek {{merges with}} Indigot Creek, a small stream forming {{part of the}} Minisink–Wawayanda town line. The {{combined}} stream continues {{to serve as the}} boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly course from this point. NY284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR93 (<b>Lime</b> <b>Kiln</b> Road) just north of the town line. From CR93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill. NY284 ends {{in the center of the}} community at a junction with US6.|$|E
5|$|While NY346 {{follows the}} {{southern}} {{bank of the}} Hoosick River, VT346 largely runs along the northern bank. The switch in positioning is made {{just east of the}} state line, where VT346 crosses over the waterway. The route continues eastward, intersecting Indian Massacre Road, the continuation of CR96, and crossing a Pan Am Railways-owned railroad line on its way to a junction with <b>Lime</b> <b>Kiln</b> Road, a local highway leading to the village of Pownal Center. At this point, VT346 turns southward into the village of North Pownal. The route heads generally north–south through the community, running alongside both the Hoosick River and the Pan Am Railways line.|$|E

5|$|Both Steep Holm and Flat Holm were {{fortified}} in the 1860s as a defence against invasion. They {{form part}} {{of a line of}} defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under the direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast, and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston-super-Mare. The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a <b>lime</b> <b>kiln</b> for the manufacture of lime mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Strachwitz and {{his family}} moved from their palace in Groß Stein to their manor in Alt Siedel, because of {{personal}} differences with his father, who remained in Groß Stein. Between 1924 and 1933 Strachwitz founded two dairy cooperatives which many local farmers joined. In parallel he studied a few semesters of forestry. He used his knowledge to influence the Silesian forest owners to sell their wood to the paper mills. He continued to use his influence in Upper Silesia to modernize forestry and farming. His ambitions were aided by his presidency of the Forstausschuss (Forestry Committee) of Upper Silesia and his membership in the Landwirtschaftskammer (Chamber of Agriculture). Strachwitz completely took over his father's estate in 1929, first as the General Manager and then as owner, with full responsibility. This made Strachwitz {{one of the most}} wealthy land and forest owners in Silesia. Along with the palace in Groß Stein he owned a <b>lime</b> <b>kiln</b> and quarry in Klein Stein—present-day Kamionek—and Groß Stein, a distillery in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel.|$|E

The main set of cottages are neither evidenced on any maps nor in census returns until after 1851, indicating {{that they were not}} built until later and only one census return in the 19th century lists a lime-kiln worker.
