40|$|Internationalization is {{a useful}} {{strategy}} for gaining firm-specific technological advantages especially during periods of technological discontinuity as the pharmaceutical industry illustrates. The antibiotics revolution in the 1940 <b>s</b> <b>saw</b> laggard US firms scrambling to gain capabilities in antibiotics. The possibilities of non-chemical routes to new drug discovery in the 1990 <b>s</b> <b>saw</b> Indian generic drug manufacturers attempting to develop new drug discovery capabilities. This article compares the leapfrogging strategies adopted by US and Indian firms and shows that in both periods internationalization strategies were central to the technological strategies of both groups of firms.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} there have been three {{distinct}} phases of enterprise policy in the UK in the past 30 years: the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>saw</b> no effective enterprise policy ('policy off'); the 1980 s witnessed an attempt {{to increase the number of}} start-ups; and the 1990 <b>s</b> <b>saw</b> a concentration on 'business quality'. This paper looks at how enterprise has evolved in Cleveland/Tees Valley over the past three decades. It suggests - and finds - that businesses in the 1980 s were more numerous but of lower 'quality' (even if the influence of unemployment is accounted for) than those from the 1970 s and 1990 s. This implies that we should be cautious about the value of policy attempts to increase business formation rates in areas such as Cleveland/Tees Valley...|$|R

It starts with a brief introduction of athletics and how division I and division III athletics are so different. Then the paper goes in chronological order through the 1920 s and 1930 s when only football and basketball were offered. The 1950 s brought a significant change to the university when Eau Claire entered the NAIA. The 1960 <b>s</b> <b>saw</b> a huge expansion of the variety of sports offered at a varsity level along with emergence of the recreation department. The 1970 <b>s</b> <b>saw</b> the impact of Title IX especially for female athletes.
