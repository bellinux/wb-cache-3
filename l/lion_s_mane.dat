40|$|Despite {{the early}} belief that persons with agrammatic aphasia have intact {{language}} comprehension, {{research in the}} fields of both linguistics and speech-language pathology has documented that these individuals often have difficultly comprehending certain sentence structures in English. Such core structures include those in which the standard subject-verbobject (SVO) English word order is violated. These deficits have been specifically noted in passive sentences (e. g., The tiger (O) was chased (V) by the <b>lion</b> (<b>S).),</b> object-relative clause constructions (e. g. It was the tiger (O) that the <b>lion</b> (<b>S)</b> chased (V)), and object-cleft constructions (e. g., The tiger (O) that the <b>lion</b> (<b>S)</b> chased (V) is big.). During the past thirty years, researchers have tried to find a theory to most parsimoniously describe these selective impairments in comprehension and their patterns in persons with agramatism. Attempts explain these comprehension deficits have mostly been within the realm of linguistic theory. To date, some of the most influential work has come from Grodzinsky (1986, 1990, 1995 a) who first accounted for the above findings by presenting a theory to explain the sentence comprehension difficulties, called the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis (TDH). The TDH assumes that, in agrammatism, all traces of noun phrase (NP) movement are deleted from the surface structure representation of a sentence and, therefore, the moved NP lacks a theta role. As a result, a cognitive default strategy then assigns any NP lacking a theta role a default role according to its linear position in the sentence based on a “standard ” canonical order (Grodzinsky, 1995 a). This theory has faced multiple revisions (e. g., Hickok, Zurif, & Cansecogonzalez, 1993) and continues to confront challenges posed by recent published finding...|$|R

40|$|M 1 and M 2 {{macrophage}} phenotypes, which mediate proinflammatory and antiinflammatory functions, respectively, {{represent the}} extremes of immunoregulatory plasticity in the macrophage population. This plasticity can also result in intermediate macrophage states that support a balance between these opposing functions. In sepsis, M 1 macrophages can compensate for hyperinflammation by acquiring an M 2 -like immunosuppressed status that {{increases the risk of}} secondary infection and death. The M 1 to M 2 macrophage reprogramming that develops during LPS tolerance resembles the pathological antiinflammatory response to sepsis. Here, we determined that p 21 regulates macrophage reprogramming by shifting the balance between active p 65 -p 50 and inhibitory p 50 -p 50 NF-κB pathways. p 21 deficiency reduced the DNA-binding affinity of the p 50 -p 50 homodimer in LPS-primed and -rechallenged macrophages, impairing their ability to attenuate IFN-β production and acquire an M 2 -like hyporesponsive status. High p 21 levels in sepsis patients correlated with low IFN-β expression, and p 21 knockdown in human monocytes corroborated its role in IFN-β regulation. The data demonstrate that p 21 adjusts the equilibrium between p 65 -p 50 and p 50 -p 50 NF-κB pathways to mediate macrophage plasticity in LPS tolerance. Identifying p 21 -related pathways involved in monocyte reprogramming may lead to potential targets for sepsis treatment.

40|$|Zhaoling {{is one of}} {{the very}} few {{imperial}} mausolea that has received considerable attention in its 1, 400 -year history. This attention has largely been confined to general description and limited individual subjects. This dissertation launches an effort to comprehensively investigate Zhaoling in the context of the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural background of the early Tang, and by comparison with ancient Iran, the steppes and China. It examines Zhaoling 2 ̆ 7 s general layout, its architectural features, stone monuments and auxiliary burial complex. It also conducts a detailed study of the six stone horse reliefs. The study reveals that Zhaoling followed Chinese traditional concepts and replicated the capital city of Chang 2 ̆ 7 an and its palatial scheme. The ratio of auxiliary tomb occupants indicates that Zhaoling was built not as a royal graveyard, but rather a complex for holding a political entity. Auxiliary tombs were used as tools to extract loyalty from high officials, Chinese and non-Chinese, to form Taizong 2 ̆ 7 s “political family” for his political concept of tianxia weigong (empire is open to all). The erection of stone monuments of the six horses and fourteen officials, traced to Turkic custom, manifests another fulfillment of Taizong 2 ̆ 7 s political concept. The duality of Taizong 2 ̆ 7 s titles—the Chinese emperor and Heavenly Qaghan for western tribal states—brought integration into the design of Zhaoling, a blend of Chinese imperial mausoleum traditions with Turkic burial customs. An element-by-element study of the stone horse reliefs demonstrates that the development of an effective Chinese cavalry, initiated in northern China in 307 BC, necessitated a systematic importation of equestrian elements from the nomads on the Chinese border. The horse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mane,</b> tail, saddle, armor, bow and arrows, which show strong nomadic influences, can all be traced to ancient West Asian sources. The sculptural form of the six horse reliefs could also be inspired by Sasanian rock relief. The seeds receptive to interaction and assimilation of foreign elements were sown during the early dynastic period from pre-Qin into Sui. Emperor Taizong continued this course, expanded his political concept and made the early Tang a dualistic empire of international spirit. ...|$|R

Relaxation occurred after {{treatment of the}} mutants with either inhibitor. We detected {{no significant difference in}} relaxation between topA- and topA+ strains treated with coumermycin. This finding, together with previous observations, supports the idea that relaxation caused by coumermycin probably arises from the relaxing activity of gyrase itself.

40|$|In {{the aquatic}} ecosystem, mesozooplankton {{are the major}} {{secondary}} producers, which graze on phytoplankton and in turn are preyed on by carnivorous invertebrates such as jellyfish and planktivorous fish. Zooplankton are the main prey of two forage fish species, Menidia menidia (Atlantic silverside) and Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), in the Upper Pettaquamscutt River Estuary (UPR) and the Upper Point Judith Pond (UPJP), Rhode Island, USA. The zooplankton communities in the UPR and UPJP were previously shown to be quite different, especially in spring when these two species ripen for spawning. The zooplankton community at UPR is dominated by calanoid copepods, suggesting a rather clean environment, whereas that at UPJP is dominated by polychaete larvae, suggesting a somewhat degraded environment. The purpose {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} habitat quality, as expressed in the nutritional quality of the zooplankton, on the maternal provisioning for spawning and egg and larval quality. ^ I measured the proximate composition and essential fatty acids in the zooplankton, adult Menidia spp. eviscerated carcasses and their eggs to trace the biochemical compositions from prey to parent to offspring. I monitored weights of gonadal and somatic tissues and calculated the fraction of the caloric energy from the zooplankton that goes into the gonadal, liver and carcass tissues by measuring daily zooplankton caloric content consumption, and the caloric content of the tissues. Finally, I measured diameters of individual spawned eggs, percentage of eggs that hatched, total lengths of larvae at hatching and percentage of larvae that survived after 7 days. ^ This study was carried out in the springs of 2005, 2006 and 2007. In spring 2005 in UPJP, an unusually low abundance of Menidia spp. and high abundance of Cyanea capillata (lion 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mane</b> jellyfish) were recorded and appeared to be related, so only UPR data on Menidia spp. were available for that year. In 2006 and 2007, both UPR and UPJP had abundant Menidia spp., and in UPJP C. capillata abundance was low to non-existent. Zooplankton taxonomic composition in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in UPR was dominated by crustaceans and UPJP by polychaetes, as was previously seen in other studies. For proximate composition, significant differences were observed in lipid (but not protein or ash) content a) for zooplankton between estuaries, b) between Menidia spp., and c) between estuaries for each species. Significant differences were further observed in content of the total omega- 3, omega- 6 and omega- 9 fatty acids for zooplankton and for M. menidia gonads between estuaries. Based on laboratory experiments, the absorption efficiency of M. menidia and M. beryllina from UPR and UPJP ranged from 90 to 93...|$|R

Yet many more respondents, 31 % to be exact, claim to use email now and 10 % expect to use it by the end of 2002. It is, though, not yet part of their daily pattern of communication, at least for responding to Spore surveys. Most actually share the email address of a neighbour, colleague or friend, often on one of the free systems provided by Internet companies. This confirms the observation that Internet penetration in developing countries should not be measured by the number of email subscriptions since each one actually means perhaps ten other people.

This is a priority action area for CTA. In all, 84 women (6. 4 %) responded, nearly all by mail, whereas women account for 11 % of the mailing list. More than half hold positions where they make sure their Spore is put to wide use: in libraries, information centres and education, and leadership positions in some civil society groups. Where are you from? Of the six ACP regions, the most populous, West Africa, provided the most responses: 548, or 42 %. Here, Nigeria, followed by Benin and Togo, takes the <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> share. The large population, and widespread distribution, in Nigeria combine in a readership level of almost six people in 10, 000, above the average. Another <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> share is taken by Ethiopia, with a readership level of 5. 1 / 10, 000, due in part to widespread distribution amongst extension workers and Spore being one of the few English language publications available. Each country can take pride, or note, of the number of responses it returned, each with its special reasons. Some regions, such as the Caribbean, or sub-regions, are relatively well-catered for in agricultural publications. Other countries, such as South Africa or Zimbabwe, have emerging agricultural sectors which have yet to express their demand in full. The full picture of responses by country is shown in the large Table 1. How many are you? We estimate that there are at least 1, 089, 200 readers of Spore. Well over one million. This does not include the people who read articles taken from Spore and published in another newspaper, magazine or Website, or broadcast on radio or TV. We call those people secondary readers, and we cannot begin to calculate them. Primary readers are the people who touch their Spore (or someone else s), take it from a library shelf, receive a photocopy within their organisation, read it in a village centre, study it in their office, or listen to the words and study the pictures whilst it is read out in the hundreds of readers groups of which so many respondents have written to us. How do we calculate our readership? One survey question was how many people read your Spore? : for example, 149 respondents said that 5 people do, and 137 said that 50 or more do. We took all these replies; we excluded the clear errors and removed the fantastic (17, 000; 15, 000); we checked for evidence (many readers explained their own sums); and we rounded off. When someone wrote 5 we put 5, and about 10 or more than 10 became 11, because we added 10 %. In all, 1, 241 respondents answered this question (73 did not). The total number of readers for those 1, 241 was 33, 786. On average this means 27. 23 readers per copy. We multiplied this average by the estimated number of copies of Spore which are read each issue: 40, 000. And 40, 000 times 27. 23 = 1, 089, 200. And the 40, 000 copies? Well, at the time of our analysis, the Spore mailing list had 11, 703 institutions and 21, 442 individuals. Of these 33, 145 copies, most go to subscribers in ACP countries (30, 713). Others go to paying subscribers, some complimentary copies go to partner organisations, our correspondents in ACP countries, and the mass media. The delegations of the European Union in ACP countries, who operate their own mailing lists, receive 4, 200 copies. To this total of 37, 345, we added the 2, 750 copies which are distributed at seminars, study visits, fairs and conferences. We then rounded the total down to 40, 000. In addition, the World Wide Web editions have a growing readership. In June 2002, the Spore pages were being read by 14, 640 visitors each two months (the frequency of Spore). When you study Table 1, remember that what matters most is not the actual total, but how many copies of Spore are available to, amongst others, rural people in a country. All in all, Table 1 has enough data to make a great many calculations. We invite you to send us your ideas on how to expand Spore s outreach. Most of the 1, 314 responses were received by mail. Many were typed, or in computer files. More than half were eloquent hand-written texts with some, in good Spore reader tradition, extending to several pages. More than 400 photos, intricate [...] ...|$|R

40|$|It {{was pointed}} out in [P. L. <b>Lions,</b> G. Papanicolaou, <b>S.</b> Varadhan, Homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equation, {{unpublished}} preprint (1987) ] that, for first order Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations, homogenization starting with affine initial data implies homogenization for general uniformly continuous initial data. The argument makes use of some properties of the HJ semi-group, in particular, the finite speed of propagation. The last property is lost for viscous HJ equations. In this paper we prove the above mentioned implication in both viscous and non-viscous cases. Our proof relies on a variant of Evans's perturbed test function method. As an application, we show homogenization in the stationary ergodic setting for viscous and non-viscous HJ equations in one space dimension with non-convex Hamiltonians of specific form. The results are new in the viscous case. Comment: 22 pages We have slightly changed the title and generalized the 1 d homogenization results to a larger class of stationary ergodic Hamiltonian...|$|R
