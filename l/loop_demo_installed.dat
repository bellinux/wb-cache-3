We conclude that the OER-paradigm embedded in DEMO and the customer satisfaction orientation of Action Workflow lead to norms which resemble the ones required by internal control, but there are some important differences. We propose a framework for the normative analysis of workflow loops in which customer relations and agency relations are distinguished. Whereas most LAP approaches do not take agency relations explicitly into account, the extended workflow loop model allows us to analyze the effects of delegation on communicative structures. ...|$|R

40|$|The language/action {{perspective}} (LAP) as orginally {{introduced by}} Winograd and Flores has inspired several tools and information system design methodologies. The {{goal of this}} article is to make the communication norms underlying various LAP workflow <b>loop</b> models (<b>DEMO,</b> ActionWorkflow) explicit and to contrast them with the auditing norms of internal control. It appears that the communicative action paradigm embedded in DEMO and the customer satisfaction orientation of ActionWorkflow lead to norms which resemble the ones required by internal control, but there are some important differences. For that reason, we propose an extended workflow loop model that distinguishes between customer relations and agency relations. Whereas current LAP approaches do not take agency relations explicitly into account, the extended workflow loop model allows us to analyze the effects of delegation on communicative processes. A framework is offered for the normative analysis of workflows based on a number of formalized communication norms...|$|R

Optimally, such software should work across multiple microarray platforms, {{should be able to}} cope with data from different sources and should be easy to operate. Results We have developed a web-based software FISH Oracle to visualize data from multiple array CGH experiments in a genomic context. Its fast visualization engine and advanced web and database technology supports highly interactive use. FISH Oracle comes with a convenient data import mechanism, powerful search options for genomic elements (e. g. gene names or karyobands), quick navigation and zooming into interesting regions, and mechanisms to export the visualization into different high quality formats. These features make the software especially suitable for the needs of life scientists. Conclusions FISH Oracle offers a fast and easy to use visualization tool for array CGH and SNP array data. It allows for the identification of genomic regions representing minimal common changes based on data from one or more experiments. FISH Oracle will be instrumental to identify candidate onco and tumor suppressor genes based on the frequency and genomic position of DNA copy number changes. The FISH Oracle application and an <b>installed</b> <b>demo</b> web server are available at [URL]. </p...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{disposal}} is {{a controversial}} issue in many European countries: concerns about potential health effects and land value loss {{as well as}} the fulfillment of the European Landfill Directive and Waste Framework Directive have significantly changed the way waste should be managed. An appropriate management of municipal solid waste (MSW) may allow a significant enhancement of efficiency in resources use, by recovering both energy and materials from waste, otherwise landfilled, thus replacing fossil fuels and virgin materials with renewable sources. Separation and recovery of the biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste is encouraged as a mean to produce bioenergy. Therefore, if not source segregated, innovative waste refining technologies may provide potential solutions for separation of organic fraction and improved energy and materials recovery. This paper presents a comprehensive system study of a recently developed technology aimed to improve the MSW management in order to decrease the demand for new landfill space and, at the same time, contribute to the urban energy needs. As part of a wider Life Plus Project entitled MARSS (Material Advanced Recovery Sustainable Systems), funded by European Community in 2012, the environmental assessment of an innovative and enhanced mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) <b>demo</b> plant <b>installed</b> in Mertesdorf (Germany) was performed by means of the SimaPro 8. 0. 5 LCA software, utilizing ReCiPe (H) Midpoint method for the impact assessment. The plant under study is designed to concentrate the biodegradable part of MSW in the < 40 mm fraction, through a series of refining and recovery steps, to remove contaminants and obtain a suitable biomass fuel with a final marketable quality fulfilling the requirements for biomass power plants to generate urban decentralized production of heat and power (CHP). This study aims at understanding if and to what extent the MBT-MARSS plant is environmentally sound, by investigating environmental costs and benefits of replacing MSW landfilling and waste-to-energy disposal by means of boosted separation of biomass for energy generation in CHPs and other recoverable fractions (metals, plastic). Steps and/or components that can be further improved are also assessed. Sensitivity of impacts to assumptions regarding the source of replaced electricity was also tested. Results not only emphasize the novelty of a promising new technology, but also the extent of benefits that can be achieved depending on the actual power generation technique that is replaced by means of the energy recovered in the process. The quantitative evaluation of the MARSS technology shows that appropriate design and management of the MBT plant lead to substantial reduction of environmental impacts as well as material and energy resource savings, thus putting forward a technical solution suitable for those cities/countries where other solutions are still lacking or inappropriate or unfeasible...|$|R
