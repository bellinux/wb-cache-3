5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. <b>Low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, the Gibbs {{phenomenon}} is undesirable because it causes artifacts, namely clipping from the overshoot and undershoot, and ringing {{artifacts from the}} oscillations. In the case of low-pass filtering, these can be reduced or eliminated by using different <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|E
50|$|A DDC {{consists}} of three subcomponents: a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> (LPF), and a downsampler (which may {{be integrated into the}} <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter).</b>|$|R
50|$|One typical {{distortion}} {{that occurs}} during image and video capture or transmission applications is blur that {{is caused by}} a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> process. The introduced blur can be modeled using Gaussian <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Part of the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> {{giving rise}} to local field {{potentials}} is due to complex electrical properties of extracellular space. The fact that the extracellular space is not homogeneous, and composed of a complex aggregate of highly conductive fluids and low-conductive and capacitive membranes, can exert strong <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> properties. Ionic diffusion, which {{plays an important role}} in membrane potential variations, can also act as a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|R
25|$|Thus, using just {{truncation}} in {{the time}} domain, or equivalently <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> in the frequency domain, one can cut out any convex set in time–frequency space; just using time domain or frequency domain methods without fractional Fourier transforms only allow cutting out rectangles parallel to the axes.|$|E

5000|$|Despite being {{analog in}} their {{representation}} of individual signal voltage samples, these devices are discrete {{in the time}} domain and thus are limited by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; both the input and output signals are generally <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered.</b> The input must be <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> to avoid aliasing effects, while the output is <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> for reconstruction.

30|$|In {{our problem}} {{concerning}} the signal from nonuniform samples, distortion operator of G is a interpolator and a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter.</b> Nonuniform samples pass from an interpolator {{in order to}} uniform, and then, a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> is used to remove the high frequency of {{the output of the}} interpolator. The SNR of reconstructed signal is dependent on the order of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter.</b> the iterative method {{is a good idea to}} improve A/D performance without using a complicated filter.|$|R
40|$|An all-optical <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> {{utilizing}} cross-gain modulation (XGM) {{in fiber}} optical parametric amplifier (OPA) {{has been proposed}} and experimentally demonstrated. In this proposed <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> the pump, signal and a continuous-wave probe were launched in the highly-nonlinear fiber (HNLF) to introduce OPA and thereby XGM effects. Pump, signals and idlers were then being separated and then filtered. With suitable time delay being introduced into different optical paths, the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> was implemented, which was verified with the experimental results of pseudo-random signal. The timing waveforms of the filtered signal were shown, followed by the transfer function of the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter's</b> frequency response.

25|$|The {{receiver}} {{picks up}} the signal , which is then quadrature-mixed down to baseband using cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency. This also creates signals centered on , so <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are used to reject these. The baseband signals are then sampled and digitised using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and a forward FFT is used to convert back to the frequency domain.|$|E
25|$|High-pass and <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> {{are also}} used in digital image {{processing}} to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian blur to the dupe, inverting the colors, and blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E
25|$|The aim {{of image}} {{restoration}} is {{the removal of}} noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data {{in terms of the}} local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.|$|E

30|$|The <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> {{passes the}} lower {{components}} of the frequency of wind power. It shows that the wind power fluctuation decreases as the time constant of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> increases [14]. In order to improve the ability of power systems for integrating wind power, wind farm power output fluctuation is mitigated by an ES system with the control strategy of a flexible first-order <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> control strategy. And the wind power is flat after smoothing [15]. A flexible first-order <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> with an optimization of the time constant is developed to limit wind power fluctuation under restriction with smaller BESS capacity [16]. However, VLF has the defect in time delay due to its filtering properties, which is not conducive to online real-time control.|$|R
25|$|Polypropylene film {{capacitors}} {{meet the}} criteria for stability Class 1 capacitors, and have low electrical losses and nearly linear behavior over a very wide temperature and frequency range. They are used for oscillators and resonant circuits; for electronic filter applications with high quality factor (Q) such as high-pass filters, <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> and band-pass filters {{as well as for}} tuning circuits; for audio crossovers in loudspeakers; in sample and hold A/D converters and in peak voltage detectors. Tight capacitance tolerances are required for timing applications in signal lights or pulse width generators to control the speed of motors, PP film capacitors are also well-suited because of their very low leakage current.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} {{quantitative}} modeling of signaling networks {{to show that}} the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade — a highly-conserved signaling network in eukaryotes — can functions as a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter</b> by amplifying lowfrequency oscillations and attenuating high-frequency oscillations. This filtering function of the kinase cascade is in addition to other known functions such as being an ultrasensitive switch. We show how this <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> regulates downstream cellular functions and cellular physiology. We also show how the presence of scaffold proteins in the kinase cascade modifies the properties of the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter.</b> In particular, we find that the presence of scaffold proteins destroys the properties of the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtering,</b> and instead attenuate all oscillations. In particular, the higher the scaffold concentration, the greater the attenuation. 1...|$|R

500|$|Another feature {{peculiar}} to waveguide filters {{is that there}} is a definite frequency, the cutoff frequency, below which no transmission can take place. [...] This means that in theory <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> cannot be made in waveguides. [...] However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. [...] The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application. [...] The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. [...] Likewise, the guide wavelength (λg) and characteristic impedance (Z0) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode.|$|E
500|$|Thus, k {{will have}} units of impedance, that is, ohms. It is readily {{apparent}} {{that in order}} for k to be constant, Y must be the dual impedance of Z. A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of Zi as the size of the section (in terms of values of its components, such as inductances, capacitances, etc.) approaches zero, while keeping k at its initial value. Thus, k is the characteristic impedance, Z0, of the transmission line that would be formed by these infinitesimally small sections. It is also the image impedance of the section at resonance, in the case of band-pass filters, or at ω = 0 in the case of <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> [...] For example, the pictured low-pass half-section has ...|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. tour, Jackson {{expressed his}} ideas about possible improvements to digital audio {{in a conversation}} with Christof Heidelberger, a designer of digital audio electronics, and Betty Bennett, the president of Soundcraft's U.S. division. Jackson, Bennett and Heidelberger formed Apogee Electronics in December 1985 (announced in the 23 November issue of Billboard) and started investigating 44kHz digital audio circuits for audible problems. They found that [...] "textbook filters" [...] which were unnecessarily steep were protecting the CD player output from high levels of 20kHz signals, an exceedingly unlikely occurrence in music. Jackson determined that Apogee could improve the sound of CDs if the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> used in the recording process were made less steep, for less phase shift throughout the hearing range. The small company produced better anti-aliasing filters for recording equipment. Initially operating out of his garage, Jackson served as the company's owner and president, and his third wife Bennett headed up sales. They demonstrated their first product at the Audio Engineering Society's 81st convention held in Los Angeles in November 1986: the 944 Series low-dispersion, linear phase, active low-pass filter, intended to replace existing filters on multi-track digital tape recorders such as the Sony PCM-3324. After a slow start, the firm sold 30,000 of the filters: [...] "a great success." [...] The 944 earned a TEC Award in 1988, the first of many such awards for Apogee.|$|E

2500|$|... kind {{of special}} filter {{geometry}} is a series resonant choke or tuned choke filter. [...] Unlike the other filter geometries which are <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters,</b> a resonant choke filter is a band-stop filter: it is a parallel combination of choke and capacitor which resonates at {{the frequency of the}} ripple voltage, presenting a very high impedance to the ripple. [...] It may be followed by a shunt capacitor to complete the filter.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, filters {{employed}} in the frequency conversion processes of the transmitter and receiver all contribute to gain and phase variations across the system passband, especially near to band edges. [...] In particular, major contributors to overall non-linear phase characteristics are the <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> preceding the A/D converters, which are usually sharp-cut filters chosen to ensure maximum bandwidth while minimizing aliased noise. [...] The transient response characteristics of these filters contribute another (unwanted) source of time sidelobes.|$|E
2500|$|A high-pass (low-cut) and/or {{low-pass}} (high-cut) filter {{may also}} be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low frequency sound signals (termed infrasonic, or subsonic, a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can be hard on the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. [...] If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> function as end-cut filters. [...] A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or notch filter which includes a microprocessor to detect the onset of [...] feedback [...] "howls" [...] and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.|$|E
