5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key <b>logistics</b> <b>center</b> of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{publication}} presents {{subject matter}} {{connected with the}} role of seaports as integrated <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> in the development of sustainable distribution of goods in urban areas. Seaports as integrated <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> and multifunctional socio-economic spaces are the key components of the European and global transport system. They carry out the functions and services necessary for the efficiency of supply chains, and their final elements include the distribution of goods from the places of production to places of consumption. Seaports cover the transport, logistic, distribution and spatial functions, which influence city development, while <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> cover the distribution function. The development of seaports is a result of their multifunctionality and multimodality focused on the widening of the range of services, which allows them to meet different demands of the environment. Thus, seaports and <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> have become elements of urban transport systems included in the EU policy of sustainable development of transport. Particularly important here is the latest implementation of the objectives of the EU White Paper on the development of resource-efficient and low-carbon transport in ecological urban transport.

Latvia possesses unique possibilities of participation in the international transit. Nearly 90 percent of the turnover of Latvian ports and 75 percent of railway cargo is transit. Considering the importance of transit and related services in Latvia's national economy, the government pays additional attention to transit development. In accordance with “The Latvian Transport Development Strategy 2007 - 2013 ” the Latvian Government as a priority recognizes the development of high quality transport and logistics services in order to increase transit transportation volumes. Attraction on the Latvian transport network of the foreign trade cargoes is connected with construction of transport-logistical system on the basis of modernization of an existing transport infrastructure and introduction of logistical approaches of management in system of interaction of all participants of a chain of deliveries, on the basis of access equal in rights to the information about freight transport flows. It is identified that the creation of <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> is one of the main measures of the improvement of transport-logistical infrastructure in the country.
