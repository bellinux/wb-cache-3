50|$|The {{human voice}} {{consists}} of sound {{made by a}} human being using the vocal folds for talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, etc. The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.) Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx, and the articulators. The lung (the pump) must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds (this air pressure is the fuel of the voice). The vocal folds (vocal cords) are a vibrating valve that chops up the airflow from the lungs into audible pulses that form the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>sound</b> source. The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to ‘fine-tune’ pitch and tone. The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.) articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx {{and to some degree}} can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen it or weaken it as a sound source.|$|E

Therefore the knowledge of its constitution {{is the basis for}} the prevention and management of voice disorders. We used 10 samples from the middle third of vocal muscles obtained from autopsies of 6 male and 4 female subjects aged between 36 and 71 years. The samples were analyzed with BA-F 8 monoclonal antibody to slow type I fibers, and antimyosin HC monoclonal antibody and antimyosin fast clone MY- 32 antibody for types IIA, IIB, IIX, and neonatal fibers. We determined the distribution of the muscle fiber types and morphometric characteristics, evaluating the differences by sex and age group. The human vocal muscle presented a heterogeneous formation with a predominance of type II fibers at 51. 99 %, while type I fibers reached 48. 01 %; this difference was significant (p 0. 05). In conclusion, the human vocal muscle the fibers were predominantly type II fast...|$|E

40|$|The {{classification}} {{and description}} of a species' acoustic repertoire is critical {{to our understanding of}} broader behavioural patterns and provides data for future cross-species comparative studies. To date, our understanding of canid auditory communication remains limited as full acoustic repertoires have been compiled for only nine of 36 extant species. Dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) are apex predators in Australia, and while their ecology and life-history patterns have been extensively studied, their communication system remains poorly understood. Early studies noted four sound types, but whether this represented the dingoes' full range of <b>laryngeal</b> and nasal <b>sounds</b> was unknown. We aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively describe the full acoustic repertoire of dingoes. We identified nine discrete vocalisations (i. e., <b>laryngeal</b> <b>sounds)</b> and two nasal sounds. Of these nine vocalisations, five were previously identified as common to other canid species. This study also revealed that dingoes possess a graded acoustic communication system, where the gradual change in acoustic characteristics of discrete vocalisations was noted. Dingoes also uttered 'mixed sounds', a finding in concordance with previous studies of social canids. Additionally, we established an ethogram to further our understanding of the contexts in which dingo acoustic communication occurs. 27 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{functional}} importance of loud, low-pitched vocalizations in big cats {{of the genus}} Panthera, {{little is known about}} the physics and physiology of the mechanisms producing such calls. We investigated <b>laryngeal</b> <b>sound</b> production in the laboratory using an excised-larynx setup combined with sound-level measurements and pressure–flow instrumentation. The larynges of five tigers (three Siberian or Amur, one generic non-pedigreed tiger with Bengal ancestry and one Sumatran), which had died of natural causes, were provided by Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo over a five-year period. Anatomical investigation indicated the presence of both a rigid cartilaginous plate in the arytenoid portion of the glottis, and a vocal fold fused with a ventricular fold. Both of these features have been confusingly termed ‘vocal pads’ in the previous literature. We successfully induced phonation in all of these larynges. Our results showed that aerodynamic power in the glottis was of the order of 1. 0 W for all specimens, acoustic power radiated (without a vocal tract) was of the order of 0. 1 mW, and fundamental frequency ranged between 20 and 100 Hz when a lung pressure in the range of 0 – 2. 0 kPa was applied. The mean glottal airflow increased to the order of 1. 0 l s– 1 per 1. 0 kPa of pressure, which is predictable from scaling human and canine larynges by glottal length and vibrational amplitude. Phonation threshold pressure was remarkably low, on the order of 0. 3 kPa, which is lower than for human and canine larynges phonated without a vocal tract. Our results indicate that a vocal fold length approximately three times greater than that of humans is predictive of the low fundamental frequency, and the extraordinarily flat and broad medial surface of the vocal folds is predictive of the low phonation threshold pressure...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Physiological and phonetic {{studies suggest}} that, at {{moderate}} levels of epilaryngeal stricture, the ventricular folds impinge upon the vocal folds and influence their dynamical behavior, which {{is thought to}} be responsible for constricted <b>laryngeal</b> <b>sounds.</b> In this work, the authors examine this hypothesis through biomechanical modeling. Method: The dynamical response of a low-dimensional, lumped-element model of the vocal folds under the influence of vocal-ventricular fold coupling was evaluated. The model was assessed for F 0 and cover-mass phase difference. Case studies of simulations of different constricted phonation types and of glottal stop illustrate various additional aspects of model performance. Results: Simulated vocal-ventricular fold coupling lowers F 0 and perturbs the mucosal wave. It also appears to reinforce irregular patterns of oscillation, and it can enhance laryngeal closure in glottal stop production. Conclusion: The effects of simulated vocal-ventricular fold coupling are consistent with sounds, such as creaky voice, harsh voice, and glottal stop, that have been observed to involve epilaryngeal stricture and apparent contact between the vocal folds and ventricular folds. This supports the view that vocal-ventricular fold coupling is important in the vibratory dynamics of such sounds and, furthermore, suggests that these sounds may intrinsically require epilaryngeal strictur...|$|R

Wild tigers (Panthera tigris) are {{endangered}} with populations {{continuing to}} decline {{primarily due to}} humans. Acoustic communication research is a recommended enhancement to current tiger conservation efforts. Tiger acoustic communication research is extremely limited with a solitary study quantifying a single tiger call. This study investigated the acoustic characteristics and behavioural context of tiger vocalisations. Remote audio recordings of five captive Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) in two separate enclosures at Taronga Zoo, NSW Australia were obtained March-July 2014 and reviewed with sound analysis software. Tigers were most vocal between 0100 - 1100 hours. From peak vocalisation times, 547 high quality recordings of tiger vocalisations were separated into seven vocalisation types (‘moan’, ‘arf’, ‘mrr’, ‘chuff’, ‘growl’, ‘roar’, and ‘hiss’). Tiger experts provided suggested contexts and functions for these vocalisations. Classification of frequent <b>laryngeal</b> <b>sounds</b> including moan, arf, and mrr were verified with a multinomial logistic regression based on peak frequency (Hz), fundamental frequency (Hz) and duration (s) measurements. This research represents the first quantitative study of multiple tiger vocalisations. Descriptive literature on tiger communication lacks ‘mrr’ and ‘arf’ descriptions and acoustic characteristics of tiger vocalisations. Future {{research is needed to}} standardize vocalisation terms and further quantify the tiger vocal repertoire.

40|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that use highly {{developed}} laryngeal echolocation, a sensory mechanism based {{on the ability to}} emit <b>laryngeal</b> <b>sounds</b> and interpret the returning echoes to identify objects. Although this capability allows bats to orientate and hunt in complete darkness, endowing them with great survival advantages, the genetic bases underlying the evolution of bat echolocation are still largely unknown. Echolocation requires high-frequency hearing that in mammals is largely dependent on somatic electromotility of outer hair cells. Then, understanding the molecular evolution of outer hair cell genes might help to unravel the evolutionary history of echolocation. In this work, we analyzed the molecular evolution of two key outer hair cell genes: the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNQ 4 and CHRNA 10, the gene encoding the a 10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit. We reconstructed the phylogeny of bats based on KCNQ 4 and CHRNA 10 protein and nucleotide sequences. A phylogenetic tree built using KCNQ 4 amino acid sequences showed that two paraphyletic clades of laryngeal echolocating bats grouped together, with eight shared substitutions among particular lineages. In addition, our analyses indicated that two of these parallel substitutions, M 388 I and P 406 S, were probably fixed under positive selection and could have had a strong functional impact on KCNQ 4. Moreover, our results indicated that KCNQ 4 evolved under positive selection in the ancestral lineage leading to mammals, suggesting that this gene might hav...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{presents}} a previously unreported method of <b>laryngeal</b> vocal <b>sound</b> production that {{is capable of}} producing pitches even higher than the whistle register (M 3). Colloquially known as the glottal whistle (here referred to as M 4), this method has a wider range than M 3 and features frequent instances of biphonation, which is of interest for those involved with contemporary and improvised music. Pitch profile analyses of M 4 have found the majority of fundamental frequency (f 0) activity to be between 1 and 3 kHz, while the most frequently seen range was between 1000 to 1, 500 Hz. Remarkably, multiple singers were able to produce f 0 higher than the highest tone on the piano. (Keywords: glottal whistle, whistle register, M 3, voice science, high fundamental frequency...|$|R
40|$|A high {{diversity}} of mating calls is found among frogs. The calls of most species, however, are simple, {{in comparison to}} those of mammals and birds. In order {{to determine if the}} mechanics of the larynx could explain the simplicity of treefrog calls, the larynges of euthanized males were activated with airflow. <b>Laryngeal</b> airflow, <b>sound</b> frequency, and sound intensity showed a positive direct relationship with the driving air pressure. While the natural calls of the studied species exhibit minimal frequency modulation, their larynges produced about an octave of frequency modulation in response to varying pulmonary pressure. Natural advertisement calls are produced near the higher extreme of frequency obtained in the laboratory and at a slightly higher intensity (6 [*]dB). Natural calls also exhibit fewer harmonics than artificial ones, because the larynges were activated with the mouth of the animal open. The results revealed that treefrog larynges allow them to produce calls spanning a much greater range of frequencies than observed in nature; therefore, the simplicity of the calls is not due to a limited frequency range of laryngeal output. Low frequencies are produced at low intensities, however, and this could explain why treefrogs concentrate their calling at the high frequencies...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the functional morphology of the human voice producing system, we are in need of data on the vocal tract anatomy of other mammalian species. The larynges and vocal tracts of four species of Artiodactyla were investigated in combination with acoustic analyses of their respective calls. Different evolutionary specializations of laryngeal characters may lead to similar effects on sound production. In the investigated species, such specializations are: the elongation and mass increase of the vocal folds, the volume increase of the laryngeal vestibulum by an enlarged thyroid cartilage and the formation of laryngeal ventricles. Both the elongation of the vocal folds and the increase of the oscillating masses lower the fundamental frequency. The influence of an increased volume of the <b>laryngeal</b> vestibulum on <b>sound</b> production remains unclear.
