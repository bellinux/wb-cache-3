Three more of the gliders were destroyed by German anti-aircraft fire as they approached the landing zones, as their slow speed made them easy targets. The thirty-eight that remained <b>landed</b> successfully between 10:46 and 11:00, although a number of them suffered damage from anti-aircraft fire.

Of the eight Hamilcars that transported the M22 Locusts of 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, seven reached the landing zones intact but had problems when they <b>landed</b> due to anti-aircraft fire and smoke obscuring the area. Four <b>landed</b> safely, but the other three came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it <b>landed</b> and was flipped over onto its turret, which rendered it useless.
