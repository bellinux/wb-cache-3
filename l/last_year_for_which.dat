However, Jesus College oarsmen played an {{infrequent}} part in university rowing in the 19th century. No Jesus College student served on the OUBC committee between 1839 and 1899, the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> Sherwood gives records. Two students from the college (W.S.Thompson and E.W.Davies (cox)) were part of the losing Oxford crew in the second Oxford–Cambridge boat race in 1836. Between 1858 and 1899, seven others trialled, unsuccessfully, for places in the Oxford University crew. Since then, college representation in the Boat Race has been more frequent: M.L.Thomas and D.R.Glynne Jones (1952) and M.L. Thomas (President, 1953); Boris Mavra (1992, 1993 and 1995); the Canadian 2004 Olympic rowing silver medallist Barney Williams (2005 and 2006); and Brodie Buckland (2007).

50|$|Horner's {{paper in}} Part II of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London for 1819 was warmly and expansively welcomed by a {{reviewer}} {{in the issue}} of The Monthly Review: or, Literary Journal for April, 1820; in comparison, a technical paper by Charles Babbage is dismissed curtly in this review. However, the reviewer noted that another, similar method had also recently been published by the architect and mathematical expositor, Peter Nicholson. This theme is developed in a further review of some of Nicholson's books in the issue of The Monthly Review <b>for</b> December, 1820, <b>which</b> in turn ends with notice of {{the appearance of a}} booklet by Theophilus Holdred, from whom Nicholson acknowledges he obtained the gist of his approach in the first place, although claiming to have improved upon it. The sequence of reviews is concluded in the issue of The Monthly Review for September, 1821, with the reviewer concluding that whereas Holdred {{was the first person to}} discover a direct and general practical solution of numerical equations, he had not reduced it to its simplest form by the time of Horner's publication, and saying that had Holdred published forty years earlier when he first discovered his method, his contribution could be more easily recognized. The reviewer is exceptionally well-informed, even having sighted Horner's preparatory correspondence with Peter Barlow in 1818, seeking work of Budan. The Bodlean Library, Oxford has the Editor's annotated copy of The Monthly Review from which it is clear that the most active reviewer in mathematics in 1814 and 1815 (the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> this information has been published) was none other than Peter Barlow,one of the foremost specialists on approximation theory of the period, suggesting that it was Barlow, who wrote this sequence of reviews. As it also happened, Henry Atkinson, of Newcastle, devised a similar approximation scheme in 1809; he had consulted his fellow Geordie, Charles Hutton, another specialist and a senior colleague of Barlow at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, only to be advised that, while his work was publishable, it was unlikely to have much impact. J. R. Young, writing in the mid-1830s, concluded that Holdred's first method replicated Atkinson's while his improved method was only added to Holdred's booklet some months after its first appearance in 1820, when Horner's paper was already in circulation.|$|R
40|$|In a November 2012 {{report that}} {{received}} significant {{attention in the}} media, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that the United States will be nearly energy self-sufficient by the <b>year</b> 2035. Justifications <b>for</b> this claim include reports of declining oil consumption, the unlocking of natural gas resources through new technologies, and overall increases in U. S. energy production. As natural gas becomes more inexpensive and renewable energy sources continue to increase in usage, the energy mix in the United States (and other countries) is expected to change. The IEA estimates that 40 percent of world electricity generation was fueled by coal in 2011. Coal is the only major energy source <b>for</b> <b>which</b> the United States demonstrates a trade surplus. In 2011, the <b>last</b> calendar <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> data are available, the United States exported more than $ 16 billion worth of coal, while importing only slightly less than $ 3 billion in coal. Furthermore, coal is expected to remain {{one of the largest}} fuel sources in worldwide energy consumption {{for at least the next}} two decades. Second only to oil in meeting the energy needs of the world, coal generates more electricity for the United States and the world than any other single fuel.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the scale of and trends {{associated}} with the cost-of-illness of thyroid disease in Korea at 2 -year intervals during the <b>last</b> 10 <b>years</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> data are available. Methods: Cost-of-illness was estimated in terms of direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include direct medical costs due to hos-pitalization, outpatient and pharmacy sectors, transportation, and care-giver costs. Indirect costs include future income loss due to premature death and loss of productivity as a result of absence from work. Results: The cost-of-illness of thyroid disease in Korea was estimated at 224. 2 billion won in 2002, 303. 4 billion won in 2004, 400. 3 billion won in 2006, 570. 4 billion won in 2008, and 762. 2 billion won in 2010. For example, the cost-of-illness of thyroid disease in 2010 was 3. 4 times greater compared to 2002. The direct cost of the total cost-of-illness was 69. 7 %, <b>which</b> accounted <b>for</b> the highest proportion of costs. Cost-of-illness for individuals between the ages of 30 and 50 accounted for the greatest share of costs. Conclusion: The cost-of-illness of thyroid disease was relatively large in economically active age groups, and demonstrated a very rapid growth rate compared to other major diseases in Korea. Therefore, we suggest nationwide recognition of the impor-tance of prevention and management of thyroid disease and prioritization of the management of thyroid disease among current and future health promotion policies in Korea...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the rest of}} India, where it is the government that predominantly owns and manages ports, the Indian state of Gujarat has implemented various forms of port liberalization since the 1990 s.

Gujarat's economy has grown at an average of 10. 14 percent per year from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal <b>year</b> 2006, the <b>last</b> five <b>years</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> data are available. This is comparable with China's average growth rate since 1978, and is distinctly faster than the growth of the other Asian tigers in the 15 years before the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Gujarat has broken new ground with different forms of privatization, ranging from private provision of port services to completely private ownership of new ports. The process started in the 1980 s and gathered momentum rapidly after the central government in New Delhi enacted major economic reforms in the early 1990 s. Gujarat has taken advantage of a constitutional loophole to convert its minor ports into some of the biggest ports in the country, vastly improved the availability and efficiency of port infrastructure, and facilitated the development of industrial centers that otherwise would not have existed. Gujarat's port liberalization, along with its status as one of the economically freest states in India, should {{serve as a model for}} the rest of India and other developing countries, which can also benefit from the dynamic gains of port privatization...|$|R
40|$|The core {{rationale}} {{for this study}} arises {{from the fact that}} while day care provision is an expanding area within the Irish hospital system, the information currently available on utilisation levels and cost implications is limited and unsatisfactory.
