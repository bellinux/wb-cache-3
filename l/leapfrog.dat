Environmental <b>leapfrogging</b> could, therefore, contribute to development and environmental goals including climate mitigation objectives. This paper examines the prospects for environmental <b>leapfrogging</b> by reviewing the literature on technology <b>leapfrogging</b> and a set of four case studies. It shows that <b>leapfrogging</b> is possible, but that the key factors for success are different in each case. It is, therefore, not possible to generalise to a large degree. Trial-and-error learning needs to be accepted as part of <b>leapfrogging</b> strategies...|$|R

5|$|<b>LeapFrog</b> Enterprises {{released}} a Sonic X educational math game for its Leapster handheld game console; {{it was released}} in 2005 in North America and 2007 in Europe. The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced platform/action game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, {{each with its own}} math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.|$|E

A second strike by Young was {{disallowed}} for offside, and at half-time {{the score was}} 2–2. Straight after half-time Young scored again, and Francis Lee scored a fourth on 63 minutes. A late Newcastle goal set up a nervy finish, but City held on to win 4–3 and secure the title. The win was compounded by a 2–1 victory by Sunderland over Manchester United, giving City the title. Liverpool won one of their remaining games but lost the other, missing their chance to <b>leapfrog</b> United into second by one point.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant is a generalist feeder that eats insects. It is {{also known}} to eat seeds in rare circumstances. It is an active forager that hunts in pairs or, after the {{breeding}} season, small family groups. It has also been known to feed with mixed-species foraging flocks, although this behavior is abnormal. When this does occur, it is most frequently seen foraging with the thorn-tailed rayadito; flocks of thirty tufted tit-tyrants in these mixed-species foraging groups have been reported. Birds in pairs tend to feed <b>leapfrog</b> style and maintain constant visual contact with each other. This species feeds at all strata of its habitat from the understory to the canopy.|$|E

After losing the first set, and facing match point in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and <b>leapfrog</b> Roger Federer into {{second place in the}} rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which neither Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two. Murray briefly fell back to No. 3 in the world, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in Monte-Carlo, but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the Mutua Madrid Open.

5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to <b>leapfrog</b> {{existing}} units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.|$|E
5|$|With Graham {{gone and}} the quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University.

He was handsome and charismatic in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and <b>leapfrog</b> him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on the ladder. This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the ladder to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is China's {{transition}} to a sustainable and low-carbon energy system based predominantly on renewable electricity supply. The specific focus {{is the concept of}} <b>leapfrogging,</b> frequently proposed as an alternative development strategy for China and other large developing countries to bypass the historical energy-intensive and polluting stages of development of the already industrialised countries. The thesis poses the question whether <b>leapfrogging</b> in China's renewable electricity sector occurred in the period from 2005 to 2010 and what the future potential for <b>leapfrogging</b> is. The specific technology focus of the thesis is renewable electricity and to some lesser degree renewable energy for heating. In this context five main areas have been looked at in detail: decentralised renewable energy technologies for rural development, innovative capacity and development of China's emerging renewable energy companies, application of renewable electricity and electricity saving technologies in China's cities, application and use of renewable technologies for large-scale electricity generation and China's national energy system as a whole. Two main bodies of theory are used as a conceptual framework to support the analysis: socio-technical innovation systems and global environmental governance with a focus on multi-stakeholder partnerships. This multi-disciplinary approach is applied to identify and analyse the roles of domestic policies, socio-technical innovation and international cooperation partnerships for renewable electricity development. In this context the thesis specifically analyses the effectiveness of China's national and local policy frameworks in facilitating transition processes and supporting innovation for renewable electricity development. Furthermore, the contribution of international cooperation initiatives and partnerships to renewable electricity development and <b>leapfrogging</b> is analysed. The research results show that <b>leapfrogging</b> in China's renewable electricity development to date has occurred only in some selected cases. Environmental <b>leapfrogging,</b> a reduction of environmental impacts through renewable energies replacing fossil fuels, has not yet occurred. China's policy frameworks and national targets have been crucial for fast development of renewable electricity technologies in the period 2005 - 2010. Further refinements and more ambition would be required to facilitate <b>leapfrogging</b> as national development strategy. China's institutional framework for energy governance is still fragmented, which impacts on the effectiveness and implementation of policies. International partnerships for technology transfer, capacity building and policy dialogues are a key element in the {{transition to a}}n energy system based on renewables and are interlinked with China's national innovation system and support policies for renewable electricity. Despite China's rapid development of renewable electricity, further cooperation for technology transfer, specifically policy dialogues and capacity building, will be crucial in the future. On a conceptual level, the research shows that the concept and definitions of <b>leapfrogging</b> so far are still very vague and would require further research in order to develop the concept of <b>leapfrogging</b> into an analytical framework and practical guiding principle for developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The <b>leapfrogging</b> {{effect has}} been {{analysed}} {{in a model}} without capital. However, history has shown numerous cases in which countries lost economic leadership {{at the same time}} as they were exporting capital. This work focuses on the interaction between international capital flows, economic growth and the transmission of leadership. We show that capital mobility is at the heart of the adoption of new technologies. Malfunctioning international capital markets that prevent capital imports may delay adoption of the new technology by the lagging country and may postpone or even prevent <b>leapfrogging</b> that would have occurred in the case of free flows of capital. The model shows that capital mobility smooths passing the baton in the relay race for economic leadership.

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple open-economy AK model with {{collateral}} constraints {{that accounts for}} growth-reversal episodes, during which countries face abrupt changes in their growth rate that lead to either growth miracles or growth disasters. Absent commitment to investment by the borrowing country, imperfect contract enforcement leads to an informational lag such that the debt contracted upon today depends upon the past stock of capital. The no-commitment delay originates a history effect by which the richer a country {{has been in the}} past, the more it can borrow today. For (arbitrarily) small deviations from perfect contract enforcement, the history effect offsets the growth benefits from international borrowing and dampens growth, and it leads to <b>leapfrogging</b> in long-run levels. When large enough, the history effect originates growth reversals and we connect the latter to <b>leapfrogging.</b> Finally, we argue that the model accords with the reported evidence on growth disasters and growth accelerations. We also provide examples showing that <b>leapfrogging</b> and growth reversals may coexist, so that currently poor but fastgrowing countries experiencing sharp growth reversals may end up, in the long-run, significantly richer than currently rich but declining countries.
