5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all <b>leaf</b> <b>litter,</b> depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the <b>leaf</b> <b>litter</b> in a region. The <b>leaf</b> <b>litter</b> is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of the <b>leaf</b> <b>litter.</b> Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of <b>leaf</b> <b>litter.</b> It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn <b>leaf</b> <b>litter</b> in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of <b>leaf</b> <b>litter.</b> Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of <b>leaf</b> <b>litter)</b> at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Our aim was {{to examine}} {{linkages}} between mass loss, chemical transformation and CH 4 production during decomposition of <b>leaf</b> <b>litters</b> submerged under water. We hypothesised that (i) labile <b>leaf</b> <b>litters</b> would fuel a rapid, high rate of methane (CH 4) production and that recalcitrant litters would fuel long-lasting but lower emissions, (ii) <b>leaf</b> <b>litters</b> experiencing a greater alteration to chemical properties would stimulate increased CH 4 production and (iii) nitrogen (N) addition would increase CH 4 emissions. Materials and methods: Litters from six plant species were collected from a riparian ecosystem adjacent to Wyaralong Dam, located in Queensland, Australia, i. e., Lophostemon confertus, Cynodon dactylon, Heteropogon contortus, Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Chrysocephalum apiculatum and Imperata cylindrica. We evaluated the rate of mass loss and CH 4 emissions for 122 days of incubation in inundated microcosms with and without N addition. We quantified the chemical changes in the decomposing litters with 13 C-cross polarization and magic angle spinning (CPMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. Results and discussion: The inundation treatment of plant litters significantly affected decomposition rates. All litters decomposed in either inundated or aerobic microcosms were quite distinct {{with regard to the}} NMR spectra of their initial litters. N addition altered the NMR spectra under both inundation and aerobic conditions. The N treatment only marginally influenced the decomposition rates of I. cylindrica and C. apiculatum litters. The diurnal patterns of CH 4 production in the H. contortus, C. rotundifolia and C. apiculatum litters under inundation incubation could be expressed as one-humped curves, with the peak value dependent on litter species and N treatment. N addition stimulated CH 4 emission by C. rotundifolia and C. apiculatum litters and inhibited CH 4 emission from microcosms containing the litters of the three gramineous species, i. e., I. cylindrica, C. dactylon and H. contortus. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that labile <b>leaf</b> <b>litters</b> could fuel a rapid, high rate of CH 4 production and that recalcitrant litters fuelled a lower CH 4 emission. We did not find that <b>leaf</b> <b>litters</b> with altered chemical properties stimulated increased CH 4 production.

The aims {{of this study were}} to: (a) determine if species from different successional stages grown on soils with low and high nitrogen levels produce <b>leaf</b> and <b>litter</b> traits that decompose differently under identical conditions; and (b) assess which trait of living leaves best relates to litter quality and litter decomposability Methods The study was conducted on 17 herbaceous species representative of three stages of a Mediterranean successional sere of Southern France. Plants were grown in monocultures in a common garden under two nitrogen levels. To elucidate how different <b>leaf</b> traits affected <b>litter</b> decomposition a microcosm experiment was conducted to determine decomposability under standard conditions. Tests were also carried out to determine how successional stage and nitrogen supply affected functional traits of living leaves and how these traits then modified litter quality and subsequent litter decomposability.
