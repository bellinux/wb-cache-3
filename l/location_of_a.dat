5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying {{one night in}} 1823. Smith said that this angel {{revealed}} the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buried book made of golden plates, {{as well as other}} artifacts, including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had been hidden in a hill near his home. Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
5|$|At Omaha Beach, {{parts of}} the Mulberry harbour are still visible, {{and a few of}} the beach {{obstacles}} remain. A memorial to the American National Guard sits at the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former German strongpoint. Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer. A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the American airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.|$|E

5|$|Between Randville and {{the former}} {{community}} of Metropolitan, M-69 runs along the West Branch of the Sturgeon River through more hilly terrain. The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. The river and the road part ways until meeting again at Foster City. This is also the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|Castles remain highly popular attractions: in 2009 nearly 2.4million people {{visited the}} Tower of London, 1.2 million visited Edinburgh Castle, 559,000 visited Leeds Castle and 349,000 visited Dover Castle. Ireland, which {{for many years}} had not {{exploited}} the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began to encourage more tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a core part of the Irish tourist industry. British and Irish castles are today also {{closely linked to the}} international film industry, with tourist visits to castles now often involving not simply a visit to an historic site, but also a visit to the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> popular film.|$|E
5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open field of battle, with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were moved to another settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to be burned.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{the site}} of the {{recently}} closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new underground research facility, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive {{hydropower}} {{supported the}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large aluminum {{industry in the}} region, because its reduction from bauxite requires large amounts of electricity. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's aluminum and 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The commoditization {{of power in the}} early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's aluminum, and many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E

5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wood yard, {{used since}} the 1930s to prepare local willow for the {{production}} of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E
