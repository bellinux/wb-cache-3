5|$|Two {{days after}} Brierre's death, the detectives have made little {{progress}} on their lead about Kaja, the victim's abusive ex-boyfriend. Ballard and Gharty suggest they <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> at Felix Wilson and his son, Hal (Jeffrey Wright), because Brierre had sex {{before her death}} and knew few men socially besides them. Pembleton and Gee, who are both very respectful of Felix Wilson's contributions to the African American community, dismiss the suggestion; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample. The next day's Baltimore Sun runs {{a story about the}} investigation into Kaja, which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime. Ballard and Gharty question Hal, who denies having sex with Brierre after tough questions from Gharty. After the interview, Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected black family.|$|E

25|$|To <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport {{conducted}} {{another study}} in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as kupado). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.|$|E

500|$|James W. Springer of Northern Illinois University {{reviewed}} Arens' {{book for}} Anthropological Quarterly. He {{hoped that the}} book would in part have a positive legacy, in that it might make anthropologists <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> and critically at their source material, and praised its criticism of the claims regarding Aztec cannibalism. He nevertheless proclaimed that Arens was [...] "almost certainly wrong", making use of faulty evaluation methods and being excessively critical of any and all claims for cultural cannibalism, failing to prove dishonesty or prejudice on the behalf of Europeans who have claimed evidence for cultural cannibalism. He criticises both Arens' treatment of Staden's claims and his discussion of Iroquois cannibalism, claiming that Arens has neglected to mention many Native American first-hand testaments as to the cannibalistic nature of these people. Ultimately, he dismissively asserted that The Man-Eating Myth [...] "does not advance our knowledge of cannibalism." [...] More favourably, R.E. Downs of the University of New Hampshire reviewed the work for American Ethnologist. Noting that the book was [...] "provocative" [...] in its thesis, he {{felt that it was}} bound to raise many [...] "hackles", and that it would lead future anthropologists to challenge other long-standing beliefs about non-western [...] "primitive" [...] societies, such as that of widespread incest and promiscuity. [...] Ultimately, he remarked that while many anthropologists might dispute Arens' ideas, never again could they claim that the existence of cultural cannibalism was an undisputed fact.|$|E

2500|$|The {{behavior}} {{detailed in}} the report was almost universally condemned in the press.

ESPN columnist Gregg Easterbrook claimed that the Saints' behavior threatened the very integrity of the sport since high school and youth players have long emulated what they see in the NFL. He also claimed that NFL Network yanked its planned replay of the 2009 NFC Championship Game due to concern that fans might <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> for late hits that should have been called.|$|E

A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled (in a 1969 recording for the BBC) that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma, [...] "was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in 'very high-flown Burmese.'" [...] Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] "While in Burma, he {{acquired a}} moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there. [...] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like this– they are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites." [...] Later, he wrote that he felt guilty about his role in the work of empire and he [...] "began to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> at his own country and saw that England also had its oppressed..." ...|$|E
2500|$|By November 1941, many of {{the initial}} assembly-line {{challenges}} had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , {{as would be expected}} in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about [...] during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> at the tail.|$|E
