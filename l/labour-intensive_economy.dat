Firstly, it marked the beginning of a national effort to transform the country’s <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>economy</b> to one driven by middle-technology industris and a high-skilled labour force. Secondly, it signified the start of a plan by Singapore’s union movement to enhance the status of unionists.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis where global aggregate demand is struggling, countries occasionally get accused of weakening their currency to gain competitiveness. The method of weakening the currency to gain competitiveness is explained by the Marshall-Lerner condition, which states that a devaluation in the long-term will strengthen the balance of trade. But is this policy always rational? And if not, which economies should avoid it? This study investigates whether the structure of the export industry can explain the varying response in the balance of trade from a devaluation. The Johansen Procedure with a Vector Error Correction Model is used to estimate long-run price elasticities of demand for exports and imports. The countries chosen are among the 30 countries with the lowest rank of economic complexity based on its output, listed by the Observatory of Economic Complexity. The exports of these countries are consisting of a single or a few goods, which enables for investigating how individual industries respond to a devaluation. The hypothesis is that there are differences between labour- and capital-intensive economies and that the former should respond more positive to a devaluation than the latter. The results indicate that there is a pattern, to the opposite of the hypothesis, where the capital-intensive economies respond more positive to a devaluation than the <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>economies.</b> This could be misleading due to underlying factors that should be controlled for to be able to produce reliable estimates. The Marshall-Lerner condition is fulfilled for two countries, Gabon and Niger, out of nine in the final sample...|$|R
40|$|The rise of China as {{the world}} factory {{in the last few}} decades has been {{accompanied}} by a rapid expansion in vocational education. A growing number of youth from rural backgrounds now have the chance to receive post-compulsory education in vocational training schools. Using human capital theory as an analytical focus, this study examines their strong desire to acquire educational credentials and explores the stress and frustration they experience after finding out that graduates in vocational schools are sent to factories to work as cheap labourers. This article argues that reform of the educational system in post-reform China has channelled a large group of rural youth to vocational education without granting them enough chance of upward mobility. When China relies heavily on a <b>labour-intensive</b> manufacturing <b>economy</b> to secure its place in neoliberal globalization, most of the jobs available are regarded as 'undesirable', dead-end and low income. Returns of human capital investment among rural youth are not guaranteed. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the AWU ebbed and flowed in the subsequent years. The ten-month-long shearer's strike of 1956 was ended by a declaration of a State of Emergency by Labor Premier Vince Gair. While the proposed cuts to shearing rates were restored and the strike was generally seen as a victory for shearers, {{it was followed by}} a breakdown in the relationship between the AWU and the ALP, the expulsion of Gair from the ALP in April 1957 and his formation of the Queensland Labor Party. It later formed a coalition with the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Ted Walsh became the deputy leader of the QLP following the split, but by 1960 ran as an independent. His strong personal local following saw him retain his Bundaberg seat until his retirement in 1969. At the same time the management of the Central Branch of the AWU in Bundaberg rested with district secretary Gerry Goding from 1942, who is credited in healing the rift between the ALP and the AWU in later years. Goding guided the union membership through the transition from a <b>labour-intensive</b> agrarian <b>economy</b> to an increasingly diverse one, particularly after increased mechanisation in the sugar industry, and the merger of mill operations. New ventures evolved, including the production of sugar harvesting and other agricultural machinery, which led to a decline in AWU memberships as the role of canecutters diminished. However, there has been a growth in employment by local government undertaking sewerage and water supply schemes. Workers employed in these industries, and those employed in hospitals, water supply and forestry were members of the AWU. The union was involved in a number of major industrial issues during the 1960s including the Mt Isa mines disputes of 1961 and 1964 and the 1967 Collinsville power station construction dispute, in which the AWU recruited the contractors employed as strike breakers. The Mt Isa and Collinsville disputes continued the union's somewhat controversial reputation at that time.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{uses the}} “growth {{accounting}} ” methodology to estimate technological change, {{in an attempt}} to formulate an explanation of Russia’s economic decline and signs of recovery in the period 1992 - 1999 in relation to technological change. The results do show that, despite the general economic collapse during the 1990 s rooted in the very structure of the Soviet economy, the level of technology has practically remained unchanged which, in turn, prevented the Russian Economy from further deteriorating. Our empirical findings also show that the Russian economy tended to be a <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>economy</b> and this, possibly, explains the limited unemployment in the crisis period. We investigate these findings in relation to the type of class coalitions within Russian social formation. In this paper, we also examine the structural characteristics of the particular post-soviet form of socio-economic organization, in order to shed some light on the Russian economy’s evolution during the first years of transition...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{cultural}} implications {{associated with the}} intensive presence of foreign labour in the modern and young UAE, with special focus on the potential impact on the cultural particularities forming national identity.   To this end, the study examines the evolution and reality of multicultural society in the country, in conjunction with multiculturalism ideologies, policies and modes pursued elsewhere. The issue is addressed from contextual, conceptual, empirical and comparative perspectives; thus the study concludes that the de facto multiculturalism experienced in the UAE is rather a complex unique model that should be understood on its own merits.   Inter-related topics including globalization, civilisational dialogue and cultural engagement, as being inseparable from the subject matter, are thoroughly discussed, with relevance to UAE’s context. The key recommendation calls for the need for earnest steps to introduce limits to the scope of tolerance prescribed, implicitly or explicitly, under public policy {{in order to maintain}} the continuity of national identity, and consequently contributes to the sustainability of the prevalent co-existence amongst various cultural communities and groups in the country, in line with the open diversified <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>economy.</b> While the present thesis is expected to help initiate discussion on cultural diversity in the UAE, a number of fields have been identified for possible further research on the state of affairs, in particular, potential threats surrounding the local religious and traditional values.

40|$|The {{creative}} industries idea {{is better than}} even its original perpetrators might have imagined, judging from the original mapping documents. By throwing the heavy duty copyright industries into the same basket as public service broadcasting, the arts {{and a lot of}} not-for-profit activity (public goods) and commercial but non-copyright-based sectors (architecture, design, increasingly software), it really messed with the minds of economic and cultural traditionalists. And, perhaps unwittingly, it prepared the way for understanding the dynamics of contemporary cultural ‘prosumption’ or ‘playbour’ in an increasingly networked social and economic space. Because, despite the original ‘bullish’ launch of the {{creative industries}} concept being very much focused on a standard notion of exploitation of intellectual property, the heterogeneity of the groups classified has made bedfellows of emergent as well as established sectors, very different business models, and ‘pro’, ‘pro-am’, and ‘am’ cultures. This is unavoidable, as the creative economy lies across the fault lines of public and private goods. Navaretti and colleagues say it thus: The unifying framework is the characteristic of knowledge as a semi-public good, with non easily enforceable property rights. Its diffusion, in principle, is good for social well being, but bad for private returns. No one wants to invest in new knowledge, if the rents generated are not, at least partly, appropriable. Institutions that govern the creation and the diffusion of knowledge have invariably been molded by this tradeoff. (Navaretti et al 1998) Creative-industries activity is prototypical embodied knowledge. It has never been capable of capturing the full economic value of its productive activity and those who work in it do not work (at lest at the production end) with the expectation of capturing the full economic value of its productive activity. This is both the bane of creatives’ lives and the source of much meaning in those lives through the justification of such commitment in the face of less-than-optimal market value. Other (sometime complementary, sometimes oppositional) values are continually being embraced in this process. From {{the point of view of}} the policy or decision maker, the creative economy is a very <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>economy</b> and one that engages its participants intensely in the creation as much of symbolic value as of direct economic value (to them; it is often captured elsewhere in the ‘value chain’). As such, it is tailor-made for a recession (it soaks up labour, and produces human capital development outcomes partially independent of wages, fees and salaries). This is clearer now than it has ever been, with the explosion of user-generated content (UGC) : consumer co-creation, games fan bases, intense pro-am engagement outside the pure market-optimising cash nexus. The tensions generated by emergent markets or non-market activity which impact the viability of established markets will accelerate as markets crumble in recessionary times. Charles Leadbeater ([URL] has recently warned that the implementation of Digital Britain will accentuate UGC at the expense of the copyright industries. But we should remember that Korea’s great surge of digital literacy and growth in both the household and market sectors of the creative economy came on the back of many thousands thrown out of work by the Asian meltdown of the late 1990 s creating entrepreneurial start-ups backed by affordable and available broadband capacity. There has been a lot of effort spent documenting the explosion of UGC, but not a lot on what motivates such activity. There is the argument that the co-creative urge has always been with us, just limited by both technology and business models that don’t need or want it. There is also the fascinating debate between the ‘altruists’ and the ‘signallers’ (see Quiggin and Potts 2008). Altruists think that we are entering a higher order phase of social evolution where monetary incentive is becoming less important and creativity and community is more important for economic growth. Signallers think that there is a co-evolution of market and non-market drivers, and the players in the UGC space are signalling their skill and leadership for emergent or future labour markets. But there is space for both sets of motivations. Equally, it is important that we don’t celebrate the end of capitalism-as-we-know-it without attending to the co-evolution of markets in the light (or shadow, if you prefer) of UGC. As Leadbeater comments in We-Think (2008, p. 128), ‘between the pure, open and voluntary models at the one end of the spectrum and the classic closed corporation at the other, an enormous middle ground is opening up, where new hybrids will appear, mixing open and closed, public and private, community and corporation, collaboration and commerce. ’ ‘This middle ground’ he says, ‘will be extreme messy, confusing and creative’.   References Navaretti, G.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a systematic fieldwork approach in order to describe the ground condition of dense urban riverine settlements. The proposed approach supplements aerial-view acquired digital elevation models that are unable to describe the ground conditions that are obstructed by urban and vegetative canopies. After three years spent developing this approach, we can compare and identify synergies between three ground-view acquisition methods: an action-, digital single lens reflex (DSLR) -camera, and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). This paper consists of a two-part study, which uses the visual quality and accuracy of the data sets produced as criterion for appraisal. Although norms would suggest a hypothetical best operational workflow as an outcome of this paper, we instead argue that the identification of circumstances in which different methods are combined to complement the limitations of another is more beneficial. As such, through the appraisal of visual quality and accuracy obtained by the approaches described above we can draw better insights to make the most out of typically laborious fieldwork. Given the <b>labour-intensive</b> process, an <b>economy</b> of work is necessitated in order to capture the best description of landscape elements with the given equipment and time, allowing the greatest area of coverage...|$|R
