5|$|In 1894, King Leopold II and Great Britain {{signed the}} 1894 Anglo-Congolese treaty, which {{resulted}} in the exchange of a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of land on {{the eastern side of the}} Congo for the Lado Enclave, leased to King Leopold II for the duration of his reign. This aided the British in pursuing the Cape to Cairo railway, as well as preventing the French from achieving an east-west line by putting the Belgians in their path. With the Lado Enclave, King Leopold gained direct access to Rejaf, the last outpost on the navigable Nile. Although the outbreak of the Mahdist War (1881–1899) had disrupted trade up and down the Nile river, Leopold hoped to gain Rejaf in preparation for its reopening once the Mahdist threat had been addressed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{causeway}} onto Virginia Key is a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of bay front popular with windsurfers and sailors, called Hobie Beach after the Hobie Cats that set sail from the shore. It's {{also the only}} Miami-area beach that allows dogs. Nearby rest rooms and a great view of the curving shoreline make this an ideal place for tailgate parties.|$|E

25|$|The Mesoamerican {{book was}} {{typically}} written with brush and colored inks {{on a paper}} prepared from the inner bark of the ficus amacus. The book consisted of a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of the prepared bark, which was folded like a screenfold to define individual pages. The pages were often covered and protected by elaborately carved book boards. Some books were composed of square pages while others were composed of rectangular pages.|$|E
25|$|In Barnum Woods, NY102 {{becomes a}} mix of {{residential}} and commercial as the two-lane main street. At the junction with Vincent Road, NY102 leaves Barnum Woods and enters East Meadow.The route remains commercial and residential in nature, proceeding northeast past a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> mall near East Meadow Avenue. After passing a large complex of stores, NY102 intersects with NY24 (Hempstead Turnpike) once again in East Meadow. This T-intersection serves as the eastern terminus of NY102, whose right-of-way also ends.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1639, Francis Day {{secured the}} Grant by the Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka, Nayaka of Wandiwash, giving {{over to the}} East India Company a three-mile <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of land, a fishing village called Madraspatnam, copies of which were {{endorsed}} by Andrew Cogan, the Chief of the Masulipatam Factory, and are even now preserved. The Grant was {{for a period of}} two years and empowered the Company to build a fort and castle on about five square kilometres of its strip of land.|$|E

25|$|Malta {{has used}} excise stamps {{to pay for}} the tax on {{cigarettes}} since at least the 1930s. Early issues consisted of <b>long</b> <b>strips</b> which depicted the British coat of arms and were inscribed EXCISE DUTY in English and DAZJU in Maltese. A smaller design was issued for imported cigarettes. <b>Long</b> <b>strips</b> with a plain design without any ornamentation were introduced in the 1950s, while designs depicting a mural crown and a Maltese cross were issued after independence in 1964.|$|R
25|$|The land {{upon which}} the city was built, as well {{as much of the}} {{surrounding}} area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to sit back and watch the rolling surf.|$|E
25|$|Shaker Heights {{is a city}} in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2010 Census, {{the city}} {{population}} was 28,448. Shaker Heights is an inner-ring streetcar suburb of Cleveland, abutting {{the eastern edge of}} the city's limits. In July 1911, a petition by property owners was successful in detaching a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of land from the south of Cleveland Heights, to be named Shaker Village. In November 1911, the voters of Shaker Village formed Shaker Heights Village, which was incorporated in January 1912.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} distance, the most {{important}} climate-forming factor is the Atlantic Ocean through the atmospheric circulation of the Icelandic cyclone and the Azores anticyclone, which bring cool and rainy weather in summer and relatively mild weather with abundant snowfall in winter. The influence of the Mediterranean Sea is strongest in the southern parts of Bulgaria, mainly through the Mediterranean cyclones. Due to its small area, {{the influence of the}} Black Sea only affects a 30–40km <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> along the coastline, mainly in summer, when the daily breeze circulation is most pronounced.|$|E

25|$|Warren has a hilly topography, {{caused by}} two factors: the {{underlying}} geology, {{which consists of}} infolded metamorphic rock of the Leeuwin Complex and Archaean granite of the Albany-Fraser Orogen; and the dissection of rivers such as the Blackwood, Warren, Shannon and Frankland. The western extent of the region takes in the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge, an 80 kilometre (50mi) <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of coastal limestone {{on top of a}} ridge of granite, with an extensive cave system. There are a number of soil types, including hard setting loamy soil, lateritic soil, leached sandy soil and Holocene marine dunes.|$|E
25|$|The {{familiar}} Rig and furrow {{marks in}} the Buchans field are exceptionally well preserved {{due to the fact}} that heavy machinery was rarely used here. These marks represent the way in which earth was built along the centre of a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> or rig of land with drains or furrows at either side. This is how crops were grown up until the 17th century before enclosure with hedges and fences took place, as well as great social changes, improved farm machinery, etc., all of which altered the way in which fields were ploughed and managed (Blair 1976).|$|E
25|$|NY27A through Lindenhurst remains commercial, passing several ocean-side marinas on the {{eastbound}} {{side of the}} highway. At {{the intersection}} with the southern terminus of CR3 (South Wellwood Avenue), the name flips to East Montauk Highway as NY27A continues northeast through Lindenhurst. At Park Avenue, the route passes south of a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> mall along {{the north side of}} the roadway, crossing into the village of Babylon. Now in Babylon, the route switches back to West Montauk Highway once again, crossing an intersection with CR96 (Great East Neck Road) and through the Bergen Point Golf Course. At Beachwood Drive, the route bends further towards the northeast, becoming a residential street through Babylon.|$|E

The dataset was collected during Ron's career at JPL from the 1970 s through 2015. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in the 1970 s and 1980 s were recorded optically on <b>long</b> <b>strips</b> of film. SAR imagery was produced via an optical, holographic technique that resulted in <b>long</b> <b>strips</b> of film imagery...|$|R

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E
25|$|A loincloth {{may take}} three major forms. The first, and simplest, {{is simply a}} <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of {{material}} which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years. The ancient Hawaiian malo was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese fundoshi. Another form is usually called a cache-sexe: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. Egyptian king Tutankhamun (1341 BC – 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous linen loincloths of this style. An alternate form is more skirt-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several times and then fastened with a girdle.|$|E
25|$|The region also {{attracted}} many distant civilisations, with the Christian apostle St. Thomas having preached {{in the area}} between 52 and 70 AD. In 1522, the Portuguese built the São Tomé harbour, named after St. Thomas, {{on the site of}} today's port and the São Tomé church on the grave of Saint Thomas. The following years saw the arrival of other Europeans, namely, the Dutch arriving at Pulicat in 1613 and the British arriving in 1639. In 1639, the British East India Company bought a three-mile <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of land lying along the coast between the Cooum delta and the Egmore River encompassing an area of about five square kilometres from the Vijayanagara King Peda Venkata Rayalu. Soon obtaining permission from the regional ruler, Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, the British built a warehouse and factory on the site, and in 1940, the British expanded the occupation by building the Fort St. George and establishing a colony {{on the site of the}} future port of Madras.|$|E
50|$|Black ash {{is unique}} among all trees in North America {{in that it}} does not have fibers {{connecting}} the growth rings to each other. This is a useful property for basket makers. By pounding on the wood with a mallet, the weaker spring wood layer is crushed, allowing the tougher and darker summer wood layer to be peeled off in <b>long</b> <b>strips.</b> The <b>long</b> <b>strips</b> are trimmed, cleaned, and used in basket weaving. Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands also make bark baskets from black ash, traditionally used for berry-gathering.|$|R
25|$|Panoramas {{illustrated}} the tournament, using <b>long</b> <b>strips</b> of painted canvas wound round a tube and slowly unwound {{to give a}} view of the event. The venue was Edinburgh in 1839 or 1840.|$|R

25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E
25|$|After 1966, McWilliams's artworks and {{performances}} were often realized {{in collaboration with}} Moorman. He composed numerous works for her, including Ice Music (1972), in which she used a file, a saw, a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of plexiglass, and other tools to play a cello made of ice until it melted; Candy (1973), in which she and her instrument were covered with chocolate fudge while seated in a gallery whose floor was covered with Easter grass and jelly beans; and C. Moorman in Drag (1973), in which she wore a tuxedo and Pablo Casals mask while miming a performance of a Bach suite for solo cello. During the 1970s, the pieces he wrote for her became increasingly spectacular. In A Water Cello for Charlotte Moorman (1972), she and her cello were submerged in a tank of water pumped in from the Hudson River. Flying Cello (1974) had Moorman attempt {{to make contact with}} her cello as they swung on separate trapezes, and in Cambridge Special for Charlotte, Elephant, and Cello (1978) she rode through the streets of Cambridge on the back of an elephant while dressed as Cleopatra. In 2001, the cellist Joan Jeanrenaud, formerly of the Kronos Quartet, revived Ice Music for performances at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|The {{panorama}} {{books are}} not Potter's best efforts, but do demonstrate {{her ability to}} pare text and illustrations to essentials. [...] She worked best, though, with more complicated plots and characters, and with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. [...] Her inexperience with babies and very young children {{is evident in the}} original panorama format itself, for a <b>long</b> <b>strip</b> of paper and a wallet are likely to be mutilated by the very young. The story in its current standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit series is considered to provide very young children with an introduction to books in general and to the world of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
