5|$|The city is {{serviced}} by the LRT <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> and Line 2, which form the Manila Light Rail Transit System. Development of the railway system {{began in the}} 1970s under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, when <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> was built, making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia. These systems are currently undergoing a multibillion-dollar expansion. <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> runs {{along the length of}} Taft Avenue (N170/R-2) and Rizal Avenue (N150/R-9), and Line 2 runs along Claro M. Recto Avenue (N145/C-1) and Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard (N180/R-6) from Santa Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal.|$|E
5|$|Of the two LRTA lines, the LRT Line 2 {{prominently}} employs wrap {{advertising in}} its rolling stock. The LRT <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> have begun using wrap advertising as well initially for their second-generation trains, followed by their third-generation trains.|$|E
5|$|The first {{services}} {{started on}} <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> on 18 January 1900, the other services starting on 10 May that year, but, facing {{competition from the}} CTR, the tramway from Petit-Quevilly was curtailed, its terminus becoming Rue Léon-Malétra.|$|E

KSS extended the Vippetangen Line on 8 November 1905, and opened an extension from Homansbyen to Adamstuen on 24 September 1909. KSS and KES agreed to link their two networks, and a connecting line opened on 1 May 1912 between Homansbyen and Rosenborg station on KES's <b>Line</b> <b>1.</b> An {{extension of the}} Vestbanen Line to Skillebekk was finished on 2 November 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} <b>line</b> (<b>1</b> m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day before}} Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had {{demonstrated}} against {{the presence of the}} American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway <b>line</b> <b>1</b> was shut down).|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Metro {{operates}} in all fifteen boroughs of Oslo, {{as well as}} reaching a bit inside the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. There are five lines, numbered 1 through 5, each color-coded. They all pass through the Common Tunnel, serving eight branch lines. In addition two lines operate to the Ring Line. Two branches are served by two lines each: the Grorud branch is served by both lines 4 and 5, while the Lambertseter branch has full-time service by line 4 and limited service by <b>line</b> <b>1.</b>|$|E

5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} on <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> of the T-bane, and replaced the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they could operate on the Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily. The T2000 were taken out of service in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As on 31 March 2015, the Company has a {{total of}} 1306 coaches (220 trains). Apart from {{extensions}} on various existing lines, two new lines viz. Line 7 & 8 are proposed in Phase III. 486 coaches (81 six-car trains) being procured for these two new lines will have advance feature of Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Additional 258 Broad gauge (BG) coaches for <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> to 4 and 138 Standard Gauge (SG) coaches for Line 5 & 6 are proposed to be procured for augmentation/extensions to cater to the increased traffic. Resultantly, {{at the end of}} Phase III, there would be 2188 coaches (333 trains). Barring a few 4-car trains on Line 5, 93% of the trains would operate either in 6 car or 8 car configuration at the end of Phase III.|$|E
5|$|The Mass Rapid Transit, or MRT, is a {{rapid transit}} system forming the major {{component}} of the railway system in Singapore, spanning the entire city-state. The earliest section of the MRT, between Toa Payoh and Yio Chu Kang, opened on 7 November 1987, making it the second-oldest metro system in Southeast Asia, after Philippine's Manila Light Rail Transit System <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> that was established in 1984. The network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as {{the backbone of the}} public transport system in Singapore, with an average daily ridership of 3.031 million in 2015 (including the Light Rail Transit (LRT)), approximately 78% of the bus network's 3.891 million in the same period.|$|E

5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out-of-date rectifiers {{not being able to}} handle the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service on Line 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on <b>Line</b> <b>1,</b> on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. On Line 9, that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with lines}} , R3, and R4, the R1 (then simply {{numbered}} <b>line</b> <b>1)</b> started services in 1989 {{as one of}} the first lines of the Cercanías commuter rail system for Barcelona, known as Rodalies Barcelona. Originally, R1 services had two southern termini, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat and Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations. In 2005, all trains terminating at the airport moved their southern terminus to Molins de Rei. In the long-term future, it is projected that the R1 will take over the southern section of line R2, creating a major north–south axis that will extend along the coast of the Barcelona metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} into Vaughan, Highway407 encounters {{the first}} of three large interchanges with other 400-series highways in York Region. The Highway427 interchange is a four-level partial stack located just north of Steeles Avenue in Vaughan and adjacent to the 407 ETR Concession Company offices. The interchange features weaved ramps which connect to former Highway27, located just east. The route continues eastward, parallel and between Steeles Avenue and Highway7. It dives through the Humber River valley alongside a CN line and along the northern border of Thackeray Conservation Lands, passing beneath a CP line. After an interchange with Pine Valley Drive (York Regional Road57), the route becomes sandwiched between the industrial lands of the Pine Valley Business Park and the Emery Creek Corporate Park. A partial interchange with Weston Road (York Regional Road56) lies just west of the large four-level stack interchange with Highway400, the only of its kind in Ontario. An interchange with Jane Street (York Regional Road55) is interwoven into {{the east side of the}} Highway400 interchange, below which pass the completed tunnels of the currently under-construction future <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> Yonge–University subway line.|$|E

5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (<b>Line</b> <b>1)</b> with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
5|$|Power outages {{affected}} Metro Manila, {{and several}} billboards were damaged in the city, {{although there was}} minimal flooding in the capital. Adverse conditions caused the Manila Light Rail Transit System <b>Line</b> <b>1</b> to close for two hours, stranding hundreds. High winds knocked over a 12m (40ft) tree that killed five on Romblon Island. The rains brought the Magat Dam on Luzon to capacity. Landslides blocked a national highway in Nueva Ecija with debris and fallen trees, which were quickly cleared within a few days. On Mindanao, flash flooding from the outer periphery of the storm affected 18towns, killing 11people. In Maguindanao in the southern Philippines, flooding washed away 50houses, forcing over 2,000people to evacuate. Damage extended {{as far south as}} the Western Visayas. Across the Philippines, Imbudo damaged 62,314houses, of which about 20% were destroyed. Housing damage was estimated at P1.2billion (PHP, $22million USD), most of which in the Cagayan Valley. Overall damage in the country was estimated at about P4.7billion (PHP, $86million USD). Of the total, about P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD) was in agriculture damage. Imbudo killed 64people in the Philippines, mostly in Cagayan Valley, and injured another 154.|$|E
5|$|The {{current line}} scheme of the R1 started {{operating}} on , after {{the dismantling of}} the former route of the Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway through the Barcelona neighborhood of Poblenou. Earlier, all the commuter rail services coming from Mataró used the route through Poblenou, terminating at Estació de les Rodalies, a terminus station that was located adjacent to the still existing Estació de França. All services coming from Mataró were then rerouted through the Sagrera rail complex and the Meridiana Tunnel to access Barcelona, terminating at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations, depending on the station of origin. The services coming from Mataró terminated at the airport, whilst the services coming from north of Mataró terminated at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Since the new through line scheme offered more stops within Barcelona and better connections with the city's metro system, the line's ridership doubled. Throughout 1989, this new line scheme was incorporated as part of <b>line</b> <b>1</b> of Rodalies Barcelona (predecessor of the R1), the Cercanías commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year.|$|E
