5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> grow faster.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E
5|$|While no {{evidence}} indicates Diplodocus nesting habits, other sauropods, {{such as the}} titanosaurian Saltasaurus, {{have been associated with}} nesting sites. The titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that they may have laid their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits, each covered with vegetation. Diplodocus may have done the same. The documentary Walking with Dinosaurs portrayed a mother Diplodocus using an ovipositor to lay eggs, but it was pure speculation {{on the part of the}} documentary author. For Diplodocus and other sauropods, the size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals. This appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures, as <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> would require greater incubation time and thus would be at greater risk.|$|E

25|$|They are {{believed}} to be predators like their larger relatives, feeding on minuscule insects in their habitat. Their mating habits are unknown, except that they lay only a few relatively <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> at a time. Microwhip scorpions need a damp environment to survive, and they always hide from light, so they are commonly found in the moist earth under buried stones and rocks. They can be found on every continent, except in Arctic and Antarctic regions.|$|E
25|$|Copepods {{are tiny}} {{crustaceans}} which usually reproduce either by broadcast spawning or by sac spawning. Broadcasting copepods scatter their eggs into the water, but sac spawners {{lay their eggs}} into an ovigerous sac. Sac spawners spawn few but relatively <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> that develop slowly. By contrast, broadcast spawners spawn numerous small eggs that develop rapidly. However, the shorter hatch times that result from broadcasting are not short enough {{to compensate for the}} higher mortality compared to sac spawners. To produce a given number of hatched eggs, broadcasters must spawn more eggs than sac spawners.|$|E
25|$|Males also {{assess their}} partner's {{reproductive}} value and adjust their own {{investment in the}} brood according to their partner's condition. Females that lay larger and brighter eggs are in better condition and have greater reproductive value. Therefore, males tend to display higher attentiveness and parental care to larger eggs, since those eggs were produced by a female with apparent good genetic quality. Smaller, duller eggs garnered less paternal care. Female foot color is also observed {{as an indication of}} perceived female condition. In one experiment, the color of eggs was muted by researchers, it was found that males were willing to exercise similar care for both <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> and small eggs if his mate had brightly colored feet, whereas males paired with dull-footed females only incubated larger eggs. Interestingly, researchers also found that males did not increase their care when females exhibited both bright feet and high-quality offspring.|$|E

25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are sucked up {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|E

500|$|Metanephrops challengeri reaches sexual {{maturity}} {{at the age}} of 3–4 years, and may live up to 15 years in total. Females produce very <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> in small numbers; they are typically around [...] in diameter, and are blue in colour. The larvae hatch at the zoea stage (equivalent to the third zoea of the Northern Hemisphere species Nephrops norvegicus). The zoea larvae are [...] long, and possess all the appendages of the cephalothorax, including the pereiopods, which are used for swimming, but no pleopods (appendages of the abdomen). This larval stage lasts less than four days, before the young moult into the post-larval stage. The post-larva swims using its pleopods. The post-larva later moults into the adult form. Larvae are rarely seen in the wild, confirming that the development to the bottom-dwelling post-larva is rapid.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{reproductive}} habits of V. togata. A 2009 study, the first to focus on V. togata, conjectured that [...] "The high proportion of immature females obtained in the survey (76%) and the low proportion of mature females (10%) could indicate that the spawning season is finishing {{at the beginning of the}} autumn. Moreover, the wide size range of the sampled population, with a considerable number of small individuals (possibly only a few days old), suggests the existence of an extended reproduction period.". Analyzing the spermatophores and eggs of the captured specimens, the 2009 study found that V. togata had a low fecundity value, with females having <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> and males producing a low number of large spermatophores (the largest reported of any deep-sea member of the suborder Incirrina). Despite this, the species was still one of the most fecund among [...] "deep-sea octopods that inhabit the Southern Ocean".|$|E
500|$|It is {{anticipated}} {{that all the}} island's rainforests, excluding those in protected areas and the steepest eastern mountain slopes, will have been deforested by 2025. [...] Invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations. Following the 2014 discovery in Madagascar of the Asian common toad, a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in Australia since the 1930s, researchers warned the toad could [...] "wreak havoc on the country's unique fauna." [...] Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar's endemic species or driven them to extinction. The island's elephant birds, a family of endemic giant ratites, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably due to human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> for food. Numerous giant lemur species vanished {{with the arrival of}} human settlers to the island, while others became extinct {{over the course of the}} centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food. A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. By contrast, a previous study in 2008 had found only 38percent of lemur species were at risk of extinction.|$|E

2500|$|The eastern shovelnose stingaree {{feeds on}} small benthic organisms, {{primarily}} polychaete worms, and excavates pits {{in search of}} its prey. Females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and are aplacental viviparous like other stingray species. Once fertilized, the relatively <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> are retained in the uterus without developing for 58 months, after which the embryos emerge and rapidly develop to term {{over a period of}} 47 months. The embryos are at first sustained by internal and external yolk sacs; once the yolk supply is exhausted they are provided with nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") by the mother. Females bear one litter per year between late February and April, and ovulate a new batch of ova immediately afterward; the litter size is up to seven and increases with female size. The newborns measure [...] long; the newborn weight of [...] represents only a tenfold increase from the weight of the egg, the smallest such increase known from a live-bearing ray.

2500|$|Cephalopods are not {{broadcast}} spawners. During {{the process}} of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a [...] "male to female neck" [...] position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate {{the process of}} fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat {{to ensure the safety}} of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.|$|E
