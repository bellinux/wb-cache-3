40|$|I {{write this}} after re-reading Steven M Wise 2 ̆ 7 s Though the Heavens May Fall. My argument, if convincing, {{undermines}} {{the basis of}} the book. Probably the most famous decision in English law is that of Lord Mansfield in Somerset v. Stewart in 1772. It is very short and very dramatic; indeed, it is so rhetorical that much of what is vital is overlooked [...] as it was meant to be. Somerset was Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s slave in Virginia and was brought to England by his owner. Somerset travelled extensively in the service of his master, to Bristol and Edinburgh, for example. But two years after they left America, Somerset left Stewart. Stewart was incensed by Somerset 2 ̆ 7 s ingratitude and advertised for his return. Somerset was captured by slave-catchers and, on Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s orders, was put on the Ann and Mary bound for Jamaica [...] virtually a death sentence for Somerset. On request from Somerset 2 ̆ 7 s friends, Lord Mansfield issued a writ of habeas corpus to the ship 2 ̆ 7 s captain, and Somerset was removed from the ship and placed under the authority of the Court of King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench.</b> The case of Somerset v Stewart was heard in the Court of King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench</b> before Mansfield on 14 May 1772. Mansfield 2 ̆ 7 s judgment opens by stating: 2 ̆ 7 The question is, if the owner has a right to detain the slave, for the sending him over to be sold in Jamaica 2 ̆ 7. The issue as so expressed is a very narrow one. On the face of it, the issue is not whether Somerset is free or not. Even less is it a declaration {{that there can be no}} slaves in England. As Wise puts it, 2 ̆ 7 Somerset was Mansfield 2 ̆ 7 s minimum antislavery position 2 ̆ 7. His decision was understood as meaning that in his view there could be no slaves in England. But, in subsequent correspondence, Mansfield rote 2 ̆ 7 nothing more was then determined, that that there was no right in the master forcibly to take the salve and carry him abroad 2 ̆ 7. Again, he insisted that he had gone 2 ̆ 7 no further than to determine the master had no right to compel the slave to go into a foreign country 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|Artisanal mining {{is basic}} mining {{characterized}} by manually intensive work methods utilizing primitive or simple equipment conducted by individuals or small groups working either illegally, or when legally sanctioned, exploiting deposits {{too small to}} constitute a mineral resource. Artisanal mining in Rwanda and Burundi is further complicated in that the mining techniques applied are often inadequate, with low productivity and poor recoveries, workers are paid low wages, and owners are reluctant to reinvest in the operations. A consequence to this vicious circle is that working conditions are often poor, with miners operating under unsafe and/or unhealthy working conditions, with the additional problem of mining {{in a manner that}} is detrimental to the environment. Artisanal mining is commonly more dangerous than large-scale modern mining operations. Artisanal operations are generally subsistence activities, with the miners focusing more on immediate concerns than the long-term consequences of their activities. When miners have no other source of income, they will usually find ways to evade controls and carry on working. The introduction of machinery is expensive and is often far beyond the reach of most artisanal miners, and therefore there is a general tendency for workers to focus on labour-intensive and riskier mining methods. This paper proposes the introduction of small-scale mechanization with labour-intensive manual mining utilizing a bench mining approach in artisanal mines operating in central Africa. From the 1950 s to 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>bench</b> mining was successfully conducted in Burundi utilizing manual labour. In order to achieve a balance between job creation and project economics, a combination of manual and mechanized mining is proposed. Manual mining offers the benefit of local job creation, while providing good mining techniques such as minimizing mining loses and dilution. Through the introduction of mechanized loading and hauling, areas of high stripping ratios can be viably mined, thus increasing the resources that can be exploited. The use of a loader and tractor-trailer arrangement is proposed, thereby improving throughput, productivity, and workers safety, and reducing the impact on the environment...|$|R
40|$|IT is {{now more}} than thirty years since Justice Holmes in a {{brilliant}} and daring essay set on foot an inquiry which has revealed the remote beginnings of English equity. Equity and common law originated in one and the same procedure and existed for a long time, not only side by side, but quite undifferentiated from each other. Their origin {{is to be found in}} the system of royal justice which the genius of Henry II converted into the common law; but this royal justice was in the beginning as much outside of, or even antagonistic to, the ordinary judicial system of the Anglo-Norman state as was ever the later equity of the Chancellor. There was no equity as a separate body of law; for the king 2 ̆ 7 s justices felt themselves able to dispense such equity as justice require. In fact to speak of law and equity is to import into the twelfth and thirteenth centuries a modem distinction which is absent. Just as Bracton was inclined to see in the King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench</b> and Council but one court, so he regarded equity as an active, mitigating principle working in and through the administration of royal justice. The manner in which equity in this sense disappeared from the common law is become common knowledge. The jealousy of parliament, which may be but the reflection of the attitude of the community at large, the realization that the power to make new writs is a power to make new law, forced the writs into a closed cycle, and put an end to the free development of the common law. Without doubt the judges, who seem to become more conservative as ecclesiastics sit more rarely on the bench, furthered this restrictive movement. At all events the law became so rigid and inflexible, its practitioners were so absorbed in nice questions of form and pleading, that there was no longer room for equity. This has become the situation early in the fourteenth century; as a result a new field for the royal prerogative is found and equity is administered in the council from which in the next century the Court of Chancery breaks off...|$|R

It makes a modest change in the check-clearing system designed to speed the movement of checks from the depositary to the paying bank. It is anticipated that it will eventually lead to what is called 2 ̆ 2 electronic presentment, 2 ̆ 2 a process that may make the clearing of checks almost as swift as today 2 ̆ 7 s electronic payment systems. In this way, the Federal Reserve has given a kind of imprimatur to the checking system and added to its life. The checking system iseven with the Check 21 Act modification-the oldest, slowest, most expensive, and easily the most complex of the payment devices in use. Checking {{has its roots in}} the Middle Ages 2 where, along with the bill of exchange and early forms of promissory notes, checks were traded in the fourteenth century merchant fairs and litigated in the merchant 2 ̆ 2 pied-poudre 2 ̆ 2 courts. The device moved indoors in the eighteenth century largely through a series of cases before the King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench</b> and decided by stellar judges such as Lord John Mansfield. The law was codified in the English Bills of Exchange Act of 1882 and received in the United States in the first uniform law, the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law of 1895. Checks are currently governed by four different laws: Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.), Negotiable Instruments; U. C. C. Article 4, Bank Deposits and Collections; 12 C. F. R. pt 210 [hereinafter Regulation J], and 12 C. F. R. pt. 229 [hereinafter Regulation CC]. The interrelationship of these laws almost defies understanding. Starting about ten years ago, both the number and the volume of checks started to decline. 5 Simpler, cheaper, and faster payment devices like credit and debit cards, and electronic payments, including internet payments and the Automated Clearing House system, were gradually replacing checks as the payment systems of choice. It was widely anticipated that checks would simply phase out of use and become an ugly memory. Through the Check 21 Act, the Federal Reserve has stalled this evolution and given new life to the checking system...|$|R

40|$|THE RED MASS The Mass of the Holy Spirit, or Red Mass, was {{authored}} in 802 by Alcuin, an ecclesiastic at {{the court}} of Charlemagne. Initially, it {{was not associated with}} the Jaw and the judicature but was intended primarily to be a devotion to the Holy Spirit. It was not until the rise of the universities in the twelfth century, with their new professional law faculties, that the Red Mass tradition started. Between 1100 and 1130, the Law School at Bologna developed Into the leading center for legal studies under the direction of Irnerlus. It Is felt that he probably Instituted the practice of commencing each academic year with a Special Mass. In 1243, Pope Innocent IV created the Roman Rota, the highest court In the judicial system of the Catholic Church. It was the practice of the judges or 2 ̆ 2 advisors 2 ̆ 2 to invoke divine guidance and strength for their judicial duties by offering the Mass of the Holy Spirit. The practice spread throughout Europe. King Louis IX of France built LaSainte Chapelle in 1248 for the celebration o! such a Mass before the court terms commenced. This practice has continued, despite the destruction of the chapel in 1790 and its reconstruction under Louis· Philippe. However, now It Is celebrated In Saint-Germain I 2 ̆ 7 Auxerrols In Paris. The name 2 ̆ 2 Red Mass 2 ̆ 2 did not attach until the practice of celebrating the Mass of the Holy Spirit (before Michaelmas Term, September 29) started in England under the reign of Edward I in 1307. The twelve judges of the King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench,</b> clothed in their scarlet robes, Jn addition to the red vestments of the celebrant and augmented by the typically red robes of the academic doctors present, merited the new title.

40|$|Abstract. Water and {{nutrient}} flow were {{measured on a}} complex upland-peatland watershed in north central Minnesota. Annual water budgets for upland and peatland components and for the total watershed were developed. Nutrient input and output budgets were developed for each component on a seasonal basis, using net precipitation inputs, and an annual nutrient budget was developed for the entire watershed, using gross precipitation and total outputs. Both components evapotranspire water near potential rates. The upland converts 34 % of the water input to water yield, while the peatland (a bog in a lower topographic position) converts 55 % of its water input to water yield. The upland annually retains some N, P, K, and Ca from net precipitation, but passes through Mg and supplies Na in excess of inputs. The peatland is a nutrient trap retaining 36 - 60 % of all nutrient inputs annually. There are striking differences in the seasonal retention of nutrient forms between the upland and bog. The total watershed accumulates P and (apparently) N but loses more K, Ca, Mg, and Na than it receives in gross precipitation. Nutrient flow is interpreted {{for the design of}} nutrient-added technologies (fertilization and sewage treatment) and a <b>s</b> a <b>bench</b> mark for nutrient-depleted technology (whole-tree harvesting).

In that year, President John F. Kennedy appointed Reynaldo G. Garza, to the U. <b>S.</b> federal <b>bench</b> as a district court judge. Judge Garza hoped that by becoming an 2 ̆ 2 effective jurist 2 ̆ 2 he would quell any scrutiny over his appointment and, moreover, 2 ̆ 2 encourage [the] appointment of other qualified Mexican Americans to the federal bench. 2 ̆ 2 Judge Garza was the only Latino appointed to the federal bench until 1979 when President Jimmy Carter appointed several Latinos to the bench, as well as, appointing Judge Garza to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Latino community lobbied for and persistently requested that a Latino Supreme Court Justice be appointed for many years. When President Bill Clinton was elected they believed he would appoint a Latino to the highest court. They were, however, sorely disappointed. In 2009, President Barack Obama historically appointed the first Latina to the U. S. Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor. A lack of Latina and Latino judges exists {{at all levels of}} the judiciary. This article introduces the reader to Latina and Latino judges, serving at the city, state and federal level. The author had the honor of interviewing eighteen judges, including Hon. Sonia Sotomayor (she was a Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge at the time) and presents the interviews in the first part of the article. In this section, the judges detail their journeys to the bench. The article next details the history of Latina and Latino judges in the U. S. The article also discusses the appointment process to the federal bench and details the importance of having and keeping the 2 ̆ 2 merit system 2 ̆ 2 also known as the 2 ̆ 2 Missouri Plan 2 ̆ 2 to select judges to state court appointments. Ultimately, sharing their stories, the judges demonstrate the importance of having a diverse bench and discuss the necessary steps to increase the presence of Latinas and Latinos on the bench...|$|R
40|$|In 1662, in The Case of Thomas Tong and Others, which {{involved}} charges of treason against several defendants, the judges of the King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench</b> conferred on a crucial {{set of points}} of procedure. As reported {{by one of the}} judges, Sir John Kelyng, the judges agreed unanimously that a pretrial confession made to the authorities was evidence against the Party himself who made the Confession, and indeed, if adequately proved could support a conviction of that party without additional witnesses to the treason itself. But [...] again unanimously, and quite definitively [...] the judges also agreed that the confession cannot be made use of as evidence against any others whom on his Examination he confessed to be in the Treason. In 1791, the United States of America amended its new Constitution to provide, also in rather simple terms, that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him. In 1999, the United States Supreme Court faced another capital case, this one for murder, in Lilly v. Virginia. The critical evidence in Lilly was an accomplice 2 ̆ 7 s pretrial confession to the authorities: One Mark Lilly had given a statement to the police in which he identified his brother Benjamin, the defendant, as the triggerman in the murder, which was part of a crime spree in which both brothers and a third man had participated. Although Mark did not testify at Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s trial, the trial court admitted his pretrial statement, and Benjamin was convicted. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the conviction. The United States Supreme Court was split on admissibility of Mark’s statement. Four Justices B the Chief Justice joined by Justices O 2 ̆ 7 Connor and Kennedy and, in substantial part, by Justice Thomas B were not satisfied that the Virginia courts had acted properly in allowing Mark 2 ̆ 7 s statement into evidence, but were also not sure that those courts had violated Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s confrontation right. They would have remanded the case to the Virginia courts for a more detailed analysis of the facts. Five Justices, however, concluded that admitting the confession violated Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s rights. A plurality of four, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, reached this result only after an extensive analysis, in accordance with prevailing confrontation doctrine, of the reliability of the statement. One of the four, Justice Breyer, raised serious doubts about that doctrine, however, and emphasized that the door was open for a much different approach to confrontation. Only Justice Scalia, who had joined an earlier attempt by Justice Thomas to reconceptualize confrontation theory, saw the case in simple, Tong-like terms, characterizing the admission of Mark 2 ̆ 7 s statement in a one-paragraph opinion as a paradigmatic Confrontation Clause violation. 2 ̆ 2 This is not, in my view, a happy story of the progress of human liberty over the last three and a half centuries. I believe the Tong court had a clearer conception of what the confrontation right means – and meant even then, long before the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution expressed it – than does most of the current Court. The right, one of the great glories of the Anglo-American system of Friedman: Lilly v. Virginia Glimmers of Hope for the Confrontation Clause? 1 adjudication, expresses the conditions under which testimonial statements must be given {{if they are to be}} acceptable proof against a criminal defendant. Recent Supreme Court doctrine has so deeply enshrouded the right in the mysteries of hearsay law that it has been all but lost. But Lilly also gives reason for hope, for Justices Scalia, Breyer, and Thomas have indicated that they are willing to think anew about what the confrontation right means and how it should be applied. In the first portion of this brief essay I will discuss Lilly against the backdrop of prevailing confrontation doctrine. I will focus on the opinions of Justices Stevens and Chief Justice Rehnquist, which purported to apply this doctrine, and I will argue that it is inadequate. In the second part of the essay, I will argue that the opinions of Justices Breyer and Scalia point the way to a sounder conception of the confrontation right: Lilly was as clear-cut as Justice Scalia made it seem, as becomes apparent under the type of approach for which Justice Breyer indicated sympathy. My own preference for such an approach will not surprise anyone familiar with the amicus brief, cited by Justice Breyer, that two co-authors and I submitted on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union...|$|R

That issue highlights the achievements and contributions of African-American lawyers in Nevada in honor of the 51 st anniversary of the first African American (Charles L. Kellar) passing the Nevada state bar examination, the 48 th anniversary of the first two African Americans admitted to the state bar of Nevada (Earle W.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine if}} the neoclassical grisaille paintings by K. A. Senff in the rotunda of the Old Anatomical Theatre still existed and to what extent. At the same time, a study of the historical furniture was also conducted. As a result it can be confirmed that the paintings on the walls or ceilings have not survived and the assumption that they were covered with lime plaster {{at some point in time}} has been disproved. The greater part of the room is covered with secondary plaster, which is confirmed by the polychromic plaster fragment that was finished earlier and found in the upper part of the wall, partially covered by the current coved ceiling. The previous research also assumed that the current plaster coat was secondary. And the fact that the current ceiling with the mirrored vault is secondary was also confirmed. Based on the original plaster fragment that was found, it can be assumed that the original finishing did not include the niches in the upper part of the walls, where it has been assumed that the paintings were located. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to ascertain where the paintings were located and how they were executed. Whether the rotunda’s interior was initially finished in a dark, almost black, shade, or was this true only of the upper part of the room; how the paintings in grey tones related to this and how extensive they were unfortunately remain a secret hidden in the obscurity of history. Questions are also raised by the fact that Krause’s notes are the only primary sources to provide information about the paintings. One would expect to find other indications of such large-scale and exceptional work (Senff is not known to have created any other monumental paintings) in the archival materials (for instance, in Senff’s own materials). It is still unclear why the initial plaster coat was totally removed and a new coat applied, especially if we consider that it was covered with paintings. Although these large-scale renovations can be associated with the period between 1856 and 1860 (architect K. Rathaus), when the rotunda’s interior was rebuilt and the entire anatomical theatre was expanded, questions are raised by the fact that the current secondary plaster coat has an unexpectedly small number of finishing coats for such long period of time. Since, the only surviving plaster fragment that presumably dates back to the Krause era is an extremely valuable historical document and forms the basis for future research, it should be exhibited in the room when the interior renovation is completed. As a result of the research conducted on the finishing coats of the historical furniture, it turned out that the oldest piece of furniture in the current interior is probably the rostrum. However whether or not it dates back to the time when the rotunda was built is still an open question. In the future, its original polychromy should be revealed and exhibited when the planned interior finishing is completed. Based on the current research, the benches, demonstration table and central section of the wall cabinet can be associated with the reconstruction of the anatomical theatre in the second half of the 1850 <b>s.</b> The <b>benches</b> and rostrum have been altered thereafter as needed. The floor is the only surviving part of the rotunda’s interior finishing that can definitely be dated back to the Krause era and it should be preserved during the renovation and thereafter exhibite...|$|R
