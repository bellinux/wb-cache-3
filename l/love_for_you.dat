[...] "The {{long years of}} fidelity rewarded at last" [...] was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that [...] "the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul." [...] The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: [...] "I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my <b>love</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too."

[...] Lacey added, [...] "Houston has a silky, rich, vibrant voice that moves between steely edges, or curls sensuously around the notes." [...] Los Angeles Times complimented Houston on her excellent vocal ability, writing, [...] "neither the frequently listless arrangements nor the sometimes mediocre material of this debut LP hides the fact that Houston is a singer with enormous power and potential" [...] on their reviews for 1985's releases.|$|E

In April 2004, without a major record deal, the singer found [...] "after some research, that adding a CD to a book, such as those found in language-teaching books, would be a {{possible}} alternative." [...] She thus released a photo book called Tsuyoi Kizuna that included a CD single, published by Tokyo-based Bungei Shunju. The photobook went to sell over 150,000 copies despite the low promotion, reaching the No. 1 place of best-selling non-fiction books in Japan. In August of the same year, she released another single titled [...] "Forever Love", this time on her own independent label Amity. The release sold quite well for an independent record, reaching number 21 on the Oricon chart and number 1 in Oricon's Indies Singles Chart.
