5|$|In Olympic National Forest in Washington state, a {{group of}} <b>loggers</b> flee through the woods, trying to escape from an unseen force. They are {{eventually}} killed by a large swarm of small glowing green insects.|$|E
5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing <b>loggers,</b> telling her that another group of <b>loggers</b> {{disappeared}} in the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of security for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging from a tree.|$|E

40|$|Lightning {{activity}} {{correlates with}} {{the formation of}} thunderclouds which increase the atmospheric electric field (AEF) between the cloud and the earth. Observations of the development of the AEF will allow the prediction of lightning activities close to a particular location. In research and development, the data <b>logger</b> plays an important role to observe and collect data from AEF sensors. The data <b>logger</b> must be reliable and effective. High investment costs are involved in acquiring a data <b>logger,</b> and choosing a suitable data <b>logger</b> is not easy. Institut Voltan dan Arus Tinggi (IVAT) is develeloping AEF sensor. Along with that sensor development a data <b>logger</b> development is also required. In this paper, a mobile data <b>logger</b> is developed by using Arduino-Uno. This mobile data <b>logger</b> is equipped with a GPS module, which provides accurate positioning in the collection of data. Laboratory and field tests were carried out to observe the performance of the mobile data <b>logger</b> system. The results showed that the developed data <b>logger</b> works properly...|$|R
5|$|Missoula, often {{considered}} the cultural center of Montana, is {{the location of}} the state's first university, and an eclectic mix of <b>loggers,</b> hippies, college students, sports fans, and retirees.

5|$|Originally, the Spruce Production Division was {{authorized}} to induct 10,317troops, including both officers and enlisted men. The Spruce Production Division quickly recruited several thousand experienced <b>loggers</b> and mill workers, {{many of whom}} were above the military draft age of 40. In May 1918, the division {{was authorized}} to grow to 28,825personnel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Loggers</b> felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could not {{keep pace with the}} rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E

3000|$|In {{cases where}} the data <b>logger</b> gets installed, or {{upgraded}} to a newer device, we performed a mutual authentication between the data <b>logger</b> and the LAU server. At this moment, if it gets installed at a new observing point, then the LAU server and the data <b>logger</b> interchange the key offline. In addition, the data <b>logger</b> performs an encrypted transmission after it creates the interchanged key with its MAC Address, IP Address, and a generated random number. The LAU server categorizes the MAC addresses and serial numbers of the data <b>logger</b> in order to manage them; generating r 2 encrypts it to E_k([...] r 1 ∥r 2) with r 1 to transmit it to the data <b>logger.</b> The data <b>logger</b> decrypts {{the information from the}} LAU server and it identifies r 1 and encrypts E_k([...] r 2) to transmit it to the LAU server. Finally, the LAU server finishes the mutual authentication by performing D_k (E_k([...] r 2)) and checking the r 2 value.|$|R

Initially suspecting eco-terrorism, the agents find themselves trapped by a seemingly ancient menace lurking in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on a site}} long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for <b>loggers,</b> boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were <b>loggers</b> in the area.|$|E

40|$|A <b>logger</b> in {{the cloud}} capable of keeping a secure, time-synchronized and {{tamper-evident}} log of medical device and patient information allows efficient forensic analysis in cases of adverse events or attacks on interoperable medical devices. A secure <b>logger</b> as such must meet requirements of confidentiality and integrity of message logs and provide tamper-detection and tamper-evidence. In this paper, we propose a design for such a cloud-based secure <b>logger</b> using the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The proposed <b>logger</b> receives medical device information from a dongle attached to a medical device. The <b>logger</b> relies on SGX, TPM and standard encryption to maintain a secure communication channel even on an untrusted network and operating system. We also show that the <b>logger</b> is resilient against different kinds of attacks such as Replay attacks, Injection attacks and Eavesdropping attacks...|$|R

The background of this development is the problems encountered in making a data <b>logger,</b> which must meet the following criteria: able to read data one or more sensors, able to store the data, able to be operated for a long time, even if placed in an area that has no electricity supply. In addition, the data that stored in the data <b>logger</b> should be loaded and displayed on a computer without having to stop the operation of the data <b>logger.</b> In this study, the data <b>logger</b> that meets these criteria has been developed using Seeeduino Stalker hardware and using Processing software for the data visualization...|$|R
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets {{is seen as a}} good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the <b>loggers</b> and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E

When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and thatch hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, {{near the edge of}} the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by <b>loggers,</b> palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven's economy, {{from the}} city's {{founding}} in 1833 {{until the end}} of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. <b>Loggers</b> used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a {{modeling and simulation}} of a Microcontroller-Based Solar Data <b>Logger</b> System. The Data <b>Logger</b> System is proposed to measures and records the data at a certain logging intervals. This paper describes how Data <b>Logger</b> is used to collect readings using sensors such as photodiode. These sensors could be measured industrial parameter which is solar radiation. When a data <b>logger</b> is powered, the microcontroller AT 89 C 51 is designed to get instruction from the operating system that is loaded in the data <b>logger</b> memory. This microcontroller is a single chip that control based on system software design using Proteus and KeilC. At the same time, data from the measurement will be display on LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). This system displayed and captured the real time data in the LCD and stored in 32 kByte of non-volatile memory. The prototype of Data <b>Logger</b> System was successful implemented and tested through simulation using Proteus Virtual System Modeller (VSM) software...|$|R
40|$|The Lane-Wells Road <b>Logger</b> was {{utilized}} primarily {{to determine the}} feasibility of employing such a device for moisture and density control in Iowa highway construction. A secondary objective {{was the use of}} the Road <b>Logger</b> to obtain information concerning moisture content and density during and after construction. Correlation studies with conventional test results required {{a small portion of the}} lease period. Practically all phases of construction and most materials utilized in base and surface courses were surveyed. Results of this study were good, in general, with the Road <b>Logger</b> indicating dry density slightly higher and the moisture content slightly lower than conventional results in most instances. Economic feasibility seemed to pose the greatest problem for the acceptance of the Road <b>Logger</b> as a standard compaction control device. It would appear from the findings of this study that probably only large projects, or several smaller contracts tested simultaneously, could justify the expense of the <b>Logger.</b> A total of about 128 miles were surveyed with the <b>Logger</b> during the lease period. Approximately 16 days of downtime due to minor breakdowns were recorded. Inclement weather forcing construction delays resulted in several idle days in which the <b>Logger's</b> full capabilities were not realized...|$|R

5|$|The Spruce Production Division was {{a unit of}} the United States Army {{that was}} {{established}} in 1917 to produce high-quality Sitka spruce timber and other wood products needed to make aircraft for the United States' efforts in World War I. The division was part of the Army Signal Corps's Aviation Section. Its headquarters were in Portland, Oregon, and its main operations center was at Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington. Workers in the division were members of the Loyal Legion of <b>Loggers</b> and Lumbermen, a union specifically established to support the army's wood production operations.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of union radicals in the Industrial Workers of the World, Disque sponsored an alternative union based on patriotism and labor–management cooperation. The new union, the Loyal Legion of <b>Loggers</b> and Lumbermen, was established in 1917 and put {{under the leadership of}} Portland attorney Captain Maurice E. Crumpacker, who would later serve as a U.S. Congressman. The union was initially opposed by both labor and mill owners, but due to Disque's strong advocacy, within six months nearly all of the mill owners had agreed to support the union; by October 1918, it had 125,000members. In fact, the union lasted 20 years longer than the Spruce Production Division.|$|E
5|$|An early road {{following}} the current path {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and <b>loggers.</b> As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number went further west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E

40|$|Wireless capsule {{endoscopy}} (WCE) is a non-invasive {{technology for}} capturing {{images of a}} human digestive system for medical diagnostics purpose. With WCE, the patient swallows a miniature capsule with camera, data processing unit, RF transmitter and batteries. The capsule captures and transmits images wirelessly from inside the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The external data <b>logger</b> worn by the patient stores the images and is later on transferred to a computer for presentation and image analysis. In this research, we designed and built a Wi-Fi based, low cost, miniature, versatile wearable data <b>logger.</b> The data <b>logger</b> is used with Wi-Fi enabled smart devices, smart phones and data servers to store and present images captured by capsule. The proposed data <b>logger</b> is designed to work with wireless capsule endoscopy and other biosensors like- temperature and heart rate sensors. The data <b>logger</b> is small enough to carry and conduct daily activities, and the patient {{do not need to}} carry traditional bulky data recorder all the time during diagnosis. The doctors can remotely access data and analyze the images from capsule endoscopy using remote access feature of the data <b>logger.</b> Smartphones and tablets have extensive processing power with expandable memory. This research exploits those capabilities to use with wireless capsule endoscopy and medical data logging applications. The application- specific data recorders are replaced by the proposed Wi-Fi data <b>logger</b> and smartphone. The data processing application is distributed on smart devices like smartphone /tablets and data <b>logger.</b> Once data are stored in smart devices, the data can be accessed remotely, distributed to the cloud and shared within networks to enable telemedicine. The data <b>logger</b> can work in both standalone and network mode. In the normal mode of the device, data <b>logger</b> stores medical data locally into a micro Secure Digital card for future download using the universal serial bus to the computer. In network mode, the real-time data is streamed into a smartphone and tablet for further processing and storage. The proposed Wi-Fi based data <b>logger</b> is prototyped in the lab and tested with the capsule hardware developed in our laboratory. The supporting Android app is also developed to collect data from the data <b>logger</b> and present the processed data to the viewer. The PC based software is also developed to access the data recorder and capture and download data from the data <b>logger</b> in real-time remotely. Both in vivo and ex vivo trials using live pig have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed device...|$|R
30|$|Observation {{values from}} the weather sensors get {{transmitted}} to the LAU (Local Acquisition Unit) Server after it gets converted into a digital signal through the data <b>logger</b> system. At this point, the data <b>logger</b> system and the LAU Server perform an encrypted communication of symmetry key types using the exchanged security key through the mutual authentication, and the data <b>logger</b> system transmits the observation value to the LAU server every minute. If data cannot be transmitted every minute, either a fault has arisen in the data <b>logger</b> system or an unexpected hijacking has happened. Therefore, an inspection for physical hijacking and responsive actions to the failure need to be performed.|$|R
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, <b>loggers</b> took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data <b>loggers</b> to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data <b>loggers</b> shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
