40|$|Abstract- Power {{awareness}} {{is an essential}} component of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), due to the <b>limited</b> <b>energy</b> <b>stored</b> in battery-operated equipment. Moreover, a WPAN has to deal with coexistence problems, since it may simultaneously operate over many types of network. Especially, when UWB, which is a candidate PHY technology for IEEE 802. 15. 3 -based WPANs, is applied, decreasing the transmission power is necessary to meet the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation and diminish interference to other communication systems. In a WPAN, the Piconet coordinator (PNC) acts as an important role for central controller of the whole Piconet. As specified in the standard, IEEE 802. 15. 3, the most capable device in a Piconet could be dynamically selected as the PNC in terms of the capacity of devices. However, the standard does not explicitly define the capacity function. In this paper, a novel PNC selection method, named Least Distance Square PNC (LDS-PNC) selection for IEEE 802. 15. 3 -based WPANs is proposed. Using the proposed selection method, the transmission power can be lessened, and the interference area introduced by PNCs can be diminished as well. The simulation results show that it has power-saving and interference mitigation characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In Wireless nodes {{power saving}} is an {{important}} issue always been raised due to <b>limited</b> <b>energy</b> <b>stored</b> in them. For saving power various methods are implemented, using routing protocols, sleep mode operations and efficient processing algorithms. In this work, we used Network Simulator- 2 to generate a wireless adhoc network and packets are routed through them using the AODV (ad-hoc on-demand distance vector) routing protocol. The Trace file is analyzed to determine the energy used by each of the nodes for routing the generated packets through the network. The most of the energy consumed in ad-hoc network is found to be the transmission of packets between the nodes. The goal of the project is to increase the energy efficiency of AODV routing protocol by incorporating Transmission Power Control Technique. This method calculates the distance between a transmitting node and a receiving node, and selects transmission power with respect to the distance between the transmitter and receiver. The simulations are done for single source, multiple sources as well as for light and dense network. The comparison of output files for each of the scenarios shows significant reduction of energy consumption in the new proposed method than in AODV. The results of this project are very significant as it can extend the life of wireless ad-hoc network considerably and can be introduced to other routing protocols as well...|$|E

The aerobic metabolism of glucose is critical in this process. Indeed, although the brain represents only ~ 2 % of body weight, it accounts for ~ 20 % of total body resting O 2 consumption. Because of the high metabolic rate and <b>limited</b> <b>energy</b> <b>stores,</b> interruption of the O 2 or glucose supply by stroke, global ischemia, or pulmonary failure readily causes loss of consciousness and, if unheeded, generalized convulsive seizure. During seizure, the cerebral metabolic rates of O 2 and glu-cose uptake increase more than under any other circumstance (2). This massive energy demand causes a rapid fall in ATP that, if prolonged, leads ultimately to irreversible cell damage (5) due to intracellular ionic derangements such as Na+ and Ca 2 + overload (2).

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{epidemic of}} obesity and metabolic disorders is focusing {{the attention of}} the scientific community on white adipose tissue and its biology. This tissue is characterized not only by its capability to change in size and shape but also by its heterogeneity and versatility. White adipose tissue can be converted into brown fat-like tissue according to different physiological and pathophysiological situations. The expression of uncoupling protein- 1 in brown-like adipocytes changes their function from energy storage to energy dissipation. This plasticity, named browning, was recently rediscovered and convergent recent accounts, including in humans, have revived the idea of using these oxidative cells to fight against metabolic diseases. Furthermore, recent reports suggest that, beside the increased energy dissipation and thermogenesis that may have adverse effects in situations such as cancer-associated cachexia and massive burns, browning could be also considered as an adaptive stress response to high redox pressure and to major stress that could help to maintain tissue homeostasis and integrity. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning brown adipocytes and the browning process and also to explore unexpected putative role(s) for these cells. While it is important to find new browning inducers to <b>limit</b> <b>energy</b> <b>stores</b> and metabolic diseases, it also appears crucial to develop new browning inhibitors to <b>limit</b> adverse <b>energy</b> dissipation in wasting-associated syndromes...|$|R

The presented method bounds the dangerous behavior of the robot during the first instants of the impact by <b>limiting</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>stored</b> into the system to a maximum imposed value. Two critical physical human robot interaction (pHRI) cases are studied, these are the collision either against a free or a clamped head. Safe energy values that can be used as reference were retrieved by analysing experimental data of energy absorption to failure of cranium bones and cervical spinal cords. The energy regulation control is implemented in a series elastic actuator prototype joint. The model and the control scheme of the system are analysed. The proposed control scheme is a position-based controller that adjusts the position trajectory reference in function of the maximum energy value imposed by the user. Preliminary results are presented to show that the actuator unit and this control scheme are capable of <b>limiting</b> the <b>energy</b> to a maximum imposed value. I...|$|R
40|$|Glucose is {{the most}} {{important}} fetal nutrient and the production of this substrate increases in the pregnant woman. In the last trimester the increased insulin resistance directs energy substrates to the fetus. Fetal growth is sometimes disturbed, often without an obvious explanation. After birth the newborn infant must produce its own glucose, primarily for the brain. Fatty acids from lipolysis are also important energy substrates. Hypoglycaemia can be a problem, occurring frequently in preterm infants and infants born small for gestational age (SGA). In addition, SGA infants are at risk of developing the metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Neonatal medication can influence energy metabolism. One such medication is theophylline, administered in preterm infants to prevent apnoea. We investigated energy substrate production in women with normal and IUGR pregnancies, in preterm neonates, before and after theophylline treatment and in newborn SGA infants, using stable isotope-labelled compounds and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that late pregnancy was associated with an almost twofold increase in the rate of lipolysis. This provides substrates for maternal energy metabolism, which may spare glucose for the fetus. Even though glucose production was comparable in the two groups of pregnant women, those with IUGR had a lower rate of lipolysis. A reduced supply of energy substrates could be one factor underlying IUGR. In spite of the insulin resistance of late pregnancy, insulin still had a regulatory role in energy substrate production in the women with normal pregnancies, but not in those with IUGR. Although infants born preterm and/or SGA have <b>limited</b> <b>energy</b> <b>stores,</b> we demonstrated that they are capable of both lipolysis and glucose production. Theophylline had no adverse effects on energy substrate production. Data on insulin and IGFBP- 1 in the SGA infants indicate that in such infants insulin sensitivity is increased peripherally but reduced in the liver...|$|R

40|$|The free {{electron}} laser for infrared experiments (FELIX) operates at wavelengths up to lambda = 110 mum. A radio-frequency linear accelerator is used to produce electron micropulses {{with a duration of}} about 3 ps. With N = 38 undulator periods, this puts FELIX well into the regime where the slippage length, Nlambda, exceeds the electron micropulse length, and prominent short pulse effects are expected. One of these effects, stable limit cycle oscillations of the pulse energy, has not been detected experimentally before. Such oscillations occur when the saturated optical pulses move away from the electron pulses, due to the changing balance between lethargy and desynchronism, while new subpulses grow periodically. In FELIX, limit cycle behaviour is clearly demonstrated. The observations are in agreement with numerical simulations of the pulse propagation, and the oscillation period is given by a simple formula containing the slippage length and the desynchronism between optical and electron pulses. We also show how lethargic behaviour can be used to reduce the optical bandwidth of the FEL and to <b>store</b> optical <b>energy</b> in the optical cavity without saturation <b>limiting</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>stored...</b>|$|R
