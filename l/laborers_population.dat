50|$|Pope Leo XIII {{immediately}} elevated Bernard Hermann Koeckemann, a Picpus Father from Germany, as {{the second}} Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated as the titular bishop of Olba. During his episcopate, Msgr. Koeckemann saw a wave of new Catholics from the exponentially growing sugarcane plantation <b>laborer</b> <b>population</b> in the Hawaiian Islands. The Catholic Church in Hawaii embraced new parishioners from the Philippines, Poland, Portugal and Spain among others. There were so many devout Portuguese members that churches often had to include Masses in which the sermon (for {{the rest of the}} Mass would have been in Latin) was delivered in the Portuguese language.|$|R
50|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Contone lived as herders and farmers, {{mostly on the}} lowest part of the slope of Mount Ceneri. After 1850, the employment situation changed because {{of the decline of}} the port of Magadino and railway construction. Many inhabitants emigrated abroad and found work as painters, plasterers and stove-makers. With immigration of, mainly Italian, day <b>laborers,</b> the <b>population</b> began to grow. At the end of the 20th Century most jobs were in the services sector. After the correction of the Ticino river, the vast, formerly marshy plain became home to a number of commercial and industrial buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Sokoloff and Engerman {{hypothesize that}} in {{societies}} founded with greater inequality, the elites gained {{more power to}} influence the choice of legal and economic institutions. In those countries which are inequal, small elites restrict majority people's rights, such as education and votes, to perpetuate the social structures and continue to make themselves [...] "elites." [...] The U.S. began its economic growth largely through slave labor and trade of the output of that labor. As the elites enacted policy to generate more economic equality, for example by increasing literacy rates, the U.S. GDP per capita pulled ahead of other long-since established countries along with the literacy rates. It is essential to note that factor endowments {{played a crucial role}} in shaping the colonies institutions and economic growth; colonies with a richer quality of soil grew cash crops such as sugar, coffee, and cotton, which were most efficiently grown using plantation systems. As such, the demand for not only slave labor but also peonage within these colonies grew. Due to the vast inequality that the society developed due to a small elite population in comparison to the vast <b>laborer</b> <b>population,</b> they were able to maintain the wealth and power within the elite class via establishing a guarded franchise. The inequalities within the cash crop colonies resulted in their economy not being able to expand and grow as fast as the U.S and Canada, due to restrictive policies. Those policies in inequal countries curb the intellectual development of most people who are only required to do simple manual jobs; however, US and Canada encourage their people to take part in education. As a result, US and Canada excel with higher productivities which are supported by advanced technology.|$|R

Križa iz Velog Varoša u Splitu. Transkripcija napjeva snimljenih 1974. godine (Martinić) analizira se i uspoređuje s ranijim zapisima (Kalogjera, 1920.). Ta usporedba pokazuje očite razlike poglavito u načinu izvedbe. Neosporno je, kako tekstovno tako i melodijski, da ova tri «posebna» napjeva, kao uspjeli primjeri pučkog stvaralaštva zaslužuju u svakom pogledu našu pozornost, tim više što oni sačinjavaju dio kulturne baštine, poizišle iz jedne na «težački» način strukturirane župe usred grada Splita. Looking {{over the}} {{repertoires}} of traditional church singing {{in many places}} of the Central Dalmatian area, {{it was easy to}} assert that three texts (Pismu novu svi pivajmo, Naš Isuse blagoslovi and Bilig Kralja od nebesi) belong solely, or almost exclusively, to the Holy Cross parish from Veli Varoš in Split. The worn condition of the pages that gave access to them - the first one from the Pisne duhovne [...] . a collection by D. M. Čulić from 1805, and the other two from an old undated manuscript collection by an unknown author – unquestionably informs us about their frequent use (in this parish) far back in the distant past. For their part, the tunes accompanying in the folk manner these somewhat archaic texts, additionally intensified and aroused my interest in the writing of this article. The transcription of the tunes, sound-recorded in 1974 (Martinić), is analyzed and compared with earlier note records (Kalogjera, 1920). That comparison shows evident differences, particularly in the way of interpretation. It is indisputable that, being successful examples of folk creativity, these three textually and melodically specific tunes deserve our attention in every respect; the more so because they form part of the cultural heritage that has emerged from this parish {{in the center of the}} city of Split, formerly with a farm <b>laborer</b> <b>population...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Day laborers generally are individuals who work and get paid on a daily or short-term basis. To find work, they often congregate on street corners and wait for employers to drive by and offer them work. Day laborers may also be employed by temporary staffing agencies that assign them work {{on a daily basis}} with client employers. Day laborers have an informal relationship with the labor market, often working for different employers each day, being paid in cash, and lacking key benefits, such as health or unemployment insurance. However, day laborers may be eligible for wage and safety protections provided by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act. The U. S. Department of Labor administers both acts. Its Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for ensuring that all covered workers receive at least the federal minimum hourly wage and overtime pay. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is required to ensure that employers provide safe and healthy workplaces to help their workers avoid injury or death. Coverage under both laws does not depend on a worker's immigration status. Although limited, information on the nature and size of the day laborer workforce suggests that these workers may be prone to workplace abuses and are probably undercounted. Available information shows that day laborers are generally young Hispanic men with little education and significant language barriers, with some also being undocumented. The only nationally representative data on the day <b>laborer</b> <b>population</b> comes from Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, but these data may undercount day laborers. The unique characteristics of day laborers and their work affect Labor's ability to enforce the protections afforded them by federal law. First, neither WHD nor OSHA can get complete information about potential violations involving day laborers, making it difficult to target resources. Second, WHD's and OSHA's investigative procedures make it difficult to detect violations of worker protection laws involving day laborers, who often have nonstandard work arrangements. Finally, WHD officials are uncertain about the extent of coverage for day laborers in some cases, and the responsibilities of temporary staffing agencies under the OSH Act are unclear. Refer to GAO- 02 - 1130 for a Spanish language version of this report. ...|$|R
40|$|As the Latino {{population}} in the U. S. continues to grow, research on the wealth and retirement status of this target population has focused almost entirely upon data sources such as the Survey of Consumer Finances (Federal Reserve System), Survey of Income and Program Participation (Census Bureau) and the Health and Retirement Survey (National Institute on Aging) with no explicit assessment of the former occupational status of Latino workers. The Latino proportion of farm workers in the agricultural sector has ranged from 70 % to 38 % of the total farm worker {{population in}} the U. S. between 1975 and 2006 (BLS Historical Data). Of the 2. 1 million hired farm workers in the U. S., 38 % are Hispanic farm workers. Mexican origin farm workers account for 92 % of all Hispanic farm <b>laborers</b> (Current <b>Population</b> Survey, 2007). Given the historical participation of Latino workers in the agricultural sector, {{an overview of the}} last 25 years is presented. Two significant issues emerge from an assessment of Latino hired farm workers: (1) misclassification of employee status and (2) less utilization of social security benefits compared to other industry wage workers. Analysis of Hispanic farm worker tax filing and retirement issues using data from a regional data set on tax and financial behaviors indicate that Hispanic farm worker retirement position is inadequate. This has significant ramifications for current and future national tax burdens...|$|R
40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that day laborers engage in higher risk occupations and suffer {{a high number of}} occupationally related fatal and non-fatal injuries. Although there have been some studies focusing on immigrant workers and their occupational injuries, none to our knowledge has studied Houston’s day laborers. An exploratory study of Houston’s day <b>laborer</b> <b>population</b> was conducted in 2008 by Dr. Fernández-Esquer from the University of Texas. ^ The aims of the current study are to analyze secondary data from this parent study and describe the prevalence of the self reported occupational injuries among Houston immigrant day laborers seeking work during the months of October through December 2008. The study also aims to determine if the reported injuries varied by age group, education level, length of time living in the U. S. and length of time working as day laborers and describe if injuries were more common by the number of different job types or job conditions reported or the use of personal protective equipment used (PPE). ^ This study analyzed 325 questionnaires that included job-related information from the parent study. One hundred and nine workers (35 %) reported an occupational injury or illness in the year before the interview. The most frequent injuries or illnesses reported were falls (26. 7 %), cuts and lacerations (23. 3 %) and being struck by an object (18. 3 %). Over half of the workers (57 %) reported working 4 to 6 different jobs in the year before the interview, followed by 22. 5 % reporting 1 to 3 different jobs. A combined 79 % of day laborers in Houston reported exposure to 7 or more of the job conditions listed and 69 % of those workers also reported an injury or illness. PPE use varied from 44 % of workers reporting using 4 to 6 PPE items to 6. 8 % reporting not using any type of PPE. Thirty two percent of workers reporting not using any PPE also reported an injury or illness. ^ Injuries were found not to have varied significantly by age group, time living in the US, time working as a day laborer, numbers of different job types and the number of PPE used. Injuries did vary significantly by education level of the participants and the number of different job conditions reported (education, X 2 (4, N = 315) = 12. 651, p = 0. 013; and job conditions, X 2 (3, N = 319) = 14. 698, p = 0. 002). ^ Although this first study of Houston’s day laborers was successful at engaging the population and getting background information regarding the occupational health of these workers, more studies are needed to further characterize the day laborers occupational experiences and injuries along with determining what specific job types and job conditions were present when injuries occurred and what kind of PPE was being used at the time. It is also clear that these workers need better safety training programs regarding working in potentially dangerous jobs and job conditions. They would also benefit from programs that would help empower them to negotiate for safer conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{tropical}} medicine was the conscious, political {{creation of the}} Western industrial powers to combat disease among European colonial soldiers, administrators and settlers. In a sudden burst of scientific zeal between 1895 and 1912, nearly all the colonial powers created their own specialized schools of tropical medicine. Over the next few decades, the Western powers selectively shared the benefits of tropical medicine with strategic sectors of the colonized <b>populations.</b> <b>Laborers</b> in key industries and civil servants {{were among the first}} to receive care. Women, children and the vast peasantry received the least attention. Just as colonial boundaries, industrial mining, cash-crop production and Christian missionaries had disrupted and transformed social patterns of organization, the introduction of biomedicine curtailed long-standing communal practices and transformed fundamental worldviews. In this sense, biomedicine arrived in Africa as an essential instrument of colonial rule and subjugation. However, beginning with a few very successful and highly visible public health campaigns such as the anti-yaws programs in East Africa in the 1920 s. African attitudes toward biomedicine gradually shifted from suspicion to greater acceptance and biomedicine both as a practice and as an ideological worldview began to take root...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the development of}} baseball in Chicago from 1876 - 1906, analyzing {{the growth of the}} top-flight professional organizations, the development of amateur and semiprofessional baseball, youth teams, high school and college nines, the rise of African-American baseball, the birth of both the National and American Leagues, and the zenith of the city 2 ̆ 7 s control and devotion to baseball, the 1906 World Series. The sport attracted players and fans from the growing immigrant <b>population,</b> <b>laborers</b> from factories, white-collar employees of the downtown business district, and African-Americans.

Despite debates concerning its origins, the term [...] "Rohingya," [...] in the form of Rooinga, first appeared in 1799 in an article about a language spoken by Muslims claiming to be natives of Arakan. In 1826, after the First Anglo-Burmese War, the British annexed Arakan and encouraged migrations from Bengal to work as farm <b>laborers.</b> The Muslim <b>population</b> may have constituted 5% of Arakan's population by 1869, although estimates for earlier years give higher numbers. Successive British censuses of 1872 and 1911 recorded an increase in Muslim population from 58,255 to 178,647 in Akyab District. During World War II, the Arakan massacres in 1942 involved communal violence between British-armed V Force Rohingya recruits and Buddhist Rakhine people and the region became increasingly ethnically polarized. After Burmese independence in 1948, the mujahideen rebellion began as a separatist movement to merge the region into the East Pakistan and continued into the 1960s, along with the Arkanese Independence Movement by Rakhine Buddhists. The rebellion left enduring mistrust and hostilities in both Muslim and Buddhist communities. In 1982, General Ne Win's government enacted the Burmese nationality law, which denied Rohingya citizenship, rendering a majority of Rohingya population stateless. Since the 1990s, the term [...] "Rohingya" [...] has increased in usage among Rohingya communities.|$|R
