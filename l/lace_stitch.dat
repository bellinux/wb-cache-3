50|$|A notable {{developer}} {{of the industry}} in Scotland was Mrs Jamieson, the wife of an Ayrshire cotton agent. Seeing a philanthropic opportunity, she set out to teach local farmers' wives and daughters the trade, focusing on firm satin stitch, overcast fillings, and fine <b>lace</b> <b>stitches</b> in cut-out spaces. The designs were drawn up by professional draughtsmen in Glasgow before being sent out to be embroidered by outworkers. They were then bleached, made up, boxed and widely marketed, proving especially popular in North America.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{generation}} of <b>lace</b> knitting <b>stitch</b> patterns by using genetic programming. We devise a genetic representation of knitting charts that accurately reflects their usage for hand knitting the pattern. We apply a basic evolutionary algorithm for generating the patterns, where the key of success is evaluation. We propose automatic evaluation of the patterns, without interaction with the user. We present some patterns generated by the method and then discuss further possibilities for bringing automatic evaluation closer to human evaluation. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
5000|$|Rawhide {{is made by}} {{scraping}} the skin thin, soaking it in lime, and then stretching it while it dries. Like alum-tanning, rawhide is not technically [...] "leather", but is usually lumped in with the other forms. Rawhide is stiffer and more brittle than other forms of leather; it is primarily found in uses such as drum heads and parchment where it {{does not need to}} flex significantly; it is also cut up into cords for use in <b>lacing</b> or <b>stitching</b> and for making many varieties of dog chews.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{consider}} that [...] "true" [...] knitted <b>lace</b> has pattern <b>stitches</b> {{on both the}} right and wrong sides, and that knitting with pattern stitches on only {{one side of the}} fabric, so that holes are separated by at least two threads, is technically not lace, but [...] "lacy knitting", although this has no historical basis.|$|R
5000|$|A show towel is a bath or {{hand towel}} {{that has had}} trim—such as satin, <b>lace</b> or linen <b>stitched</b> onto it, or {{embroidery}} done on it—mainly to simply [...] "look nice". They are used to add a decorative touch—usually to a bathroom—most commonly in the USA. They are generally not {{to be used to}} for drying, as regular washing ruins the added trim, and the towel buckles as well (because the towel usually shrinks differently than the trim).|$|R
50|$|Irish Crochet Lace is {{made with}} a very fine steel crochet hook and fine crochet cotton or linen thread. It begins with an outline of the pattern {{on a piece of}} cloth. Each motif is then crocheted separately, using cotton cord for volume and shaping. The {{finished}} motifs are then basted (sewn with a loose stitch for temporary tacking) onto a cloth {{in the shape of the}} pattern. The motifs are then joined using chains and picots. When all the motifs have been joined together forming one piece of <b>lace</b> the basting <b>stitch</b> is removed from the back cloth revealing the completed lace.|$|R
40|$|Birch bark lace is Estonian needle lace. Structurally {{it resembles}} needle lace {{as it is}} known {{elsewhere}} in Europe. It uses the same stitches and there are similarities in the material used in the embroidery. However, the technology employed is unique in certain remarkable respects – it has adapted to local needs and possibilities. Whereas traditionally contour thread was tightened onto a strong textile, or in earlier times also onto parchment, in Estonia a strip of birch bark was used as a base material instead. Birch bark has many advantages as a base material: it was always available on farms and cost nothing; also, it was easy to process into a suitable size. While European lace makers were forced to cover a light-coloured base material with a dark textile or paper, the lower surface of the birch bark used for making lace was naturally darker and as such provided a suitable background for the white thread. Birch bark also gave this type of lace its name – birch bark lace. Birch bark lace is characterised by a simple geometric pattern. The joining of various motifs is not used in the birch bark lace technique. To the best of our knowledge, birch bark lace was embroidered in one piece between contour threads. Of the various <b>lace</b> <b>stitches,</b> birch bark <b>lace</b> uses the buttonhole stitch and twisted buttonhole stitch. The pattern is formed from the holes left between tight buttonhole <b>stitches.</b> Birch bark <b>lace</b> net differs from other birch bark laces for its net-like material of paired buttonhole stitches that could be decorated with running stitch embroidery. Ornaments are characterised by geometrical motifs that can be stitched with either white or red thread. The birch bark lace technique is not particularly well known in Estonia. No distinctive surveys have been published, but birch bark lace has been comparatively discussed alongside other lace techniques used in Estonia or introduced with a brief overview in descriptions of how to make national costumes. Hence, neither the region where it was once used nor its uses are known. The problem is that Estonian language literature has never given accounts of systematic instructions on how to use the technique. Therefore, there are few experts who are familiar with the techniques of making birch bark lace and who can distinguish objects in this technique from other museum textiles. Birch bark lace may, depending on the stitches used, be visually similar to crochet lace or filet lace. For this reason, it is possible that our museums hold more objects decorated with birch bark lace than we are currently aware. This article provides an overview of the objects decorated with birch bark lace identified in the collections of the Estonian National Museum and describes three birch bark lace techniques...|$|R
25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a <b>lace</b> carriage, where <b>stitches</b> can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|R
5000|$|The stole is a liturgical vestment {{of various}} Christian denominations. It {{consists}} of a band of colored cloth, formerly usually of silk, about {{seven and a half}} to nine feet long and three to four inches wide, whose ends may be straight or may broaden out. The center of the stole is worn {{around the back of the}} neck and the two ends hang down parallel to each other in front, either attached to each other or hanging loose. The stole is almost always decorated in some way, usually with a cross or some other significant religious design. It is often decorated with contrasting galloons (ornamental trim) and fringe is usually applied to the ends of the stole following [...] A piece of white linen or <b>lace</b> may be <b>stitched</b> onto the back of the collar as a sweat guard which can be replaced more cheaply than buying a new stole.|$|R
5000|$|One {{version of}} the fifth {{generation}} Prelude, a high-performance model called the Type S, was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2 L H22A, featuring VTEC and producing [...] at 7,200 rpm and 163 lbf·ft (221 N·m) at 6,500 rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, 87.0 mm bore x 90.7 mm stroke and VTEC-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to 12.2 mm intake and 11.2 mm exhaust. Honda also overhauled the air box {{and replaced it with}} a more efficient design that {{is often referred to as}} Dynamic Chambering, along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62 mm (as opposed to the previous 60 mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from 2 to 2¼ in (51 to 57 mm) (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine both Type S and USDM Type SH featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve. The fifth generation curb weight was , and ground clearance was [...] Unlike the SiR S-spec that had an LSD, the Type S acquired the Honda technology known as the Active Torque Transfer System (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people see it as leather and alcantara <b>laced</b> with red <b>stitching.</b> Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.|$|R
