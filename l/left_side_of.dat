5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body, and visual input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the visual field.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation.

5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E

5|$|Holmes was a {{hard working}} midfielder who possessed skill and could make neat passes, {{although}} he had been criticised for lacking in physical strength and tackling.

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E

The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982.

5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E

Since the floor inside is lower than the ground outside, a new floor made of wood (particularly molave) was installed in 1852 which was later replaced by brick tiles from 1874 to 1875.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a single fixed graph G on <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> input instances can be solved by brute-force in time |V(H)|O(|V(G)|), so polynomial {{in the size of}} the input graph H. In other words, the problem is trivially in P for graphs G of bounded size. The interesting question is then what other properties of G, beside size, make polynomial algorithms possible.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item.

If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
