2500|$|On December 2, 2016, David Feldman Promotions {{confirmed}} a {{fight between}} Jones and undefeated bare-knuckle fighter and former world title challenger Bobby Gunn would be announced for February 17, 2017 for the vacant WBF Cruiserweight championship {{at a press conference}} on December 6 at the Chase Center in Delaware. At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72-0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, [...] "I always do things that people don't expect me to do. I promised Bobby a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> I would give him the opportunity, and I am a man of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again." [...] At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn {{in the beginning of the}} 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.|$|E

60|$|Grandfather Frog has a {{great big}} mouth. You know that. Everybody does.

6000|$|When {{he reached}} the first little pool he baited his hook very {{carefully}} and then, taking the greatest care {{to keep out of}} sight of any trout that might be in the little pool, he began to fish.

He kept very quiet and fished and fished, patiently waiting for a foolish trout to take his hook. But he didn't get so much as a nibble. [...] "Either the trout have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise," [...] muttered Farmer Brown's boy, as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool.|$|E
60|$|Presently he came {{to another}} little pool. He stole up to it very, very softly, {{so as not to}} frighten the fish. Then he sat down close to the edge of it and didn't move. Buster learned a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> a {{fisherman}} must be patient unless, like Little Joe Otter, he is just as much at home in the water as the fish themselves, and can swim fast enough to catch them by chasing them. So he didn't move so much as an eye lash. He was so still that he looked almost like the stump of an old tree. Perhaps that is what the fish thought he was, for pretty soon, two or three swam right in close to where he was sitting. Now Buster Bear may be big and clumsy looking, but there isn't anything that can move much quicker than one of those big paws of his when he wants it to. One of them moved now, and quicker than a wink had scooped one of those foolish fish out on to the bank.|$|E

60|$|As was said, {{the face}} upon which he looked was strangely, marvelously changed {{from what it}} had been when he had last seen it nine years before, and, though it was still the face of Levi West, it was a very {{different}} Levi West than the shiftless ne'er-do-well who had run away to sea in the Brazilian brig that <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>That</b> Levi West had been a rough, careless, happy-go-lucky fellow; thoughtless and selfish, but with nothing essentially evil or sinister in his nature. The Levi West that now sat in a rush-bottom chair at {{the other side of the}} fireplace had that stamped upon his front that might be both evil and sinister. His swart complexion was tanned to an Indian copper. On one side of his face was a curious discoloration in the skin and a long, crooked, cruel scar that ran diagonally across forehead and temple and cheek in a white, jagged seam. This discoloration was of a livid blue, about the tint of a tattoo mark. It made a patch the size of a man's hand, lying across the cheek and the side of the neck. Hiram could not keep his eyes from this mark and the white scar cutting across it.|$|E
60|$|Especially of compassion. It {{has been}} said a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> books have their fate. They have, {{and it is very}} much like the destiny of man. They share with us the great {{incertitude}} of ignominy or glory--of severe justice and senseless persecution--of calumny and misunderstanding--the shame of undeserved success. Of all the inanimate objects, of all men's creations, books are the nearest to us, for they contain our very thought, our ambitions, our indignations, our illusions, our fidelity to truth, and our persistent leaning towards error. But most of all they resemble us in their precarious hold on life. A bridge constructed according to the rules of the art of bridge-building is certain of a long, honourable and useful career. But a book as good in its way as the bridge may perish obscurely on the very day of its birth. The art of their creators is not sufficient to give them more than a moment of life. Of the books born from the restlessness, the inspiration, and the vanity of human minds, those that the Muses would love best lie more than all others under the menace of an early death. Sometimes their defects will save them. Sometimes a book fair to see may--to use a lofty expression--have no individual soul. Obviously a book of that sort cannot die. It can only crumble into dust. But the best of books drawing sustenance from the sympathy and memory of men have lived on the brink of destruction, for men's memories are short, and their sympathy is, we must admit, a very fluctuating, unprincipled emotion.|$|E
