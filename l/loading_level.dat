However, in such an approach the chronological information between individual hours is lost. In this paper we propose a novel approach to power system models which constitutes an alternative to the traditional <b>load</b> <b>levels.</b> In particular, we introduce the concept of system states as opposed to <b>load</b> <b>levels,</b> which allows us to better incorporate chronological information in power system models thereby resulting in a more accurate representation of system outcomes such as electricity prices and total cost. Moreover, the system states can be defined taking into account various important system features at once, as opposed to <b>load</b> <b>levels</b> which are defined using just one specific feature, i. e., demand or net demand. Therefore the system states approach better captures other results such as reserve prices, which are not driven by the usual feature used to define <b>load</b> <b>levels.</b> In a case study we compare the newly proposed methodology to a standard <b>load</b> <b>level</b> approach, which validates that the system states approach better captures power system outcomes. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5000|$|In Britain until Samuel Plimsoll's Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels {{until their}} decks were almost awash, {{resulting}} in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, {{could end up in}} jail. Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some engineers to derive a fairly simple formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship's hull which, when it reached {{the surface of the water}} during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe <b>loading</b> <b>level.</b> To this day, that mark, called the [...] "Plimsoll Line", exists on ships' sides, and consists of a circle with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the [...] "ladder" [...] of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. This is called the [...] "freeboard mark" [...] or [...] "load line mark" [...] in the marine industry.|$|E
