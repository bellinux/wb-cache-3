5|$|Adenanthos obovatus {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{as a source of}} nectar for the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) in winter and spring (early June to September), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by A. meisneri in <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> and summer (late October to February).|$|E
5|$|Between <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> {{and early}} fall, {{much of the}} park can be {{accessed}} for multiple-day backpacking trips. All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.|$|E
5|$|In <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 1345 however, Kantakouzenos, {{reinforced}} with allegedly 20,000 troops from Aydin under their ruler Umur Bey, marched against Momchil. Momchil tried {{to prevent this}} by asking again for pardon and offering to submit to Kantakouzenos, but the emperor refused to heed him.|$|E
50|$|Seyval noir is {{moderately}} winter-hardy vine {{which is}} able to survive the cold winters and <b>late</b> <b>springs</b> of Quebec. The grape is also fairly resistant to most grape diseases but does have some susceptibility to powdery mildew.|$|R
50|$|Paris {{lies in a}} high {{valley of}} the Rocky Mountains, at nearly 6000 ft in elevation. Due to the high elevation, cold winters, <b>late</b> <b>springs</b> and mild summers are the norm for Paris and the area. Most of the {{surrounding}} country is used for ranching.|$|R

5|$|The {{first series}} has been {{broadcast}} twice on BBC Two, first in early 1993. It was repeated in <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 1994 to lead {{directly into the}} transmission of the second series, which {{was scheduled to be}} broadcast from June 1994.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{rainfall}} is {{the third}} lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart) but is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> bringing the highest rainfall. Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April, owing {{to the effect of}} summer and the mountains. The area is not very windy and the breeze is at its strongest from August to November. Canberra is less humid than the nearby coastal areas.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor is a {{commonly}} occurring mushroom of wet sclerophyll forests in Tasmania. Fruiting occurs from <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> to early winter, with most fruit bodies recorded between {{the months of}} January to March.

5|$|Jifna has local {{traditions and}} legends {{relating}} to the Holy Family, and to the village water-spring.

5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons. Most importantly, an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until <b>late</b> <b>spring.</b> The full floods could have discouraged an earlier attack, even if it was unlikely to have happened {{before the end of the}} Balkans Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
40|$|Yields {{of crops}} vary in Finland {{from year to}} year owing to the {{variations}} in climate, particularly in temperature. Since the growing season is relatively short early sowing is important and this is sometimes delayed owing to <b>late</b> <b>springs.</b> Preparations of the seedbed cannot begin before the snow has melted and the soil has both thawed and dried sufficiently. Because of this, annual crops generally cannot benefit from the first 1 – 3 weeks of the growing period...|$|R

5|$|There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground. Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional {{loops and}} Sunset Campground are open from <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> to early autumn. The 114-room Bryce Canyon Lodge {{is another way}} to stay {{overnight}} in the park.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled white flowers, opening from <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> to early summer, that rise above a whorl of three, leaf-like bracts. It {{is an example of}} a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronised with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E

5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in <b>late</b> <b>spring,</b> and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E
5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the <b>late</b> <b>spring.</b> The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E

5000|$|Yinchuan has a cold {{desert climate}} (Köppen BWk) {{with an annual}} {{rainfall}} of 186 mm. Yinchuan has distinct seasons, with dry, cold winters, <b>late</b> <b>springs</b> and short summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from [...] in January to [...] in July, with the annual mean at [...] Diurnal temperature variation tends to be large due to the aridity, which also partly contributes to the sunny climate; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 63 percent in three months to 71 percent in November, the city receives 2,906 hours of bright sunshine annually. There are 158 frost-free days.|$|R
5|$|Athens {{is home to}} {{the summer}} music festival Athfest, , the Athens Popfest and the <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the {{low-power}} (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most prominent modern music media. Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|By <b>late</b> <b>spring</b> 1865, Walker regained {{sufficient}} strength {{and began to}} assist his father by lecturing on political economy at Amherst as well as assisting him {{in the preparation of}} The Science of Wealth. He also taught Latin, Greek, and mathematics at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts until being offered an editorial position at the Springfield Republican by Samuel Bowles. At the Republican, Walker wrote on Reconstruction era politics, railroad regulation, and representation.|$|E
