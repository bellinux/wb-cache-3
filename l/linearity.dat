5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of the Lie algebra. Lie algebras are much simpler objects than Lie groups to work with. Due {{to the fact that}} the Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional vector space, in the case of the Lorentz Lie algebra the dimension is , one need only find a finite number of representative matrices of the Lie algebra, one for each element of a basis of the Lie algebra as a vector space. The rest follow from extension by <b>linearity,</b> and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' <b>linearity,</b> {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, MGM hired Hilliard {{away from}} UA. His first {{assignment}} was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift measured {{out to a}} voice-distorting 1500 degrees. Hilliard's solution was to use higher <b>linearity</b> transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, in consultation with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{existence}} of club convergence across countries by developing a two stage strategy, which employs information on clustering schemes - identified by a mapping analysis - and estimates a multiple-club spatial convergence model with non <b>linearities</b> and spatial dependence. Because of identification and collinearity problems, we introduce an entropy-based estimation procedure which simultaneously takes account of ill-posed and ill-conditioned inference problems. At the first stage, unobserved total factor productivity differentials across countries are identified by specifying a mapping structure in a convergence model with non <b>linearities</b> and spatial dependence. At the second step of the analysis, we estimate a multiple-club spatial convergence model, where clubs correspond to subsets of total observations, as identified at {{the first stage of}} the analysis.

25|$|The Lorentz transformations have a {{mathematical}} property called <b>linearity,</b> since x and t are obtained as linear combinations of x and t, with no higher powers involved.

In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion.

40|$|The trend lines {{presented}} can {{be useful}} in a number of ways. They provide a baseline of comparision from which software developers can compare their performance against a large database of similar projects. This will often identify a organizational style. It was possible to quantify the organizational style using the Manpower Buildup Gradient. That the developer was a better than average producer on RAM based systems was shown. The Ck associated with the ROM system suggests that it is a different class of work. When this system is compared against the Firmware database it is very creditable. It {{is important to recognize that}} there are non <b>linearities</b> present in the software process. The non <b>linearities</b> are tied to system size.
