40|$|The fast Fourier {{transform}} {{is used in}} two-dimensions {{to calculate}} the apodizing effect of a center opening pupil shutter. Two shutter models are investigated and compared, a circular shutter with diameter a function of time, and a five-bladed <b>leaf-type</b> <b>shutter.</b> The influence of shutter shape, defocus, and third and fifth order spherical aberration on the time-averaged optical transfer function is investigated. The results indicate {{that there is only}} a small effect on resolution and depth of focus due to shutter motion in a well corrected optical system...|$|E

[...] The terrain and climate, {{as well as the}} nature of the campaign, made heliography a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large Aldis lamps, brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with <b>leaf-type</b> <b>shutters</b> for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During {{the early stages of the}} war, the British garrisons were besieged in Kimberley, Ladysmith, and Mafeking. With land telegraph lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and Aldis lamps at night.|$|R
