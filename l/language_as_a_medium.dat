5|$|Scotland has a {{literary}} heritage {{dating back to}} the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in Brythonic speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of Welsh literature. Later medieval literature included works in Latin, Gaelic, Old English and French. The first surviving major text in Early Scots is the 14th-century poet John Barbour's epic Brus, focusing on the life of Robert I, and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works. In the 16th century the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry, but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as {{a literary}} language. Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including James Macpherson, whose Ossian Cycle made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment. It was also a major influence on Robert Burns, whom many consider the national poet, and Walter Scott, whose Waverley Novels did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century. Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald. In the 20th century the Scottish Renaissance saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots <b>language</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> for serious literature. Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including Edwin Morgan, who would be appointed the first Scots Makar by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including Irvine Welsh. Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included Carol Ann Duffy, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named UK Poet Laureate.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century there was a new surge of {{activity}} in Scottish literature, influenced by modernism and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance. The leading figure in the movement was Hugh MacDiarmid who attempted to revive the Scots <b>language</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> for serious literature, developing a form of Synthetic Scots that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms. Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets Edwin Muir and William Soutar. Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch, Sydney Goodsir Smith and Edwin Morgan, who became known for translations of works {{from a wide range of}} European languages. Alexander Gray is chiefly remembered for this translations into Scots from the German and Danish ballad traditions into Scots. Writers who reflected urban contemporary Scots included Douglas Dunn, Tom Leonard and Liz Lochhead. The Scottish Renaissance increasingly concentrated on the novel. George Blake pioneered the exploration of the experiences of the working class. Lewis Grassic Gibbon produced one of the most important realisations of the ideas of the Scottish Renaissance in his trilogy A Scots Quair. Other writers that investigated the working class included James Barke and J. F. Hendry. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers that included Alasdair Gray and James Kelman were among the first novelists to fully utilise a working class Scots voice as the main narrator. Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner both made use of vernacular language including expletives and Scots dialect.|$|E
25|$|After the Arab Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Middle Persian, the {{language}} of Sassanids, continued in wide use well into the second Islamic century (eighth century) as a medium of administration in the eastern lands of the Caliphate. Despite Arabization of public affairs, the peoples retained much of their pre-Islamic outlook and way of life, adjusted to fit {{the demands of the}} Islamic religion. Towards {{the end of the first}} Islamic century, population began resenting the cost of sustaining the Arab Caliphs, the Umayyads - who become oppressive and corrupt, and in the second Islamic century (eighth century AD), a generally Persian-led uprising - led by the Iranian national hero Abu Muslim Khorasani - brought another Arab clan, the Abbasids, to the Caliphal throne. Under the Abbasids, the Persianate customs of their Barmakid viziers became the style of the ruling elite. Politically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control, causing two major and lasting consequences. First, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutasim (833-842) greatly increased the presence of Turkic mercenaries and Mamluk slaves in the Caliphate, and they eventually displaced Arabs and Persians from the military, and therefore from the political hegemony, starting an era of Turco-Persian symbiosis. Second, the governors in Khurasan, Tahirids, were factually independent; then the Saffarids from Sistan freed the eastern lands, but were replaced by independent Samanids, although they showed perfunctory deference to the Caliph. Separation of the eastern lands from Caliphate was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became a dominant culture in West, Central and South Asia, and the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. This culture would persist, at least in the modified form of the Ottoman Empire, into the twentieth century. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the new Persian <b>language</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> of administration and literature, by the rise of Persianized Turks to military control, by new political importance of non-Arab ulama, and by development of ethnically composite Islamic society.|$|E

Data collection is done with the use of FLINT observation sheet, as proposed by Moskowitz (1971) and Menon (1998), Teacher interview sheet and the questionnaire by AI-Nofaie (2010) and is analyzed. Findings suggest that, the use of English/other languages dominates the overall foreign language classroom interaction. There was also a tendency for teacher to dominate in terms of teacher talk and use other languages rather than the target language, thus limiting student practice and exposure towards the target language of their choice. The implications of the research are drawn for further research and the improvement in teaching techniques of teachers...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{contradictory}} theory {{towards the}} use of teachers’ code-switching in language acquisition. Some argues that the target language {{is supposed to be}} the only language performed in teaching process. On the other hand, other theories allow {{the use of}} various <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> of instruction. The second theory is strongly supported by the fact that target language learning cannot be separated from native language (Margana, 2013). Highlighting this contradictory phenomenon, this study is aimed to identify the occurrences of teachers’ code-switching while teaching English in the classroom. Especially, this study focused on the analysis of the grammatical patterns, types, factors, and functions of code-switching. Moreover, this study revealed to what extend these code-switching affect the students’ performance. This study was a qualitative case study which produced descriptive data. The data were all of the code-switching performed by the English teachers in the form of expressions. In order to complete the source of data, supporting documents and some informants were involved in this study. Coping with the aims of the study, purposive sampling was used to collect the samples under the consideration that the samplings were teaching English in the accelerated classroom. Observation, documentation, and interview were conducted to collect the data. Those were interpreted descriptively. To enhance the trustworthiness of the data analysis, the triangulation technique was used. After being checked, the data were analyzed based on Spradley’s Ethnographic Analysis (1979). The results pointed out that there were two grammatical patterns of code-switching performed; free-morpheme, and equivalence constraints. Regarding to the patterns, the types of code-switching were categorized as tag-switching, intersentential switching, and intrasentential switching. The results also described the factors initiating the teachers to switch code; participant, topic, situation, solidarity, and status. These analyses led to the functions of teachers’ code-switching in teaching process; quotation, interjection, message qualification, addressee specification, reiteration, and personalization versus objectification. Moreover, it was revealed that these code-switching gave a good impact on the students’ performance. In conclusion, the result of this study supported the second theory which allows the use of various <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> of teaching English in the accelerated classroom.
