Waters are meteoric in origin (Fig. 1), excluding any other source (magmatic, seawater, juvenile). Almost all samples lie on the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), while others draw a <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>slope</b> due to local evaporation processes, affecting waters discharging both in the Albano and Nemi lakes. Some samples show a shift in their 18 O content with respect to the GMLW, probably due to: i) exchange with gas phases and CO 2 -exsolution phenomena (negative shift, such as in the sample CA 1 well); and ii) interaction with rocks at relatively high temperature (positive shift). It is worthy of note that waters showing positive 18 O circulate in the same areas (Ciampino, Tivoli, Pomezia, Ardea) where anomalies in other geochemical parameters such as temperature, chemical composition and gas content, were found (see posters P 05, P 06 and P 08, this session). Finally, one sample (the acidic pool of the Zolf.

30|$|Constructing a facies {{model in}} {{geological}} modeling with {{two types of}} rock facies is not only stimulating but also necessary for modeling {{in a new direction}} to be able to reflect the interconnection of the oil body as well as heterogeneity of reservoir characteristics more clearly. The results of environmental interpretation derived from core sample data show that more than ten kinds of facies in rivers/lakes have been identified in the study area. However, predicting this kind of facies in the space of coring in wells and then simulated reservoirs as depositional facies faces many difficulties. Therefore, the simulation under lithology facies still includes reservoir and non-reservoir rocks but splits reservoir rocks into different HU types based on their porosity-permeability characteristics derived from core analysis results used in facies modeling steps. FZI values are shown on the chart by the statistical probability of reservoir rock in four HU types corresponding to four <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>slope</b> angles representing each HU type from the core analysis data. The newly identified HU types then are shown on the Amaefule chart plot according to the relationships between the reservoir rock quality index and normalized porosity (Φz) for all core samples. The division of rock facies into HU types also refers to the results of sedimentary environmental interpretation from core sample data in the wells. We used the artificial neutron network method in the IP software to predict the FZI values and then grouped them by HU type for no core sample intervals of whole sections of the wells. Based on the facies model and parameter model of porosity, saturation was built, and in-place oil reserves were calculated using the volumetric calculation function in Petrel software. One hundred realizations were run, and we chose the base case corresponding to the P 50 probabilistic results to simplify its use in production simulation models. Compared with the results calculated by volumetric methods for block H 1 and H 2 of 102 million barrels, those of oil-in-place reserves calculated from the model were more than about 3 %.|$|R

As shown, oil # 13041 is the ordinary heavy oil of type II, and the other ones (# 13161 and # 13121) are the extra heavy oil type. It is observed that the viscosity-temperature curves of oil # 13161 and # 13121 have the obvious property of two straight <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> the <b>different</b> <b>slopes</b> on semilog coordinate. The first-line slope {{is much higher than}} that of the second line. The intersection point of these two lines is defined as the turning point of temperature. It differs from the temperature breakpoint from the flowing experiments of porous media. The turning temperatures of oil # 13161 and # 13121 are about 52 and 56  °C. They are much smaller than that of the flowing experiments, which is resulted from the different rheological properties in different measuring conditions (Yang and He 2003). Traditionally, the apparent-viscosity of crude oil from the rotational viscometer is the lowest. Compared with it, the apparent-viscosity in capillary tube is a little increased, and the apparent-viscosity in porous media is the highest. For that porous media with a lower permeability, this phenomenon is much more distinct. Thus, the temperature breakpoint of heavy crude oil is also increased accordingly under a lower permeability condition. The oil rheological features in porous media (including the natural core and the sand pack) are of practical significance in the oilfield development.|$|R

Fifty seven infants with HD were rehydrated on a 185 ml/kg/ 24 hr. basis. Among them, 9 (Group I) presented seizures for the first time during treatment; and 16, matched for age, did not convulse (Group II). Subsequent cases were ascribed a 120 ml/kg/ 24 hr regimen; 8 of these, also matched for age with Group I, constituted Group III. The 3 groups were entirely comparable under many respects, including plasma Na and urea on admission. The fluids were comparable regarding (Na), but their rates of administration were significantly different in the 3 groups: respectively 216, 175 and 123 ml/kg/ 24 hr for I, II and III. In each group we computed the slopes of the increases in weight over the admission weights as a function of time (α), and the slopes of the decreases in plasma Na with time (β). Despite the differences in the rates of infusion, neither was αI different from αII, nor αII from αIII. By contrast, both βI and βIII differed from βII. Plotting α and β values for each group against infusion rates yielded straight <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> very <b>different</b> <b>slopes,</b> showing that infusion rates affect natremia much more than weight. Thus, it appears that during the treatment of HD, seizures are associated with high infusion rates, which correlate well with rapid falls in natremia; plasma urea on admission is not involved in the seizures; and it may be suggested that the rate of decrease in plasma Na should not exceed 0. 5 mEq/l/hr which corresponds to an infusion rate of 150 ml/kg/ 24 hr, containing 60 mEq/l Na.

They identified the intersection point of these two trends as the asphaltene precipitation onset. Kraiwattanawong et al.

The main {{objective of this}} study was to investigate possible use of crossbred progeny records to genetically evaluate sires. Bulls of each breed were evaluated separately using their purebred, crossbred or both purebred and crossbred progeny. First, crossbred progeny were used without including genetic groups. Secondly, crossbred progeny were used with genetic groups included. Rank correlations for different types of evaluations were calculated. In total, 10 different comparisons, 5 for each breed, were performed. The expected correlation of ranks of sires obtained using different data sets were estimated where applicable. Reliability and Prediction Error Variance of sire proofs were estimated both by an approximate method and direct calculation. Over-estimation of reliability and under-estimation of Prediction Error Variance by the approximate method was given. High correlations between ranks of Holstein-Friesian sires evaluated using different data sets were observed, while, the correlation between ranks of Jersey sires evaluated using purebred progeny with ranks of the same sires evaluated using only crossbred progeny was less than expected. Correlations of ranks of Jersey sires evaluated using all progeny with ranks of the same sires evaluated using only crossbred progeny were also low. After plotting EBVs of sires of each breed obtained using only purebred against EBVs of the same sires obtained using both purebred and crossbred progeny, two <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> slightly <b>different</b> <b>slopes</b> were observed.

It was concluded that crossbred progeny of Holstein-Friesian sires may be used to assist in their evaluation under New Zealand conditions, but, further research is recommended before using crossbred progeny of Jersey sires in sire evaluation...|$|R

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. Liquids such as water, silicon, silica, and germanium possess thermodynamic anomalies: at sufficiently low temperature, the specific heat Cp, the compressibility KT and the thermal expansion ap increase upon cooling. Studies have shown the possibility for anomalous liquids to have a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT), terminating at a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP). The existence of the LLCP would explain the anomalies of these systems. However the LLCP is difficult to access experimentally due to crystallization. Here we study the properties of the Widom line, defined as the locus of the maximum correlation length in the one-phase region. The Widom line is approximately an extension of the LLPT line. For <b>different</b> systems, the <b>slope</b> of the LLPT line may vary from positive to negative, so the behavior of the Widom line may also differ. To gain a complete picture of the critical phenomena, we study the behavior of the Widom <b>line</b> for systems <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>slopes</b> of the LLPT line. In both computer simulations and linear scaling theory, we find the Widom line can be identified by maxima in either entropy or volume fluctuations for systems with non-zero slope of the LLPT line. The loci of Cp, Kt or αp maxima converge as the critical temperature is approached. However, when the slope of the LLPT line approaches zero, the method of identifying the Widom line by entropy fluctuations as the loci of Cp or αp maxima becomes unfruitful. The locus of Cp maxima approaches the LLCP from below the critical temperature in linear scaling theory and cannot be observed in simulations. The response function maxima in terms of volume fluctuations are still well-defined, and it is possible to identify the Widom line by following the locus of Kt maxima. Our findings should help guide the experimental search for the LLCP in liquid water. We also study the effect of confinement (i) within a fixed matrix of nanoscopic particles, and (ii) inside a cylindrical pore. We find the LLCP shifts to lower temperatures and higher pressures, but the behavior of the Widom line is unaffected by confinement...|$|R

Then the annual sediment reduction beneficials, defined as the percentage of sediment reduction of the sediment yield without soil-water conservation measures, is calculated, and its temporal variation is plotted. The curve indicates that the soil-water preservation beneficats is a non-linear variation, which can be divided into three stages: (1) the increasing slowly; (2) increasing rapidly; and (3) remaining unchanged or even decreasing. The relationships are plotted between the sediment reduction beneficials and the areas of the soil-water conservation measures such as land terracing, tree- and grass-planting and the land created through check dams.

To improve the QSAR correlations, substituents are usually divided into electron-donating groups (EDG) and electron-withdrawing groups (EWG), which are treated separately and thought to follow different mechanisms of toxicity. In this paper, we focus on one important aspect of toxicity, the rate constant for production of phenoxyl radical. Activation energies are obtained for the reaction of X-phenol with peroxyl radical by using the Evans-Polanyi principle, giving rate constants as a function of ∆BDE values for both EDG and EWG sets.

40|$|Significant {{changes in}} the STIS {{sensitivity}} are revealed by 2. 3 years of observations of the same standard stars in the 52 X 2 arcsec slit. The largest changes are in G 140 L, where the sensitivity depends on both the time and temperature. The minor effect is a- 0. 25 %/C temperature correlation, where {{the bulk of the}} observations are confined to the 34. 5 - 38. 5 C temperature range. No significant change with temperature is detected for the near-UV MAMA or CCD modes. Following a correction for the correlation with temperature, the sensitivity of G 140 L decreases linearly with time. These losses vary with wavelength, ranging from a minimum of- 0. 8 %/yr at 1325 Å to a maximum of- 2. 8 %/yr at 1575 Å. For G 230 L, the mean sensitivity over all wavelengths increases by an average of 1. 8 % in the first 1. 3 years and then begins to drop. Two straight <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>slopes</b> fit the observed changes. The changes before 1998. 7 also vary with wavelength, ranging from a minimum of + 0. 8 %/yr at 2550 to a maximum at 2250 Å of + 2. 1 %/yr. The wavelength-dependent slopes of the currently decreasing sensitivity range from zero at the short wavelength end of the band to- 1. 9 %/yr in the 2300 - 2400 Å interval. Changes in the three low dispersion CCD modes are less severe. For G 230 LB and G 750 L, most wavelength bins are consistent within a three σ uncertainty of constant sensitivity over time. Only one wavelength bin for G 230 LB and two for G 750 L show sensitivity losses with more than three σ certainty. Those changes are small and lie in the 0. 2 - 0. 4 %/yr range. However for G 430 L, the losses in every 200 Å wavelength bin beyond 3300 Å range from 0. 5 to 0. 7 %/yr with a high statistical significance of 2 - 9 σ. After correcting the three low-dispersion modes for sensitivity changes, the 1 σ photometric broadband repeatability ranges from 0. 2 % for G 140 L and G 750 L to 0. 4 % for spectrophotometry in the other 3 modes...|$|E
40|$|Para solos agregados, a envoltória da resistência ao cisalhamento pode ser dividida em dois segmentos, com declividades e interceptos diferentes. Um primeiro segmento mais inclinado e com intercepto menor representaria a envoltória de ruptura definida pelo atrito e coesão interagregados, enquanto o segundo segmento, menos inclinado e com intercepto maior, seria a envoltória definida pelo atrito e coesão intra-agregados. O presente estudo foi realizado com o objetivo de avaliar se a envoltória de resistência ao cisalhamento de agregados do horizonte {{superficial}} de um Nitossolo Vermelho pode ser subdividida em segmentos distintos, com coeficientes angulares diferentes, e se isso está relacionado à existência de agregados nele. Inicialmente, amostras coletadas na superfície de um Nitossolo Vermelho distrófico latossólico de textura argilosa foram submetidas ao ensaio de cisalhamento direto com pressões normais de 24, 4; 48, 9; 98, 2; 196, 4; 294, 6; 392, 8 e 491, 8 kPa. Posteriormente, o ensaio foi realizado com amostras de agregados de cinco classes de diâmetro: For aggregated soils the Mohr failure {{line can}} be separated into two straight <b>lines,</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>slopes</b> and intercepts. In the range of low normal load, when the slope is very steep and the intercept is small, the failure line {{is defined by the}} friction and cohesion inter-aggregates, while for the higher load range the slope becomes smaller and intercept is larger, which defines the intra-aggregate friction and cohesion. Therefore, for aggregated soils the normal load range used in the direct shear test affects the final result. The present study was carried out with the objective of evaluating if the Mohr failure line of a Red Latosolic Nitisol can be subdivided in different segments, with different steepness and intercepts, and if this is related to the existence of soil aggregates. Initially, soil surface samples of a Typic Hapludox (Nitossolo Vermelho Distrófico latossólico, Brazilian Soil Classification System) were subjected to the direct shear test with seven normal loads (24. 4, 48. 9, 98. 2, 196. 4, 294. 6, 392. 8 and 491. 8 kPa). Afterwards, the tests were carried out with aggregate samples of five diameter classes (< 0. 25, 0. 25 - 0. 50, 0. 50 - 1. 00, 1. 00 - 2. 00 and 2. 00 - 4. 00 mm) with eight normal loads (24. 4, 48. 9, 73. 5, 147. 3, 294. 6, 441. 9, 589. 2 and 736. 6 kPa). The Mohr failure line could be divided into two straight line segments in all tests. Results indicate that the aggregation should be considered in the definition of the normal loads {{to be used in the}} direct shear test, as well as in the result analysis, once it affects the failure line. The studies here indicate that, under the given moisture conditions, the aggregates determine the shear strength for loads of up to 294. 6 kPa for the evaluated soil...|$|E
