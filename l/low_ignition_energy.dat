5000|$|Hydrogen {{is being}} {{researched}} as a fuel for vehicles because it produces no carbon dioxide emissions. If hydrogen fuel becomes more popular, {{it has the}} potential to be less expensive than other fuels, if low-cost production via electrolysis can be implemented. Hydrogen can be used and created in fuel cells to power electric motors or burnt directly in combustion engines. BMW has developed a bivalent internal combustion engine that can switch between petroleum and liquid hydrogen fuels. In gasseous form, hydrogen is difficult to store and has a low volumetric energy density. It can be produced in many different ways, but many of the methods produce carbon dioxide. The most promising method is electrolysis. Safety of the hydrogen storage tanks in the event of an accident has been investigated, and various tests show that they do not present any problems. [...] When used as a fuel, hydrogen has a wide range of flammability and <b>low</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy.</b> These properties allow hydrogen to be burned using a wide range of air-fuel mixtures, but problems arise with premature ignition. Crankcase ventilation is very important when burning hydrogen, because of the <b>low</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy.</b> Proper ventilation is needed to prevent ignition in the crankcase and the formation of water in the engine oil. Hydrogen and natural gas are very similar as fuels, so the differences between the components needed to burn them are trivial, and interoperable systems are easily made.|$|E

However, the low density of the acetylene/air mixture is such that the total combustion energy is quite low and weak containers such as bamboo or even glass rarely shatter.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the present hydrocarbon economy, energy is primarily derived from fossil fuels, like Coal, Oil and Gas. The petroleum oil obtained from mother earth is further, refined into gasoline, diesel, and natural gas. However, the burning of these hydrocarbon fuels causes the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Hydrogen the lightest of all gases and the most abundant element in the universe, is being considered for use as an energy carrier (for storing and transporting energy) for future generations. Emphasis on mitigating global climate change and reducing pollution, strengthens the case of hydrogen over other fuels. The environmentally benign nature of hydrogen coupled with the finite supply of fossil fuels supports the hydrogen economy. A possible transition to the full hydrogen economy is envisaged which will take place through several phases. The current work {{is concerned with the}} transitional phase and involves an investigation into the possibility of using the existing natural gas infrastructure for transporting hydrogen as a natural gas-hydrogen mixture. Likely impacts on the natural gas infrastructure {{as a consequence of the}} introduction of hydrogen are being studied as part of a European Union funded research project called Naturalhy. The work that is the subject of this thesis forms part of the safety work package of the Naturalhy project. In turn the part of the safety work package with which the work of this thesis is concerned is the changes that handling a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen rather than natural gas will have on the risk that will be posed to the general public. In particular, it is concerned with the changes that might result to such parameters as the ease with which mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas might be ignited compared with natural gas and hence the change to the frequency with which such events as explosions within domestic properties might increase. The work commenced with a review of the literature on the subjects of failure probability and ignition probability associated with natural gas infrastructure. The analysis and the outcome of this literature review suggested that the most sensitive area affected by the addition of hydrogen is accidental gas releases into confined enclosures such as domestic property. The presence of hydrogen is likely to increase the probability of fire and/or explosion due to the characteristic properties of hydrogen (wide flammability range, lower minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> etc.). The <b>ignition</b> characteristics for the gases (methane, hydrogen and methane-hydrogen mixtures) was studied using an experimental rig based on the principle of capacitive spark discharge. Consequently, the data obtained through experiments was used to calculate the Minimum <b>Ignition</b> <b>Energy</b> (MIE) of a particular gas and the <b>Lowest</b> <b>Ignition</b> <b>Energy</b> at various flammable gas concentrations for a particular gas. The results and observations were further analysed to provide information on the ignition probability associated with various <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> values for all the gases. The results for MIE are compared with the available data in the literature for methane and hydrogen gas.

40|$|The {{drawback}} of {{lean burn}} with ethanol is reduced power output. Lean operation of {{ethanol fuelled engines}} has additional drawbacks. Lean mixtures are hard to ignite, despite the mixture being above the low fire (point) limit of the fuel.

40|$|The {{physical}} and combustion properties of hydrogen {{give rise to}} hazards that must be considered when designing and operating a hydrogen system. One of the major concerns {{in the use of}} hydrogen is that of fire or detonation because of hydrogen's wide flammability range, <b>low</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> and flame speed. Other concerns include the contact and interaction of hydrogen with materials, such as the hydrogen embrittlement of materials and the formation of hydrogen hydrides. The low temperature of liquid and slush hydrogen bring other concerns related to material compatibility and pressure control; this is especially important when dissimilar, adjoining materials are involved. The potential hazards arising from these properties and design features necessitate a proper hydrogen hazards analysis before introducing a material, component, or system into hydrogen service. The objective of this guide is to describe the NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility hydrogen hazards analysis method that should be performed before hydrogen is used in components and/or systems. The method is consistent with standard practices for analyzing hazards. It is recommended that this analysis be made before implementing a hydrogen component qualification procedure.

40|$|Constant {{pressure}} outwardly propagating flame {{experiments in}} a spherical bomb are performed {{to examine the}} duration and radius over which spark ignition effects persist. This is motivated {{by the need to}} properly account for such effects in the measurement of laminar burning velocity and Markstein length using the spark ignited expanding flame technique. Ignition energy was varied and its effects on flame propagation in methane-air and isooctane-air mixtures were studied. The Markstein length of the mixture proved critical in the ignition energy dependency of flame propagation. For relatively high values, an underlying common variation of self-sustaining flame speed with radius can be identified by the rapid convergence of curves for different ignition energies. As the Markstein length decreases, low energy spark ignition is found to give rise to a distorted and wrinkled flame kernel. For such mixtures, due to the weak effect of stretch, the kernel subsequently develops into a non-spherically propagating flame. In these cases the spark ignition effect persists up to large radius. It is shown that using <b>low</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> leads to a flame speed, during the development phase, which is higher than that of a self-sustaining spherical flame. It is further shown that if this effect is not accounted for, measurements of Markstein length using standard fitting techniques results in a large error.

40|$|AbstractAn {{extensive}} {{investigation on}} experimental test of dust minimum explosible concentration (MEC) {{was carried out}} by using the Siwek 20 L vessel. Systematic data were reported on the MEC of various dusts and the influences of <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> dust calorific value, moisture content and particle size were taken into account. It is found that the overly <b>low</b> or high <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> will result in unrealistic MEC results. To reliably measure MEC, the experimental tests should be preformed under the condition that the test result is independent of <b>ignition</b> <b>energy.</b> For the Siwek 20 L vessel, the 4 - 6 kJ is the most appropriate energy ranges to determine the MEC of various dusts. The more incombustible component contained in lower calorific value dust acts as a thermal sink in the ignition and heating process of dust cloud, and therefore, the higher MEC {{can be found in the}} MEC measurement of lower calorific value dust. Moreover, due to the notable dust agglomeration, to validly measure MEC, the moisture content of test dust should not exceed 10 wt %. When the moisture content is lower than 10 wt %, the MEC smoothly increases with the rise of moisture content. With the decrease of particle size, the measured MEC becomes lower, and the MEC has an approximate linear relation with particle size. The results reported in this work provide the experimental basis and data guidance for the prevention and evaluation of dust explosion risk...|$|R

50|$|The {{flammability}} limits (4-75% {{of hydrogen}} in air at normal temperature, wider at high temperatures), its autoignition temperature at 571 °C, its very <b>low</b> minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> and its tendency to form explosive mixtures with air, require provisions {{to be made}} for maintaining the hydrogen content within the generator above the upper or below the flammability limit at all times, and other hydrogen safety measures. When filled with hydrogen, overpressure has to be maintained as inlet of air into the generator could cause a dangerous explosion in confined space. The generator enclosure is purged before opening it for maintenance, and before refilling the generator with hydrogen. During shutdown, hydrogen is purged by an inert gas, then the inert gas is replaced by air; the opposite sequence is used before startup. Carbon dioxide or nitrogen can be used for this purpose, as they do not form combustible mixtures with hydrogen and are inexpensive. Gas purity sensors are used to indicate the end of the purging cycle, which shortens the startup and shutdown times and reduces consumption of the purging gas. Carbon dioxide is favored as due to the very high density difference it easily displaces the hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is admitted {{to the bottom of the}} generator first, pushing the hydrogen out at the top. Then air is admitted to the top, pushing the carbon dioxide out at the bottom. Purging is best done with the generator stopped. If done on barring, the generator fans will mix the gases and greatly increase the time required to achieve purity.|$|R
40|$|This thesis traces and {{critically}} reviews {{recent developments in}} hydrogen fuelling of internal combustion engines. It reports {{the development of an}} improved fuelling system that has been tested on a Ricardo E 6 variable compression spark ignition engine, in the Thermodynamics laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Canterbury. The introduction of hydrogen to an internal combustion engine via the inlet manifold (external mixture formation), often results in the occurrence of pre-ignition. This is because hydrogen, with its <b>low</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> and extreme lean limit of flammability, is easily ignited by residual gases or hot spots in an engine cylinder. If pre-ignition occurs before inlet valve closure, the mixture may burn back through pre-mixed gases in the inlet manifold. Another serious disadvantage with external mixture formation is that hydrogen displaces a large volume of air, effectively reducing the volumetric efficiency of the engine. To overcome these problems hydrogen may be injected directly into an engine combustion chamber during the compression stroke, although if injection commences too early in the stroke pre-ignition may still occur. It is thus considered that the most desirable system for fuelling an internal combustion engine on hydrogen is to employ direct gaseous injection at high pressure late in the compression stroke. There are a number of problems involved with the design and development of a suitable high pressure hydrogen direct injector. In particular the injector must actuate rapidly and be controllable to a high degree of accuracy to consistently meter precise quantities of fuel at each injection. Leakage of hydrogen through the injector when closed must be minimised in order to avoid unnecessary fuel wastage and to prevent the build up of a flammable pre-mixed mixture that could lead to pre-ignition. A suitable injector has been designed and tested. The injector is electromagnetically actuated for electronic control of injection timing and duration (control of injection duration being necessary to vary the quantity of fuel delivered). The injector has a nominal lift distance of 0. 2 mm and can be opened for durations as short as 1 ms. A fluorocarbon elastomer Quad-ring was used in the seat of the valve to provide a leak free seal for the high pressure hydrogen. Engine testing was conducted to determine the performance of the valve. The engine was tested on hydrogen for compression ratios of 8 : 1, 10 : 1 and 12 : 1 over a range of operating conditions. Results of engine performance, complete with combustion chamber pressure traces and exhaust gas emission analysis are presented. The design concept has proven to be successful with satisfactory operation of the engine on hydrogen without any combustion related problems. The elastomeric seal, although providing leak free operation, had an average lifetime of about 30 minutes. Future injector development work should focus on devising a highly durable injector seat seal which minimises leakage...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} the numerical simulation of a coal-dust monodisperse suspension sparkplug ignition in a methane-air mixture. The methane-air mixture is not stoichiometric. The {{aim of the}} research is a design-theoretical determination of the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> of coal-dust-methane-air mixture (CDMAM) depending on the methane volume fraction. Simulation has shown that the increase of the methane volume fraction leads to the decrease of the CDMAM minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> and with the expansion of coal particles the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> rises...|$|R
40|$|As a dust {{explosion}} {{is regarded as}} a serious hazard in the industry, knowing the sensitivity of combustible dusts helps to calculate the explosion risk. Also mixtures of a less flammable dust with a combustible dust are often encountered in the process industries. One of the important parameters in determining the ignition sensitivity is the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> (MIE). The aim of this work is to determine crucial <b>ignition</b> <b>energies</b> for different types of combustible dusts of various particle sizes. Experiments are performed to determine the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> of pure dusts and also of different powder mixtures in air. They illustrate that by adding a small amount of a highly combustible powder (such as niacin, lycopodium and metal powder) with a less flammable powder (such as wood, cacao and South African coal) has a considerable effect on the MIE. There is a significant decrease in minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> when the fraction of the highly combustible dust exceeds 10 %. After mixing with more than 50 % of the highly combustible dust, the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> decreases gradually. In addition for the ignitable mixtures, the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> was calculated by means of a harmonic model and gave a satisfactory agreement with the experimental obtained values. It has notably been shown that the MIE of solid/ solid mixtures decreases remarkably when the highly flammable dust is added. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Explosions {{of hybrid}} {{mixtures}} of methane and nicotinic acid are investigated near the lower-flammability-limit conditions. The {{effect on the}} maximum pressure and deflagration index of the <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> and, then, of the ignition source {{in combination with the}} turbulence is analyzed. In correspondence of limit conditions for pure methane and pure nicotinic acid, the variation of both the <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> and the turbulence was found to affect the behavior of the explosion. It was observed that the deflagration index is determined to be independent from the <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> even though the dependence on the turbulence still remains. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{discharge}} characteristics of engine ignition, a dual-coil ignition was designed. Simulation models of <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> secondary voltage and spark duration of this ignition were established. The influence of discharge time interval and energy distribution method on discharge characteristics of the dual-coil ignition was studied. Compared with single-coil ignition, {{the results show that}} dual-coil ignition produced higher secondary voltage, <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> and extended spark duration. When total <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> remains constant, the dual-coil coupled discharge mode can improve energy conversion efficiency. The ignition can achieve flexible switching of discharge modes and optimal control of discharge characteristics，which is beneficial for improving fuel economy and reducing exhaust emissions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out on coal dust-inertant mixture explosions. Tests of explosion severity and flammability limit were conducted by using the Siwek 20 L vessel and influences of <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> coal dust calorific value, coal dust concentration and inertant composition were taken into account. The increase of inerting results with <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> is followed by an approximate stabilization when <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> exceeds 5 kJ. The <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> region of 5 - 10 kJ is appropriate for inerting testing, whereas ignitors with energy lower than 5 kJ produce unrealistic inerting results. The inerting effectiveness of inertant increases with the reduction of coal dust calorific value. Coal dust concentrations near the stoichiometric concentration require {{the greatest amount of}} inertant to suppress explosions. As the coal dust concentration increases beyond the stoichiometric, the amount of inertant requirement is reduced. Due to the efficient decomposition and particular flame extinguishing mechanism, monoammonium phosphate represents more excellent inerting effectiveness than calcium carbonate...|$|R
