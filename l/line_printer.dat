2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s IBM {{provided}} {{a program called}} FORMAT for generating printed documents on any computer capable of running Fortran IV. [...] Written by Gerald M. Berns, FORMAT was described in his paper [...] "Description of FORMAT, a Text-Processing Program" [...] (Communications of the ACM, Volume 12, Number 3, March, 1969) as [...] "a production program which facilitates the editing and printing of 'finished' documents directly on the printer of a relatively small (64k) computer system. It features good performance, totally free-form input, very flexible formatting capabilities including up to eight columns per page, automatic capitalization, aids for index construction, and a minimum of nontext [...] items." [...] Input was normally on punched cards or magnetic tape, with up to 80capital letters and non-alphabetic characters per card. The limited typographical controls available were implemented by control sequences; for example, letters were automatically converted to lower case unless they followed a full stop, that is, the [...] "period" [...] character. Output could be printed on a typical <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> in all-capitals — or in upper and lower case using a special ("TN") printer chain — or could be punched as a paper tape which could be printed, in better than <b>line</b> <b>printer</b> quality, on a Flexowriter. A workalike program with some improvements, DORMAT, was developed and used at University College London.|$|E

50|$|Early {{mainframe}} printers were {{so called}} <b>line</b> <b>printers.</b> <b>Line</b> <b>printers</b> provided {{only a very}} limited set of commands to control how the paper was advanced when print lines were printed. The application writing reports, list, etc. to be printed had to include those commands in the print data. These single character print commands are called printer control characters.|$|R
