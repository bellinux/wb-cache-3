500|$|Despite the {{manpower}} and technical limitations {{imposed on the}} German Army by the Treaty of Versailles, several Reichswehr officers established a clandestine general staff to study World War I and develop future strategies and tactics. Although at first {{the concept of the}} tank as a mobile weapon of war met with apathy, German industry was encouraged to look into tank design, while quiet cooperation was undertaken with the Soviet Union. There was also minor military cooperation with Sweden, including the extraction of technical data that proved invaluable to early German tank design. As early as 1926 the German companies Krupp, Rheinmetall and Daimler-Benz were contracted to develop prototype tanks armed with a large, 75-millimeter cannon. These were designed under the cover name Großtraktor (<b>large</b> <b>tractor)</b> [...] to veil the true purpose of the vehicle. By 1930 a light tank armed with rapid-fire machineguns was to be developed under the cover name Leichttraktor (light tractor). The six produced Großtraktor were later put into service for a brief period with the 1Panzer Division; the Leichttraktor remained in testing until 1935.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the north}} side is a {{staircase}} connecting {{the upper and lower}} ends of the hairpins, which allows pedestrians to avoid the walk where there are no sidewalks. Both sets of stairs accommodated many workers commuting to the factories on Gregory Avenue. The buildings overlooking the Horseshoe, as it has always been known by the locals, was the factory of S. Blickman & Co. which operated a stainless steel fabricating plant at the site for about 70 years. The plant produced stainless steel for many industrial and commercial purposes and was oriented to outfitting the many ships built along the Hoboken waterfront in Todd Shipyards (the family of former Governor Christy Todd Whitman) and Bethlehem Steel Shipyards. It produced most of the stainless steel equipment used to outfit Naval vessels constructed on the East coast during the Second World War. Blickman outgrew the factory and eventually the disused building was converted to condominiums in the 1980s. Further down the street on the corner of Gregory and Hackensack Plank Road was the factory of Robert Reiner & Co. which imported and customized Swiss embroidery machines when Hudson County {{was the center of the}} embroidery industry in the US in the first half of the 20th Century. [...] During the time of their operation Shippen Street was the only local street capable of accommodating the turn of many <b>large</b> <b>tractor</b> trailer trucks which serviced these two large and active factories.

No parking was permitted on Gregory Avenue until the factories both ceased operation.|$|E
