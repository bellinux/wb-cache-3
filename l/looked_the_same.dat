25|$|During in Huiyang, Holmes {{was under}} the command of Colonel (later Sir) Douglas Clague. He was {{assigned}} to deal with external affairs and to co-operate closely with the guerillas of the East River Column (東江縱隊). With the help from the guerillas, Holmes had organised a number of rescue plans trying to save the prisoners of war from the Japanese concentration camps and had conducted espionage in the Japanese-occupied region. According to the recollection of Paui Tsui, Holmes and his companions once secretly entered Hong Kong and reached the foot of Lion Rock. From the foot of the mountain, he used binoculars to spy the concentration camp far away in To Kwa Wan regardless the potential danger of being discovered by the Japanese. Fortunately, although Holmes was a Westerner, the Japanese had never recognised that the fluent Cantonese speaker was in fact a British. Tsui explained the reason was because Holmes was not huge physically and with the disguise of wearing bamboo hat and grey linen clothing, he just <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a common Chinese farmer. His bravery was appreciated by the British government that he was awarded a Military Cross in early 1943 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) of the Military Division a few months later. It was rare at that time to be decorated twice in a single year.|$|E

A mother of a contestant in the film claimed that the film overplayed practices that the contestants go through: [...] "Most pageants aren't quite like that, with shaving the girls' legs, spraying them with fake tans and putting on so much makeup." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town was}} {{authorised}} to tender construction and operation {{to one or}} more contractors. It quickly chose the only serious candidate, Gustav Palmer Harding, a British citizen. He was the continental representative of Merryweather & Sons, builders of steam tram engines. This decision knitted the close railway links between the city and Great Britain that remained for nearly half a century. Naturally, Mr Harding wanted to promote his company's machines, so he long made his views known to the municipal authorities. Finally convinced, they authorised him to use steam power from Maromme (Line 1), entering service on 29 December 1877. Merryweather & Sons, whose depot was on the Avenue du Mont-Riboudet, provided the tram units. Small and light — [...] — these reversible locomotives had two coupled axles, fully covered by a wooden body. They <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a normal carriage so as not to frighten the horses. These steam carriages had enclosed lower decks; the upper decks were roofed but had open sides.|$|E

You are then asked to take a careful look at each possible pair of objects, and {{to decide whether or}} not their members <b>look</b> chromatically <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> You carry out the instructions thoroughly, and the following propositions sum up the results of your empirical investigation: i. red object # 1 <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in colour as red object # 2. ii. red object # 2 <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in colour as red object # 3. iii. red object # 1 does not <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in colour as red object # 3. Experiences like these may seem familiar. Had you recently been in a hardware shop to choose a suitable shade of beige for repainting your kitchen wall, you might have experienced something similar. The shades of beige on two colour chips are indiscriminable. Yet, when you compare them with a third colour chip, while the latter is indiscriminable from the shade on the second chip, it is discriminable from the first. 1 Such experiences suggest that the relation denoted by <b>the</b> predicate <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as isn’t transitive.

500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky {{became the}} second game to use Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, after Lure of the Temptress. According to Cecil, the {{original}} version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky, {{as the ability to}} issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create. Lure of the Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event, whereas Beneath a Steel Sky had multiple threads. In one way this presented them with [...] "exciting gameplay opportunities, but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of multilinearity." [...] As a consequence, some of the engine's features were scaled back. Tony Warriner and David Sykes, both Revolution co-founders and programmers, had to update the engine, which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive. As an example of change in the updated engine, Virtual Theatre 2.0, Warriner explained that in Lure of the Temptress, the system controlled everything, for instance specific routines to a door. So if there was a door on-screen, the door-routine was called up to handle it. The consequence was that every door <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and acted the same, so if a door was somewhat different from the last one, it caused a problem. This was changed in the new system, as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2005, 68% of American flex-fuel car {{owners were}} not aware they owned an E85 flex. Flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> There was no price difference. American automakers did not label these vehicles. In contrast, all Brazilian automakers clearly labeled FFVs with text that was some variant of the word Flex. Beginning in 2007 many new FFV models in the US featured a yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities. As of 2008, GM badged its vehicles with the text [...] "Flexfuel/E85 Ethanol". Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that in 2009 only 504,297 flex-fuel vehicles were regularly fueled with E85, and these were primarily fleet-operated vehicles. As a result, only 712 million gallons were used for E85, representing just 1% of that year's ethanol consumption.|$|E

Following the precedents of Edward Gibbon and Jacob Grimm, the name of the Franks has been linked with the word [...] in English. It has been suggested that the meaning of [...] "free" [...] was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation. It is traditionally assumed that Frank comes from the Germanic word for [...] "javelin" [...] (such as in Old English [...] or Old Norse [...] ). There is also another theory that suggests that Frank comes from the Latin word [...] meaning [...] "throwing axe". Words in other Germanic languages meaning [...] "fierce", [...] "bold" [...] or [...] "insolent" [...] (German , Middle Dutch , Old English [...] and Old Norwegian [...] ), may also be significant.|$|E
