In graph theoretic terms, a <b>link</b> <b>farm</b> is a [...] clique. Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. A <b>link</b> <b>farm</b> {{is a form of}} spamming the index of a web search engine (sometimes called spamdexing). Other link exchange systems are designed to allow individual websites to selectively exchange links with other relevant websites and are not considered a form of spamdexing.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the overall link-based spam {{structure}} and its evolution {{which would be}} helpful {{for the development of}} robust analysis tools and research for Web spamming as a social activity in the cyber space. First, we use strongly con-nected component (SCC) decomposition to separate many <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> from the largest SCC, so called the core. We show that denser <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> in the core can be extracted by node filtering and recursive application of SCC decomposi-tion to the core. Surprisingly, we can find new large <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> during each iteration and this trend continues until at least 10 iterations. In addition, we measure the spamicity of such <b>link</b> <b>farms.</b> Next, the evolution of <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> is ex-amined over two years. Results show that almost all large <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> do not grow anymore while some of them shrink, and many large <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> are created in one year...|$|R

40|$|Web {{spamming}} {{has emerged}} to deceive search engines and obtain a higher ranking in search result lists which brings more traffic and profits to web sites. Link spamming {{is the major}} spamming technique that manipulates the link structure of the Web to deceive link-based ranking algorithms that regard incoming links to a page as endorsements to it. Spam pages using link spamming techniques are need to be eliminated since they damage the quality of search results and contaminate web mining and analysis results with useless pages. They are, however, also interesting social activities in cyberspace. In this thesis, I study the evolution and emergence of web spam in three-yearly large-scale of Japanese Web archives containing million hosts and 83 million links. As far as I know, the overall characteristics of web spam in a time-series of web snapshots of this scale have never been explored. Understanding the evolution of web spam pages, such as their {{growth in the number}} and change in topics over time, is helpful in developing new spam detection techniques and tracking spam sites for topic shift observation. Understanding the emergence of web spam pages, such as continuously created links to spam pages, is helpful in collecting new spam samples for spam classifier update. To understand the evolution of web spam, I analyze temporal changes in the size and topics of web spam pages. To clarify global characteristics of web spam pages such as distribution and topics in the single snapshot, I first propose a method for extracting spam <b>link</b> structures, <b>link</b> <b>farms,</b> from large-scale of web graphs. I then investigate the evolution of size and topic distributions in <b>link</b> <b>farms.</b> It is found that <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> were isolated from each other and most of them did not grow; the overall topic distribution in <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> was not significantly changed, although new <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> appeared and hosts in them dynamically changed. To understand the emergence of web spam, I focus on pages that contain links to spam pages. I propose a method for detecting hijacked sites, which are legitimate sites containing links to spam sites, and evaluate its detection precision. It is confirmed that monitoring hijacked sites is helpful in discovering emerging spam sites. On the other hand, I propose a method for identifying spam link generators, which are hosts that will generate links to spam hosts, and evaluate its identification accuracy. It is found that many links to spam hosts were created by spam link generators and some of spam link generator detected in 2004 and 2005 are still generating links to spam hosts in 2010. Main Contribution of this thesis are as following: ・I clarify overall distribution and evolution of <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> in large-scale Japanese Web graph for three years containing four million hosts and 83 million links. As far as I know, the overall characteristics of <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> in a time-series of web snapshots of this scale have never been explored. I propose a method for efficiently extracting many <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> and investigate the distribution of extracted <b>link</b> <b>farms.</b> It is found that <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> in the core recursively showed similar distribution. I categorize spam hosts in <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> into seven topics and build topic classifiers. It is found that two dominant topics accounted for over 60 % of all spam hosts in <b>link</b> <b>farms.</b> ・I analyze the evolution of <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> in the aspect of their size and topics. It is found that <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> were isolated from each other; many <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> maintained for years, but most of them did not grow; the distribution of topics in <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> was not significantly changed while new <b>link</b> <b>farms</b> appeared and hosts and keywords related to each topic dynamically changed. ・I study link hijacking techniques and propose a method for detecting hijacked sites. I investigate characteristics of hijacked sites and categorize them into several types. I detect hijacked sites with high precision and show that emerging spam sites can be discovered by monitoring hijacked sites. ・I study spam link generators that generate and propose several features for identifying spam link generators. It is found that almost new links pointing to spam hosts are created by spam link generators. I identify spam link generators with high accuracy and show that some spam link generators detected in 2004 and 2005 still generate links to spam pages in 2010. 報告番号: 甲 27288; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(情報理工学); 学位記番号: 博情第 326 号; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|R

Experiments and user evaluation show significant improvement in the quality of results produced using HITS-like methods. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{analyze the}} {{phenomenon}} of collusion {{for the purpose of}} boosting the pagerank of a node in an interlinked environment. We investigate the optimal attack pattern for a group of nodes (attackers) attempting to improve the ranking of a specific node (the victim). We consider attacks where the attackers can only manipulate their own outgoing links. We show that the optimal attacks in this scenario are uncoordinated, i. e. the attackers link directly to the victim and no one else; nodes do not link to each other. We also discuss optimal attack patterns for a group that wants to hide itself by not pointing directly to the victim. In these disguised attacks, the attackers link to nodes l hops away from the victim. We show that an optimal disguised attack exists and how it can be computed. The optimal disguised attack also allows us to find optimal <b>link</b> <b>farm</b> configurations.
