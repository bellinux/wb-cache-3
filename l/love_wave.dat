The waves {{generated by the}} transient excitation are identified as <b>Love</b> <b>waves</b> through the waveforms with depth, phase velocity, and amplitude characteristics.

It was shown from a comparison of both Sato's and Alsop's solutions that the effects of body waves scattered at the vertical continuity are not negligible. In the case of the structure with a slant discontinuity, {{it was found that the}} smaller the slant angle of discontinuity the larger the amplitude of reflected <b>Love</b> <b>waves.</b> Secondly, the problem of <b>Love</b> <b>waves</b> propagating through a structure with a convexity was examined.

Furthermore, we studied the {{characteristics of}} <b>Love</b> <b>waves</b> propagating through the structures of the Tokyo metropolitan area from the viewpoint of an earthquake disaster counterplan. The finite element solutions for the models close to the real structures gave about a two-fold amplification at the period about 15 sec in the northern part of the 23 wards of Tokyo in comparison with the solutions assuming the horizontal layers.

Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911. They form a distinct class, different from other types of seismic waves, such as P-waves and S-waves (both body waves), or Rayleigh waves (another type of surface wave).

40|$|Industry best {{practices}} for estimating viscoelastic soil properties employ either crosshole seismic surveys, or ex-situ laboratory testing. The former method can be costly, and its {{area of investigation}} limited to a few meters. The latter method samples only a tiny volume from the research area, and requires that samples be disturbed from their native condition. We investigated an alternative method that uses <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> inversion to estimate layer geometry, shear modulus, and soil viscosity. We derived a method for determining the complex velocity of <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> modes in horizontally layered viscoelastic media, and used the method to investigate the behavior and propagation of the <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> fundamental mode and first three overtones in one, two, and three layered media. We studied the evolution of <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> modes with increasing frequency, and found that roots representing the complex velocities of <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> modes evolve in pairs, with one root originating from along the real axis, and the other root originating from along the imaginary axis. In all cases studied, we observed that only one root from each pair was expressed as a propagating wave. The simultaneous propagation of multiple <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> modes poses a challenge to their separation and analysis. We developed a technique for separating <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> modes and used the information thus obtained to produce dispersion and attenuation relationships. We characterized the technique, and demonstrated its viability using synthetic data. Using these dispersion and attenuation relationships, we used the Gauss-Newton inversion method to deduce best-fit layer property models. We investigated the method 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to constraints on model properties, and to the types of data used in inversion. For a single-layer soil model, {{we found that the}} method gives reasonable estimates of layer thickness, shear modulus, and viscosity. For two and three-layer systems, we found it necessary to constrain layer thickness in order to obtain consistent estimates of shear modulus and velocity. We thus conclude that the <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> method is best used for extending estimates obtained using crosshole or downhole information as a control. In some cases, we found it difficult to ascertain, a-priori, which of the modes from each pair was manifested in the data. When the wrong root is chosen, the model may converge to erroneous soil property estimates. We recommend that future work be directed at developing techniques for ensuring that the correct root is used in the inversion model.

In this study, {{two kinds of}} acoustic wave sensors are adopted as the cell-based biosensors to investigate the biomechanical and biological behaviors of cells, the quartz thickness shear mode (TSM) resonator and <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> sensor. For the first part, the quartz TSM resonator is applied to detect the structural and mechanical properties of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSCs), which are one kind of newly discovered adult cells in tendons, and the platelets from blood. Through the TSM resonator, the related viscoelastic properties of cells are extracted, which could indicate the state of cells in different physiological conditions.

We inferred that the predominant wave packet or {{phase in the}} T–T component is the fundamental mode of the <b>Love</b> <b>wave.</b> Because no other significant wave packet was visible in the obtained T–T signals, the higher modes of the <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> were not strongly excited in this frequency range; thus, it would have existed only at higher frequencies. The outstanding fundamental <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> {{is consistent with the}} observational and theoretical study by Hatayama et al. (1995). They reported that the fundamental mode of the <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> predominant in the later part of the observed ground motion in the Osaka basin was excited by large, deep earthquakes and that the first higher mode of the basin-induced <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> cannot exist in frequencies less than 0.5  Hz in {{the central part of the}} basin.

The Kanto basin contains thick Neogene sediments of the Miura group above pre-Neogene bedrock (Ito et al. 2016). The S-wave velocity inside the basin gradually increases with depth (e.g., Takemura et al. 2015). The Osaka basin is smaller than the Kanto basin and has a clear unconformity at the sediment–bedrock boundary with a large jump in S-wave velocity. The S-wave velocity in the sediments is less than 1.0  km/s (e.g., Sekiguchi et al. 2016). The difference of the velocity structure in the sedimentary basin would cause a difference in excitation of the modes.|$|E

The EGFs principally contain Rayleigh and <b>Love</b> <b>wave</b> energy and our focus is placed on utilizing these signals between 5 - and 15 -sec period. Our approach and the results of several tests based exclusively on Rayleigh waves were described in detail by Barmin et al. (2011).

Phase-matched filters are a class of linear filters in which the Fourier phase of the filter is made equal to that of a given signal. Herrin and Goforth (1977) described an iterative technique which can be used to find a phase-matched filter for a particular component of a seismic signal.
