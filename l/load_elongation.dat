40|$|A {{device to}} {{determine}} the operable failure mode of mechanically fastened lightweight composite joints by measuring the hole elongation of a bolted joint is disclosed. The double-lap joint test apparatus comprises a stud, a test specimen having a hole, two load transfer plates, and linear displacement measuring instruments. The test specimen is sandwiched between the two load transfer plates and clamped together with the stud. Spacer washers are placed between the test specimen and each load transfer plate to provide a known, controllable area for the determination of clamping forces around the hole of the specimen attributable to bolt torque. The spacer washers also provide a gap for the mounting of reference angles {{on each side of}} the test specimen. Under tensile <b>loading,</b> <b>elongation</b> of the hole of the test specimen causes the stud to move away from the reference angles. This displacement is measured by the voltage output of two linear displacement measuring instruments that are attached to the stud and remain in contact with the reference angles throughout the tensile loading.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purposes}} of this study were: to compare the strength (single strand breaking load and loop breaking <b>load),</b> the <b>elongation</b> and the evenness of four types represented by 11 brands of polyester sewing threads available on the market in Corvallis, Oregon in January, 1976; to determine whether there were differences in the strength and elongation of black and white threads; and to find the correlations between: the single strand breaking load and the loop breaking load of a thread; the single strand breaking <b>load</b> and the <b>elongation</b> of a thread; and the breaking load and the evenness of a thread. The four types of thread were: corespun polyester/cotton 2 -ply, corespun polyester/cotton 3 -ply, short staple spun polyester and tow spun polyester. Some differences were observed among different types and among various brands within the same type of thread in every property that was investigated. In comparing the single strand breaking loads, corespun 3 -ply threads were significantly stronger than the corespun 2 -ply thread of the same brand; corespun 3 -ply threads exhibited no significant differences from tow spun threads; short staple spun threads were significantly weaker than corespun 3 -ply and tow spun threads. Comparisons of loop breaking load indicated that tow spun threads still performed best, followed by short staple spun threads. Corespun 3 -ply threads were weaker than both tow spun threads and short staple spun threads. The corespun 2 -ply thread was the weakest of all. Corespun 3 -ply threads had better extensibility than the corespun 2 -ply thread and the short staple spun threads; short staple spun threads, in turn, were more extensible than tow spun threads. With a few exceptions, no significant differences in the breaking <b>load</b> and <b>elongation</b> of black and white thread occurred. The evenness of all 11 brands of thread was similar. Based on this study, the tow spun threads would be a good choice for fabrics with normal extensibility. Two of the three corespun 3 -ply threads would be suitable for fabrics which stretch more. No significant correlations were found between: single strand breaking load and loop breaking load; single strand breaking load and evenness; and loop breaking load and evenness. Although a high positive correlation between single strand breaking <b>load</b> and <b>elongation</b> was not significant at the. 05 level, the relationship appears fruitful for further study because only the tow spun threads and one of the short staple spun threads had a much lower rate of elongation relative to the single strand breaking load...|$|R

Hence the tensile lap joint test and beam-to-column connection test were conducted on CFS countersunk bolted connection to study the load-elongation behaviour and moment-rotation behaviour respectively.

CNW have demonstrated the capability to enhance the properties of a polymer matrix at low filler loading. In this study, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) bionanocomposites were prepared using the solution casting technique, by incorporating the PLA with the CNW obtained from an oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed no significant changes in the PLA peak positions, which indicates that incorporating the CNW into the PLA did not result in any significant changes in the chemical structure of the PLA. Thermogravimetric analysis, on the other hand, revealed that the bionanocomposites (PLA-CNW) had better thermal stability than the pure PLA. The tensile strength of PLA-CNW increased by 84 % with the addition of 3 parts of CNW per hundred resins (phr), and decreased thereafter. Moreover, a linear relationship was observed between the Young's modulus and CNW <b>loading.</b> <b>Elongation</b> at break, however, decreased with the addition of 1 -phr CNW, and remained constant with further addition. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that agglomeration of CNW occurred at 5 -phr loading, consistent with the tensile strength results.

40|$|The <b>load</b> <b>elongation</b> {{behaviour}} of geotextiles is decisively {{influenced by}} the surrounding soil. This influence on behaviour has previously been quantifiable only insufficiently and cannot therefore be used in current dimensioning procedures. This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the <b>load</b> <b>elongation</b> behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed air bellows are installed. These compressed air bellows are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (mechanically bonded fabrics, thermally bonded fabric, woven textile) were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the <b>load</b> <b>elongation</b> behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non wovens, from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.

Furthermore, the impact of osteoblast growth on the various nanofiber scaffolds stability was determined. Nanofiber matrices composed of PLLA, PLLA-collagen, or BMP- 2 –incorporated PLLA were produced from different solvents by electrospinning. Standardized test samples of each nanofiber scaffold were subjected to failure protocol before or after incubation in the presence of osteoblasts over a period of 22 days under osteoinductive conditions. PLLA nanofibers electrospun from hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) showed a higher strain and tended to have increased maximum loads and Young's modulus compared to PLLA fibers spun from dichloromethane. In addition, they had a higher resistance during incubation in the presence of cells. Functionalization by incorporation of growth factors increased Young's modulus, independent of the solvent used. However, the incorporation of growth factors using the HFIP system resulted in a loss of strain. Similar results were observed when PLLA was blended with different ratios of collagen. Summarizing the results, this study indicates that different functionalization strategies influence the mechanical stability of PLLA nanofibers.

A homeostatic datum point is assumed when constant force is applied to both the medial and lateral soft tissues structures. In order to validate this assumption and redefine the datum point for measurement of soft tissue imbalance, an electronic measuring system was developed to record the soft tissue imbalance at O. 25 mm distraction intervals of the knee. This soft tissue measuring system consists of a instrument containing electronic transducers, an condi tioning unit and a portable computer. The surgical analogue surgical instrument introduces a pivot to the centre of the knee in the coronal plane so that the clockwise and counterclockwise moments produced by the collateral soft tissues produce an angular deviation at the equilibrium position. Measurements of angular deviation and separation gap are recorded by the electronic transducers. Ten patients were measured whilst undergoing total knee replacement at Bretby Hall Orthopaedic Hospital. The mean change in angular deviation over an average distraction of the knee of 7. 15 mm was 0. 68 ' {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 8. It is concluded that this is an acceptable error band compared to current methods of measurement and soft tissue imbalance can be measured independently of the passive compressive loads through the knee. The development of the instrumentation within this thesis has resulted in patent applications in both the U. K and the U. S. A...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} variety {{and use of}} lining fabrics, consumers have become concerned over choices for lining fabrics which have good serviceability properties. The major {{purpose of this study}} was to secure some information on the physical properties of lining fab-rics to help consumers in the selection of lining fabrics which will give good serviceability. Eight lining fabrics made of one fiber [...] two fabrics each of cot-ton, rayon, acetate and polyester [...] were examined for their service-ability properties such as resistance to abrasion, breaking <b>load</b> and <b>elongation</b> of yarn and fabric, tearing strength, resistance to yarn slippage, dimensional stability and resistance to wrinkling. They were all white, plain weave, light-weight and commonly-sold lining fabrics. The experimental fabrics were analyzed for their basic charac-teristics such as fabric count, weight, thickness, twist and yarn num...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{irregularities}} {{are inherent}} to textile fibers, natural fibers in particular. This series of papers examines {{the impact of}} fiber irregularity on the mechanical behavior of textile fibers. In the first part, the effect of fiber dimensional irregularities on the tensile behavior of linear elastic fibers is examined, using the finite element method (FEM). Fiber dimensional irregularities are simulated with sine waves of different magnitude and frequency. The results indicate that increasing the level or magnitude of irregularity will decrease the breaking <b>load,</b> breaking <b>elongation</b> and method Young’s modulus of the fiber, while increasing the frequency of irregularity will decrease the breaking load and method Young’s modulus, but the breaking elongation will increase. Fiber dimensional irregularity and the gauge length effect are also simulated in this study. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of particulate filled polymers are influenced significantly by interfacial interactions. The adhesion between the polymer and the filler {{depends on the}} area of the interface and the strength of the interaction. The former is related to specific area of the filler while the strength of the interaction can be modified by surface treatment. This study is focused on comparing the reinforcing ability of muscovite and phlogopite with and without surface treatment. Muscovite and phlogopite are two common forms of mica. Mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, tensile strength, elongation and impact strength were used to compare the reinforcing ability of muscovite and phlogopite in EVA composites. The Young's modulus of the surface treated and non-surface treated composites increased with an increase in filler loading. Composites reinforced with muscovite had similar moduli compared to composites reinforced with phlogopite. The tensile strength of phlogopite reinforced composites increased with an increase in filler content while that of muscovite reinforced composites remained constant. Surface modification by both silane and stearic acid reduced the tensile strength of phlogopite reinforced composites. The tensile strength of stearic acid treated muscovite reinforced composites improved but not to the same extent as the silane treated composites. Both muscovite and phlogopite lead to a lowering of the impact strength at high filler loadings while the tensile impact strength of both muscovite and phlogopite reinforced composites improved when using silane and stearic acid. In non-surface treated systems, muscovite reinforced composites showed an initial increase in elongation while the elongation of phlogopite reinforced composites decreased with an increase in filler <b>loading.</b> <b>Elongation</b> at maximum <b>load</b> values, however, increased at low filler loadings, when using stearic acid. It can be concluded that stearic acid is not an effective coupling agent for mica/EVA composites and that the use of silane for phlogopite reinforced composites does not offer any improvement in {{mechanical properties}}.
