500|$|Salinger was {{assigned}} to a counter-intelligence division, for which he used his proficiency in French and German to interrogate prisoners of war. In April 1945 he entered a liberated concentration camp, probably one of Dachau's sub-camps. Salinger earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and served in five campaigns. Salinger's experiences in the war affected him emotionally. He was hospitalized {{for a few weeks}} for combat stress reaction after Germany was defeated, and he later told his daughter: [...] "You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely, no matter how <b>long</b> <b>you</b> live." [...] Both of his biographers speculate that Salinger drew upon his wartime experiences in several stories, such as [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor", which is narrated by a traumatized soldier. Salinger continued to write while serving in the army, publishing several stories in slick magazines such as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. He also continued to submit stories to The New Yorker, but with little success; it rejected all of his submissions from 1944 to 1946, a group of 15poems in 1945 alone.|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how <b>long</b> <b>you</b> had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes you wonder if the century, not Senior, has lost its way." [...] Since his death, no Oriole has worn Cal Sr.'s number 7, although the number has not been officially retired.|$|E
500|$|The four-piece band {{struggled}} {{to come up}} with new material for an album, but in February 1968 recorded Wright's [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] and Waters' [...] "Julia Dream". In early February it was announced that the Waters-penned track, [...] "Corporal Clegg" [...] would be the band's next single, however, due to pressure from the label, the song was earmarked for the album, and [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] was released in April as a single, with [...] "Julia Dream" [...] on the B-side. Throughout April, the band was taking stock of the songs recorded up to that point. Waters blocked the release of the two tracks, [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] and [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream", on the album, though the band retained [...] "Jugband Blues", and the Waters-written [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] on which Barrett played. With not enough material to fill the album's last 12 minutes, the band started piecing together several pieces of material that was to become the title track of the album, [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets". Mason and Waters planned the track out {{as if it were an}} architectural design, including peaks and troughs. Producer Smith didn't like the song, stating to them that they [...] "just can't do this, it's too <b>long.</b> <b>You</b> have to write three-minute songs." [...] On 25 June, the band recorded another session for BBC Radio's Top Gear; the session featured two tracks from Saucerful: [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] and a shortened retitled version of the title track, titled here as [...] "The Massed Gadgets of Hercules".|$|E

Several days later, Vito went back to the restaurant and apologized, saying, [...] "Sometimes you tell a lie so <b>long,</b> <b>you</b> don't know when to stop." [...] The two men reconciled.

Gordon unveiled the drink at One Sixty Blue, a restaurant co-owned by Michael Jordan. The drink was made with white tea, which has a very high amount of antioxidants, and the most polyphenols of any tea.|$|E

2500|$|Minna {{pursued a}} career as an actress, specialising in female {{juvenile}} lead roles ("Erste Liebhaberin") in tragedies. She was in demand by many German theatre companies, and appeared in Dessau, Altenburg, Magdeburg and Dresden before she met Richard Wagner. In a letter dated December 27, 1833, Minna sets out her conditions for employment: she would not accept guest appearances, but expected the leading tragic and young heroine parts. Her fee was 600 thaler plus travelling expenses. While she was praised for her abilities as an actress, her physical charms also brought her admiration. One anonymous suitor wrote to her: [...] "When Nature created you, O Fair One, she broke the mold and never more may create so fair an image.
