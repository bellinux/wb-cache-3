5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against <b>Lebanon</b> and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from <b>Lebanon</b> in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however <b>Lebanon</b> considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad.|$|E

5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and <b>Lebanon.</b> Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to <b>Lebanon.</b> The Pennsylvania tore down the original <b>Lebanon</b> passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The <b>Lebanon</b> Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E

5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern <b>Lebanon,</b> Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in <b>Lebanon</b> as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern <b>Lebanon</b> since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in <b>Lebanon.</b>|$|E

5|$|Once again, the {{official}} end of hostilities did not spell {{an end to}} fighting and Israel remained engaged in <b>Lebanon</b> for years to come. When the Syrians introduced the SA-8 Gecko into <b>Lebanon</b> in July 1982, IAF Phantoms were sent to hunt down four launchers on July 24 and two were claimed by 69 Squadron. Up to its very disbandment in 1994, the squadron also took part in repeated strikes against terrorist organizations operating from <b>Lebanon.</b> On one such operation on October 16, 1986, a bomb exploded immediately after release from Kurnass 306, forcing both crew to eject. The pilot, Yishai Aviram, was rescued by an IAF AH-1 Cobra, but navigator Ron Arad was captured {{by members of the}} Shi'a Amal Movement.
