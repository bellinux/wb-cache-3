5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated level {{crossing}} and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the <b>line</b> <b>are</b> to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are being}} made to Union Station, which is the busiest {{passenger}} transportation facility in Canada, {{and is expected to}} have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements currently underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other longer term options such as a second downtown station and/or connections to a future Relief Subway <b>Line</b> <b>are</b> also being studied to meet future demand.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year.

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing <b>line</b> <b>are</b> carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real <b>line),</b> <b>are</b> also members of this space.|$|E

The local tracks of the Culver <b>Line</b> <b>are</b> served by the F service, {{as well as the}} G between Bergen Street and Church Avenue.

Together, the railways create an uninterrupted rail link between the port city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports, and the former intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Ofoten Line and the Iron Ore <b>Line</b> <b>are</b> two {{railroad}} lines {{which were}} built to allow iron ore to be hauled from the LKAB's mines in Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget in Sweden to Luleå on the Baltic Sea in Sweden and to Narvik on the Norwegian Sea in Norway. Historically, these lines were {{operated by the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in Norway and the Swedish State Railways (SJ) in Sweden, but in 1996 the operations, but not the infrastructure, were transferred to the new company Malmtrafik i Kiruna (MTAB), {{a joint venture between}} LKAB, NSB and SJ, and its Norwegian subsidiary Malmtrafikk (MTAS). At the time, the line was using El 15 and Dm3 locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission <b>line</b> <b>are</b> derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E
