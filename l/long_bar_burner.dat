40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} a high {{magnetic}} field on the precipitation behaviour of the primary Al 3 Zr phase are investigated. With and without the field, the primary Al 3 Zr crystals possess three morphologies - small tabular crystals in the deposit layer, <b>long</b> <b>bars</b> and dendritic crystals. The dendritic crystals are probably those surviving from the initial material. The tabular crystals in the deposit layer are those surviving from the heating stage, whereas the <b>long</b> <b>bars</b> are those formed during cooling. With the field, the tabular crystals in the deposit layer and the <b>long</b> <b>bars</b> tend to orient with the direction parallel to the field direction, but {{the orientation of the}} dendritic crystals is less affected. The orientation of the crystals in the deposit layer arises from their magnetocrystalline anisotropy, but that of the <b>long</b> <b>bars</b> and dendritic crystals is disturbed by gravity and the formation of compound twins, respectively. Increased Zr content raises the precipitation amount of the primary Al 3 Zr crystals but weakens the alignment tendency of the tabular ones in the deposit layer. The weakness of the alignment arises from interaction between the crystals...|$|R

The laser induced stress intensity was evaluated from the dynamic strain measured by small semiconductor strain gauges attached on the <b>long</b> <b>bar.</b> As a result, the impulse stress induced on the human enamel increased with increasing the laser energy, and related to the volume of the prepared cavity. The laser induced stress for the removal of the unit volume of human enamel was 0. 03 Pa/mm 3...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} {{dynamical}} effects on disk stars of a “long bar ” in the Milky Way by inserting a triaxial rotating bar into an axisymmetric disk+bulge+dark halo potential and integrating 3 -D orbits of 10 4 tracer stars {{over a period}} of 5 Gyr. The <b>long</b> <b>bar</b> has been detected via “clump giants ” in the IR by López-Corredoira et al. (2007), and is estimated to have semi-major axes of (3. 9 × 0. 6 × 0. 1) kpc and a mass of 6 × 10 9 M⊙. We find such a structure has striking effects on disk orbits. The <b>long</b> <b>bar</b> is able to move considerable inner disk material into prominent stellar streams in the solar neighborhood, apparently inconsistently with observations; furthermore it can eject inner disk material to considerable heights (several kpc) above the Galactic plane in a manner which may be inconsistent with observations. The effects of the <b>long</b> <b>bar</b> can be greatly ameliorated by reducing its density and/or making it considerably thicker vertically. These effects are under continuing study...|$|R
