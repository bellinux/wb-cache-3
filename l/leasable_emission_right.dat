40|$|In {{order to}} provide timely {{authoritative}} guidance to facilitate reporting under the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRIC 3 <b>Emission</b> <b>Rights</b> through the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) in 2004. The IFRIC consensus concludes that ETS gives rises to an intangible asset for <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> held, a provisional liability for <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> purchased to offset emissions, and a government grant when <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> are allocated for less than their fair value. The withdrawal of IFRIC 3 {{and the absence of}} authoritative accounting guidance for <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> provide a window of opportunity to reconsider accounting for <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> from an alternative perspective. Informed by the tenets of social ecology as an environmental ethics approach, this thesis seeks to critically examine and problematise the accounting recognition of <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> in IFRIC 3. Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is used as a critical research method to examine texts from three sources: IFRIC 3 <b>Emission</b> <b>Rights,</b> draft IFRIC 3 comment letters and two IASB press releases on the withdrawal of IFRIC 3. CDA consists of three levels of analysis: (1) Text analysis: who is saying what? (2) Discourse analysis: what does the text mean? (3) Social analysis: who are the key players in the discourse construction? Key findings of CDA show that while the proposed recognition of <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> is consistent with the IASB Conceptual Framework 1 and existing accounting standards, it fails to reflect the ecological substance of ETS, of which <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> become an integral component. CDA highlights that a mainstream accounting framework does not comfortably address the complex nature of <b>emission</b> <b>rights.</b> Furthermore, this thesis argues that the mainstream accounting approach adopted in IFRIC 3 reinforces the status quo of a business-as-usual approach and represents a superficial approach to a complex environmental and social issue.

40|$|Abstract. Existing {{literature}} on equity considerations for {{climate change mitigation}} has largely focused on fair burden-sharing at an inter-national level without adequate attention to equity concerns at the intra-national level. However, disparities between regions and income groups within nations pose perhaps more equity concerns over climate change mitigation than those between nations. While international equity can be agreed upon via political negotiation among nations, the poor in both developed and developing countries may not be guaranteed their fair allocation of <b>emissions</b> <b>rights</b> because the necessary institutional framework {{has yet to be}} established at both international and national levels. This paper distinguishes three parts of <b>emissions</b> <b>rights</b> and discusses their transferability in view of equity concerns. The author suggests that basic necessity <b>emissions</b> <b>rights</b> are not transferable and non-necessity emissions are fully marketable, while individual contributions to state are subject to collective decision-making or political manipulation at the international level. The exact share of each of the three parts is subject to further investigation, but unlimited free trading of <b>emissions</b> <b>rights</b> is likely to result in equity concerns at both inter- and intra-national levels.

As the largest participant in the CDM market, China shoulders the biggest proportion of market risk. Among the studies on CDM in China, few have focused upon the legal aspect of CDM, which is crucial in defending developers’ interests. To fill this research gap in {{making the transition from}} policy to law, this paper claims that carbon <b>emission</b> <b>right,</b> which is the basis of trade, should be attributed as a property right in Property Law of People’s Republic of China. The present study will discuss the characteristics of carbon emission, definition, and legal attribution of carbon <b>emission</b> <b>right.</b> The valid object of carbon <b>emission</b> <b>right</b> in the CDM market under Property Law should be certified emissions reductions (CERs). The usufructuary right could be specifically applied in practice to the owners’ property right on CERs in China.
