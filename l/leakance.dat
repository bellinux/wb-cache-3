50|$|The discretized surface {{equation}} is {{coupled with the}} 3-D subsurface flow equation via superposition (common node approach) or via leakage through a surficial skin layer (dual node approach). For both approaches, fully implicit coupling of the surface and subsurface flow regimes provides an integral view of the movement of water, {{as opposed to the}} traditional division of surface and subsurface regimes. Flux across the land surface is, therefore, a natural internal process allowing water to move between the surface and subsurface flow systems as governed by local flow hydrodynamics, instead of using physically artificial boundary conditions at the interface.

Test discharge was continuous at 718 gallons per minute. Observed water levels in the Upper Floridan Aquifer were influenced by regional pumping and a test-specific drawdown was not obvious. Accordingly, maximum drawdown in the Upper Floridan Aquifer caused by test pumping was estimated by comparing tidal cycle amplitudes prior to and during the test. Maximum amplitude change was about 0. 2 feet and was considered the maximum drawdown in the Upper Floridan Aquifer caused by test pumping. This drawdown and site specific hydraulic characteristics of the Upper and Lower Floridan Aquifers were applied to a ground-water flow model to simulate aquifer-test results and estimate Middle Semiconfining Unit <b>leakance.</b> Computed <b>leakance</b> was 5 x 10 - 8 per minute.

In this dissertation, the problem is posed {{within the framework of}} maximum likelihood estimation by means of an estimation criterion which includes head measurements as well as prior information of the model parameters. Parameters that can be estimated include the principal values and directions of transmissivity (or hydraulic conductivity), storativity (or specific storage), recharge rates, boundary heads or fluxes, <b>leakances,</b> and parameters controlling the error structure of the data. In transient problems, the initial steady-state of the system can also be derived and/or taken advantage of.

40|$|Estimating the {{parameters}} of groundwater flow models by automatic calibration methods is an extremely difficult problem, but one which must be solved {{in order to produce}} reliable model predictions. The data upon which the model is calibrated are usually corrupted by measurement and model structure errors which can unduly affect the values of the parameter estimates. In this dissertation the statistically robust M-estimator of Huber is used to reduce the influence of large, outlying errors in the measured head data on the values of the estimated model parameters. The robust estimation procedure is implemented in a computer program which models unconfined, steady-state and transient flow as described by the Boussinesq equation for Dupuit-type flow. The program allows the user to estimate hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, specific storage, recharge rates, <b>leakances,</b> boundary heads and boundary fluxes. The nonlinear error criterion is minimized using conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton methods coupled with both accurate and innaccurate line search algorithms. The gradient of the error criterion is efficiently computed by using the adjoint state finite element method.

40|$|A wetland in west-central Florida was {{studied to}} {{characterize}} the local hydrostratigraphic configuration of surficial deposits overlying more-permeable limestones and conceptualize groundwater recharge. Eight continuous cores were drilled through the surficial deposits and partially into the underlying limestone. A total of 111 samples were extracted from the cores for laboratory sediment analyses and testing. The surficial deposits are roughly eight meters thick and made up of upper and lower clean-sand hydrostratigraphic layers (S 1 and S 3, respectively) separated by a low-permeability layer of clayey sand (S 2). Also, a discontinuous low-permeability layer of clayey sand (S 4) lies between S 3 {{and the top of}} limestone. Equivalent hydraulic conductivity values for the S 2 and S 4 clayey layers (0. 01 and 0. 1 m/day respectively) are significantly less than those of the S 1 and S 3 sand layers (2 and 1 m/day respectively). Significant confinement between the surficial and Upper Floridan aquifers by means of a laterally extensive dense-clay unit immediately above the limestone is consistently reported elsewhere in the region, but was not encountered within the wetland. Partial confinement is apparently the result of low-permeability layers within the surficial deposits alone. Results of ground-penetrating radar and vertical head difference measurements suggest the presence of buried sinkhole features which perforate the low-permeability S 2 layer and create preferred pathways for flow or karst drains. Comparison of results between laboratory sediment testing and a site-scale aquifer performance test (APT) suggest that the primary mechanism for drainage during the APT was by vertical percolation through the S 2 layer while flow through karst drains was minimized. In this case, calculated leakances based on laboratory sediment testing are most accurate in approximation of effective <b>leakance.</b> It is predicted that as water table stages rise within the wetland, effective <b>leakance</b> will increase as flow toward karst drains becomes the more dominant mechanism for drainage. As a result, calculated leakances based on direct laboratory sediment testing are a decreasingly accurate approximation of effective <b>leakance...</b>|$|E

40|$|MODRSP is program {{used for}} calculating drawdown, velocity, storage losses and capture {{response}} functions for multi - aquifer ground -water flow systems. Capture {{is defined as}} the sum of the increase in aquifer recharge and decrease in aquifer discharge {{as a result of an}} applied stress from pumping [Bredehoeft et al., 19821. The capture phenomena treated by MODRSP are stream- aquifer <b>leakance,</b> reduction of evapotranspiration losses, <b>leakance</b> from adjacent aquifers, flows to and from prescribed head boundaries and increases or decreases in natural recharge or discharge from head dependent boundaries. The response functions are independent of the magnitude of the stresses and are dependent on the type of partial differential equation, the boundary and initial conditions and the parameters thereof, and the spatial and temporal location of stresses. The aquifers modeled may have irregular -shaped areal boundaries and non -homogeneous transmissive and storage qualities. For regional aquifers, the stresses are generally pumpages from wells. The utility of response functions arises from their capacity to be embedded in management models. The management models consist of a mathematical expression of a criterion to measure preference, and sets of constraints which act to limit the preferred actions. The response functions are incorporated into constraints that couple the hydrologic system with the management system (Maddock, 1972). MODRSP is a modification of MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1984, 1988). MODRSP uses many of the data input structures of MODFLOW, but there are major differences between the two programs. The differences are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. An abbreviated theoretical development is presented in Chapter 2, a more complete theoretical development may be found in Maddock and Lacher (1991).

In addition, the hydrologic {{properties of}} the lower Midville aquifer underlying the P, B and D Areas at the Savannah River Site were determined by a series of aquifer tests conducted in 1993 and 1994. The tests generally consisted of collecting water level and atmospheric data for 24 hours followed by a 72 hour pump test and a subsequent 72 hour recovery period.

40|$|Residual mapping is an {{automated}} groundwater-model calibration technique which rapidly identifies parameter-zone configurations, while limiting tendencies to over-parameterize. Residual mapping analyzes the model residual, or {{the difference between}} model-calculated head and spatially-interpolated observation data, for non-random trends. These trends are entered in the model as parameter zones. The values of hydrologic variables in each parameter zone are then optimized, using parameter-estimation software.

If the parameter-value ranges for adjacent zones do not have significant overlap, the zones are considered to be valid. This technique was applied to a finite-difference, transient groundwater flow model of a major municipal well field, located in west-central Florida. A computer conde automates the residual mapping process, making it practical for application to large, transient flow models.

Although obviously coupled, the response times of the lake and groundwater systems were different from one another. Typically, the adjustments in hydraulic heads occurred more rapidly than lake stage. Response times for groundwaters close to the lake were controlled by the lake because of the slow transient response in stage. However, the influence of the lake declined toward the basin boundaries. This behavior occurred because critical parameters controlling the response-time behavior of the groundwater system (e. g., recharge rate) differed from those controlling the response-time behavior of the lake (e. g., bed <b>leakance).</b> An improved understanding of lake–groundwater behaviors have the potential to evaluate how lakes function as systems for recording paleoclimates...|$|E

Soil cores suggest that the RGA consists of a thin sandy facies (2 to 6 feet) {{at the top of}} a thicker (> 10 feet) gravelly facies. Previous analyses have not considered any permeability contrast between the two facies. To assess the accuracy of this assumption, TVA personnel conducted borehole flowmeter tests at wells MW 108 and PW 1. Well MW 79 could not be tested. The high K sand unit is probably 10 times more permeable than comparable zone in the gravelly portion of the RGA. Previous analyses of the three multi-well aquifer tests do not use the same conceptual aquifer model. Data analysis for one pumping test assumed that <b>leakance</b> was significant. Data analysis for another pumping test assumed that a geologic boundary was significant. By collectively analyzing all three tests with the borehole flowmeter results, the inconsistency among the three pumping tests can be explained.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the development, calibration {{and use of}} quantitative, predictive management model for the groundwater in the Utah portion of the Cache Valley in northern Utah. The quasi-three-dimensional finite difference computer model was adapted from the U. S. Geological Survey’s Trescott and Larson model and simulates the groundwater levels and flows in the groundwater basin. The variable spacing grid system is 23 nodes x 38 x 2 and represents the complex natural system by a simpler approximation with one unconfined and one confined aquifer and the appropriate boundary and initial conditions. River nodes, spring nodes, and constant head nodes were developed to simulate the real interactions of the aquifers with streams, springs and reservoirs. Evapotranspiration from the land surface is also represented by the program. The program was calibrated by adjusting the model parameters such as transmissivity, storativity, <b>leakance,</b> river nodes, spring nodes, etc. until the predicted values of head and flow were nearly {{the same as the}} observed conditions. Calibrations with 1969 conditions and then a transient-state comparison with the water level change maps of 1969 to 1972.

40|$|Discrepancies in {{simulated}} transmissivities of the Upper Floridan aquifer {{were identified}} in the overlap areas of seven ground-water flow models in southwest and west-central Florida. Discrepancies in transmissivity are generally the result of uncertainty and spatial variability in other aquifer properties. All ground-water flow models were used to simulate the potentiometric surface of the Upper Floridan aquifer for approximated steady-state conditions from August 1993 through July 1994 using the time-independent hydraulic properties assigned to the models. Specified-head and general-head boundary data used to generate boundary conditions appropriate to these models {{were obtained from the}} estimated annual average heads for the steady-state period. Water-use data and the approximated surficial aquifer system water table were updated to reflect conditions during the approximated steady-state period. Simulated heads at control points, vertical leakage rates to the Upper Floridan aquifer, and spring flows were used to analyze the discrepancies in transmissivities in model overlap areas. Factors causing transmissivity discrepancies in model overlap areas include differences among directly applied recharge rates, differences among model simulated vertical <b>leakance</b> values assigned to the overlaying confining unit resulting in varying leakage rates to the Upper Floridan aquifer, differences in heads and conductances used in general-head boundary cells, and differences in transmissivities assigned in the vicinity of springs.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{ground water}} flow model {{was created in}} 1978 and revised in 1981 to predict the drawdown effects of a proposed municipal wellfield permitted to withdraw 30 million gallons per day (mgd; 1. 1 × 105 m 3 /day) {{of water from the}} semiconfined Floridan Aquifer system. The predictions are {{based on the assumption that}} water levels in the semiconfined Floridan Aquifer reach a long-term, steady-state condition within a few days of initiation of pumping. Using this assumption, a 75 day simulation without water table recharge, pumping at the maximum permitted rates, was considered to represent a worst-case condition and the greatest drawdowns that could be experienced during wellfield operation. This method of predicting wellfield effects was accepted by the permitting agency. For this post audit, observed drawdowns were derived by taking the difference between pre-pumping and post-pumping potentiometric surface levels. Comparison of predicted and observed drawdowns suggests that actual drawdown over a 12 year period exceeds predicted drawdown by a factor of two or more. Analysis of the source of error in the 1981 predictions suggests that the values used for transmissivity, storativity. specific yield, and <b>leakance</b> are reasonable at the wellfield scale. Simulation using actual 1980 – 1992 pumping rates improves the agreement between predicted and observed drawdowns. The principal source of error is the assumption that water levels in a semiconfined aquifer achieve a steady-state condition after a few days or weeks of pumping. Simulations using a version of the 1981 model modified to include recharge and evapotranspiration suggest that it can take hundreds of days or several years for water levels in the linked Surficial and Floridan Aquifers to reach an apparent steady-state condition, and that slow declines in levels continue for years after the initiation of pumping. While the 1981 “impact” model can be used for reasonably predicting short-term, wellfield-scale effects of pumping, using a 75 day long simulation without recharge to predict the long-term behavior of the wellfield was an inappropriate application, resulting in significant underprediction of wellfield effects...|$|E
40|$|Palas Basin is a {{semi-arid}} closed basin {{located in}} the Central Anatolia region of Turkey. The major economic activity in the basin is agriculture; therefore, both surface water and groundwater are used for irrigation. However, intensive use of water resources threatens the hydrologic sustainability of a lake ecosystem (Tuzla Lake) {{located in the}} basin. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between agricultural water uses in the Palas Basin and water flows to the Tuzla Lake using groundwater flow model developed with the FREEWAT platform. The model grid with 250 m x 250 m resolution was created based on the entire watershed. Two hydrostratigraphic units were identified. The source terms defined in the model were rainfall recharge and the sink terms were evapotranspiration and wells. The model was run for one year at steady state conditions. Three scenarios were simulated to understand the effect of groundwater use on the lake hydrology. The first scenario assumed {{that there was no}} groundwater abstraction. As the second and third water management scenario, the model was run with 50 % less and % 50 more groundwater abstraction than that of the reference conditions. The model successfully simulated the direction of groundwater flow and groundwater levels in the basin. Annual groundwater recharge was simulated as 5. 27 million m 3. Groundwater losses were due to pumping (1. 49 million m 3 /yr), <b>leakance</b> to Değirmen River (2. 25 million m 3 /yr) and seepage to Tuzla Lake (1. 53 million m 3 /yr). Water flows to Tuzla Lake were significantly related to pumping rates. Increasing groundwater pumping rates reduces groundwater flows to Tuzla Lake and lowers lake water levels. No groundwater abstraction and reduction in groundwater pumping rates increase water flows to Tuzla Lake and cause higher water levels. This analysis showed that protection of hydrologic characteristics of Tuzla Lake is only possible with more control on groundwater abstraction...|$|E
40|$|In the buried-valley {{aquifers}} of {{the western}} and central glaciated plains of North America, assemblages of permeable outwash facies may form large and productive regional aquifer systems. In glacially derived aquifers {{it is common to}} have low-permeability facies (e. g., till or lacustrine clay) juxtaposed with high-permeability facies (e. g., sand and gravel outwash). The heterogeneity in the Miami buried-valley aquifer system in southwestern Ohio was examined as an example. Practical approaches for evaluating the lithological uncertainty were explored in the areas lacking data. The facies types were represented by an indicator random function, which exhibited an isotropic, exponential covariance structure. A comparative, quantitative analysis of the facies boundaries was accomplished using three different indicator geostatistical methodologies: (1) hydrostratigraphic analysis with indicator point kriging and probability cutoff, (2) hydrostratigraphic analysis with conditional indicator simulation, and (3) <b>leakance</b> zonation with indicator block kriging and grid-cell averaging. With the first method, it was shown in a theoretical analysis that the 0. 5 probability level computed by indicator point kriging may or may not correspond to the boundary between high- and low-permeability facies, depending upon the level of data support. With the data support for the Miami aquifer system, the 0. 65 probability contour gave an areal distribution of low-permeability facies that honored both the original data and the declustered global mean of the original indicator data. The first and third methods gave rise to a single model, in which the facies distribution was best in some local accuracy sense. The second method gave rise to many alternative models, in which the global texture of the facies distribution took precedence over local estimation of the expected value. The first two methods involved evaluating the geometry of the boundaries between the facies types in advance of creating the grid of the numerical ground-water model, so that grid cell boundaries could be made to correspond to facies boundaries. The third method was useful when updating an existing ground-water model that has grid cell boundaries not necessarily corresponding to facies boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to better {{characterize}} parameters influencing the exchange of surface water in south Florida’s C- 111 canal and Biscayne aquifer using the analytical model STWT 1. A three-step model evaluation framework was implemented as follows: (1) qualitative parameter ranking by comparing two Morris method sampling strategies, (2) quantitative variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol’s method, and (3) estimation of parameter posterior probability distributions and statistics using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimator (GLUE) methodology. Results indicated that the original Morris random sampling method underestimated total parameter effects compared to the improved global Morris sampling strategy. However, parameter rankings from the two sampling methods were similar. For the STWT 1 model, only four out of the six parameters analyzed were important for predicting water table response to canal stage and recharge fluctuations. Morris ranking in order of decreasing importance resulted in specific yield (ASY), aquifer saturated thickness (AB), horizontal hydraulic conductivity (AKX), canal <b>leakance</b> (XAA), vertical hydraulic conductivity (AKZ), and half-width of canal (XZERO). Sobol’s sensitivity indices for the four most critical parameters revealed that summation of first-order parameter effects was 1. 0, indicating that STWT 1 behaved as an additive model or negligible parameter interactions. We estimated parameter values of 0. 07 to 0. 14 for ASY, 11, 000 to 14, 300 m d- 1 for AKX, 13. 4 to 18. 3 m for AB, and 99. 8 to 279 m for XAA. The estimated values were within the range of values estimated using more complex methods at nearby sites. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency and root mean square error for estimated parameters ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 95 and from 4 to 7 cm, respectively. This study demonstrates a simple and inexpensive way to characterize hydrogeological parameters controlling groundwater-surface interactions in any region with aquifers that are highly permeable without using standard pumping tests or canal drawdown experiments. Hydrogeological parameters estimated using this approach could be used as starting values in large-scale numerical simulations...|$|E
