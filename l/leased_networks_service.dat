Its purpose is to help build community understanding of the likely price and reliability impacts of <b>leasing</b> <b>network</b> assets, based on evidence from interstate and independent analysis of data. The report concludes that, in the Australian experience, privatised network businesses generally operate more efficiently, resulting in lower price increases compared to their government-owned counterparts.

30|$|Using {{a packet}} facade, <b>network</b> <b>services</b> {{do not need}} to strip the {{protocol}} headers from received packets to interact with packets. Thus, when non-essential <b>network</b> <b>services</b> are omitted from devices with low resources, the remaining <b>network</b> <b>services</b> can still interpret the received packets. In addition, packet attributes remain associated with a packet even if network protocols are omitted at intermediate nodes. Thus, when lightweight nodes are provided with simpler versions of the <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> these simpler services can inspect the packet attributes that were added by more advanced <b>network</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an extended}} definition of <b>service</b> <b>networks.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>network</b> definition, {{which can be}} used for classifying <b>service</b> <b>networks,</b> comprises two parts: the <b>service</b> <b>network</b> declaration and the <b>service</b> <b>network</b> specification. The <b>service</b> <b>network</b> specification consists of the specification of the network characteristics, the node characteristics, and the link characteristics. Each of these three characteristics comprises a set of criteria. One fraction of the criteria has been identified through literature research on <b>services,</b> <b>networked</b> organizations, and <b>service</b> <b>network</b> concepts. The remaining fraction of criteria {{is the result of a}} case study analysis. The <b>service</b> <b>network</b> case study has been taken from the information technology sector (i. e., the network of Cloud computing services).

40|$|The {{automated}} {{identification of}} <b>network</b> <b>service</b> depen-dencies remains a challenging {{problem in the}} administra-tion of large distributed systems. Advances in developing solutions for this problem have immediate and tangible benefits to operators in the field. When the dependencies of the <b>services</b> in a <b>network</b> are better-understood, plan-ning for and responding to system failures becomes more efficient, minimizing downtime and managing resources more effectively. This paper introduces three novel techniques {{to assist in the}} automatic identification of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> depen-dencies through passively monitoring and analyzing net-work traffic, including a logarithm-based ranking scheme aimed at more accurate detection of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> de-pendencies with lower false positives, an inference tech-nique for identifying the dependencies involving infre-quently used <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> and an approach for au-tomated discovery of clusters of <b>network</b> <b>services</b> config-ured for load balancing or backup purposes. This paper also presents the experimental evaluation of these tech-niques using real-world traffic collected from a produc-tion network. The experimental results demonstrate that these techniques advance {{the state of the art}} in automated detection and inference of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> dependencies.

40|$|This paper aims at {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution through a closer examination of the context of mobile handsets. It aims first to establish quantitatively that mobile handsets are a determinant of mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution patterns, and second, to develop a consistent perspective capable of explaining the evolution of various mobile <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> Despite the fact that mobile handsets are indispensable to users of mobile <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> surprisingly little is known about the role of these handsets in mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution. This paper provides quantitative evidence of a positive relationship between intra-network-carrier penetration rates for mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> subscribers and mobile handsets designed for these services. The relationship is such that if one <b>network</b> <b>service</b> is diffused more than another, the mobile handsets related to the more diffused service are similarly more widely diffused in the market, and vice versa. The evidence is derived from an analysis of two mobile <b>network</b> <b>services</b> in Japan, mobile Internet and third generation mobile, initiated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. There are no existing studies that consistently explain the mechanisms of different mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution patterns. Since the positive relationship that emerges from the analysis is consistent for both cases, by examining the mechanisms underlying this relationship, the paper develops an adequate and consistent perspective based on a constituent model reflecting the technological and competition structure of mobile <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> From this perspective, this positive relationship can be explained as the similarity or dissimilarity in essential technology ownership distribution across constituents. This perspective describes mobile network evolution in terms of changes in the distribution of essential technology ownership and, therefore, could be generalised more widely.
