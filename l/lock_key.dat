5|$|There are two {{versions}} of the PowerBook100's QWERTY layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63keys and an international ISO version with 64keys. The caps <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> on the PowerBook100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System7 operating system software includes an extension file that causes an icon of the international caps lock symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar when Caps Lock is active.|$|E
25|$|Caps lock is {{replaced}} by Shift lock, thus affecting non-letter keys as well. However, there is an ongoing evolution towards a Caps <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> instead of a Shift lock.|$|E
25|$|Support {{for many}} USB {{devices such as}} cameras, mice, {{external}} keyboards and flash drives is included, utilizing a feature similar to plug-and-play on other operating systems. Like the prototype Cr-48, Chromebooks have a specialized keyboard complete with buttons for opening and controlling multiple browser-windows, {{as well as a}} Web search button which replaces the caps <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> (caps lock being activated by pressing both alt+search).|$|E
25|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>keys</b> <b>lock</b> {{part of a}} keyboard, {{depending}} on the settings selected. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> include Scroll <b>lock,</b> Num lock (which allows {{the use of the}} numeric keypad), and Caps lock.|$|R
50|$|They {{produce a}} range of {{residential}} lock products, including tubular <b>locks,</b> <b>key</b> <b>locking</b> hardware sets, electronic keyless locks, deadbolts, and Mortise locks. They also provide cabinet and drawer pulls for interior spaces like Kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets.|$|R

25|$|One {{test for}} whether the {{computer}} has crashed is pressing the caps <b>lock</b> <b>key.</b> The keyboard sends the key code to the keyboard driver {{running in the}} main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the Shift, alt and control state of the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|The Cr-48's {{hardware}} design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys, {{such as the}} function keys, and replacing the caps <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> with a dedicated search key, which can be changed back to caps lock in the OS's keyboard settings. Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet, demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs, and announced a 3G plan that would give users 100MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.|$|E
25|$|Alphabetical, numeric, and {{punctuation}} {{keys are}} used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed {{at the same time as}} some modifier keys.|$|E

Participants (35 male and 62 female) imagined being asked for money {{by a person}} who had <b>locked</b> <b>keys</b> in a car and then reported how likely they would he to comply with such a request, whether they had previously <b>locked</b> their <b>keys</b> in their car (empathy), and, if so, whether they had been helped (reciprocity). In support of the explanation based on empathy, people who reported previously <b>locking</b> their <b>keys</b> in their cars indicated being more likely to comply...|$|R

25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

50|$|These keys {{were common}} in both {{cabinetry}} and door locks in early Colonial America and remained in common usage within the United States through the 1940s, giving way after World War II to the pin tumbler <b>lock.</b> Most <b>keys</b> {{of this type}} and their locks were formed of brass, although pewter was sometimes used. They were commonly available at hardware and other stores. Today, lever <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are associated with fine cabinetry.|$|R

50|$|Mechanical {{access control}} systems include turnstiles, gates, doors, and <b>locks.</b> <b>Key</b> {{control of the}} locks becomes a problem with large user populations and any user turnover. Keys quickly become unmanageable, often forcing the {{adoption}} of electronic access control.|$|R

50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the SHIFT <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT key, the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent a}} {{screensaver}} from starting, xine sends a scroll <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> {{signal to the}} environment to pretend keyboard interaction took place. This can often lead to issues with other programs running as they receive the scroll <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> as normal input. One example is the Konsole terminal emulator, which changes the behaviour of the arrow keys when scroll lock is used.|$|E
50|$|The prompt is not {{strictly}} accurate in that, {{for the vast}} majority of computer systems, modifier <b>keys</b> or <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> would not cause processing to resume, as they do not produce an actual character that the program could detect.|$|R

50|$|Num Lock or Numeric Lock (⇭) {{is a key}} on the numeric keypad of most {{computer}} keyboards. It is a <b>lock</b> <b>key,</b> like Caps Lock and Scroll Lock. Its state (on or off) {{affects the}} function {{of some of the}} keys, and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.The Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have cursor control or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had separate number keys and cursor control keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to choose between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.|$|E
