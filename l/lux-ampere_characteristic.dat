40|$|Steady-state photocurrents are {{measured}} in amorphous selenium (a-Se) films as function of illumination intensity for temperatures between 210 K and 297 K. The <b>Lux-Ampère</b> <b>characteristic,</b> Iph ∝ Gγ, shows a maximum exponent of 1. 08 ± 0. 06 around 250 K while lower values {{are measured}} {{at room temperature}} and 210 K. The photocurrent overshoots its steady-state value upon initial turn-on of a high light intensity by an amount that has a minimum in the 250 K region. Both phenomena indicate {{the presence of a}} deep electron trap near the a-Se equilibrium Fermi level...|$|E

Its physical properties are strongly influenced by an existence of deep levels in the forbidden band. This thesis deals with an influence of deep levels to the photoelectric transport in high resistivity CdTe. Experimental part of this thesis consits of measurement of slopes of <b>Lux-Ampere</b> <b>characteristics</b> of variously doped CdTe samples depended on voltage and energy of excitation. Gradients of measured guidelines of <b>Lux-Ampere</b> <b>characteristics</b> show strong dependency on an electric charge accumulated on deep levels.

Influence of nanocrystal dimensions on the electrophysical and photoelectrical properties of heterojunctions has been studied. The current-voltage characteristics of nanoporous Si with various nanocrystal dimensions were measured.

40|$|Steady-state and {{transient}} photoconductivity {{characteristics of}} thermally and laser-beam deposited chalcogenide amorphous films As 40 Se 60 and As 50 Se 50 are studied at varied light intensity and temperature. The <b>lux-ampere</b> <b>characteristics</b> are shown {{to change the}} power exponent from a value greater than 0. 5 at low intensities to the value less than 0. 5 at high intensities, indicating the change in recombination reaction. The transient photocurrents in step-function mode of excitation {{were found to be}} consistent with the model of trap-controlled non-stationary capture and recombination in exponentially distributed in energy hole traps.

40|$|CdTe {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} X-ray and g-ray detectors' material. This work deals with influence of deep levels to photoelectric properties of CdTe. PICTS, Lux-Ampere and spectral dependences measurements at room temperature and low temperature 10 K were performed on one undoped and several variously doped (Cl, Sn and Ge) samples and applied electrical fields up to 800 V. cm- 1. Experimental setups are introduced. Room temperature numerical solution of sample photoelectrical properties for typical midgap level using driftdiffusion and Poisson equation was performed and results are discussed. The experimentally observed slopes of <b>Lux-ampere</b> <b>characteristics</b> and energy shifts of the main photoconductivity peak with the applied voltage are explained based on a model of screening of electric field by charge accumulated on deep levels. Finally comparison with acquired experimental data is performed yielding estimates of maximum total concentration of deep levels in the samples.

40|$|Cadmium {{selenide}} is an n-type direct-band gap semiconductor {{having an}} energy band gap of 1. 7 eV. Its {{melting point is}} 1260 °C and density is 5. 8 g/c. c It has two structures (1) cubic and (2) hexagonal. Its photoconductivity lies {{in the range from}} 0. 4 micrometer to 1. 3 micrometer with peak photosensitivity at 0. 72 micrometer. It has fact response compared to cadmium sulphide. Various techniques are available for obtaining cadmium selenide layers required for preparing photoconductive cells. They include chemical vapour deposition, close-space vapour transport, chemical bath deposition, spray pyrolysis, screen-printing, electro deposition, electrophoretic deposition, anodization, chemi plating, vacuum deposition, sputtering and electron beam evaporation. Screen-printed and sintered layer possess certain advantages. They are (1) large area photoconductive cells can be easily made. (2) They exhibit ohmic dependence of photocurrent on applied voltage. (3) Impurity incorporation is very easy. (4) Good adhesion to the substrate is obtained. (5) They do not involve the use of sophisticated and expensive equipments like vacuum system, gauges and power supplies. (6) Electrical power consumption is every low. (7) Layers can be easily obtained on any substrate whether it is conducting or non-conducting and (8) this method is very cheap. The property which is of technological interest is the dark resistivity of the cadmium selenide layers. For photoconductive work, a very high dark resistivity of the order of 108 ohm-cm is required whereas for photovoltaic work a very low dark resistivity of the order of 1 ohm-cm is required. In the present investigation, high resistivity cadmium selenide layers suitable for photoconductive cells have been obtained as a result of sintering carried out in air and also by doping with suitable acceptor impurities. Without any acceptor impurity and with suitable post heat-treatment of the sintered cadmium selenide layers in high vacuum for a specified length of time the dark resistivity could be brought down considerably. Chapter I give an introduction to the photoconductivity of solids and the general mechanism of photoconductivity. It also discusses how the photoconductivity is related to the lifetime of the majority carriers, trapping centres and sensitizing centres. The work carried out on cadmium selenide so far has also been reviewed. The various experimental techniques employed in carrying out this research work have been described. Sintering conditions of the cadmium selenide layers such as time, temperature, various atmospheres such as nitrogen, vacuum etc are studied and the results are discussed. The effect of various electrical contacts on the photosensitivity of the sintered cadmium selenide layer is dealt with. Optoelectronic properties such as spectral distribution of photoconductivity, <b>lux-ampere</b> <b>characteristics,</b> rise and decay of photocurrent and the effect of temperature and high field on the photocurrent are studied. The effect of oxygen adsorption on the properties of the sintered CdSe layers is described. Photovoltaic studies were carried out by employing the CdSe sintered layers. Various types of applications of the CdSe layers are given. ...|$|R
