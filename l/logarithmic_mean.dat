But it satisfies only a weaker form of Proportionality Test WPT along with, say, the factor antithesis FA(Törnqvist) of the Törnqvist index. According to WPT, if both prices and quantities change proportionally, the price index must equal the common factor of proportionality. Montgomery-Vartia index was proposed independently in another notation by Montgomery in 1937. Both Sato-Vartia and Montgomery-Vartia indices are modifications and refinements of the Törnqvist index.|$|E
