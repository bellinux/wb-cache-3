40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated colony-level sublethal effects of imidacloprid on <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> affecting foraging and food consumption, and thus colony growth and reproduction, at lower pesticide concentrations than for honey bee colonies. However, these studies may not reflect the full effects of neonicotinoids on <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> because <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> life cycles {{are different from those}} of honey <b>bees.</b> Unlike honey <b>bees,</b> <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> <b>live</b> in colonies for only a few months each year. Assessing the sublethal effects of systemic insecticides only on the colony level is appropriate for honey <b>bees,</b> but for <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> this approach addresses just part of their annual life cycle. Queens are solitary from the time they leave their home colonies in fall until they produce their first workers the following year. Queens forage for pollen and nectar, and are thus exposed to more risk of direct pesticide exposure than honey bee queens. Almost no {{research has}} been done on pesticide exposure to and effects on <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> queens. Additional research should focus on critical periods in a <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> queen’s life which have the greatest nutritional demands, foraging requirements, and potential for exposure to pesticides, particularly the period during and after nest establishment in the spring when the queen must forage for the nutritional needs of her brood and for her own needs while she maintains an elevated body temperature in order to incubate the brood...|$|R

50|$|Danish {{zoologist}} Johan Christian Fabricius first identified Apis florea in 1787. A. florea is {{a member}} of the Apis genus. The Apidae is a diverse family of bees including honey <b>bees,</b> orchid <b>bees,</b> <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> stingless bees, cuckoo bees and carpenter bees. The name Florea is a personal name of Romanian origin. A. florea is native to southeast Asia, and therefore one of the most phylogenetically basal bees. This suggests that honeybees originated in this region, with A. florea being one of the oldest and potentially similar to ancestors; therefore its first appearance in phylogeny occurs before that of A. mellifera and A. cerena. A. mellifera most likely evolved from A. florea and then migrated to Europe. A. florea, a dwarf honeybee, is a sister species of Apis andreniformis. These sister species are the most ancient honeybee lineage, most likely diverging in the Bartonian era.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe insect growth {{regulators}} (IGRs) are ecdysone or {{juvenile hormone}} mimics, or chitin synthesis inhibitors. They {{are more likely}} to be hazardous to larval insects than to adults. Application of JH mimics to adult honey bees may affect foraging behaviour and some physiological traits. Topical and feeding tests revealed that application of IGRs to larvae may result in death and larval ejection by workers, malformed larvae and pupae with typical rimmed eyes, or malformed adults. Several laboratory "larvae tests" using artificially contaminated diets have been described for honey <b>bees</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> Field and cage methods have also been published for honey <b>bees</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> respectively.

40|$|Bees provide vital {{pollination}} {{services to}} the majority of flowering plants in both natural and agricultural systems. Unfortunately, both native and managed bee populations are experiencing declines, threatening the persistence of these plants and crops. Agricultural chemicals are one possible culprit contributing to bee declines. Even fungicides, generally considered safe for bees, have been shown to disrupt honey <b>bee</b> development and impair <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> behavior. Little is known, however, how fungicides may affect <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> colony growth. We conducted a controlled cage study {{to determine the effects of}} fungicide exposure on colonies of a native <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> species (Bombus impatiens). Colonies of B. impatiens were exposed to flowers treated with field-relevant levels of the fungicide chlorothalonil over the course of one month. Colony success was assessed by the number and biomass of larvae, pupae, and adult <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> <b>Bumble</b> <b>bee</b> colonies exposed to fungicide produced fewer workers, lower total bee biomass, and had lighter mother queens than control colonies. Our results suggest that fungicides negatively affect the colony success of a native <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> species and that the use of fungicides during bloom has the potential to severely impact the success of native <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> populations foraging in agroecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Regulation {{of worker}} {{behavior}} by dominant queens or workers is {{a hallmark of}} insect societies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and their evolutionary conservation are not well understood. Honey <b>bee</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> colonies consist of a single reproductive queen and facultatively sterile workers. The queens' influences on the workers are mediated largely via inhibition of juvenile hormone titers, which affect division of labor in honey bees and worker reproduction in <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> Studies in honey bees identified a transcription factor, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h 1), whose expression in worker brains is significantly downregulated {{in the presence of}} a queen or queen pheromone and higher in forager bees, making this gene an ideal candidate for examining the evolutionary conservation of socially regulated pathways in Hymenoptera. Results In contrast to honey <b>bees,</b> <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> foragers do not have higher Kr-h 1 levels relative to nurses: in one of three colonies levels were similar in nurses and foragers, and in two colonies levels were higher in nurses. Similarly to honey bees, brain Kr-h 1 levels were significantly downregulated in the presence versus absence of a queen. Furthermore, in small queenless groups, Kr-h 1 levels were downregulated in subordinate workers with undeveloped ovaries relative to dominant individuals with active ovaries. Brain Kr-h 1 levels were upregulated by juvenile hormone treatment relative to a vehicle control. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that KR-H 1 orthologs are presence across insect orders. Though this protein is highly conserved between honey <b>bees</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> there are significant differences between orthologs of insects from different orders. Conclusions Our results suggest that Kr-h 1 is associated with juvenile hormone mediated regulation of reproduction in <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> The expression of this transcription factor is inhibited by the queen and associated with endocrine mediated regulation of social organization in two species of bees. Thus, KR-H 1 may transcriptionally regulate a conserved genetic module that is part of a pathway that has been co-opted to function in social behavior, and adjusts the behavior of workers to their social environmental context. </p...|$|R

50|$|Since {{bees are}} {{characterized}} by a distinct color pattern {{as well as a}} defensive sting, they have been subject to mimicry in order to gain its known protective mark. <b>Bumble</b> <b>bees</b> are resembled by sawflies, other bees, day-flying moths, beetles, and flies. Cimbicid sawflies resemble bees, but have swollen antenna tips as a distinguisher. Other bees, such as carpenter and digger bees, contain a striking resemblance to <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> but males contain a yellow clypeus and females have hindlegs with brushes rather than a pollen basket, which is a characteristic of <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> Clearwing hawk moths (of the family Sphingidae such as the species Hemaris thetis) resemble <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> while foraging through flowers, but are distinct with skinny legs and spindle antennae. Bumble flower beetles (Scarabaeidae such as Euphoria inda) maintains a similar flight behavior to <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> like flying close to plants and buzzing loudly.

The recent decline in honeybee health has underscored he danger of relying on a single species to provide vital services. Increasing pollinator biodiversity with native bees may provide biological insurance against the decline of any particular species. By examining cropping systems, {{it is possible to}} determine which native bees are providing pollination services and then augment habitat to increase their numbers or attempt domestication. In this study, we examined the native bee populations in the cranberry growing area of southern coastal Oregon in order to determine if native bees {{play a significant role in}} cranberry pollination. This two-year study surveyed four farms across a 22 km north-south gradient. At least 27 bee species were observed during cranberry bloom (mid-May to late June), of which five were observed foraging on the cranberry flowers.
