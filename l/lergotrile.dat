40|$|Thirty-eight {{microorganisms}} {{were screened}} {{for their ability}} to produce metabolites of the semisynthetic alkaloid, <b>lergotrile.</b> A total of five microorganisms were found to biotransform <b>lergotrile,</b> and N-desmethyl <b>lergotrile</b> was detected as the principal metabolite with most organisms. Streptomyces platensis (NRRL 2364) appeared to form the metabolite in highest yield, and a preparative-scale conversion was accomplished with a recovered yield of 50 %. Structure proof was accomplished with comparative thin-layer chromatography, mixed melting point, mass spectrometry, and remethylation to <b>lergotrile...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} dopamine and various ergot alkaloids on prolactin secretion were studied using continuously perfused columns of dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. Bromocriptine (5 nmol/l) and lisuride hydrogen maleate (5 nmol/l) both inhibited prolactin secretion, the effects persisting {{for more than}} 3 h {{after the end of}} the administration of the drugs. A similar although less long-lasting effect was observed with <b>lergotrile</b> (50 nmol/l) and the new ergoline derivative, pergolide (5 nmol/l). These effects contrasted with the rapid disappearance of the action of dopamine. The potency estimates of the ergots relative to that of dopamine were: <b>lergotrile,</b> 2. 3; bromocriptine, 13; lisuride, 15; pergolide, 23. Ther dopamine-receptor blocking drugs, metoclopramide and haloperidol, antagonized the prolactin release-inhibiting activity of the compounds; bromocriptine and lisuride showed the highest resistance to this dopaminergic blockade. The results suggested that the direct effect of the ergot derivatives on dispersed pituitary cells was mediated through dopamine receptors and emphasized the long-lasting action of bromocriptine and lisuride in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The ATP-dependent uptake of l-glutamate into {{synaptic}} vesicles {{has been}} well characterized, implicating a key role for synaptic vesicles in glutamatergic neurotransmission. In the present study, we provide evidence that vesicular glutamate uptake is selectively inhibited by the pep-tide-containing halogenated ergot bromocriptine. It is the most potent inhibitor of the agents tested; the IC 5 o was de-termined to be 22 Îœ M. The uptake was also inhibited by other ergopeptines such as ergotamine and ergocristine, but with less potency. Ergots devoid of the peptide moiety, however, such as ergonovine, <b>lergotrile,</b> and methysergide, {{had little or no}} effect. Although bromocriptine is known to elicit dopaminergic and serotonergic effects, its inhibitory effect on vesicular glutamate uptake was not mimicked by agents known to interact with dopamine and serotonin receptors. Kinetic data suggest that bromocriptine competes with glutamate for the glutamate binding site on the glutamate trans-locator. It is proposed that this inhibitor could be useful as a prototype probe in identifying and characterizing the vesicular glutamate translocator, as well as in developing a more specific inhibitor of the transport system...|$|E
40|$|In {{male and}} female rat {{anterior}} pituitary homogenates dopamine inhibited basal adenylate cyclase by 30 % and 50 %, respectively. Dopamine also inhibited vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 50 % in both sexes. Sulpiride, a specific D 2 antagonist, stereospecificaily blocked with high affinity the dopamine inhibition in both males and females. RU 24926, a specific, non-catechol, non-ergot D 2 agonist, also inhibited basal adenylate cyclase of female pituitary with a higher apparent affinity than dopamine (KD 20 n,i and 450 nM, respectively). This effect was also stereospecifically antagonized by sulpiride. Apomorphine was also more potent (Kj,, 100 nM) than dopamine, whereas norepinephrine and SKF 38393, a specific D 1 agonist, were poorly active; isoproterenol and clonidine were inactive. Ergots derivatives such as CB 154, LY 14865, pergolide, and <b>lergotrile</b> were potent agonists. a-Dihydroergocryptine was a partial agonist of the dopamine receptor negatively coupled with an adenylate cyclase. Because of the slow association kinetics of this drug with the dopamine receptor, its KD (0. 7 nM) for adenylate cyclase inhibition could be correctly determined only after a 30 -mm incubation period. All classical dopaminergic antagonists blocked dopamine inhibition of pituitar...|$|E
