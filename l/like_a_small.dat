5|$|As Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) {{struggles to}} gain {{government}} {{support for his}} moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.|$|E
5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E

5|$|This {{community}} {{also saw}} close collaboration between architects, specialist structural engineers, and building contractors emerge {{on the new}} skyscraper projects. Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this broke down in Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on {{the appearance of the}} skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built. Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the D. H. Burnham & Company, for example, felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Half Flight was {{augmented}} by four Martinsyde S1s and redesignated No.30 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The squadron moved into Kut following the city's capture by the Allies during the Battle of Es Sinn in September; {{for his part}} in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised an implement shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> garden rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a millstone for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

5|$|The citadel {{encloses}} {{a set of}} buildings, {{the notable}} ones being the fort built in 1620, the Masilamaninathar Temple built in the 13th century, the Zion Church built in 1701, New Jerusalem Church built in 1718, the Town Gateway built in 1792, the Danish Governor Bungalow built in 1784 {{and a series of}} tomb stones built during the 17th and 18th centuries. The settlement inside the citadel is modeled <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> European town with a land gate and wooden doors leading to the main street, namely, the King's Street. Some of the notable buildings in the King's street are the Gate House, Muhldorff's House, Port Master's Bungalow and Rehling's House. There were originally citadel walls towards the sea, which eroded with time on account of the salty nature of the environment. The fortification could not withstand an attack by regular military forces, but acted as a protection for the citizens of the settlement against predatory cavalry raids. The bastions of the fort are constructed with black stone.|$|E

25|$|Basava (1105–1167) Arguably one of {{the first}} social reformers, Basava championed devotional worship that {{rejected}} temple worship and rituals, and replaced it with personalised direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> linga. This approach brought Shiva's presence to everyone and at all times, without gender, class or caste discrimination. His teachings and verses such as Káyakavé Kailása (Work is the path to Kailash (bliss, heaven), or Work is Worship) became popular.|$|E
25|$|The title {{above is}} used {{since it is}} {{commonly}} used to describe whistles similar to those used by police in America and elsewhere.

25|$|The aim of {{preliminary}} practices (ngöndro) is {{to start}} the student on the correct path for such higher teachings. Just as Sutrayāna preceded Vajrayāna historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones. Preliminary practices include all Sutrayāna activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principle stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic bodhicitta wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without {{the basis of these}} three in particular to practice Vajrayāna can be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> child trying to ride an unbroken horse.|$|E

25|$|Anioma social {{structure}} {{is dominated by}} the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of uno, eboh', and idumu, which are major blood lineages; while ogbe and obodo are open and much more political. Uno is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was Eboh, which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and the grandparents and the grandchildren. The Ogbe is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the Idumu and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one that looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> town; this is the Obodo.|$|E
25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} {{electromagnetic field}} at a frequency {{associated with a}} transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron's entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this {{is the process of}} stimulated emission.|$|E
