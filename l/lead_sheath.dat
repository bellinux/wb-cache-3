50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{an early}} form of {{insulated}} cable, introduced in 1896, {{consisted of two}} impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall <b>lead</b> <b>sheath.</b> Joints were soldered, and special fittings were used for lamp holders and switches. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time. Paper-insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior wiring installations because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture {{did not affect the}} insulation.|$|E
50|$|The three {{submarine}} {{power cables}} installed in 1991 are each rated to carry 1430 A continuously at 350 kV operating voltage. They are constructed with a compacted multi-strand copper conductor {{as a central}} core, with mass-impregnated paper insulation surrounded by a <b>lead</b> <b>sheath.</b> Two layers of galvanised steel wire armour provides strength and mechanical protection. The outer layer of the cable is a serving made from polypropylene rope and the outer diameter is approximately 130 mm. The cables have a 30-minute overload capacity of 1600 A.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submarine}} power cables is {{the transport of}} electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers. The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes ≤ 1200 are most common, but sizes ≥ 2400 mm2 have been made occasionally. For voltages ≥ 12 kV the conductors are round. Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420 kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30 mm. 36 kV class cables have only 5.5 - 8 mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation {{can also be used}} for DC.Low-pressure oil-filled cables have an insulation lapped from paper strips. The entire cable core is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central oil channel in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525 kV.Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525 kV. Cables ≥ 52 kV are equipped with an extruded <b>lead</b> <b>sheath</b> to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50 km is possible). In this stage the product is called cable core. In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In three-core cables, three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.The armouring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass). Modern three-core cables, e.g. for the interconnection of offshore wind turbines) carry often optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{insulated}} lead covered (PILC) cables {{have played}} an important role in underground power distribution for a hundred years. Replacing aged PILC before failure is critical to managing power distribution. Three prominent failure mechanisms accelerate cable aging: temperature stresses, moisture ingress, and partial discharge. The research focuses on the effect of temperature and moisture on the effective (complex) permittivity of the cable insulation. Measurements are performed using cylindrical dielectrometry sensors designed to be wrapped around the cable. The <b>lead</b> <b>sheath</b> of the cable is removed so that the sensors can be placed directly in contact with the insulation. From the measurements, the electrical properties of the material as a function of temperature and transient moisture diffusion are found. A theoretical treatment of the interdigital dielectrometry sensors with a cylindrical geometry is presented. Two classes of the geometry are studied. The periodic sensor geometry has electrodes aligned with the cylindrical axis and periodic around the circumference. The z periodic sensor geometry has the electrodes forming rings around the cylinder that are periodic along the cylindrical axis. The material is modeled by concentric rings of homogeneous materials. The electric field solution consists of an infinite summation of Fourier series terms. In finding the field solution and as a consequence of it, the potential, electric field lines, and the impedance between the driving and sensing electrodes are found. A generalized solution to the planar dielectrometry sensor topology is also presented. This solution allows for an arbitrary placement and excitation of electrodes, providing the analytical tools for a new generation of sensors. (cont.) Dielectrometry sensors for use in and z periodic geometries are designed and manufactured on a 4 mil PTFE substrate. An experimental setup is designed and built to provide a temperature and humidity controlled environment for measurements. Special clamping mechanisms are used to secure the sensor to the sample. Custom built hardware is used to excite the sensor at frequencies ranging from 0. 005 Hz to 10, 000 Hz (over six decades), measure and record the response, and deliver it to a computer for storage and analysis. Steady state measurements are performed at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 100 C. Plastics, woods, and the PILC cable samples are measured. Using the theoretical model, the effective permittivity is estimated from the measurements. An Arrhenius temperature dependence is observed for several materials including the PILC cables. We characterize the temperature dependence of these materials by a master curve and activation energy. Together they give a complete description of the effective permittivity's frequency and temperature dependence. Transient measurements of moisture diffusion are made at constant temperatures for several materials. For some experiments the boundary conditions limit the diffusion of moisture to one direction. When the z periodic sensor is used, six independent measurements are taken along the direction of diffusion. From the initial and final conditions and the theoretical model, a mapping between the electrical properties and the insulation moisture content is formed. Moisture concentration along the direction of diffusion is estimated and in some cases characterized by a simple diffusion coefficient. (cont.) The diffusion experiments provide evidence that moisture can move rapidly through the stranded conductors of the cables, delivering moisture to locations far removed from an initial breach. The experimental results show the electrical properties of the cable insulation is highly sensitive to the presence of moisture and changes in temperature. While using these sensors for field measurements may not be practical because they require the cable sheath to be removed, the technology provides a valuable, low cost tool for assessing cable health in an off-line setting. by Zachary M.

The mean implantation time was 65  months (range 23  to 188). The indications for lead extraction were chronic infection (7), superior vena cava obstruction (4), lead malfunction (4), and pain (2).  METHODS—A prospective analysis {{of the use of}} the Excimer laser sheath in extracting chronically implanted pacemaker <b>leads.</b> Laser <b>sheath</b> extraction was undertaken if conventional extraction techniques with simple traction or traction with a locking stylet had failed.

DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic modification during mammalian development, yet its role in myelination remains obscure.

Our studies also point to a possible role of SAMe in establishing the aberrant DNA methylation patterns in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy, implicating SAMe in the pathogenesis of this disease. These critical observations establish a link between SAMe and DNA methylation status in a defined biological system, providing a mechanism that could direct methylation changes during cellular differentiation and in diverse pathological situations...|$|R
50|$|Most {{high-voltage}} cables {{for power}} transmission {{that are currently}} sold on the market are insulated by a sheath of XLPE. Some cables may have a lead or aluminium jacket in conjunction with XLPE insulation to allow for fiber optics. Before 1960, underground power cables were insulated with oil and paper and ran in a rigid steel pipe, or a semi-rigid aluminium or <b>lead</b> jacket or <b>sheath.</b> The oil was kept under pressure to prevent formation of voids that would allow partial discharges within the cable insulation. There are still many of these oil-and-paper insulated cables in use worldwide. Between 1960 and 1990, polymers became more widely used at distribution voltages, mostly EPDM (ethylene propylene diene M-class); however, their relative unreliability, particularly early XLPE, resulted in a slow uptake at transmission voltages. While cables of 330 kV are commonly constructed using XLPE, this has occurred only in recent decades.|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} disabling {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS), in which destruction of myelin <b>sheaths</b> <b>leads</b> to disturbed axonal conduction. Available MS therapies modulate the immune response, but are unable to prevent neurological decline. Therefore, great efforts are made to develop therapies that limit demyelination and axonal degeneration. Oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the interleukin (IL) - 6 cytokine family, is produced in demyelinating lesions of MS patients and stimulates neuronal survival. In this study, we reveal that the OSM receptor (OSMR) was robustly upregulated on microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model. While OSMR deficiency led to aggravated demyelination, CNS-targeted OSM treatment largely prevented demyelination. OSM treatment increased IL- 4 expression and induced polarization of myeloid cells towards an anti-inflammatory M 2 phenotype in vivo.

Here, we demonstrate a requirement for the basal polarity complex protein Scribble in CNS myelination and remyelination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial {{development and}} is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes where it is localised to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. When Scribble expression is conditionally eliminated in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice, myelin initiation in CNS is disrupted, both during development and following focal demyelination, and longitudinal extension of the myelin sheath is disrupted. At later stages of myelination, Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness whilst suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) /mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway, and localises to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.

30|$|A {{failure mode}} is {{regarded}} as any kind of damage to the downhole construction (e.g., casing strings, cement sheath) and/or surface equipment (e.g., wellhead) of a geothermal well that either temporarily excludes further drilling operations, well testing or fluid production, or leads directly to the partial or total well abandonment. All of the geothermal wells drilled into extremely high temperatures push their components including casing strings, casing connections, wellhead assembly, cement sheaths, drilling fluid to its technical limits. Based on the classification of casing failures made by Teodoriu (2015), excluding casing failure from corrosion, extensive wear, and overloading, most wells investigating high-temperature geothermal resources will fall {{into the category of}} the so-called temperature variation induced fatigue. This kind of failure is caused by large temperature variations and is aggravated by the lack of casing mobility within the cement sheaths. It is expected that such casing failure will be caused by accumulated temperature cycles, putting the casing material above its yield limit. Similarly to the casing material and connections, fatigue due to extensive thermally driven loads will <b>lead</b> to cement <b>sheaths</b> damage and loss of the cement bond at casing–cement or cement–rock interfaces with potential influx of hostile reservoir fluids.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{extraction}} {{techniques of}} chronic pacemaker and defibrillator leads {{is to present}} an approach that is successful in extracting all leads and minimizes or eliminates complications. To extract a chronically implanted intravascular device, the device must {{be separated from the}} encapsulating inflammatory tissue. Three ablation techniques are currently used: mechanical, laser and electrosurgical. Indirect traction is traction applied by an instrument such as a snare passed into the heart, usually through a femoral vein. The lead is entrapped in the snare, and pulling or pushing applies traction. 1, 2 The safety of this technique is enhanced by the ability to avoid those problems associated with the binding sites in the superior veins and right atrium. Indirect traction is more successful than direct traction. Countertraction is a method of safely extracting an electrode entrapped in fibrous tissue at the electrode-myocardial interface. It is defined as the countering of the traction on the <b>lead</b> by a <b>sheath.</b> A sheath of slightly larger diameter is passed over the lead to a point about 1 cm from the heart wall. Traction is applied on the lead, pulling the myocardial wall {{to the edge of the}} sheath, which counters the traction.

40|$|Main {{processes}} of plasma-wall interaction and impurity transport in fusion devices {{and their impact}} on the availability of the devices are presented and modelling tools, in particular the three-dimensional Monte-Carlo code ERO, are introduced. The capability of ERO is demonstrated on the example of tungsten erosion and deposition modelling. The dependence of tungsten deposition on plasma temperature and density is studied by simulations with a simplified geometry assuming (almost) constant plasma parameters. The amount of deposition increases with increasing electron temperature and density. Up to 100 % of eroded tungsten can be promptly deposited near to the location of erosion at very high densities (~ 1 × 1014 cm− 3 expected e. g. in the divertor of ITER). The effect of the sheath characteristics on tungsten prompt deposition is investigated by using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to spatially resolve the plasma parameters inside the sheath. Applying PIC data instead of non-resolved <b>sheath</b> <b>leads</b> in general to smaller tungsten deposition, which is mainly due to a density and temperature decrease towards the surface within the sheath. Two-dimensional tungsten erosion/deposition simulations, assuming symmetry in toroidal direction but poloidally spatially varying plasma parameter profiles, have been carried out for the JET divertor. The simulations reveal, similar to experimental findings, that tungsten gross erosion is dominated in H-mode plasmas by the intra-ELM phases. However, due to deposition, the net tungsten erosion can be similar within intra- and inter-ELM phases if the inter-ELM electron temperature is high enough. Also, the simulated deposition fraction of about 84 % in between ELMs is in line with spectroscopic observations from which a lower limit of 50 % has been estimated...|$|R
40|$|Capacitively coupled radio {{frequency}} plasmas operated in an electronegative gas (CF 4) and driven by voltage waveforms composed of four consecutive harmonics are investigated for different fundamental driving frequencies using PIC/MCC simulations and an analytical model. As {{has been observed}} previously for electropositive gases, the application of peak- shaped waveforms (that are characterized by a strong amplitude asymmetry) results {{in the development of}} a DC self-bias due to the electrical asymmetry effect (EAE), which increases the energy of ions arriving at the powered electrode. In contrast to the electropositive case (Korolov et al 2012 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 45 465202) the absolute value of the DC self- bias is found to increase as the fundamental frequency is reduced in this electronegative discharge, providing an increased range over which the DC self-bias can be controlled. The analytical model reveals that this increased DC self-bias is caused by changes in the spatial pro le and the mean value of the net charge density in the grounded electrode sheath. The spatio-temporally resolved simulation data show that as the frequency is reduced the grounded electrode sheath region becomes electronegative. The presence of negative ions in this <b>sheath</b> <b>leads</b> to very different dynamics of the power absorption of electrons, which in turn enhances the local electronegativity and plasma density via ionization and attachment processes. The ion ux to the grounded electrode (where the ion energy is lowest) can be up to twice that to the powered electrode. At the same time, while the mean ion energies at both electrodes are quite different, their ratio remains approximately constant for all base frequencies studied here...|$|R

Consequently, failure of myelination or damage to the myelin <b>sheath</b> <b>leads</b> to severe pathology as seen in multiple sclerosis. During myelination oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are challenged to build up and maintain a highly complex multilaminar plasma membrane structure. It is well-known that myelin membranes are divided into subdomains with distinct protein and lipid composition. Nevertheless, {{it is unclear how}} these domains are generated and then maintained throughout the adult. Especially the mechanisms of interaction between cytoskeleton elements and membrane structures in the developing and adult myelin sheath are still unknown. In this work, the interaction of the cytoskeleton protein septin(Sept 6) and the myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL is demonstrated. Septins are enriched in myelin membranes which is unique for cytoskeleton elements. Most important, the loss of Sept 6 in myelin is compensated by its closest homolog Sept 11 which clearly points to a functional role of septins in the myelin compartment. A detailed analysis of the septin protein family in myelinating cells was performed here. It was shown that septins are coordinately regulated during differentiation and myelination in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. On the protein level particular septins were identified to be differentially enriched in myelin membranes. They form distinct stoechiometric complexes interacting also with actin. We propose that septin/myelin membrane complexes {{play an important role in}} myelination. Septins might be crucial in the formation and maintenance of myelin subdomains as well as in the transport of myelin components. In line with this, a possible site of interaction between Sept 6 and MAL was identified in the Schwann cell cytoplasm. There, Sept 6 and MAL might be important for sorting and trafficking processes crucial for the targeting of myelin components into the emerging and adult myelin sheath. Sept 6 -deficient mice, however, did not disclose alterations in myelin ultrastructure and protein composition besides the upregulation of Sept 11. But, it is well-known that the septin cortex is very robust and that homologous isoforms might compensate for the loss of single septins. In line with this, it is shown here that myelinating Schwann cells tolerate the loss of Sept 2, which might be due to such compensation mechanisms. The function of Sept 7 in myelination could not be elucidated, since downregulation in in vitro myelinating cultures led to unspecific effects probably on cytokinesis and cell survival. Nevertheless, this first comprehensive study on septins in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells generated valuable data critical for further analysis of septin function in myelin. This study provides insight into the composition of the septin cytoskeleton, its regulation during myelination and its interaction with myelin membranes. Understanding the role of the septin cytoskeleton in myelin formation and maintenance may reveal new insights in the mechanisms of myelination and remyelination in health and disease...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the generation, {{characterisation}} and application of PEG-like, low fouling surfaces deposited by plasma polymerisation of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether. The first part of the thes{{is focused on}} uniform films, where the ideal deposition parameters were identified for the fabrication of robust low fouling plasma polymer films, particularly with regards to the W/FM parameter by varying the plasma load power. A number of complimentary surface sensitive analytical tools were employed in film characterisation including, including XPS, NEXAFS and neutron reflectometry. A combination of these analytical techniques enabled us to determine that films deposited at lower load power retained a higher degree of monomer “PEG-like” functionality, particularly with regards to the ether content and these films displayed the most efficient low-fouling characteristics against BSA and lysozyme protein adsorption. Further to this, HeLa cell attachment was largely resisted by the lower-fouling higher ether containing plasma polymer surfaces. The use of neutron reflectometry in the analysis of the uniform plasma polymer films enabled us to further identify the densities and H content of the film, not otherwise determinable with XPS and ToF-SIMS. Using the scattering length densities we were also able to identify the full empirical formula of the plasma polymer films, where the lower load power that was shown to be most protein resistant (QCM-d) showed to have a chemical composition most similar to that of a typical PEG-grafted surface. The second part of the results component of the thesis was focused on the generation and characterisation of gradient PEG-like plasma polymer surfaces. These surfaces are ideal for the high throughput analysis of material-biological interactions, and were shown to be successful in the formation of chemical gradients of BSA, Lysozyme, IgG, human serum albumin (HAS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS). The gradient surfaces were analysed using complimentary techniques such as NEXAFS, XPS, synchrotron source gi FTIR microspectroscopy and ToF-SIMs and it was shown that more proteins adsorbed in regions of the gradients that displayed a lower ether and higher hydrocarbon and carbonyl content. Cell attachment was also investigated across the gradients, which appeared to be dictated by the adsorption of FBS which was present during the cell culture experiments. Time was shown to be a critical factor for the relative adsorption of FBS with the central region of the lower powered gradients showing to be FBS resistant (within XPS detection limits), while after a 24 hour adsorption period, proteins were measured across {{the entire length of the}} gradients. The generation and application of chemically micropatterned surfaces is discussed in the final results chapter of this thesis. By controlling the electrode geometry, we were able to deposit functional, chemically micro-patterned surfaces in one step using plasma polymerisation of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether. By etching patterned holes in the top, active electrode, and placing it to sit 1 mm above the substrate in the plasma reactor, variation to the plasma flow and resulting <b>sheath</b> <b>leads</b> to a low-fouling surrounding coating, while the patterned features (deposited under the holes of the electrode are more fragmented with a higher proportion of carbonyl and hydrocarbon species. The controlled spatial variation to surface chemistry was analysed and imaged using ToF-SIMS imaging and gi-FTIR microspectroscopy and the size and shape of the patterned features can be controlled with the design of the electrode. The biological applications of these chemically patterned surfaces was displayed by spatial control of protein (BSA) adsorption and cell (HeLa) attachment, as well as the spatial confinement of enzyme mediated self-assembled peptides...|$|R
