It was {{the aim of}} the study to screen the actually default values for dilution factors which were used actually in the ESD. During the project all producers of <b>laquers,</b> varnishes and cooling lubricants in germany were interviewed. A nationwide sample of the users of the same products was also interviewed. In all 2. 439 questionnaires and 1. 800 memory letters were sended to companies in germany. 54 percent of questionnaires for producers of <b>laquers</b> and varnishes and 75 percent of questionnaires for producers of cooling lubricants came back. In the fields of use 28, 7 percent of questionnaires for users of <b>laquers</b> and varnishes and 31, 1 percent of questionnaires for users of cooling lubricants came back. The number of 405 questionnaires could be evaluated. The collected datas were evaluated with statistical methods with reference to the number of answers. The statistical certainty of the values examined {{with the help of a}} non-parametric statistical test. As results 10 percentil values or minimum values were recommended for further use. The use of minimum values was caused by a small data stock for the evaluated values. The proposed dilution factors for the most analysed categories are lower than the present default values in the ESD. The size of the municipal sewage treatment plants is characterize by the daily effluent of waste water. They are about 30 percent smaller than the default-values of EC in the most cases of analysed industrial categories. (orig.)

5000|$|Hotchiku is a {{term that}} was popularized by Watzumi Doso. Traditional Komuso shakuhachi were quite similar, with three primary differences. First, Modern Hotchiku {{performers}} such as Doso and Okuda often prefer exceptionally long shakuhachi, while Komuso shakuhachi rarely exceeded 2.1 shaku. Second, Komuso shakuhachi had an inlaid mouthpiece, which protects the blowing edge from taking on excess moisture and rotting out. Thirdly, though ji is not used, the inside is painted with urushi, a natural <b>laquer</b> made from the sap of the urushi tree, used in Japan from antiquity. Like the mouthpiece inlay, this protects the bore from taking on excess moisture and contributes to the flute's longevity.|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} {{focuses on}} Anna Laqueur (nee Levy) (1850 - 1932), {{who became a}} matriach of the extended Laqueur-Levi family. Her spirited correspondence with her husband Siegfried Laqueur, a successful entrepreneuer, with her sons, her brother, her sisters, with an ever growing number of nephews and nieces, {{as well as her}} family's correspondence with her, reached an astounding volume. While it was possible to trace the lineage of the Laqueur family it required an extraordinary amount of patience and some guessing to establish the family relationships of the Levy clan, who like the Laqueur family originated from small towns in Silesia and who by virtue of hardwork and a well- focused business acumen achieved economic security. Their histories reflected in their correspondences and diaries are an example of the rise of German Jews from Eastern provinces from modest beginnings to a comfortable bourgeoisie. According to the grade of their assimilation {{it is not surprising that}} the second and third generation felt no longer restrained to marry outside the Jewish faith. Measured by the volume and intensity of the correspondence between the mother and sons Walter and Ernst, who both were to become physicians, it can be concluded that they were quite attached to each other. Unfortunately the bulk of the correspondence between Ernst and his mother is in shorthand. Anna, besides being the center of the Laqueur family, had wide ranging interests: poetry (mostly offered on festive occasions), correspondence with intellectuals (Geiger, Ludwig) and active involvement in social welfare and charities. She also travelled frequently. In short, she led a very active life, a true "mater familiae".

40|$|Chemical <b>laquering</b> is {{the most}} used process to enhance wear {{resistance}} of transparent plastic optics. Major drawbacks of this process are the poor thickness uniformity across the substrates and the bad reproducibility. Evaporation and sputtering techniques are applied for the optical interference coatings. In this project, wear resistant layers in combination with optical interference coatings onto transparent plastic substrates were investigated for ophthalmic and for precision optic applications. For {{the production of the}} hard coating of opthalmic lenses plasma-IAD and PECVD were used simultaneously. With a combination of the hard-coating and the broadband AR-coating in one process very good adhesion and chemical resistance were achieved. The results of the eraser abrasion test and the temper test are superior to conventional coatings. This process was also applied successfully with PC lenses. Because of reduced throughput times and reduced production costs this process offers significant economical advantages in comparison to the conventional chemical hardlaquering in combination with a vacuum deposition process. For PMMA a monomer bufferlayer was desposited and polymerised in the vacuum chamber. With an additional quartz layer on top of the polymer film good adhesion and good results in the temperature cycle test were achieved. (orig.)

40|$|Anti-microbial fitted {{polymers}} {{can protect}} {{the surface of}} food from unwanted microorganisms like bacteria, yeast and mould or prevent or suppress their growth. This type of active packaging contributes to a better quality and shelf life. Today the extended use of polymers offers new possibilities to construct anti-microbial packaging materials. There are two different mechanisms of anti-microbial fitted films, surface fixed anti-microbial groups or release of active agents. Based on the release mechanism different antimicrobial substances can be used and put into films via several procedures. Our conception: We aim to remove preservatives from food and place them only where protection is necessary. Preservatives are released in a low concentration from the packaging to contact the food surface. Therefore we use food grade polymers and preservatives permitted in Germany in food and polymers as well (benzoic and sorbic acid). We also use conventional technologies like compounding or preferably <b>laquering</b> for upgrading of basic films. Mono- or multilayer films can be fitted additionally with active layers. They do not interfere with mechanical or physical properties of the basic material. The anti-microbial packaging works by slow migration of the agents from the packaging material {{to the surface of}} the products, thus helping to maintain concentrations needed. The incorporated substances can control microbial contamination. Therefore use is predestinated for solid or semi solid food or semi-finished products directly in contact with the foil: dairy products, fresh meat, meat products, fish, pasta, bread, fruits, vegetables.

40|$|Tetrachloroethylene and its daughter-products {{represent}} {{a group of}} contaminations which are frequently found at sites with industrial activities, such as metal processing, electrotechnical and pharmaceutical industries as well as dry cleaning of clothing {{and the production of}} colours, paints and <b>laquers.</b> Due to their toxicity and persistence under natural conditions "denser-than-water" non aqueous phase liquids are substantial threats to the subsurface environment as well as the surface ecosystems including human beings. During the last two decades a number of technical solutions has been presented to enhance the situation of contaminated areas. One of the more recently established concepts are permeable reactive barriers. Permeable reactive barriers are passive in situ treatment zones containing a reactive material suitable to remove the contamination from the groundwater. They are installed downgradient from the pollution source perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction to immobilise or degrade the dissolved pollutants in the groundwater as it flows through. This project was organised in two main parts. The first part assessed seven different iron powders in batch experiments to determine the most efficient powder in terms of degradation velocity. The second part of the study employed this powder in a column experiment using different mixing ratios with sand to evaluate its performance under simulated subsurface conditions in a permeable reactive barrier. The aim of this experiment was to obtain a more detailed description of the behaviour and performance of the selected material. In the batch experiment the most promissing iron powder produced a half-life of tetrachloroethylene of 2. 36 h. The column study demonstrated that cis-dichloroethylene has the longest half-life compared to tetrachlorethylene and trichloroethylene with 1. 65 h.

Working with industrial chemists, Avella designed a Jaquard weave pattern to function as substrate for this <b>laquer</b> coating. Successfully used to make womenswear with a high gloss finish, this textile was patented before being displayed in 2010 and much imitated in other collections. Continuing this research for the following collection Avella pursued experiments in laboratory-based industrial chemistry to find a liquid coating that could, like ‘laquer’, be applied as a surface finish to textiles. The resulting metallic iridescent surface was first used in the 20 ?? Collection (Intellectual Property YSL). Whilst the culture of neophilia in Womenswear fashion at YSL demands permanent innovation for stylistic rather than functional reasons, the innovations in the surface coatings of textiles has potential instrumentality which Avella brings to the resources of the RCA Materials For Living Research Hub and its Inspiring Matter Biennial Conference (2012).
