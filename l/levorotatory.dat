25|$|Deprenyl is a racemic compound, {{a mixture}} of two isomers called enantiomers. Further work {{determined}} that the <b>levorotatory</b> enantiomer was a more potent MAO-inhibitor, {{which was published in}} 1967, and subsequent work was done with the single enantiomer L-deprenyl.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists {{in the form of}} two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- synephrine. The dextrorotatory d-isomer corresponds to the (S)-configuration, and the <b>levorotatory</b> l-isomer to the (R)-configuration.|$|E
25|$|Racemic {{epinephrine}} {{has historically}} been used {{for the treatment of}} croup. Regular epinephrine however works equally well. Racemic adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the dextrorotatory (D) and <b>levorotatory</b> (L) isomers of adrenaline. The L-form is the active component. Racemic adrenaline works by stimulation of the alpha adrenergic receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulation of the β adrenergic receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of zopiclone {{in humans}} are stereoselective. After oral {{administration of the}} racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the <b>levorotatory</b> enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are {{higher than those of}} the respective antipodes.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{noticed that}} {{crystals}} of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, {{half of the}} crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was <b>levorotatory.</b> Pasteur determined that optical activity related {{to the shape of}} the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light. The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{rotation}} {{of a given}} enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its salts and free base form. The free base form of (S)‑ketamine exhibits dextrorotation and is therefore labelled (S)‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its hydrochloride salt shows levorotation and is thus labelled (S)‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride. The difference originates from the conformation of the cyclohexanone ring. In both the free base and the hydrochloride, the cyclohexanone ring adopts a chair conformation, but {{the orientation of the}} substituents varies. In the free base, the o-chlorophenyl group adopts an equatorial position and the methylamino group adopts an axial position. In the hydrochloride salt, the positions are reversed, with the o-chlorophenyl group axial and the methylamino group equatorial. Not all salts of ketamine show different {{optical rotation}} to the free base: (S)-ketamine (R,R)-tartrate is <b>levorotatory,</b> like (S)‑ketamine.|$|E
500|$|... 1849:Louis Pasteur {{discovers that}} the racemic form of tartaric acid {{is a mixture}} of the <b>levorotatory</b> and dextrotatory forms, thus {{clarifying}} the nature of optical rotation and advancing the field of stereochemistry.|$|E
500|$|The alpha {{amino acids}} {{are the most}} common form found in nature, but only when {{occurring}} in the L-isomer. The alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom, with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon. [...] Therefore, all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers, called L or D amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (see also Chirality). While L-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome, D-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as cone snails. They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria, and D-serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain. D-amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals, which (depending on the protein) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination. The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory; L-glyceraldehyde is <b>levorotatory).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Recently, levomilnacipran, the <b>levorotatory</b> {{enantiomer}} of milnacipran, {{has been}} found to act as an inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which is responsible for β-amyloid plaque formation, and hence may [...] be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Other BACE-1 inhibitors, such as CTS-21166 (ASP1720), MK-8931, and AZD3293 are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{classical}} {{description of}} F-actin {{states that it}} has a filamentous structure that can be considered to be a single stranded <b>levorotatory</b> helix with a rotation of 166° around the helical axis and an axial translation of 27.5 Å, or a single stranded dextrorotatory helix with a cross over spacing of 350-380 Å, with each actin surrounded by four more. The symmetry of the actin polymer at 2.17 subunits per turn of a helix is incompatible with the formation of crystals, which is only possible with a symmetry of exactly 2, 3, 4 or 6 subunits per turn. Therefore, models have to be constructed that explain these anomalies using data from electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, crystallization of dimers in different positions and diffraction of X-rays. It {{should be pointed out that}} it is not correct to talk of a “structure” for a molecule as dynamic as the actin filament. In reality we talk of distinct structural states, in these the measurement of axial translation remains constant at 27.5 Å while the subunit rotation data shows considerable variability, with displacements of up to 10% from its optimum position commonly seen. Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different [...] "structural states". These could be important in the polymerization process.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] {{labeling}} is {{unrelated to}} (+)/(−); {{it does not}} indicate which enantiomer is dextrorotatory and which is <b>levorotatory.</b> Rather, it indicates the compound's stereochemistry relative {{to that of the}} dextrorotatory or <b>levorotatory</b> enantiomer of glyceraldehyde. The dextrorotatory isomer of glyceraldehyde is, in fact, the [...] isomer. Nine of the nineteen -amino acids commonly found in proteins are dextrorotatory (at a wavelength of 589 nm), and -fructose is also referred to as levulose because it is <b>levorotatory.</b> A rule of thumb for determining the [...] isomeric form of an amino acid is the [...] "CORN" [...] rule.

50|$|The {{presence}} of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the N-methylphenylethanolamine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists {{in the form of}} two enantiomers, d- and l-N-methylphenylethanolamine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- N-methylphenylethanolamine. The dextrorotatory isomer corresponds to the S-configuration, and the <b>levorotatory</b> isomer to the R-configuration.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reported}} kinetic resolution {{was achieved by}} Louis Pasteur. After reacting aqueous racemic ammonium tartrate with a mold from Penicillium glaucum, he reisolated the remaining tartrate and found it was <b>levorotatory.</b> The chiral microorganisms present in the mold catalyzed the metabolization of (R,R)-tartrate selectively, leaving an excess of (S,S)-tartrate.|$|E
50|$|Levormeloxifene (INN) is an {{experimental}} selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) {{that was being}} developed {{as an alternative to}} estrogen replacement therapy for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal bone loss.

50|$|Like many chiral molecules, the two {{stereoisomers}} of glyceraldehyde {{will gradually}} rotate the polarization direction of linearly polarized light {{as it passes}} through it, even in solution. The two stereoisomers are identified with the prefixes D- and L-, according {{to the sense of}} rotation: D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory (rotates the polarization axis clockwise), while L-glyceraldehyde is <b>levorotatory</b> (rotates it counterclockwise).|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic carbon of the phenylethanolamine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists {{in the form of}} two enantiomers, d- and l-phenylethanolamine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l-phenylethanolamine. The dextrorotatory isomer corresponds to the S-configuration, and the <b>levorotatory</b> isomer to the R-configuration The data given at right is for the racemate.|$|E
50|$|Levonorgestrel, {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is the C13β or <b>levorotatory</b> stereoisomer and enantiopure form of norgestrel, the C13α or dextrorotatory isomer being inactive. Levonorgestrel is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is the parent compound of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{in water}} {{or in the}} solid form, D- (+) glucose is dextrorotatory, meaning it will rotate the {{direction}} of polarized light clockwise. The effect {{is due to the}} chirality of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, L- (-)glucose, is <b>levorotatory</b> (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five tautomers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} synthesis at Janssen Pharmaceutica {{resulted in}} the preparation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, whose hydrochloride salt was reported to have a melting point of 264-265 °C; the free base of the racemate has a melting point of 87-89 °C. The racemic mixture is referred to as [...] "tetramisole" [...] - levamisole refers only to the <b>levorotatory</b> enantiomer of tetramisole.|$|E
50|$|A {{compound}} with dextrorotation {{is called}} dextrorotatory or dextrorotary, while a compound with levorotation is called <b>levorotatory</b> or levorotary. Compounds with these properties {{are said to}} have optical activity and consist of chiral molecules. If a chiral molecule is dextrorotary, its enantiomer (geometric mirror image) will be levorotary, and vice versa. The enantiomers will rotate plane polarized light the same number of degrees, but in opposite directions.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine is {{optically}} active, {{having two}} enantiomeric forms. The naturally occurring form of nicotine is <b>levorotatory</b> {{with a specific}} rotation of αD = -166.4° ((−)-nicotine). The dextrorotatory form, (+)-nicotine is physiologically less active than (-)-nicotine. (−)-nicotine is more toxic than (+)-nicotine. The salts of (+)-nicotine are usually dextrorotatory. The hydrochloride and sulphate salts become optically inactive if heated in a closed vessel above 180 °C.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} D- prefix does not refer {{directly}} to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of D-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that D-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed {{some of the other}} D-aldohexoses are <b>levorotatory.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term optical {{activity}} {{is derived from}} the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or <b>levorotatory</b> form, of an optical isomer rotates the plane of a beam of linearly polarized light counterclockwise. The (+)-form, or dextrorotatory form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a polarimeter and is expressed as the optical rotation.|$|E
50|$|Helicenes are {{notable for}} having {{chirality}} despite lacking both asymmetric carbons and chiral centers. The chirality {{results from the}} handedness of the helicity itself. The clockwise and counterclockwise helices are non-superposable {{as a result of}} their axial chirality. By convention a left-handed helix is minus and labeled M, a right-handed helix is plus and labeled P. Evidence from CD spectroscopy suggests left-handed helices are <b>levorotatory</b> and right-handed helices are dextrorotatory.|$|E
