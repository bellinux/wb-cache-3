500|$|The {{following}} day, Richard went on Montreal {{radio to}} ask fans to cease rioting, and instead support the Canadiens in the playoffs; {{he offered to}} take his punishment then come back the following year to win the Cup. While the Canadiens were eliminated in the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals, Richard led Montreal to the 1956 Stanley Cup. [...] The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada; the riot is often characterized as an early manifestation of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. Campbell's decision to suspend Richard was widely supported by fans outside of Quebec. Some, including Detroit's Ted <b>Lindsay,</b> <b>said</b> the suspension did {{not go far enough}} and argued Richard, a man who had paid more fines than any other player in league history, should have been banned for life.|$|E

Where was I {{going to get a}} double century to compensate? My two innings in that match totalled seven runs." ...|$|E
2500|$|BBC One {{controller}} Danny Cohen, when {{commenting on}} the decision to axe the series, said [...] "Now that all the Harper children have flown the nest we feel it's time {{to make room for}} new comedies". Robert <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said</b> in an interview with The Daily Telegraph: [...] "I'm amazed by the public's love for the series [...] When Kris Marshall left in 2005 I was convinced that was it.

2500|$|While {{promoting}} the storyline, Nicholas {{said he had}} enjoyed working on EastEnders but {{did not know if}} he would return again. Nicholas also said that Gavin is [...] "trying to get [...] back and he is trying to stay in control. He is very much how the mood takes him—whether he tips over to being nice or being nasty. It could go very badly wrong". Following the episode on 5 July 2016 in which Gavin lures Kathy to his mansion under false pretences, Sarah Deen from the Metro said that Gavin [...] "must have a head made of concrete" [...] after surviving being hit on the head with a vase, and called the episode [...] "tense and creepy" [...] and like a [...] "horror movie". <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said</b> that Gavin made a [...] "shock exit" [...] in the following episode, and said [...] "he remained a villain to the very end." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Dennis and Lindsay Crosby {{confirmed}} {{that their father}} was physically abusive. Lindsay added, [...] "I'm glad [...] did it. I hope it clears {{up a lot of}} the old lies and rumors." [...] Unlike Gary, however, <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said</b> that he preferred to remember [...] "all the good things I did with my dad and forget the times that were rough." [...] Dennis asserted that the book was [...] "Gary's business" [...] and a result of his [...] "anger," [...] but would not deny the book's claims. Bing's younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader Bob Crosby, recalled at the time of Gary's revelations that Bing was a [...] "disciplinarian," [...] as their mother and father had been. He added, [...] "We were brought up that way." [...] In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing was abusive as a means of administering punishment: [...] "He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{airing of}} his final episode, West {{received}} further praise through Twitter, with one user stating [...] "What a wonderful piece of acting by the cast of Eastenders tonight, especially Timothy West.", [...] "Timothy West is a fantastic actor! RIP Stan." [...] and [...] "Crying so much at tonight's @bbceastenders Timothy West was so so amazing, he will be truly missed! #RIPStan" [...] Danny Walker of the Daily Mirror felt the cast made [...] "stellar performances" [...] in the build-up to Stan's death and thought Stan's death was [...] "emotional" [...] and [...] "brilliant". <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said</b> that Stan's death was [...] "devastating" [...] and praised West, Henry and Dyer for their acting in the final scenes. In a [...] "farewell" [...] feature for Beamly, Brent-Slater described Stan as [...] "wonderful, grumpy and generally brilliant". Dyer and Bright featured in an EastEnders special feature, , in which they watch clips of their time on the show; during this, both Dyer and Bright praised West and his acting, with Bright calling him a [...] "legend".|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Lindsay and {{his wife}} cut ties with the Republican Party by {{registering}} with the Democratic Party. <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "In a sense, this step recognizes the failure of 20 years in progressive Republican politics. In another sense, it represents the renewed decision to fight for new national leadership." [...] Lindsay then launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. He attracted positive media attention and was a successful fundraiser. Lindsay did well in the early Arizona caucus, coming in second place behind Edmund Muskie of Maine and ahead of eventual nominee George McGovern of South Dakota. Then in the March 14 Florida primary, he placed a weak fifth place, behind George Wallace of Alabama, Muskie, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and Scoop Jackson of Washington (though he did edge out McGovern). Among his difficulties was New York City's worsening problems, which Lindsay was accused of neglecting; a band of protesters from Forest Hills, Queens, who were opposed to his support for a low income housing project in their neighborhood, followed Lindsay around his aborted campaign itinerary to jeer and heckle him. His poor showing in Florida effectively doomed his candidacy. New York City politician Meade Esposito called for Lindsay to end his campaign with the much-publicized comment [...] "I think the handwriting is on the wall; Little Sheba better come home." [...] After a poor showing in the April 5 Wisconsin primary, Lindsay formally abandoned the race.|$|E

5000|$|On AllMusic, <b>Lindsay</b> Planer <b>said,</b> [...] "Oswald's uncanny compositions—which he terms [...] "plunderphonics"—are sculpted by {{morphing}} and layering multiple incarnations {{of a song}} to make {{a thoroughly}} unique version.... While {{it may not be}} everyone's blend of surreal sonic psychedelics, Grayfolded is well executed and worthy of inclusion in any Deadhead collection." ...|$|R

"I {{hope they}} are not going to make another twenty years' war of it," [...] <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "If you go on in the way that you are doing, Drummond, you will be a field marshal in a third of that time; but you must {{remember}} about the proverb of the pitcher and the well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "These {{movements}} mean nothing," [...] <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said,</b> as {{he returned}} from one of these rides. [...] "The marshal makes the changes simply {{for the sake of}} doing something--partly, perhaps, to take the king's attention off this confounded delay; partly to interest the troops, who must be just as restless and impatient as we are." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review of}} Where Did Everyone Go? by <b>Lindsay</b> Planer <b>said</b> [...] "there is a {{perceptible}} poignancy and longing weaved throughout Jenkins' arrangements.

Cole's practically conversational delivery of pop standards...become musical soliloquies with the score as a sonic subtext." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} business," [...] <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said</b> seriously. [...] "As bad in its way as Prague, {{that is to say}} in {{proportion}} to the numbers engaged. Everyone says they would rather fight three Austrians than one Russian. The marshal has rather scored off the king; for he warned him that, though slow, the Russians were formidable foes, but the king scoffed at the idea. He has found out now that he greatly undervalued them, and has owned as much to Keith.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{strictly}} forbidden," [...] <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said,</b> with a laugh; [...] "but I need hardly {{say that there}} is a good deal of it. Of course, pains are taken that these affairs do not come to his majesty's ears. Fever, or a fall from a horse, account satisfactorily enough for the absence of an officer from parade, and even his total disappearance from the scene can be similarly explained. Should the affair come to the king's ears, 'tis best to keep out of his way until it has blown over.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} {{long enough for}} him to see that Mary is a charming girl," [...] Mrs. <b>Lindsay</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "He has seen very little of ladies; and he is, no doubt, struck with the idea that she is an {{extremely}} nice girl. I don't say that he is in love with her, yet; but quite enough, perhaps, to foresee that, ere long, he will feel more ardent than he does at present; and that it is the only arrangement possible, since we are determined to turn out for him.|$|E
