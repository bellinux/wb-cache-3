5|$|Having {{existed for}} over 600 years, Gray's Inn {{has a long}} list of notable members and honorary members. Even as the {{smallest}} of the Inns of Court it has had members who have been particularly noted <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges,</b> such as Francis Bacon, The 1st Earl of Birkenhead, Baron Slynn, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hoffmann and others. Outside the Bar and judiciary of England and Wales, members have included the clergy (including five Archbishops of Canterbury), industrialists like John Wynne, astronomers such as John Lee, media figures, like Huw Thomas, and members of the Bar and judiciary of other nations, such as Sir Ti-liang Yang (former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong), B. R. Ambedkar (principal architect of the Constitution of India) and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and also former presidents of Cyprus Spyros Kyprianou, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Glafcos Clerides.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to the trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges,</b> particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E

25|$|Dando's BBC {{colleague}} Nick Ross stated on Newsnight on {{the night}} of her death that retaliatory attacks by criminals against police, <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> were almost unknown in Britain. Finally, forensic examination of the cartridge case and bullet recovered from the scene of the attack suggested that the weapon used had been the result of a workshop conversion of a replica or decommissioned gun. It was argued that a professional assassin would not use such a poor quality weapon. The police therefore soon began to favour the idea that the killing had been carried out by a crazed individual acting on an opportunist basis. This assumed profile of the perpetrator led to the focus on Barry George.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} his B.A. degree, Garner {{entered the}} University of Texas School of Law, {{where he served}} as {{an associate editor of}} the Texas Law Review. After receiving his J.D. degree in 1984, he clerked for Judge Thomas M.

He then returned to the University of Texas School of Law as a visiting associate professor of law and was named director of the Texas/Oxford Center for Legal Lexicography, while teaching upper-division seminars on writing and editing at the law school. In 1990, he left the University to found LawProse Inc., a Dallas firm that provides seminars on clear writing for <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> and offers consulting services on appellate and high-stakes briefing and revising corporate and other legal documents.|$|E
25|$|After his {{personal}} tragedies while he remaining locked in his room, Blackford {{began working on}} a book to report the important decisions of the Supreme Court and provide a legal source to the state <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges.</b> He was meticulous and precise in his writing. His biographer attributed his ability to write concisely {{to the fact that he}} never practiced law extensively, and never developed the habit of writing lengthy arguments, but instead kept his thoughts clear and precise. Each volume he authored covered a decade of court decisions and were published four years after the decade was complete. So careful was Blackford in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the work, he regularly held up printing to make corrections found after a few volumes were printed, and after they were printed, if an error was reported, he would destroy the existing copies and have new ones made. He used his own savings to have the books published with the intention of selling them to lawyers in Indiana. The sale of the books brought Blackford a substantial income, and he earned between $1,500 and $2,000 annually on royalties.|$|E

500|$|Another tax protester {{argument}} centers {{upon the}} pending and inoperative Titles of Nobility Amendment. [...] Proposed as {{an amendment to}} the Constitution by the 11th Congress in 1810, it would, if ratified by the required number of states, strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign government. [...] The contention here is that this amendment was in fact ratified by the required number of states (in the 1810s) to have become an operative part of the Constitution, and that, because this is so, actions taken by <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges,</b> who use the title Esquire–asserted to be a title of nobility and monarchical–are unconstitutional. In fact, the use of [...] "Esquire" [...] by <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> is merely an informal custom in the United States, not a title with any legal standing. This contention, rarely raised before courts, was most recently addressed in Campion v. Towns, No.CV-04-1516PHX-ROS, *2 n.1 (D. Ariz. 2005) as a defense to a charge of tax evasion. The court replied: ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the loss}} of its {{equitable}} jurisdiction, the Exchequer became a dedicated common law court, and thus fell prey to the same fate as the other two common law courts (the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Common Pleas) during the late 19th century. There had long been calls for the merger of the courts, and in 1828 Henry Brougham, a Member of Parliament, complained in Parliament {{that as long as}} there were three courts unevenness was inevitable, saying that [...] "It is not {{in the power of the}} courts, even if all were monopolies and other restrictions done away, to distribute business equally, as long as suitors are left free to choose their own tribunal", and that there would always be a favourite court, which would therefore attract the best <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> and entrench its position.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} what role Hitler himself played in {{granting}} protection to Hess. A case {{is known of}} a Jew who enjoyed Hitler's personal protection—his former family doctor, Eduard Bloch, whom Hitler called an Edeljude ("noble Jew"). Hitler {{is known to have}} felt very close to the other veterans of his regiment. Thomas Weber, the author of Hitler's First War: Adolf Hitler, the Men of the List Regiment, and the First World War, has said that it is conceivable that Hitler knew Hess personally because the two men had been wounded in the Battle of the Somme only a day apart, and may have been initially treated in the same place before being transported together to the same hospital in Germany. However, Weber cautions that the letters of protection may have been organised without Hitler's knowledge by Wiedemann, [...] "because he did the same in other cases involving Jewish soldiers." [...] The letter from Himmler was not found until 2012, when it was discovered in surviving Gestapo files on Jewish <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> in Germany. It was publicised in the July 2012 issue of the quarterly publication Jewish Voice From Germany and was corroborated by Hess's daughter Ursula.|$|E
500|$|On 13 August 1582 Coke married Bridget, the {{daughter}} of John Paston, a Counsellor from Norwich. Paston came {{from a long line}} of <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> – his great grandfather, William Paston, was a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Having grown up nearby Coke knew the family, and asked for Bridget's hand immediately after she turned eighteen. At the time he was a thirty-one-year-old barrister with a strong practice, and her father had no qualms about accepting his offer. Six months after they married John Paston died, leaving his daughter and son-in-law his entire estate and several of his clients. Bridget maintained a diary, which reveals that she mainly ran the household. Despite this she was an independent woman, travelling without her husband and acting as a helpmate to Coke. Bridget was noted by Woolrych as an [...] "incomparable" [...] woman who had [...] "inestimable value clearly manifested by the eulogies which are lavished on her character". The couple settled at the manor of Huntingfield, described by Catherine Drinker Bowen as [...] "enchanting, with a legend for every turret... A splendid gallery ran the length of the house, the Great Hall was built around six massive oaks which supported the roof as they grew".|$|E

500|$|On January 10, 1825, Desha {{appointed}} four justices {{to the new}} court. He {{chose his}} Secretary of State, former U.S. Senator William T. Barry, as chief justice. The other three members were Lexington lawyer James Haggin, Circuit Judge John Trimble (brother of Supreme Court Justice Robert Trimble), and Benjamin Patton. Of the new court [...] called by detractors the [...] "Desha court" [...] Barry [...] "seems {{to have been the}} only one who had in a measure an even show in experience, prestige, and ability to rank as a jurist with the old-court justices", according to Stickles. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused to surrender the court's records to Francis P. Blair, clerk of the New Court, so Blair took the records from Sneed's office by force, and Sneed was fined 10 pounds for contempt of court because of his refusal to cooperate. The Old Court continued to hear cases in a Frankfort church, while the New Court occupied the official court chambers. Neither recognized the other, and both claimed to be the legitimate court of last resort in the state. Most of the state's <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> were supporters of the Old Court and continued to practice before them and abide by their mandates, but others chose to acknowledge the New Court as legitimate.|$|E
500|$|In March 1599, Devereux {{was sent}} to defeat the growing {{rebellion}} in Ireland and was given command of 18,000men, but by November his army was reduced to 4,000, the rest [...] "frittered away" [...] in exchange for [...] " [...] nothing". On 5 June 1600 he faced a panel of Privy Councillors, judges {{and members of the}} nobility at York House, where he was charged with appointing generals without the Queen's permission, ignoring orders and negotiating [...] "very basely" [...] with the leader of the rebel forces. While the members of the nobility wished to be gentle with Devereux, the <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> felt differently, recommending fines and confinement in the Tower of London. In the end a compromise was reached, with Devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices. Devereux immediately began plotting rebellion. Orders were sent out for [...] "bedding" [...] and [...] "draperies"– codenames for weapons– and rebellious gentlemen gathered at Essex House to hear him talk of Elizabeth's [...] "crooked mind and crooked carcass". In response, Coke and Cecil began a counter-plot. In 1599 Sir John Hayward had written and published The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV, dedicating it to Devereux. Elizabeth, furious, had banned the book, suggesting that it was a [...] "seditious prelude" [...] intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch. Against the backdrop of Devereux's plot, Coke and Cecil started a new investigation into the book, hoping to prove some involvement of Devereux in the publishing. Coke interviewed Hayward's licensing cleric, Samuel Harsnett, who complained that the dedication had been [...] "foisted" [...] on him by Devereux. In reaction, Coke decided to bring charges of treason against Devereux, saying that he had [...] "plotted and practised with the Pope and king of Spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of England... His permitting underhand that treasonable book of Henry IV to be printed and published; it being plainly deciphered, not only by the matter, and by the epistle itself, for what end and for whose behalf it was made, but also the Earl himself being present so often at the playing thereof, and with great applause giving countenance to it".|$|E
