40|$|Radioisotopes are {{efficient}} tracers {{of coastal}} processes on various {{spatial and temporal}} scales. The isotopes of radon and radium are particularly useful tools to understand hydrological <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction</b> because (a) activities of these isotopes are elevated in groundwater by two to three orders of magnitude in comparison with seawater, and (b) these isotopes have half-lives similar to the time scales of coastal hydrological processes such as river and groundwater discharge to the ocean, as well as coastal ocean mixing (or residence) time. The application of these isotopes to studies of <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction</b> in the central Great Barrier Reef region (Townsville to Cooktown) is illustrated in three recent studies: (1) coastal mapping of radon on a regional scale improves {{the understanding of the}} spatial variability of river and groundwater fluxes to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon; (2) quantification of tidal water exchange between mangrove forests and creeks demonstrates the significant contributions this process makes to water flux and associated geochemical fluxes along tropical coastlines; (3) estimates of coastal water residence time contribute {{to the understanding of the}} fate of land-derived solutes in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. Concurrent mapping of 222 Rn (half-life 3. 8 days) and salinity allows an efficient qualitative assessment of <b>land–ocean</b> <b>interaction</b> on various spatial and temporal scales. From shore-parallel transects along the Central Great Barrier Reef coastline with a surface-towed and continuously recording multi-detector system, numerous locations of elevated radon activities can be identified as terrestrially-derived submarine groundwater discharge, riverine sources, and the recirculation of seawater through crustacean burrows in mangrove forests. Variations in the inverse relationship of 222 Rn and salinity in different tropical wet seasons reveal ‘timing’ aspects of large-scale freshwater input during the tropical wet season into the lagoon. Subsequently, 222 Rn was used together with radium isotopes to quantify the tidal water exchange between a mangrove forest on Hinchinbrook Island and the ocean. Significant export of these radio-nuclides from the forest into a tidal creek indicates continuous tidally-driven circulation through animal burrows in the forest. The forest floor is efficiently flushed, with water flux of about 30 L m- 2 day- 1 of forest floor, which is equivalent to about 10...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Holocene {{sedimentary}} facies of the Fenland {{are described}} using a lithological database and new cores recovered {{as part of}} the <b>Land-Ocean</b> <b>Interaction</b> Study. Landward, the Holocene sequence is dominated by mud facies with intercalated peat layers, whereas the seaward areas are sand-dominated. The sedimentological characteristics of the mud facies are homogeneous and are similar for the whole sequence. Glacial deposits located north of The Wash are thought o be the main sediment sources. The sand facies generally fines upwards and the chemistry reflects this change. However, lemental ratios show only slight variations between the two facies implying a general constancy of sediment provenance. The evolution of the Fenland has been dominated by three main events. Firstly, the initial post-glacial transgression, which started c. 7850 cal. BP. Secondly, the sedimentary infilling of the embayment with rising sea-level; deposition of intertidal clastic sediments alternating with peat accumulation. Thirdly, renewed expansion of tidal flat areas between c. 2750 and 1500 cal. BP forming the final clastic fill.

The importance of a link between tidal range, fresh water flow and recorded suspended sediment concentrations, is illustrated by reference to data collected under the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) <b>Land–Ocean</b> <b>Interaction</b> Study (LOIS) initiative (1992 – 1998). Data recorded at Burringham, on the River Trent upstream of Trent Falls show a clear link between tidal range and suspended sediment concentrations which is strongly influenced by the downstream flushing effects of high fresh water flow events. While the arguments presented in this discussion do not contradict the main findings in the original paper it is proposed that {{a better understanding of}} siltation in the Humber system may be promoted by understanding the behaviour of the turbidity maximum in this system and its related mobile sediment population. It is suggested that the rapid reduction in suspended sediment concentration brought about by sudden increases in fresh water flow is probably indicative of the highly canalised nature of the tidal reaches of the Trent and Ouse...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} status, {{the difference}} between organic matter production and consumption of an estuary (Randers Fjord, Denmark) has been assessed based on 2 field cruises in April and August 2001 {{and a number of}} approaches: (1) the oxygen (0 2) incubation method, (2) dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) budgets, (3) the response surface difference (RSD) method based on diel O 2 changes and (4) <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction</b> in the coastal zone (LOICZ) budgets based on dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Although each method has its own associated limitations and uncertainties, the above approaches converged most of the time in consistent metabolic estimates, both in sign and magnitude, and revealed that this system was near metabolic balance in spring (net ecosystem production: NEP similar to 0) and net heterotrophic in summer (NEP similar to - 50 mmol C m - 2 d - 1).

40|$|Purpose The Yellow River Delta, {{an active}} <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction</b> area, will {{develop into a}} large eco-economic region in East China during the coming decade. It is {{necessary}} to assess the geochemical features of heavy metals in the soils. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the concentrations and distribution of heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd) in soil profiles of the area and to identify their sources. Materials and methods Horizon samples were collected based on pedogenic features from bottom to top in each profile {{to a depth of}} 120 cm and a total of 92 samples were collected. The sampling sites were grouped into four lines from inland to coastal area with three land use types (cotton field, cereal field, and wetland). The concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Iron oxide fractions in the soil were extracted by oxalate-oxalic acid and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the mineral composition of the soils. Multivariate statistical analysis and historical data were employed to identify the possible sources of these heavy metals. Results and discussion The mean concentrations of heavy metals were elevated along the Yellow River region and {{in the southern part of}} the delta; however, they were generally lower than the Chinese guideline values. As for the depth distribution of heavy metals in soil profiles, the maximum values of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd in middle horizon of cotton field were almost twice than those in surface horizon. The iron oxides and XRD analysis indicated that the trace elements accumulation appeared to be related with the contents of crystalline iron oxide and layer silicates. Historical data from suspended sediments of the Yellow River and principal component analysis (PCA) implied that most of the metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) were sourced from natural alluviation and sedimentation. Conclusions The Yellow River Delta soils were slightly polluted by heavy metals the Yellow River Delta. The special pedogenic horizon characterized by higher iron oxides and layered silicates minerals in the middle and lower part of the soil profile was found with heavy metals enrichment, which required to be studied further. Suspended sediments transported by the Yellow River were suggested to be one of the major sources for the heavy metals accumulation in the basal soils of this region. Purpose The Yellow River Delta, an active <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction</b> area, will develop into a large eco-economic region in East China during the coming decade.

40|$|Submarine {{groundwater}} discharge (SGD) {{into the ocean}} is increasingly recognized as {{an important component of}} <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction.</b> Numerous geological settings may be the source of terrestrially derived SGD, including spatially extensive sand dune systems, which are a common coastal setting in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions throughout the world. Within the catchment of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, numerous large-scale sand dune systems exist. Creeks and rivers draining these systems are largely absent; however, terrestrially derived {{groundwater discharge}}s from discrete springs in the intertidal zone. The geological and hydrological controls of the discharge were investigated, using a combination of geological, geophysical, and hydrological methods. From sedimentary and geoelectric data it is inferred that a unit of sandy clay provides a confinement of the shallow aquifer system in the dune complex, with groundwater discharging where this layer is breached. Groundwater discharge flux was inversely correlated with tidal water level, but remained positive throughout the tidal cycle. A simple hydrological model indicates that the continuous discharge {{is the result of a}} change in hydraulic pressure of the confined aquifer in response to tidal forcing at the seaward limit of the aquitard, which is a previously undescribed effect of tidal modulation of SGD. The observed groundwater discharge is likely to have a significant effect on the biogeochemistry of the coastal environment, particularly in the absence of surface water drainage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results and}} conclusions of the INCA (Integrated Nitrogen Model for European CAtchments) project and sets the findings {{in the context of}} the ELOISE (European <b>Land-Ocean</b> <b>Interaction</b> Studies) programme. The INCA project was concerned with the development of a generic model of the major factors and processes controlling nitrogen dynamics in European river systems, thereby providing a tool (a) to aid the scientific understanding of nitrogen transport and retention in catchments and (b) for river-basin management and policy-making. The findings of the study highlight the heterogeneity of the factors and processes controlling nitrogen dynamics in freshwater systems. Nonetheless, the INCA model was able to simulate the in-stream nitrogen concentrations and fluxes observed at annual and seasonal timescales in Arctic, Continental and Maritime-Temperate regimes. This result suggests that the data requirements and structural complexity of the INCA model are appropriate to simulate nitrogen fluxes across a wide range of European freshwater environments. This is a major requirement for the production of coupled fiver-estuary-coastal shelf models for the management of our aquatic environment. With regard to river-basin management, to achieve an efficient reduction in nutrient fluxes from the land to the estuarine and coastal zone, the model simulations suggest that management options must be adaptable to the prevailing environmental and socio-economic factors in individual catchments: 'Blanket approaches' to environmental policy appear too simple.

The new-born coastal wetland was formed in 1996, without any effects of human activities since then. Plant communities composed by herbaceous plants and few woody plants characterized the zonal distribution from the river to the sea. The herbaceous plants emerged from the river bank or the sea beach to the inner upland, while the woody plants changed with opposite trends. Most plants near the river were not halotolerant, while plants near the sea were mainly halophytes. Species richness and Shannon-Wiener index coincided with this similar trend. Species diversity in the upland was larger than that near the river or the sea. The upstream seed bank was responsible for vegetation species.

Nutrient {{temporal and spatial}} distributions were evaluated, in addition to budgets and fluxes derived from the <b>Land-Ocean</b> <b>Interaction</b> in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) biogeochemical model, to determine dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrient distribution, flux, and fate in the Mullica River–Great Bay Estuary. Seasonal cycles were observed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP) with increasing concentrations from spring to fall and maximum concentrations in summer/early fall. Annually, the estuarine system was a net source of DOC (5 mol m 2 y 1), DON (0. 08 mol m 2 y 1), and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP, 0. 010 mol m 2 y 1), a net sink of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, 0. 28 mol m 2 y 1), and in approximate balance of DOP (0. 001 mol m 2 y 1). Overall, the upper estuary and mid-estuary served as net sinks for most nutrients, whereas the lower estuary served as a net source. Annual mean nutrient export from the lower estuary to the nearshore coastal region was 3 mol m 2 y 1 for DOC, 0. 08 mol m 2 y 1 for DON and DIN, 0. 006 mol m 2 y 1 for DOP, and 0. 017 mol m 2 y 1 for DIP. In comparison, annual mean watershed DIN input (0. 02 mol m 2 y 1) was approximately two times greate...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution paleoceanography of the Plio-Pleistocene is {{important}} in understanding climate forcing mechanisms and the associated environmental changes. This is particularly true in high-latitude marginal seas such as the Bering Sea, which has been very sensitive to changes in global climate during interglacial and glacial or Milankovitch time scales. This is due to significant changes in water circulation, <b>land-ocean</b> <b>interaction,</b> and sea-ice formation. With theaim to reveal the climate and oceanographic history of the Bering Sea over the past 5 Ma, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 cored a total of 5741 meters of sediment (97. 4 % recovery) at seven sites covering three different areas: Umnak Plateau, Bowers Ridge, and the Bering slope region. Four deep holes range from 600 m to 745 m spanning in age from 1. 9 Ma to 5 Ma. The water depths (819 m to 3173 m) allow characterization of past verticalwater mass distribution such as the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). The results highlight three key points. (1) The first is an understanding of long-term evolution of surface-water mass distribution during the past 5 Ma including past sea-ice distribution and warm and less eutrophic subarctic Pacific water mass entry into the Bering Sea. (2) We characterized relatively stagnant intermediate water mass distribution imprinted as laminated sediment intervals that have beenubiquitously encountered. Today, the OMZ impinges upon the sediments at ~ 700 – 1600 m water depths. In the past, the OMZ appears to have occurred mainly during interglacial periods. Changes in low oxygen-tolerant benthic foraminiferal faunas clearly concur with this observation. (3) We also characterized significant changes between glacial episode of terrigenous sedimentary supply and interglacialepisode of diatom flux...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic gross primary {{production}} (GPP), community respiration (CR), and nitrification (NIT) were measured monthly in the Scheldt estuary by the oxygen incubation method in 2003. No significant evolution of planktonic GPP was observed since the 1990 s with high rates in the freshwater area (salinity 0; 97 6 65 mmol C m - 2 d - 1) decreasing seaward (22 - 37 mmol C m - 2 d - 1). A significant decrease of NIT was observed with regard to previous investigations although this process still represents up to 20 % of total organic matter production in the inner estuary. Planktonic CR was highest in the inner estuary {{and seemed to be}} mainly controlled by external organic matter inputs. Planktonic net community production was negative most of the time in the estuary with values ranging from - 300 to 165 mmol C m - 2 d - 1. Whole estuary net ecosystem production (NEP) was investigated on an annual scale using the results mentioned above and published benthic metabolic rates. A NEP of - 39 ± 8 mmol C m - 2 d - 1 was estimated, which confirms the strong heterotrophic status of this highly nutrified estuary. NEP rates were computed from June to December 2003 to compare with results derived from the <b>Land-Ocean</b> <b>Interaction</b> in the Coastal Zone budgeting procedure applied to dissolved inorganic phosphorus and carbon (DIP and DIC). DIP budgets failed to provide realistic estimates in the inner estuary where abiotic processes account for more than 50 % of the nonconservative DIP flux. DIC budgets predicted a much lower NEP than in situ incubations (- 109 ± 31 versus - 42 ± 9 mmol C m - 2 d - 1) although, as each approach is associated with several critical assumptions, the source of this discrepancy remains unclear...|$|R
