The Admiral reached Lolita at about midnight and indicated to her crew {{that he did not}} take the reports of enemy submarines seriously, reportedly saying: [...] "What are you all playing at, {{running up and down the}} harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in the harbour? There's not one to be seen."

I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|There are 44 {{letters to}} White's friend Thomas Pennant (1726–1798), {{of which the}} first nine were never posted and are thus undated. Of those that were posted, the first, Letter 10 giving an {{overview}} of Selborne, is dated 4 August 1767; the last, Letter 44 on wood pigeons, is dated 30 November 1780. It is not known how the men became friends, or even if they ever met; White writes repeatedly that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> [...] "to have a little conversation face to face after we have corresponded so freely for several years" [...] so it is certain they did not meet for long periods, and possible they never met at all. The letters are edited from the form {{in which they were}} actually posted; for example, Letter 10 as posted had a cringing introductory paragraph of thanks to Pennant which White edited out of the published version.|$|E

His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices.

500|$|In a 2003 documentary, Living with Michael Jackson, {{the singer}} {{revealed}} to journalist Martin Bashir that Bubbles had become overly pugnacious. He was removed to an animal sanctuary over fears he might attack Jackson's newborn son, Prince Michael II. Jackson subsequently bought two more baby chimpanzees, Max and Action Jackson; the public believed these two chimpanzees were also Bubbles. [...] Bubbles' removal {{was a source}} of regret for the musician, who stated that the animals could live for up to 60 years. During the interview, Bashir was also told of how Jackson had planned to hold a [...] "celebrity animal party" [...] for Bubbles. Cheeta, the chimpanzee from Tarzan, Benji and Lassie were to be invited. Bubbles was relocated to Bob Dunn's ranch in Sylmar, California. [...] "Bubbles is an adult chimp and a wild animal," [...] Dunn stated at the time. [...] "We don't let him out to play." [...] According to CNN, the chimpanzee would be visited by Jackson and his children, who also played with the other animals while at the Californian ranch. [...] "He still acts like a kid around them", Dunn added, referring to the musician. The Washington Times, however, claimed Bubbles was not visited by Jackson, despite the singer's representative stating beforehand that the entertainer would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with the animal again. Shortly afterward, in December 2003, it was claimed that Bubbles had attempted suicide. The chimpanzee was supposedly taken to a hospital in time to be saved.|$|E
