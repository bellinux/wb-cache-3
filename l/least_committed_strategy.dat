This prior is source-destination symmetric, fulfills a natural semi-group property for warps, and with probability 1 creates invertible warps. Using this as a <b>least</b> <b>committed</b> prior, we formulate a Partial Differential Equation for obtaining the maximally likely warp given matching constraints derived from the images. We solve for the free bound-ary conditions, and the bias toward smaller areas in the finite domain setting.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the Brownian image model is the <b>least</b> <b>committed,</b> scale invariant, {{statistical}} image model which describes the second order statistics of natural images. Various properties of three different types of Gaussian image models (white noise, Brownian and fractional Brownian images) will be discussed in relation to linear scale-space theory, and it will be shown empirically that the second order statistics of natural images mapped into jet space may, within some scale interval, be modeled by the Brownian image model. This is consistent with the 1 /f 2 power spectrum law that apparently governs natural images. Furthermore, the distribution of Brownian images mapped into jet space is Gaussian and an analytical expression can be derived for the covariance matrix of Brownian images in jet space. This matrix is also a good approximation of the covariance matrix of natural images in jet space. The consequence of these results is that the Brownian image model {{can be used as a}} <b>least</b> <b>committed</b> model of the covariance structure of the distribution of natural images. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} the impact different director types have on firm commitments to voluntary labor regulation. Using an author-constructed dataset of eight focal firm’s {{boards of directors}} for a nineteen-year period, I examine the impacts of gender and racial diversity, {{as well as the}} inclusion of independent interlocking board members on firm commitments to voluntary labor regulation following a legitimacy crisis in the 1990 s. Framing firms’ responses within a chronological approach to institutional theory, I test how trends for these three director types varied for firms most and <b>least</b> <b>committed</b> to voluntary labor regulation, as well as for firms that underwent bankruptcy, an acquisition, or split into various firms between 1996 and 2014. Findings suggest that firms view gender and racial diversity in similar ways, but independent interlocks as a separate strategy. All firms increased the number of women and racial minorities on their boards, with <b>least</b> <b>committed</b> firms having the highest percentages of both over this entire period. Use of independent interlocks increased at a moderate rate for most committed firms, decreased over time for <b>least</b> <b>committed</b> firms, and increased significantly for firms going through additional crises (bankruptcy, an acquisition, or splitting up). This study contributes to theory and research on organizational change by extending understanding of mechanisms that drive organizational change in response to crisis by analyzing internal normative mechanisms that shaped firms’ responses. It extends research on board composition by analyzing the conditions under which board diversity and interlocked board members are sought by focal firms. Understanding how and why board diversity and independent interlock membership serve as mechanisms of internal, normative change provides insight into what internal mechanisms shape organizational policies and practices, and provide a correction to the over-focus on external, coercive mechanisms in existing scholarship...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the concept}} of {{stochastic}} ordering is extended to belief functions on the real line defined by random closed intervals. In this context, the usual stochastic ordering is shown to break down into four distinct ordering relations, called credal orderings, which correspond to the four basic ordering structures between intervals. These orderings are characterized in terms of lower and upper expectations. We then derive the expressions of the <b>least</b> <b>committed</b> (<b>least</b> informative) belief function credally less (respectively, greater) {{than or equal to}} a given belief function. In each case, the solution is a consonant belief function that can be described by a possibility distribution.
