40|$|BACKGROUND: Zinc (Zn) {{biofortification}} through foliar Zn {{application is}} an attractive strategy to reduce human Zn deficiency. However, {{little is known about}} the biofortification efficiency and bioavailability of rice grain from different forms of foliar Zn fertilizers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four different Zn forms were applied as a foliar treatment among three rice cultivars under field trial. Zinc bioavailability was assessed by in vitro digestion/Caco- 2 cell model. Foliar Zn fertilization was an effective agronomic practice to promote grain Zn concentration and Zn bioavailability among three rice cultivars, especially, in case of Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4). On average, Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) increased Zn concentration in <b>polished</b> <b>rice</b> up to 24. 04 % and 22. 47 %, respectively. On average, Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) increased Zn bioavailability in <b>polished</b> <b>rice</b> up to 68. 37 % and 64. 43 %, respectively. The effectiveness of foliar applied Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) were higher than Zn-EDTA and Zn-Citrate on improvement of Zn concentration, and reduction of phytic acid, as a results higher accumulation of bioavailable Zn in <b>polished</b> <b>rice.</b> Moreover, foliar Zn application could maintain grain yield, the protein and minerals (Fe and Ca) quality of the <b>polished</b> <b>rice.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Foliar application of Zn in rice offers a practical and useful approach to improve bioavailable Zn in <b>polished</b> <b>rice.</b> According to current study, Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) are recommended as excellent foliar Zn forms to ongoing agronomic biofortification...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{aimed to}} discover the distribution and the primary influence factors of Cu in the soil-rice systems of tropical farmland. Soil samples of farmland and rice plant (stalk and <b>polished</b> <b>rice)</b> from the western region of Hainan Island were collected and studied. The {{results showed that the}} average Cu content in the topsoil of the study area was 15. 75 mg kg- 1; the highest Cu content (45. 92 mg kg- 1) was found in the rice fields of the northern area, where pyroclastic parent material is distributed. Thus, there is a potential for Cu contamination of the rice grown in this region. The average contents of Cu in the <b>rice</b> stalks and <b>polished</b> <b>rice</b> were 16. 9 and 5. 68 mg kg- 1, respectively, indicating that the stalks had a larger capacity for Cu bioaccumulation than the <b>polished</b> <b>rice.</b> The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of Cu in rice was found to decrease with increased Cu contents in the soil. In regards to the northern farmlands with high Cu contents in the soil derived from pyroclastic deposits, an alkaline fertilizer should be used to prevent the risk of Cu pollution in the <b>polished</b> <b>rice,</b> as soil acidification can promote the uptake and accumulation of Cu to some extent...|$|R
