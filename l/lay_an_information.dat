If the child is not there you might find yourself in a very awkward position, and if Nibson himself happened {{to be at home}} he would be perfectly justified in using firearms.' I said of course that was a point I must consider. It is indeed a point on which we must take Mr. Pettigrew's opinion. But probably we shall have to <b>lay</b> <b>an</b> <b>information</b> before the nearest magistrate, though I think myself that if we were to take the officer into our confidence--and he seemed to me a bluff, hearty fellow--he would take {{a lot of interest in}} the matter, and might stretch a point, and send three or four men down after dark to search the place again for smuggled goods. You see, he has strong suspicions of the man, and has searched his place more than once. Then, when they were about it, we could enter and seize Walter. Should there be a mistake altogether, and the child not be found there, we could give the officer a written undertaking to hold him free in the very unlikely event of the fellow making a fuss about his house being entered." ...|$|E

[...] The laying of an information as described in Part III of the Act allows anyone to commence a prosecution for a provincial offence, whereas Parts I and II of the Act may only be used by a provincial offences officer.|$|E

They elected the Council of Four Hundred from among their number; nine archons and the treasurers were drawn from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less than ten minas, the generals (strategoi) and commanders of cavalry (hipparchoi) from those who could show an unencumbered property of not less than a hundred minas and had children born in lawful wedlock over ten years of age. Thus, in the event of their death, their estate could pass to a competent heir. These officers were required to hold to account the prytanes (councillors), strategoi (generals) and hipparchoi (cavalry officers) of the preceding year until their accounts had been audited.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} opportunities {{have presented}} service options for users {{that are both}} economical and flexible to use requirements. However, the risk analysis for the user identifies vulnerabilities for intellectual property ownership and vulnerabilities for the identification of rightful property owners when cloud services are used. It is common for image owners to embed watermarks and other security mechanisms into their property so that the rightful ownership may be identified. In this paper we present a design that overcomes many of the current limitations in cloud watermarking uses and propose a schema that places responsibility on the cloud provider to have <b>a</b> robust <b>information</b> protection program. Such <b>a</b> design solution <b>lays</b> out <b>an</b> <b>information</b> security architecture that enhances utility for cloud services and gives better options for users to securely place properties in the cloud.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Every {{business}} environment today {{is influenced by}} information technology â€“ ranging from production, sales, service delivery, shopping, banking and telecommunications, to mention but a few. Consequently, {{there is a growing}} need for highly trained and skilled personnel to take up and continue in the trend of managing not only the present technologies but also to be ready to adapt to the ever growing development in the world. Given the level of investment and development expected in the Nigerian power, automobile, oil/gas, agriculture and small & medium enterprises(SMEs), it is essential that the curriculum used by Nigerian educational institutions be tailored towards industry needs by <b>laying</b> <b>a</b> sound <b>information</b> technology framework through the introduction of relevant course contents, strengthening existing teaching and training methods. This is Critical. The purpose of this research publication is to examine the current level of information technology education in the Nigerian Institutions of higher learning, exploring industry needs and requirements, considering factors facing training institutions and possible recommendations, bearing in mind the fact that, the employability of our graduates depends on their abilities and feedback from industry as key indicators of their value.

30|$|The {{paper by}} Craig Vineyard, Stephen Verzi, Michael Bernard, Shawn Taylor, Irene Dubicka, and Thomas Caudell {{identifies}} {{one of the}} most important and challenging problems facing the security community in the new environment created with the rise of potentially devastating threats now posed by violent non-state actors (VNSA). Given the diffuse nature of these new threats, intelligence analysts need to process very large amounts of data and strive to detect potentially threatening connections between different bits of diverse data. Drawing from biological investigations of the brain in neuroscience the authors <b>lay</b> out <b>a</b> multi-model <b>information</b> approach to store information and to automate an association mechanism. Their paper provides a fascinating simple example that illustrates the modelâ€™s functionality and promise.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{simultaneous}} wireless power and information transfer (SWPIT) for network-coded two-way re- <b>lay</b> transmission from <b>an</b> <b>information</b> theoretical viewpoint, where two sources exchange <b>information</b> via <b>an</b> energy har- vesting relay. By considering the time switching (TS) relay receiver architecture, we present the TS-based two-way re- laying (TS-TWR) protocol. In order {{to explore the}} system throughput limit with data rate fairness, we formulate an op- timization problem under total power constraint. To solve the problem, we first derive some explicit results and then de- sign an efficient algorithm. Numerical results show that with the same total available power, TS-TWR has a certain per- formance loss compared with conventional non-EH two-way relaying due to the path loss effect on energy transfer, where in relatively low and relatively high SNR regimes, the perfor- mance losses are relatively small.
