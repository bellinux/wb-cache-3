25|$|There is a <b>lambda</b> <b>phage</b> {{virus in}} biology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lambda</b> <b>phage</b> {{has been}} used heavily as a model organism, {{and has been a}} rich source for useful tools in {{microbial}} genetics, and later in molecular genetics. Uses include its application as a vector for the cloning of recombinant DNA; the use of its site-specific recombinase (int) for the shuffling of cloned DNAs by the gateway method; and the application of its Red operon, including the proteins Red alpha (also called 'exo'), beta and gamma in the DNA engineering method called recombineering. <b>Lambda</b> <b>phage</b> has also been of major importance in the study of specialized transduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of lambda phages is {{controlled}} by cI and Cro proteins. The <b>lambda</b> <b>phage</b> {{will remain in the}} lysogenic state if cI proteins predominate, but will be transformed into the lytic cycle if cro proteins predominate.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of cI causes immunity to superinfection by other <b>lambda</b> <b>phages,</b> {{as it will}} inhibit their PL and PR promoters.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lambda</b> transducing <b>phages</b> {{containing}} {{portions of}} the phoA gene have been isolated and used to construct a deletion map of the phoA gene. The isolation of a plaque-forming <b>lambda</b> transducing <b>phage</b> carrying the entire phoA gene is also described. Two new methods for screening or selection of mutants that have altered levels of alkaline phosphatase activity are reported...|$|R
40|$|Specialized transducing <b>lambda</b> <b>phages</b> {{carrying}} the region III flagellar genes (fla) of Escherichia coli K- 12 were isolated {{by a new}} method. A strain carrying both a cryptic lambda prophage near the his genes and a deletion of the attlambda gene {{was used as a}} starting strain. The lysogen of lambdacI 857 pga 18 -bio 69 was isolated in which the prophage was integrated within the lambda cryptic genes by means of recombination with the residual lambda DNA. The strains with deletions starting within the prophage and ending in these fla genes were selected from among the heat-resistant survivors of the lysogen. They were then infected with heat-inducible and lysis-defective <b>lambda</b> <b>phages</b> and, thus, specialized transducing phage lines for hag and fla were obtained. High-frequency transfer lines of rare phages {{carrying the}} fla genes were isolated by inducing a strain carrying a heat-inducible lambda prophage near the his genes and selecting by transduction of a fla deletion strain. Preliminary characterization of these transducing phages is also reported...|$|R
25|$|Cooperative binding of {{proteins}} onto nucleic acids {{has also been}} shown. A classical example is the binding of the <b>lambda</b> <b>phage</b> repressor to its operators, which occurs cooperatively. Other examples of transcription factors exhibit positive cooperativity when binding their target, such as the repressor of the TtgABC pumps (n=1.6).|$|E
25|$|<b>Lambda</b> <b>phage</b> is a non-contractile tailed phage, meaning {{during an}} {{infection}} event it cannot 'force' its DNA through a bacterial cell membrane. It must instead use an existing pathway {{to invade the}} host cell, having evolved the tip of its tail to interact with a specific pore to allow entry of its DNA to the hosts.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these biological tools, certain naturally observed configurations of DNA (genes, promoters, enhancers, repressors) and the associated machinery itself {{are referred to as}} an expression system. This term is normally used in the case where a gene or set of genes is switched on under well defined conditions, for example, the simple repressor switch expression system in <b>Lambda</b> <b>phage</b> and the lac operator system in bacteria. Several natural expression systems are directly used or modified and used for artificial expression systems such as the Tet-on and Tet-off expression system.|$|E
40|$|Seve lambda dnif {{specialized}} transducing bacteriophages {{were isolated}} from Escherichia coli strains containing plasmids carrying the his-nif region of Klebsiella pneumoniae. These phages collectively carry deoxyribonucleic acid {{for all of}} the genes in the nif regulon and adjacent deoxyribonucleic acid of K. pneumoniae. The phages were isolated by using Mu insertions in the nif region to direct the integration of <b>lambda</b> pMu <b>phages</b> in nif via formation of lambda pMu-Mu dilysogens which, upon induction, yielded <b>lambda</b> dnif <b>phages.</b> This procedure should be generally applicable for isolating <b>lambda</b> specialized transducing <b>phages</b> carrying genes from E. coli or other bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Specialized transducing {{particles}} of <b>phage</b> <b>lambda</b> are formed by illegitimate recombination during prophage induction. We {{examined the effects}} of an Esherichia coli int, xis, himA, himD, or fis mutation on illegitimate recombination during formation of <b>lambda</b> Spi- <b>phage,</b> a class of <b>lambda</b> bio transducing <b>phage.</b> This type of phage is distinguishable from the docL and docR particles, which contain one cohesive end and are formed by cutting of the cos site, by plaque formation of lambda bio on Escherichia coli P 2 lysogens. The yields of <b>lambda</b> Spi- <b>phage</b> in the int, xis, int-xis deletion, and b 2 deletion mutants were about 50 - to 200 -fold higher than that of the wild-type prophage when bacteria were irradiated with UV light. This result indicates that Int and Xis functions, and the att site, are not required for illegitimate recombination. The yield of <b>lambda</b> Spi- <b>phage</b> in the himA, himD, or fis mutant carrying lambda delta int-xis prophage was 2. 6 -, 3. 3 -, or 17 -fold lower, respectively, than that in the wild-type bacteria under UV irradiation. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the junctions of the transducing phages indicates that recombination at the hotspots, as well as at non-hotspots, takes place between short homologous sequences. Because the growth of infecting phages was not suppressed by the himA, himD, or fis mutation, we conclude that Fis is required, but IHF is only partially required, for short-homology-dependent illegitimate recombination during the formation of <b>lambda</b> bio transducing <b>phage...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{the course}} of the {{passages}} it lost its O antigen and in 1953 was cured first of its <b>lambda</b> <b>phage</b> ( [...] by UV by Joshua Lederberg and colleagues) and then in 1985 of the F plasmid by acridine orange curing. Strains derived from MG1655 include DH1, parent of DH5α and in turn of DH10β (rebranded as TOP10 by Invitrogen).|$|E
2500|$|Joshua Lederberg and Norton Zinder {{showed in}} 1951 that genetic {{material}} could be transferred from one {{strain of the}} bacterium Salmonella typhimurium to another using viral material as an intermediary step. [...] This process is called transduction. In 1956, M. Laurance Morse, Esther Lederberg and Joshua Lederberg also discovered specialized transduction. The research in specialized transduction focused upon <b>lambda</b> <b>phage</b> infection of E. coli. Transduction and specialized transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} cloning, a vector is a DNA molecule used as {{a vehicle}} to artificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed (e.g.- plasmid, cosmic, <b>Lambda</b> <b>phages).</b> A vector containing foreign DNA is termed recombinant DNA. The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. Of these, the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. Common to all engineered vectors are an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker.|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} genome of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was cloned in an ordered library {{consisting of}} 34 overlapping or adjacent cosmids, one plasmid and two <b>lambda</b> <b>phages.</b> The genome size {{was determined by}} adding up the sizes of either the individual unique EcoRI restriction fragments of the gene bank or of the XhoI fragments of genomic M. pneumoniae DNA. The values from these calculations, 835 and 849 kbp, are in good agreement. An XhoI restriction map was constructed by identifying adjacent DNA fragments by probing with selected cosmid clones...|$|R
40|$|To examine {{bacteriophage}} recombination in vivo, {{independent of}} such other processes as replication and packaging, substituted <b>lambda</b> <b>phages</b> bearing restriction site polymorphisms {{were employed in}} a direct physical assay. Bacteria were infected with two phage variants; DNA was extracted from the infected cells and cut with a restriction endonuclease. The production of a unique recombinant fragment was measured by Southern blotting and hybridization with a substitution sequence-specific probe. High frequency recombination was observed under the following conditions: the substituted <b>lambda</b> <b>phages</b> infected a wild-type host cell bearing a lambda repressor-expressing plasmid designed to shut down phage transcription and inhibit phage DNA replication as well. The same plasmid expressed the lambda red and gam genes. In addition, the host cell bore a second plasmid which expressed the EcoRI restriction-modification system. Both phage chromosomes possessed a single EcoRI site {{in the middle of}} the marked substitution sequence; however, as the site was modified in one of the parent phages, only the other partner was cut. Recombination was found to be dependent upon (1) red, (2) recA, (3) inactivation of the host recBCD function, either by Gam protein or by mutation and (4) double-strand breaks. The homologous recombination system of phage P 22 could substitute for that of lambda...|$|R
2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (<b>lambda</b> <b>phage,</b> {{coliphage}} λ) is {{a bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E
50|$|The model {{organism}} {{for studying}} lysogeny is <b>lambda</b> <b>phage.</b> Prophage integration, maintenance of lysogeny, induction, {{and control of}} phage genome excision in induction is described in detail in the <b>lambda</b> <b>phage</b> article.|$|E

Bacteria serve as natural hosts, with {{transmission}} achieved through passive diffusion.. There are currently three species in this genus, including the type species Enterobacteria phage lambda.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} characterized {{a set of}} <b>lambda</b> dilv <b>phages</b> by genetic, restriction enzyme, and heteroduplex {{analyses and}} tentatively correlated isoleucine-valine gene products with specific ilv DNA segments by using cloned ilv segments in maxicells and <b>lambda</b> dilv <b>phage</b> infection of UV-irradiated cells. In this work, {{the identity of the}} ilvC gene product, alpha-acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, was confirmed by demonstrating its induction by the physiological inducers alpha-acetolactate and alpha-acetohydroxybutyrate. The identity of the ilvE gene product, transaminase, B, was confirmed by antibody precipitation of the purified enzyme. Phage derivatives with ilv regulatory mutations were found to have the predicted effect upon the ilvGEDA and ilvC protein products. The distribution of the ilvGEDA and ilvC gene products in the soluble, periplasmic, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions was examined, and no significant membrane association was observed. The expression of the ilv genes in the <b>lambda</b> dilv <b>phage</b> from ilv and <b>phage</b> <b>lambda</b> promoters was compared {{in order to determine the}} fractional contribution of each to ilv gene expression. An additional protein of 54, 000 daltons that was not detected in the previous analysis was observed to be coded by a bacterial gene but was produced only by readthrough from phage promoters...|$|R
40|$|The {{recombinant}} DNA molecules {{were constructed}} from plasmid RSF 2124 and the EcoRI fragment of lambda DNA containing the genes responsible for prophage integration. The {{presence of these}} genes in recombinant plasmids was detected genetically. lambda int-gene was shown to be expressed in either orientation of insertion in the plasmid. We found that recombinant plasmid was able to integrate into chromosome of lambda lysogens. The integration of plasmid into host chromosome was demonstrated by contransduction of chromosome and plasmid markers using generalized transducer P 1 and by specialized transduction with <b>lambda</b> <b>phages...</b>|$|R
40|$|A general {{method for}} {{constructing}} <b>lambda</b> specialized transducing <b>phages</b> is described. The method, which is potentially applicable to any gene of Escherichia coli, {{is based on}} using Mu DNA homology to direct the integration of a <b>lambda</b> pMu <b>phage</b> near the genes whose transduction is desired. With this method we isolated a <b>lambda</b> transducing <b>phage</b> carrying all 10 genes in the che gene cluster (map location, 41. 5 to 42. 5 min). The products of the cheA and tar genes were identified by using transducing phages with amber mutations in these genes. It was established that tar codes for methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein II (molecular weight, 62, 000) and that cheA codes for two polypeptides (molecular weights, 76, 000 and 66, 000). Possible origins of the two cheA polypeptides are discussed...|$|R

In vitro 32 P-labelled nuclear RNA prepared from heat-shocked third instar larvae hybridized specifically to one fragment within 85 kb of cloned DNA. The region which is specifically transcribed after heat shock could be defined to a cluster of internally-repetitive DNA and its neighbouring proximal sequences.
