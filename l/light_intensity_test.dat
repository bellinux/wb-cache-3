Two of the three toxic cultures studied produced more toxins in axenic than in nonaxenic cultures. High toxin production correlated with high nitrogen concentrations (test range, 0. 42 to 84 mg of N per liter) and low <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> (<b>test</b> range, 12 to 95 microeinsteins/m 2 per s). Toxin production depended on phosphorus concentration at low levels of phosphorus (0. 1 to 0. 4 mg of P per liter) and higher concentrations had no additional effect. The optimum temperature for toxin production and growth of green O. agardhii was 25 degrees C. Red O. agardhii produced almost similar amounts of toxin at temperatures of 15 to 25 degrees C.

There was a consistent trend for feeding performance to increase with larval age and <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> in both clearwater and greenwater conditions, demonstrating that visual proficiency increases with larval age. Feeding intensity remained low over the first 3 days of first feeding across all <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>tested.</b> Days 6 and 7 post-hatch larvae showed considerably higher feeding intensities particularly at 8 and 17 mmol s 1 m 2.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} morphologic {{and physiological}} alterations in the retina of three laminin mutant zebrafish, bashful (bal, lama 1), grumpy (gup, lamb 1), and sleepy (sly, lamc 1), which {{were identified in}} forward genetic screens and {{were found to be}} impaired in visual functions. METHODS: Mutant larvae were observed for defects in visual behavior by testing their optokinetic response (OKR). In addition, electroretinograms (ERG) were measured and retinal morphology was examined by standard histology, immunocytochemistry, TUNEL assay, and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Both, gup and sly showed no OKR at any <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>tested,</b> whereas bal embryos showed some remaining OKR behavior at more than 40 % of contrast. Consistent with the OKR result, gup and sly did not show an ERG response at any <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>tested,</b> whereas bal mutants exhibited small a- and b-waves at high <b>light</b> <b>intensities.</b> All three laminin mutants showed altered ganglion cell layers, optic nerve fasciculations, and lens defects. Again, bal showed the least severe morphologic phenotype with no additional defects. In contrast, both, gup and sly, showed severe photoreceptor outer segment shortening and synapse alteration (floating ribbons) as well as increased cell death.

40|$|Abstract Cyclic GMP {{has been}} implicated in {{controlling}} the light-regulated conductance of rod photorecptors of the vertebrate retina. However, there is little direct evidence correlating changes in cGMP concentration with the light-regulated permeability mechanism in living cells. A preparation of intact frog rod outer segments suspended in a Ringer 2 ̆ 7 s medium containing low Ca 2 + {{has been used to}} demonstrate that initial changes in total cellular cGMP concentration parallel changes in the light-regulated membrane current over a wide range of <b>light</b> <b>intensities.</b> At <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> bleaching from 160 to 5. 6 x 106 rhodopsin molecules/rod/s, decreases in the response latency for the cGMP kinetics parallel decreases in the latent period of the electrical response. Further, changes in the rate of the cGMP decrease parallel the rate of membrane current suppression as the <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> is varied. Up to 105 cGMP molecules are hydrolyzed per photolyzed rhodopsin, consistent with in vitro studies showing that each bleached rhodopsin can activate over 100 phosphodiesterase molecules. Addition of the Ca 2 + ionophore, A 23187, does not affect the initial kinetics of the cGMP decrease or of the electrical response, excluding a direct role for Ca 2 + in the initial events of phototransduction. These results are consistent with cGMP being the intracellular messenger that links rhodopsin isomerization with changes in membrane permeability upon illumination. It is unlikely, however, that light-induced changes in total cGMP concentration are the sole regulators of membrane current. This is suggested by several observations: 1) at bright <b>light</b> <b>intensities,</b> the subsecond light-induced cGMP decrease is essentially complete prior to complete suppression of membrane current; 2) maximal light-induced decreases in cGMP concentration occur at all <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>tested,</b> whereas the extent of membrane current suppression varies over the same range of light intensities; 3) changing the external Ca 2 + concentration from 1 mM to 10 nM in the dark causes an increase in membrane current that is significantly more rapid than corresponding changes in cGMP concentration. Thus, light-induced changes in total cellular cGMP concentration correlate with some, but not all, aspects of the visual excitation process in vertebrate photoreceptors...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the influence of <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> in the transcription of the mcyA gene and corresponding production of microcystins in toxic isolates of Planktothrix agardhii, where little is known, and compare them to Microcystis aeruginosa. For that purpose, cultures were exposed to three different <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> (4, 20 and 30 μmol photons m(- 2) s(- 1)) for 18 days at 20 ± 1 °C. The growth was followed daily using absorbance readings. Samples were collected at each growth stage for cell counting, microcystins quantification and RNA extraction. The level of transcripts was quantified by RT-qPCR and the relative expression determined using 16 S rDNA, gltA and rpoC 1 as reference genes. The most stable reference genes in M. aeruginosa were rpoC 1 and gltA, whereas in P. agardhii were 16 S rDNA and gltA. There was a correspondence between the growth rate and <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> in M. aeruginosa and P. agardhii. The growth rates for both species were lower at 4 and higher at 30 μmol photons m(- 2) s(- 1). Microcystin concentration per cell was similar between <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> in M. aeruginosa and over time, while in P. agardhii it was higher in the stationary phase at 4 μmol photons m(- 2) s(- 1). There were differences in the expression of mcyA between the two species.

40|$|Vertebrate rod photoreceptors {{adjust their}} {{sensitivity}} as they adapt during exposure to steady light. Light adaptation prevents the rod from saturating and significantly extends its dynamic range. We examined the time {{course of the}} onset of light adaptation in bullfrog rods and compared it with the projected onset of feedback reactions thought to underlie light adaptation on the molecular level. We found that adaptation developed in two distinct temporal phases: (1) a fast phase that operated within seconds after the onset of illumination, which is consistent with most previous reports of a 1 – 2 -s time constant for the onset of adaptation; and (2) a slow phase that engaged over tens of seconds of continuous illumination. The fast phase desensitized the rods as much as 80 -fold, and was observed at every <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>tested.</b> The slow phase was observed only at <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> that suppressed {{more than half of the}} dark current. It provided an additional sensitivity loss of up to 40 -fold before the rod saturated. Thus, rods achieved a total degree of adaptation of ∼ 3, 000 -fold. Although the fast adaptation is likely to originate from the well characterized Ca 2 +-dependent feedback mechanisms regulating the activities of several phototransduction cascade components, the molecular mechanism underlying slow adaptation is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the slow adaptation phase is mediated by cGMP dissociation from noncatalytic binding sites on the cGMP phosphodiesterase, which has been shown to reduce the lifetime of activated phosphodiesterase in vitro. Although cGMP dissociated from the noncatalytic binding sites in intact rods with kinetics approximating that for the slow adaptation phase, this hypothesis was ruled out because the <b>intensity</b> of <b>light</b> required for cGMP dissociation far exceeded that required to evoke the slow phase.

FR grown tissues which were photosynthetically imcompetent were hypersensitive to AF under white light and had approximately the same relative response to AF under blue and red light as green, white-light-grown tissues. Ultrastructural damage was apparent in FR-grown, AF-treated tissues within an hour after exposure to white light, with cytoplasmic and plastidic disorganization occurring simultaneously. In cucumber cotyledon tissue which had been greening for various time periods, there was no correlation between photosynthetic capacity and herbicidal efficacy of AF.

Six multilocus mutants were constructed to test the effects of eliminating the proteins of the CsmC/CsmD and CsmB/CsmF motif families, and the resulting strains were characterized physiologically and biochemically. Mutants lacking all proteins of either motif family still assembled functional chlorosomes, and as measured by growth rates of the mutant strains, light harvesting was affected only at the lowest <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>tested</b> (9 and 32 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1). The size, composition, and biogenesis of the mutant chlorosomes differed from those of wild-type chlorosomes. Mutants lacking proteins of the CsmC/CsmD motif family produced smaller chlorosomes than did the wild type, and the Qy absorbance maximum for the bacteriochlorophyll c aggregates in these chlorosomes was strongly blueshifted. Conversely, the chlorosomes of mutants lacking proteins of the CsmB/CsmF motif family were larger than wild-type chlorosomes, and the Qy absorption for their bacteriochlorophyll c aggregates was redshifted. When CsmH was eliminated in addition to other proteins of either motif family, chlorosomes had smaller diameters. These data show that the chlorosome envelope proteins of the CsmB/CsmF and CsmC/CsmD families play important roles in determining chlorosome size as well as the assembly and supramolecular organization of the bacteriochlorophyll c aggregates within the chlorosome...|$|R

These suppressors lacked detectable cyt c 2, but they contained a new soluble cytochrome which was designated isocytochrome c 2 (isocyt c 2) {{that was not}} detectable in either cycA+ or cycA mutant cells. When spd mutants were grown photosynthetically, isocyt c 2 was present at approximately 20 to 40 % {{of the level of}} cyt c 2 found in photosynthetically grown wild type cells, and it was found in the periplasm with cytochromes c' and c 554.

Retinal function of 5 symptomatic MP mice, and 5 age-matched wild type (WT) mice was evaluated by full field electroretinography (ERG) at varying <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> following both dark (scotopic) and light (photopic) adaptation. Comparison between the full field ERG a- and b-wave components of MP and WT mice were performed.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on retinal tissues using antibodies against Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), which are markers of retinal stress and dopaminergic cells respectively. Minor alterations of retinal function were observed in the onset, or implicit time, of b-wave formation in the MP mouse, most notably at the highest <b>intensity</b> of <b>light</b> <b>tested.</b> Further, the MitoPark mouse had smaller wave amplitudes than WT mice, but these observations did not reach statistical significance.

The short-term buoyancy response to light is nested into a longer term response, {{over a period of}} days, as cyanobacteria respond to their nutrient and light climate, which may be manifested in their gas vesicle volume, photosynthetic rate and carbohydrate metabolism. Microcystis aeruginosa cultures were subjected to a range of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or light pre-treatments before exposure to saturating irradiance, and these results are used to illustrate that populations can display a range of buoyancy responses dependent upon subtle changes in nutrient and light conditions. N-limited (0 µM) cells suffered a dilution in gas vesicle volume and increased carbohydrate content, which resulted in a loss of buoyancy. Cells in 10 µM N increased their gas vesicle content during light exposure; however, this was insufficient to maintain buoyancy in the majority of cells as carbohydrate increased. Cells in 100 µM N increased their gas vesicle volume, metabolized carbohydrate more efficiently than the N-limited treatments and retained positive buoyancy. During light exposure, there was minimal change in buoyancy in 0 µM P pre-treated cells, although there was a dilution in gas vesicle volume and an increase in carbohydrate. In 0. 5 µM P pre-treated cells, the proportion of individuals floating did not change, although gas vesicle volume and carbohydrate increased. There was a significant increase in gas vesicle volume in 10 µM P pre-treated cells during light exposure, and some buoyancy loss due to carbohydrate accumulation. Cells grown in the range of <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>tested</b> all increased their gas vesicle volume during the 24 h light treatment. The actual rate of gas vesicle production was equivalent for all three light pretreatments; however, the growth-dependent dilution rate was determined by the previous light history, which resulted in different relative gas vesicle volume per cell. There was minimal increase in carbohydrate per cell during the light period, yet all treatments displayed the classical buoyancy loss response. Justin D. Brookes and George G. Gan...|$|R

Newly-hatched larvae were obtained by stripping of hormonally induced broodstock, and were stocked in 32 -liter tanks at densities from 30 to 50 L- 1. Four experiments were carried out testing six light intensities: 50, 100, 200, 500, 1500, and 2500 lx, and total darkness as a control. Mean survival ranged from 0. 06 to 16. 0 % and were significantly influenced by <b>light</b> <b>intensity.</b> Complete darkness resulted in 100 % mortality after one week, larvae appeared to have starved since they had empty stomachs. The species has {{the characteristics of a}} visual-feeder. Survival was the highest at 200 lx, while at 500 lx was higher than at 50, 100, and 2500 lx. Frequency of functional swim bladder ranged from 36. 8 to 100 %, but it was not significantly correlated with <b>light</b> <b>intensity.</b> Based on this study, a medium <b>light</b> <b>intensity,</b> 200 to 1500 lx, is recommended for rearing fat snook larvae.

40|$|Bacteriorhodopsin, in known amounts and {{controlled}} orientation, is incorporated into planar membrane films. These films are {{formed by the}} sequential transfer of two air-water interface films onto a thin, hydrophilic, electrically conductive support cast from nitrocellulose. The films are easily accessible to electrical measurements and to control of the ionic milieu {{on either side of}} the membrane. The area of the assembled membrane films can be varied between 2. 3 x 10 (- 2) cm 2 and 0. 7 cm 2. Illumination of these films produces photocurrents, photovoltages, and changes in the pH of the surrounding medium. The peak amplitude of the photocurrent increases linearly with <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> for dim <b>lights,</b> and it approaches a saturating value for brighter lights. In the linear range, the stoichiometry of transport is 0. 65 +/- 0. 06 protons/absorbed photon. The rate of transport is linearly proportional to <b>light</b> at all <b>intensities</b> <b>tested.</b> The amplitude and kinetics of the photovoltage measured are accurately predicted by the photocurrent generated and the passive electrical features of the film. Parallel measurements of pH and photocurrent reveal that the light-induced changes in pH are fully accounted for by the rate and amount of charge transport across the membrane. Preceding the transport of protons, a transient photovoltage is detected that exhibits no detectable latency, reaches peak in about 80 microseconds, and probably arises from light-induced intramolecular charge displacements...|$|R

Despite the existence of several tomato crop growth models, no models are available for tomato seedlings. In the present paper, a simple empirical model was tested for the prediction of growth and development of tomato seedlings. Dry matter production, shoot length and leaf area were simulated {{as a function of}} incoming solar radiation, under different temperature regimes. In order to evaluate the model, experiments were conducted under various temperature and solar irradiance regimes. The experiments were carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Thessaly near Volos (Velestino, Thessaly), situated on the continental area of Eastern Greece, during three periods (winter, spring and late spring). Three <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> levels were <b>tested</b> in each experimental period, namely: control level (natural light level), 20 % higher than the control light level (using HPS lamps) and 15 % lower than the control light level (using a shading net).

40|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{relationship}} between insect vision and the spectral properties of flowers, the visual system has been studied in detail only in few insect pollinator species. For instance, wavelength discrimination thresholds have been determined in two species only: the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the butterfly Papilio xuthus. Here, we present the wavelength discrimination thresholds (Δλ) for the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. We compare the data with those found for the honeybee, the butterfly P. xuthus and the predictions of a colour discrimination model. After training moths to feed from a rewarded disk illuminated with a monochromatic light, we tested them in a dual choice situation, {{in which they had}} to choose between the light of the training wavelength and a novel unrewarded wavelength. To characterise the Δλ function, we decreased the difference between wavelengths in subsequent tests. We also varied the <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> to <b>test</b> its effect on the discrimination capacity. In agreement with the predictions of the model, we found two expected minima of discrimination where photoreceptor sensitivities overlap, as well as a minor third unpredicted minimum around the peak of the blue photoreceptor. M. stellatarum is capable to discriminate lights with a wavelength difference of 1 to 2 nm. These discrimination minima are similar to those found for the tetrachromatic P. xuthus, and are better than those of the honeybee. The moth is also capable to use achromatic information to discriminate between lights of long wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|Mulloway, Argyrosomus japonicus, is a {{euryhaline}} sciaenid that {{is popular}} with seafood consumers and recreational fishers. The species is an emerging aquaculture candidate and culture techniques have been developed. But with industry production low and fingerling costs {{estimated to be}} as high as 2 each, there is an imperative to improve production technology and lower costs. This study aimed to improve mulloway hatchery efficiency through: • the development of specific disinfection protocols for mulloway eggs to reduce the potential for transmission of pathogens on the surface of eggs. • an improved understanding of embryonic development. • optimization of light and feeding regimes to increase growth and survival of larvae and juveniles. • {{a better understanding of the}} biological mechanisms underpinning feeding behaviour for larval and juvenile stages. Disinfection of fish eggs with ozone is an important practice to reduce the incidence of infection by pathogens in the hatchery. However, ozone can reduce hatching success and can induce deformities in hatched larvae. In this study, the embryonic development of mulloway was described in greater detail than previously available to create a visual reference of egg stages and to assist in the development of a safe ozone disinfection protocol. The potential impact of ozone exposure is measured using a CT value, which is the concentration of ozone (mg l- 1) multiplied by the contact time (min). Initially, the combined effects of ozone CT (0, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1 or 5) and treatment temperature (19, 22 or 25 °C) on the hatching success of mulloway larvae were evaluated. The highest CT value that did not negatively affect hatching was a CT of 1, and the most appropriate water temperature for disinfection was 22 °C, as there were no apparent negative impacts of treating eggs at this temperature and mulloway eggs are currently incubated at 22 °C at the Port Stephens Fisheries Institute (PSFI) hatchery. Embryos at four different stages of embryonic development (3, 8, 20 or 27 h post fertilisation; HPF) were then exposed to ozone (CT = 1) and no significant effect was detected on hatchability at any of the embryonic stages examined. Accordingly, it is suggested that eggs should be disinfected with ozone early in development to reduce negative impacts on development caused by nodavirus and other pathogens. The photoperiod and <b>light</b> <b>intensity</b> requirements of early and advanced larvae were investigated to determine an appropriate light regime. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of a range of photoperiods (24 L: 0 D, 18 L: 6 D, 12 L: 12 D, 6 L: 18 D or 0 L: 24 D) and <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> (1 or 10 μmol s- 1 m- 2) on the growth, swim bladder (SB) inflation, food consumption and survival of early (2 - 8 dah [days after hatching]) and advanced (14 - 34 dah) mulloway larvae. The two <b>light</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>tested</b> had no effect on the parameters measured in early or advanced larvae and there were no significant interactions between photoperiod and <b>light</b> <b>intensity.</b> In early larvae, the optimal photoperiod was determined to be 12 L: 12 D, which promoted growth, survival and SB inflation. Once SB inflation has been achieved, the photoperiod should be adjusted to 18 L: 6 D to increase feeding time and promote growth. In advanced larvae, no differences in growth were observed at the end of the experiment; however, survival was significantly better in the 0 L: 24 D photoperiod compared with all other photoperiods examined. It is possible that there are physiological effects of maintaining larvae in complete darkness, and until further research is completed, it is recommended that an 18 L: 6 D photoperiod is used. This protocol is expected to optimise growth and subsequently reduce the overall time that larvae remain in the hatchery. The optimal weaning procedures for mulloway larvae were also investigated. Three experiments were conducted to compare weaning strategies using live feeds; rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) and Artemia, and formulated pellet diets. Initially, the effects of feeding Artemia at different levels (0, 50 or 100...|$|R
