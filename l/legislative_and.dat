5|$|After the crown, {{the most}} {{important}} government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers. Unlike its counterpart in England, the king's council in Scotland retained <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E

5|$|Canada has a {{parliamentary}} system {{within the context}} of a constitutional monarchy, the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, <b>legislative,</b> <b>and</b> judicial branches. The sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who is also monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces. As such, the Queen's representative, the Governor General of Canada (at present Julie Payette), carries out most of the federal royal duties in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} issues in South Dakota include {{the costs and}} benefits of the state lottery, South Dakota's relatively low rankings in education spending (particularly teacher pay – recently the State Sales Tax was increased from 4% to 4.5% to finance an increase in teacher pay), and recent <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> electoral attempts to ban abortion in the state.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E

In particular, there are five groups of final end users: members, <b>legislative</b> leaders, <b>and</b> other decision-makers; <b>legislative</b> officers <b>and</b> senior <b>legislative</b> clerks; drafters <b>and</b> <b>legislative</b> clerks; ICT managers and staff responsible for the technology used to create <b>and</b> maintain <b>legislative</b> documents; <b>and</b> ICT developers. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the various departments and agencies under gubernatorial control, the Governor has an executive administrative staff that assist in coordinating the executive duties. This staff is led by a Chief of Staff, and includes five offices: Intergovernmental Relations, Legal Counsel, <b>Legislative</b> <b>and</b> Policy, Press, and the Governor's Office in Washington, D.C.. The Chief of Staff {{has a number of}} deputies to assist in running these departments. The Governor's staff is appointed and therefore largely exempt from state civil service laws.|$|E
5|$|Its {{decisions}} are made by qualified majority voting in most areas, unanimity in others, or just simple majority for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new EU law itself.|$|E

Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E

5|$|Like other U.S. states, the {{structure}} of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers as the federal government, with executive, <b>legislative,</b> <b>and</b> judicial branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the Constitution of South Dakota, the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar is a semi-presidential {{representative}} democratic multi-party republic, {{wherein the}} popularly elected {{president is the}} head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma is a {{constitutional}} republic {{with a government}} modeled after the Federal Government of the United States, with executive, <b>legislative,</b> <b>and</b> judicial branches.

State officials are elected by plurality voting {{in the state of}} Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, <b>legislative,</b> <b>and</b> legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E
