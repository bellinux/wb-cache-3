He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic.

5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{behind the}} house may {{originally}} have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming {{the upper and lower}} terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.|$|E
5|$|This road got {{its name}} because it {{formerly}} served as a demarcation line which separated the civic area from the ethnic settlements of Singapore {{as part of the}} British colonial government's town planning, known as the Jackson Plan. Jackson's 1822 plan for the European Town composed of four parallel roads <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast-southwestern direction, and a major intersecting road. This perpendicular road is the present-day Middle Road. Due to increasing Chinese immigrants settling near the European Town, the Europeans subsequently vacated the area to dwell more inland, away from the urbanising city quarters.|$|E

5|$|Clark's Grant, {{the large}} {{tract of land}} {{on the north side}} of the Ohio River that he {{received}} as compensation for his military service, included a large portion of Clark County, Indiana, and portions of Floyd and Scott Counties, as well as the present-day site of Clarksville, Indiana, the first American town <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territory (in 1784). Clark served as the first chairman of the Clarksville, Indiana, board of trustees. Clark was unable to retain title to his landholdings. At the end of his life, he was poor, in ill health, and frequently intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Dirleton Castle {{stands on}} a rocky outcrop, {{at the heart of}} the rich {{agricultural}} lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Security Act of 1947.|$|E

5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E
5|$|Lobbying {{is common}} in Annapolis; {{there are more than}} 700 lobbyists {{registered}} with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. The Mayflower Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the Mayflower upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.|$|E
