25|$|Studies of gestural ability {{incorporating}} BPO measures consider {{aspects of}} cognition, language, language impairment, and motor apraxia. Cognitive and linguistic studies tend to emphasize symbolic representation, expression, and comprehension {{in a human}} development context. Language impairment studies utilize BPO measures to explore gestural deficits that are correlated with particular <b>language</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and to help distinguish distinctive categories of - and degrees of severity in - aphasia. Studies of motor apraxia use BPO measures to better understand gestural impairment in apraxic patients, and often consider aphasia as an apraxic phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Insights into {{language}} {{storage in}} the brain have come from studying mulilingual individuals afflicted with a form of aphasia. The symptoms and severity of aphasia in multilinguals depend on how many languages the individual knows, what order they have them stored {{in the brain}}, how frequently they use each one, and how proficient they are in using those languages. Two primary theoretical approaches to studying and viewing multilingual aphasics exist—the localizationalist approach and the dynamic approach. The localizationalist approach views different languages as stored in {{different regions of the}} brain, explaining why multilingual aphasics may lose one language they know, but not the other(s). The dynamical theory approach suggests that the language system is supervised by a dynamic equilibrium between the existing <b>language</b> <b>capabilities</b> and the constant alteration and adaptation to the communicative requirements of the environment. The dynamic approach views the representation and control aspects of the language system as compromised as a result of brain damage to the brain's language regions. The dynamic approach offers a satisfactory explanation for the various recovery times of each of the languages the aphasic has had impaired or lost because of the brain damage. Recovery of languages varies across aphasic patients. Some may recover all lost or impaired languages simultaneously. For some, one language is recovered before the others. In others, an involuntary mix of languages occurs in the recovery process; they intermix words from the various languages they know when speaking.|$|E

40|$|Australian law {{enforcement}} agencies increasingly deploy electronic surveillance techniques to combat serious and organised crime to maintain national security. The criminal justice system is {{an important source of}} data that can shed light upon non-traditional security challenges. Telephone interception and listening device recordings of suspected criminal activity often comprise conversations conducted in languages other than English containing jargon and/or code words. Community translators and interpreters are relied upon to translate these conversations into English for evidentiary purposes. Military cryptologic linguists also translate languages other than English from electronic surveillance activity to support national security objectives. However, unlike ongoing <b>language</b> <b>capability</b> development in the military in support of meeting traditional security objectives, <b>language</b> <b>capability</b> supporting non-traditional security areas of {{law enforcement}} has remained relatively unchanged for three decades. Using qualitative interviewing methods and discourse analysis of court transcripts, this research investigates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>language</b> <b>capability</b> available to support {{law enforcement agencies}}. Systemic deficiencies in <b>language</b> <b>capability</b> and associated causal factors are identified. This thesis argues that <b>language</b> <b>capability</b> supporting the criminal justice sphere is seriously under-resourced and that this has significant implications for Australia&rsquo;s national security defined to include non-traditional security challenges...|$|R

50|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA) {{is a type}} of {{neurological syndrome}} in which <b>language</b> <b>capabilities</b> slowly and progressively become impaired. Although it was first described as solely impairment of <b>language</b> <b>capabilities</b> while other mental functions remain intact, it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss of executive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.-Marsel Mesulam in 1982.
