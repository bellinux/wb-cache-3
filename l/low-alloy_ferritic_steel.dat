40|$|The {{security}} of energy supply and sustainable and safe energy production {{are two main}} research topics of the Institute for Energy of the Joint Research Center. To lower the risks, for people and the environment, involved in fuel production and petroleum refining, studies and tests are carried out at the Institute on the degradation of <b>low-alloy</b> <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> under petrorefinery service simulated conditions. In this frame, and for industrial purposes, a reliable assessment of damage level by means of non-destructive techniques is a key factor. This paper presents the results of magnetic measurements, in particular the Barkhausen method, on ferritic steels previously exposed to service simulated conditions, and in air. The results show a good potential for this magnetic method to detect changes due to the exposure of the steels to the different environments and, in particular, the degree of damage due to hydrogen attack. A correlation between the results of magnetic and hardness measurements is currently under investigation, but not yet presented in this outline...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microstructure}} and prestraining and ageing on ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, fracture toughness and cleavage fracture resistance of a multi-pass <b>low-alloy</b> <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> weld metal have been investigated. The weld metal simulated submerged arc welds {{used in the}} fabrication of Sizewell B power station reactor pressure vessel. The study aimed to investigate differences in mechanical properties of a single microstructure; asdeposited and reheated microstructures and subjected to various mechanical tests. Additionally, to simulate the effects of irradiation embrittlement a number of specimens were prestrained and then statically strain aged. Charpy impact transition curves had obvious trends depending upon microstructure and condition, with microstructure having a significant influence on the transition region and upper-shelf impact energy level. Prestraining and ageing the specimens promoted {{an increase in the}} ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and reduction the upper shelf energy level for both microstructures. The extremes of behaviour were defined by the reheated as-received and as-deposited prestrained and aged conditions, being the “best” and “worst conditions” respectively. This trend was repeated with the cracktip opening displacement tests. A combination of factors decreases toughness for the asdeposited prestrained and aged condition, which exhibited the highest yield stress, and lowest work hardening exponent and the best cleavage fracture resistance. Such factors result in marked upwards shifts in Charpy impact transition curves and decease in the crack growth resistance curves. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free <b>low-alloy</b> <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels.</b> By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|R
50|$|The RPV {{provides}} {{a critical role}} in safety of the PWR reactor and the materials used must be able to contain the reactor core at elevated temperatures and pressures. The materials used in the cylindrical shell of the vessels have evolved over time, but in general they consist of <b>low-alloy</b> <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels</b> clad with 3-10mm of austenitic stainless steel. The stainless steel cladding is primarily used in locations that come into contact with coolant in order to minimize corrosion. Through the mid-1960, SA-302, Grade B, a molybdenum-magnesium plate steel, was used {{in the body of the}} vessel. As changing designs required larger pressure vessels, the addition of nickel to this alloy by roughly 0.4-0.7 wt% was required to increase the yield strength. Other common steel alloys include SA-533 Grade B Class 1 and SA-508 Class 2. Both materials have main alloying elements of nickel, manganese, molybdenum, and silicon, but the latter also includes 0.25-0.45 wt% chromium. All alloy listed also have >0.04 wt% sulfur. The table below gives the weight percent of elements in commonly used <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels</b> for reactor components according to ASTM requirements.Low-alloyed NiMoMn <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels</b> are attractive for this purpose due to their high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion, properties that make them resistant to thermal shock. However, when considering the properties of these steels, one must take into account the response it will have to radiation damage. Due to harsh conditions, the RPV cylinder shell material is often the lifetime-limiting component for a nuclear reactor. Understanding the effects radiation has on the microstructure in addition to the physical and mechanical properties will allow scientists to design alloys more resistant to radiation damage.|$|R
40|$|Micro {{residual}} stresses {{of the second}} and third order {{play an important role in}} the fracture mechanical analysis of thermally-cycled materials, and thus in lifetime analysis of such effected components. For example, forming rollers in a rolling plant made of white cast iron can develop cracking due to stress risers caused by thermal-induced {{residual stresses}}. After long-term service exposure of the <b>low-alloy,</b> heat-resistant <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels</b> damage was observed during operation, caused by the precipitation of copper particles ranging from 1 to 3 nm in size which are surrounded by coherent residual microstresses of third order. In multi-phase materials can exist two kind of micro residual stresses: thermal-induced residual stresses of the second order and coherent residual stresses of third order. In multi-phase materials, thermal-induced stresses of the second order appear when individual material phases exhibit different thermal expansion coefficients. Such differences in temperature-related expansion coefficients of cementite and ferrite in steel and white cast iron promote the development of these types of residual stresses. These differences below the Curie point of cementite grow with decreasing temperature and therefore, the largest variations of the residual stresses can be assumed at ambient temperatures. In multi-phase materials, coherent residual stresses of the third order appear when the lattice parameter of the second phase particles embedded coherently in the matrix and the lattice parameter of the matrix are different. Such differences in the ferritic Cu containing materials between the lattice parameters of coherent Cu particles and the lattice parameters of the matrix yield to distortion of the lattice around the Cu particles that causes the coherent residual stresses of third order. The main objective of the here discussed research was to develop a micro-magnetic non-destructive method for quantitative characterisation and separation of microscopic residual stresses of second and third order in multi-phase, iron-based material...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{through-thickness}} {{residual stress}} measurements are provided {{for a variety}} of samples of weld deposited 308 / 309 L stainless steel and Alloy 600 cladding on <b>low-alloy</b> pressure vessel <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels.</b> Clad thicknesses between 5 and 9 mm on samples that vary in thickness from 45 to 200 mm were studied. The samples were taken from flat plates, from a spherical head of a pressure vessel, from a ring-segment of a nozzle bore, and from the transition radius between a nozzle and a pressure vessel shell. A layer removal method was used to measure the residual stresses. The effects of uncertainties in elastic constants (Young`s modulus and Poisson`s ratio) as well as experimental error are assessed. All measurements were done at room temperature. The results of this work indicate that curvature plays a significant role in cladding residual stress and that tensile residual stresses as high as the yield stress can be measured in the cladding material. Since the vessel from which the spherical and nozzle corner samples were taken was hydrotested, and the flat plate specimens were taken from specimens used in mechanical fatigue testing, these results suggest that rather high tensile residual stresses can be retained in the cladding material even after some mechanical loading associated with hydrotesting and that higher levels of hydrotest loading would be required to alter the cladding residual stresses...|$|R

For assuring long-term stack operation a diffusion barrier layer with high electronic conductivity may be needed to impede interdiffusion between the various components. A pre-oxidation layer on the <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> turned out to be not viable as a barrier layer since a Ni-layer tends to dissociate the oxide scale. Therefore the potential of ceria as a diffusion barrier layer for the anode side of the SOFC was estimated.

After long-term exposures no indication of interdiffusion between Ni and <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> could be detected, however, sputtered coatings on <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> substrates showed significantly lower conductivities than bulk ceria samples because of void formation between the ceria and the oxide on the steel surface.

Successively increasing doses from 350 to 900 appm of Ne concentration, corresponding to atomic displacement levels from 0. 7 to 1. 8 dpa, were approached. A nearly uniform distribution of Ne concentration and atomic displacement damage was produced through {{the thickness of}} 60 mu m of the specimens by using an energy degrader. Mechanical properties of the specimens were tested with the small-ball punch technique. The test at room temperature shows a less significant ductility loss in the ODS <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> MA 956 than in the T 122 irradiated to the same dose of 350 appm Ne/ 0. 7 dpa.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of various combinations of glass-ceramic sealants with high-chromium <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels</b> under conditions simulating SOFC stacks has been evaluated, i. e. three glass-ceramic sealants and seven types of <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels.</b> The test method used {{is based on}} test samples consisting of two metallic sheets, joined together with a glass-ceramic sealant. The outer side of the specimens was exposed to air for 400 It at 800 degrees C, whereas the inner side was exposed to hydrogen saturated with 3 vol. % water vapour. In particular, {{attention is paid to}} the influence of small amounts of additives to both the glass-ceramic sealant and the steel on the electrical and chemical behaviour of the specimens. Under experimental conditions simulating SOFC stacks, it appeared that excessive internal Cr oxidation of the <b>ferritic</b> <b>steels,</b> sometimes accompanied by external Fe-oxide formation, only occurred in the case of glass-ceramics containing minor amounts of PbO. This internal oxidation finally resulted in a volume change of the <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel,</b> which was manifested in bulging of the steel. As a consequence, the glass-ceramic was pushed away from the steel surface and crack formation at the glass-ceramic-steel interface occurred. The rate of corrosion attack strongly depended on the detailed steel composition.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to assess the effectiveness and reliability of advanced nondestructive examination (NDE) methods for the inspection of light-water reactor components. The scope of this research encom¬passes primary system pressure boundary materials including dissimilar metal welds (DMWs), cast austenitic stainless steels (CASS), piping with corrosion-resistant cladding, weld overlays, inlays and onlays, and far-side examinations of austenitic piping welds. A primary objective of this work is to evaluate various NDE methods to assess their ability to detect, localize, and size cracks in steel components that challenge standard and/or conventional inspection methodologies. This interim technical letter report provides a summary of a technical evaluation aimed at assessing the capabilities of phased-array (PA) ultrasonic testing (UT) methods as applied to the inspection of small-bore DMW components {{that exist in the}} reactor coolant systems (RCS) of pressurized water reactors (PWRs).
