5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>Action,</b> a loose {{alliance}} of protesters on site, described the pier as {{a cornerstone of}} Hong Kong identity. By linking the pier with earlier social movements in late 1960s and early 1970s, it argued that the place {{was a symbol of}} Hong Kong civic activism and therefore should not be demolished.|$|E

A youth sports festival was held on Sharpham Road Playing Fields in 2009. In 2010 a skatepark was built in the village, funded by the Cheddar <b>Local</b> <b>Action</b> Team.|$|E
5|$|The {{last piece}} of live music played in the hall, on 14 February 1982, was a {{performance}} by the Glossop School Band, who were {{taking part in the}} North West Amateur Brass Band Championship in front of a crowd of 1,700. The hall had been sold 18 months earlier to a development company, Espley Tyas Development Group, and was by then scheduled for demolition to allow the site to be redeveloped. News of the sale had triggered the formation of <b>local</b> <b>action</b> groups, who organised a petition signed by 50,000 people in an unsuccessful effort to save the hall. The exhibition halls were sold to Mullet Ltd. in 1983, but competition from the newly opened G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to their closure. The site was sold to the British Car Auction Group in 1987, and the buildings demolished {{to make way for a}} large car auction centre.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem with}} Volta's {{batteries}} was short battery life (an hour's worth at best), which {{was caused by}} two phenomena. The first was that the current produced electrolysed the electrolyte solution, resulting in a film of hydrogen bubbles forming on the copper, which steadily increased the internal resistance of the battery (this effect, called polarization, is counteracted in modern cells by additional measures). The other was a phenomenon called <b>local</b> <b>action,</b> wherein minute short-circuits would form around impurities in the zinc, causing the zinc to degrade. The latter problem was solved in 1835 by William Sturgeon, who found that amalgamated zinc, whose surface had been treated with some mercury, didn't suffer from <b>local</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
25|$|Severn Tunnel Junction {{serves as}} a Park and Ride station for commuters from {{southern}} Monmouthshire to Bristol, Newport and Cardiff {{and there is a}} <b>local</b> <b>action</b> group – the Severn Tunnel Action Group (STAG) – who are campaigning to enhance the Junction's status as a transport hub for the southern Monmouthshire area. As of January 2010, Network Rail have remodelled the tracks around the station, re-opened Platform 4 and modernised the parking and passenger facilities. The junction where the Gloucester to Newport Line joins the South Wales Main Line has been moved west of the station and now joins the main line with high-speed turnouts.|$|E
25|$|Excavation {{started in}} December 1974 {{and saw the}} removal of 400,000 cubic meters (500,000cu.yd.) of earthwork. A <b>local</b> <b>action</b> committee, Action Edmonton, demanded in early 1975 that {{construction}} be halted and the venue relocated. The city estimated that this would cost an additional $2.5 million and delay the process with eight months. The decision to not enclose the stadium was taken on December 10, 1975. The venue was thus not designed to allow a roof, air-filled or stiff, to be retrofitted. The venue {{was built on the}} former site of the Rat Creek Dump and the Williamson Slaughter House. During excavation, remains from the dump were struck, resulting in archaeological surveys being carried out. Construction of the Edmonton Light Rail Transit's inaugural Capital Line commenced in 1974 and was opened in time for the Commonwealth Games, which allowed spectators to take the LRT from Stadium station to downtown Edmonton.|$|E

30|$|The {{robustness}} {{determines the}} reliability of the system which can be represented by the accuracy of the query action detection before false detections begin to occur whereas the discriminability is concerned with its ability to reject irrelevant actions such that false detections do not occur. To evaluate the robustness and discriminability of our proposed method, we employ the Weizmann human action dataset [16], {{which is one of the}} most widely used standard datasets. In this dataset, total 10 actions conducted by nine people (i.e., 90 videos) are contained, which can be divided into two categories: global actions (like run, forward jump, side jump, skip, walk) and <b>local</b> <b>actions</b> (like bend (bd), jack (jk), vertical jump (vjp), one-hand wave (wv 1), two-hand wave (wv 2)). Since most events observed in static camera applications are related to <b>local</b> <b>actions,</b> we thus focus on the five <b>local</b> <b>actions</b> in the Weizmann dataset (see Figure 3).|$|R

30|$|Fifth, some {{malicious}} events, part of {{an attack}} scenario, may target the network layer and therefore do not generate evidence in the system. Conversely, some {{of the events that}} compromise the system, are invisible to the network security solutions. In fact, some <b>local</b> <b>actions</b> may be triggered by the execution of remotely actions on the target system. Or even some <b>local</b> <b>actions</b> may be executed by the target system as a response to a remote executed action. Providing suitable mechanisms to correlate all types of evidence (network, system, and storage), handle incompleteness in them, and characterize provable system properties is of utmost importance.|$|R

[...] Cells that produce paracrine factors secrete them into the immediate extracellular environment. Factors then travel to nearby cells in which the gradient of factor received determines the outcome. However, the exact distance that paracrine factors can travel is not certain.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in reinforcement learning {{research is to}} extend methods that have worked well on discrete, shortrange, low-dimensional problems to continuous, high-diameter, high-dimensional problems, such as robot navigation using high-resolution sensors. Self-Organizing Distinctive-state Abstraction (SODA) is a new, generic method by which a robot in a continuous world can better learn to navigate by learning a set of high-level features and building temporally-extended actions to carry it between distinctive states based on those features. A SODA agent first uses a self-organizing feature map to develop a set of high-level perceptual features while exploring the environment with primitive, <b>local</b> <b>actions.</b> The agent then builds a set of high-level actions composed of generic trajectory-following and hill-climbing control laws that carry it between the states at local maxima of feature activations. In an experiment on a simulated robot navigation task, the SODA agent learns to perform a task requiring 300 small-scale, <b>local</b> <b>actions</b> using as few as 9 new, temporally-extended actions, significantly improving learning time over navigating with the <b>local</b> <b>actions.</b> ...|$|R
