50|$|S v Williams, an {{important}} case in South African law, with significant implications {{specifically for the}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> and criminal law, was heard in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on 19 September 1986, with judgment handed down on 30 September. The bench comprised Chief Justice Rabie and Judges of Appeal Corbett, Hoexter, Botha and Van Heerden, who found that, {{when a person is}} kept alive artificially by means of respirator, its eventual disconnection is not in legal terms the act which causes death; it merely constitutes the termination of a fruitless attempt to avert the consequences of the wounding. The causal connection between the wounding and the eventual death exists from beginning to end, in other words; it is not interrupted by the disconnection of the respirator. The court avoided {{the question of whether or}} not brain death, in line with medical science, should amount to legal death.|$|E

Then the concept <b>of</b> natural <b>law,</b> as an order <b>of</b> natural <b>persons,</b> is given a similar treatment, so that it becomes possible to investigate the status <b>of</b> natural <b>persons</b> in various theories <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that answer to the general concept <b>of</b> <b>law</b> analysed previously.

50|$|When {{the centre}} of the Empire was moved to the Greek East in the 4th century, many legal {{concepts}} of Greek origin appeared in the official Roman legislation. The influence is visible even in the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> or of the family, which is traditionally the part of the law that changes least. For example, Constantine started putting restrictions on the ancient Roman concept of patria potestas, the power held by the male head of a family over his descendents, by acknowledging that persons in potestate, the descendents, could have proprietary rights. He was apparently making concessions to the much stricter concept of paternal authority under Greek-Hellenistic law. The Codex Theodosianus (438 AD) was a codification of Constantian laws. Later emperors went even further, until Justinian finally decreed that a child in potestate became owner of everything it acquired, except when it acquired something from its father.|$|E
5000|$|In Ex Parte Boedel Steenkamp, an {{important}} {{case in the}} South African <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> and succession, heard on June 21, 1962, the residue of the deceased’s estate was bequeathed in equal shares in his will to his daughter and his daughter’s children [...] "wat by datum van dood in die lewe is" [...] (who are alive when I die). At {{the time of the}} deceased’s death, his daughter had two children and was pregnant with a third. The question before the court was whether the nasciturus could inherit. The court was unwilling to act to the prejudice of the nasciturus, and held, therefore, that it could inherit. A child in ventre matris had to be presumed to be alive for the purpose of inheritance, and was entitled to inherit equally with his mother, the testator's daughter, and her other children already born at the death of the testator.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, a {{friendship}} contract (‘vriendschapscontract’) is an agreement which regulates {{the consequences of}} a social relationship between two or more persons under family law as well as property law. Such a contract has no prescribed form. From an evidential point of view a written or notarial form is preferred. In addition, parties are in principle (see article 3:40 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek (BW)) free to determine the content of their agreement. For example, a tangible or intangible duty of care can be established, a power of attorney can be granted in case a party can no longer act on his own behalf, and an arrangement can be made for the event that one party obtains a good that, in whole or in part, is financed with assets of the other. In the Dutch <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> and family law there are as of yet no legal effects attached to friendship contracts, which is also not expected to happen in the near future. The friendship contract is therefore currently governed by the general Dutch contract and property law.|$|E
