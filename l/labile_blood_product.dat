40|$|Millions of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> are transfused every year; {{many lives}} are thus {{directly}} concerned by transfusion. The three main <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> used in transfusion are erythrocyte concentrates, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma. Each {{of these products}} has to be stored according to its particular components. However, during storage, modifications or degradation of those components may occur, and are known as storage lesions. Thus, biomarker discovery of in vivo blood aging {{as well as in}} vitro <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> storage lesions is of high interest for the transfusion medicine community. Pre-analytical issues are of major importance in analyzing the various <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> during storage conditions as well as according to various protocols that are currently used in blood banks for their preparations.

40|$|International audienceLabile <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> contain phosphatidylserine-expressing cell dusts, {{including}} apoptotic {{cells and}} microparticles. These cell by-products are produced during <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> process or storage and {{derived from the}} cells of interest that exert a therapeutic effect (red blood cells or platelets). Alternatively, phosphatidylserine-expressing cell dusts may also derived from contaminating cells, such as leukocytes, or may be already present in plasma, such as platelet-derived microparticles. These cell by-products present in <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> can be responsible for transfusion-induced immunomodulation leading to either transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or increased occurrence of post-transfusion infections or cancer relapse. In this review, we report data from the literature and our laboratory dealing with interactions between antigen-presenting cells and phosphatidylserine-expressing cell dusts, including apoptotic leukocytes and blood cell-derived microparticles. Then, we discuss how these phosphatidylserine-expressing cell by-products may influence transfusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Haemovigilance {{is defined}} as a set of {{surveillance}} procedures from the collection of blood and its components to the follow–up of recipients, denoted to collect and assess information on unexpected or undesirable effects resulting from the therapeutic use of <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. In this system the complications of blood transfusion are systematically collected and reported and data of adverse effects of blood transfusion are analyzed and a series of corrective measures are performed to prevent the recurrence of them. Another goal of haemovigilance is documentary collections of blood transfusion cases which eventually leads to conducting and promoting blood transfusion in hospitals. Haemovigilance only works if complications of blood transfusion are early detected and reported. Keywords: Haemovigilanc...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess retrospectively the clinical tolerance of SD treated plasma and to compare it to other <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> (red <b>blood</b> cell and platelet concentrates). METHODS: Adverse events (AEs) related to the use of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> at the <b>Blood</b> Transfusion Center (BTC) are routinely collected through a formalised system of hemovigilance. All AEs reported are entered into a safety data base which was used for the study. All AEs reported during a one-year period to the BTC were retrospectively re-assessed and descriptive statistics calculated. RESULTS: 5064 units of SD treated plasma were transfused to 894 recipients during the study period at the occasion of 1553 transfusions. No AE associated to SD treatment plasma was reported during that period. In contrast, during the same period, 485 AEs {{associated with the use of}} red blood cell concentrates (RBCC) were reported in 251 patients at the occasion of 262 transfusions. 2. 1 % (251 / 11, 748) of the patients transfused with RBCC experienced one or more AEs. The incidence of AEs per unit transfused was 1. 3 % (485 / 37, 332), and 2. 4 % (485 / 20, 460) of RBCC transfusions were associated with one or more AEs. 142 AEs associated with the use of platelet concentrate (PC) were observed in 69 patients at the occasion of 73 transfusions. 4. 2 % (69 / 1645) of patients transfused with PC experienced one or more AEs. The incidence of AEs per unit transfused was 1. 1 % (142 / 12, 772), and 2. 8 % (142 / 5034) of PC transfusions were associated with one or more AEs. All reported AEs were classified and non serious. The most frequently observed AEs were fever, chills and rashes which accounted for roughly 64 % of all reported AEs. CONCLUSION: As for the overall clinical tolerance of red cell and platelet concentrates, the results of this study are in complete agreement with the published literature. The study also confirms the extremely good tolerability of SD treated plasma in comparison with other <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Submicron-sized extra-cellular vesicles {{generated}} by budding from the external cell membranes, microparticles (MPs) are important actors in transfusion {{as well as}} in other medical specialties. After briefly positioning their role in the characterization of <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> this technically oriented chapter aims to review practical points that need to be considered when trying to use flow cytometry for the analysis, characterization and absolute counting of MP subsets. Subjects of active discussions relative to instrumentation will include the choice of the trigger parameter, possible standardization approaches requiring instrument quality-control, origin and control of non-specific background and of coincidence artifacts, choice of the type of electronic signals, optimal sheath fluid and sample speed. Questions related to reagents will cover target antigens and receptors, multi-color reagents, negative controls, enumeration of MPs and limiting artifacts due to unexpected (micro-) coagulation of plasma samples.

40|$|PURPOSE: Erythrocyte {{concentrates}} (ECs) {{represent the}} most transfused <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> They are stored at 4 °C in additive solutions {{for up to}} 56 days. Protein oxidation is a marker of oxidative stress and cysteine residues, whose oxidations are required for physiological cell functions, are highly prone to such modification. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Five ECs from independent donations were followed. Soluble protein extracts were prepared at days 6, 27, and 41, and cysteines were alkylated, reduced, and labeled with infrared dyes. Samples were mixed two by two (day 6 as reference) and analyzed by 2 D-DIGE. Detection of labeled cysteines allows quantitative comparison of oxidative status. Spots of interest were analyzed by proteomics. RESULTS: Thirty-two spots containing 43 proteins were classified as increasing, decreasing, or exhibiting a peak of expression during storage. Proteins having catalytic and antioxidant activities were particularly affected during storage, for example, peroxiredoxin- 1 and DJ- 1 were reversibly oxidized and catalase was irreversibly oxidized. These proteins {{could be used to}} evaluate different storage strategies to maintain proper protein function during the overall storage period. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This redox-DIGE approach brings new quantitative data on oxidized proteins in stored red blood cells. As previously reported on carbonylation, the oxidative damages differently affect protein functions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Blood {{transfusion}} safety depends on strict compliance {{with each step}} of a process beginning with the order for <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> and related immunohematologic testing and ending with administration and follow-up of the receiver. This process is governed by stringent regulatory texts and guidelines. Despite precautions, processing errors are still reported. Analysis of incident reports shows that {{the most common cause}} involves patient identification and that most errors occur at two levels, i. e. the entry of patient information and management of multiple regulatory crosschecks and record-keeping using different systems. METHOD: The purpose of this report is to describe the collaborative approach implemented by the Établissement français du Sang Alpes-Méditerranée (EFSAM) and the Assistance publique des Hôpitaux de Marseille (APHM) to secure the blood transfusion process and protect interfaces while simplifying and facilitating exchanges. RESULTS: Close cooperation has had a threefold impact with simplification of administration, improvement of experience feedback, and better management of test ordering. The organization implemented between the two institutions has minimized document redundancy and interfaces between immunohematologic testing and delivery. Collaboration based on experience feedback has improved the level of quality and cost control. CONCLUSION: In the domain of blood {{transfusion safety}}, the threshold of 10 (- 5) has been reached with regard to the risk of ABO errors in the distribution concentrated red cells (CRC). In addition, this collaborative organization has created further opportunity for improvement by deploying new methods to identify simplification measures and by controlling demand and usage...|$|R
30|$|Results Of the 155 {{patients}} in the study, 129 (83.2  %) were male, median MELD and Child–Pugh scores were, respectively, 14.5 (11 – 23) and 9 (7 – 11). Seventy-three percent of patents had alcoholic cirrhosis, and median creatinine clearance (according aMDRD) was 95  ml/min with 26 patients (16.8  %) below 60  ml/min. 128 (82.6  %) had an AKI according to the AKIN criteria, and 31 (20  %) required at least one RRT in ICU. The inclusion of diuresis {{in the definition of}} the AKI increases the number of patients with AKI in 32 (20  %) with peak incidence between H 24 and H 30. During first 48  h, incidence of IRA varies from 54.4 to 78.1  % depending on the time slot. The median plasma volume was 3 liters of crystalloid intraoperatively and 4 liters during the first 24  h without significant differences by AKI as albumin dose. Patients who develop early AKI were more transfused in <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Incidence of nephrotoxics as iodine injection and aminoglycosides during first 48  h were, respectively, 20.6 and 6.5  % without significant difference. Only the IGS 2 and monitoring by Swan–Ganz are significant independent predictive factors for AKI. Diabetics, admission norepinephrine concentration and high first residual tacrolimus dosage are significant independent predictive factors for RRT (respective OR of 3.75 (1.15 to − 12.12), 2.04 (1.13 to − 3.69) and 1.07 (1.05 to − 1.09) per point of tacrolimus). No patient without early AKI according to these criteria has used an RRT during the ICU stay.|$|R

Data from blood services show that 10 % or more of plasma donors regularly use medication which is permitted under donation guidelines. It is conceivable that medication taken by the donor in plasma for transfusion could cause an anaphylactic transfusion reaction in the recipient. This exploratory study investigated the presence of drugs or drug metabolites in donor plasma. Materials and Methods: Samples (5 ml) were taken from thawed, quarantine fresh frozen plasma units (FFP) which had to be rejected for transfusion because of leaks or length of time after thawing. The samples were analysed for approximately 1000 drugs and drug metabolites using a toxicological screening method. Results: Eighty-seven samples were analysed. Toxicological screening was positive in fourteen samples (16 %). In eleven samples, one substance was found, and in three samples, the presence of two or three drugs was detected. Conclusion: After freezing, storage and thawing of fresh FFP, it is possible to detect medication taken by the donor.

40|$|Clinical {{effectiveness}} of leucoreduced, pooled donor platelet concentrates, stored in plasma or additive solution {{with and without}} pathogen reduction For the generally accepted indications for treatment and prevention of bleeding, millions of platelet products are transfused annually, warranting vigilance towards emerging logistical problems and safety issues (Slichter, 2007; Stroncek & Rebulla, 2007). Donor counselling and screening, including molecular techniques, have reduced the risk of transmission of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I and –II. However, despite the bacterial culture of platelet products, a risk of 1 in 25 000 platelet transfusions for transfusion-related sepsis still remains (Goodnough et al, 1999; Kuehnert et al, 2001; Dodd et al, 2002; Blajchman et al, 2005; Schrezenmeier et al, 2007). The availability of platelets and reduction of costs due to reduced outdating would benefit from extending the storage time of platelet products, which is hampered mainly by the risk of bacterial growth beyond 5 d of storage (Lee et al, 2003). Pathogen reduction (PR) {{has been shown to}} be very effective for the inactivation of several viruses and bacteria (Lin et al, 2004, 2005). Moreover, PR might also comprise a solution for emerging pathogens, cytomegalovirus and an alternative for c-irradiation for the prevention of graft-versus-host-disease (Grass et al, 1999; Lin, 2001). Several countries have considered implementing PR as a standard for all platelet products, but concerns still exist with regard to clinical efficacy and potential long-term toxicity as well as uncertainty as to whether PR- platelet products can be stored for longer than 5 d (Council of Europe expert committee in blood transfusion study group on pathogen inactivation of <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The TRIP {{national}} hemovigilance and biovigilance office receives {{reports on}} {{side effects and}} incidents associated with the transfusion of <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The findings are publicly reported in annual hemovigilance reports. The category of anaphylactic reaction, defined as allergic reactions with systemic features such as airway obstruction, fall in blood pressure, vomiting or diarrhoea, accounts for {{the largest number of}} serious transfusion reactions. In most cases no cause is found for these reactions. TRIP data show that anaphylactic reactions occur relatively frequently during or after transfusion of plasma or (plasma rich) platelet concentrates. Data from blood services show that approximately 10 % or more of plasma donors regularly use medication which is permitted under donation guidelines. It is conceivable that medication taken by the donor, or its metabolites in plasma for transfusion, could cause an anafylactic transfusion reaction in the recipient. Aims: This exploratory study investigated the presence of drug or drug metabolites in donor plasma after quarantine, storage and thawing. Method: In a large hospital, samples (5 ml) were taken from thawed quarantine fresh frozen plasma units which had to be rejected for transfusion because of leaks or length of time after thawing. The samples were stored frozen at 70 °C until screening. Only samples for which the blood supply organisation confirmed that the donor had consented to research use were included. The samples were analysed for approximately 800 drugs or drug metabolites using ITox screening and LC-MSMS. All detectable substances that were recognised as drug or drug metabolite were considered as positive screening results. Results: Currently 87 samples have been collected and analysed. ITox screening was positive in 14 samples, In 11 samples only one substance was determined and in three samples the presence of two or three drugs was measured. Summary/conclusions: In 14 out of 87 analysed quarantine fresh frozen plasma units (16 %) drug or drug metabolites could be detected. This is in line with the expectation that 10 - 20 % of the plasma donors use medication on a regular basis. The measured concentrations did not exceed the concentrations expected with normal use of the medication. All of the detected drugs are permitted under donor guidelines. The finding of methyl paraben in one sample, not in association with medication, was unexpected. Methyl paraben is widely used as preservative by cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Parabens are also used as food additives. After freezing, quarantine, storage and thawing of fresh frozen plasma units it is possible to detect medication in therapeutic concentrations in donor plasma. After dilution in an adult recipient, no relevant pharmaceutical effects would be expected from the substances. It cannot be excluded that a sensitised patient could have an anaphylactic reaction due to administration of plasma containing medication taken by the donor. Further investigation of the effects of donor medication in the recipients of plasma or plasma rich <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> is recommended.

40|$|Objectives: The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{cardiovascular}} responses to behavioural stressors of three groups of adolescents who differed in blood pressure status across assessments. Design: Casual blood pressure of adolescents who were identified as having elevated blood pressure during a school screen was re-evaluated in the laboratory. The adolescents were classified into two groups: (i) those with consistently elevated blood pressure across school and laboratory assessments and (i) those with <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> pressure whose blood pressure in the laboratory was below 130 / 80 mmHg. A comparison group of adolescents with consistently normal blood pressure was also included. Methods: Cardiovascular parameters were assessed during rest and during two behavioural stressors, the evaluated speaking task and the mirror tracing task. Results: Adolescents with elevated blood pressure were more vascularly responsive across stressors than adolescents with <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, who, in turn, were more reactive than adolescents with normal blood pressure. Conclusions: These results suggest that vascular reactivity to behavioural stressors may be useful in predicting risk of hypertension because of its sensitivity in distinguishing adolescents with consistently elevated blood pressure from those with <b>labile</b> <b>blood</b> pressure and those with normal blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|Summary.   In {{addition}} to the clinical management of blood supplies, the UK National Blood Service (NBS) examines short-term supply and demand to predict any potential shortages in blood supplies.

This paper describes <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> use in a United Kingdom Hospital Trust in 1999 and combines it with donor information to project the effect of demographic changes on demand and supply over the next 25 years. Overall, 2801 (4 %) inpatients received transfusions of <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The proportion of inpatients receiving <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> increased with age.

40|$|AbstractHematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) recipients are a high-risk, immunocompromised {{group of patients}} who receive frequent transfusions after transplantation. Transfusion of cytomegalovirus (CMV) -negative <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> {{has long been the}} standard of care to prevent transfusion-transmitted CMV in this patient population. Leukoreduction of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> before transfusion has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted CMV. In the era of universal leukoreduction in Canada, the need for CMV testing of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> remains unclear. We sought to identify whether there is a difference in transfusion-transmitted CMV viremia in patients receiving only leukoreduced versus CMV-negative and leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> in HSCT recipients. Patients who were CMV negative and received an allogeneic HSCT from a CMV-negative donor between October 1, 1999 and June 30, 2012 were included in the analysis. Transfusion data were collected from The Ottawa Hospital Blood Bank and Canadian Blood Services. CMV viremia was defined as PCR positivity. One hundred sixty-six patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 89 patients received an HSCT before January 2007, during the time when patients received leukoreduced and CMV-negative <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Seventy-seven patients received an HSCT after this time, receiving only leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The 2 groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, diagnosis, graft type, graft source, conditioning regimen, or ABO compatibility (P > . 05).

The identification of proteins belonging to red blood cell, platelets or plasma was achieved {{at the end of the}} last century. Then, the questions on the applications emerged. Hence, several studies have focused on problems related to <b>blood</b> banking and <b>products,</b> such as the aging of <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> identification of biomarkers, related diseases and the protein-protein interactions. More recently, a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to quality control has been applied in order to offer solutions and improve the quality of <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The current challenge we face is developing a closer relationship between transfusion medicine and proteomics. In this article, these issues will be approached by focusing first on the proteome identification of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> and then on the applications and future developments within the field of proteomics and <b>blood</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{total amount}} of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> to be {{allocated}} at the blood center is sufficient to satisfy the total demand from all blood banks in the affected region. But the supply of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> with a specific blood group does not always match the total demand {{for this kind of}} <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> at all <b>blood</b> banks. The remaining lifetime of these products is assumed longer than the period of blood demand for emergency relief.|$|R
30|$|Constraint 4 {{denotes the}} formula {{relation}} among the supply, the demand, and the shortage. The demand of <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> p with <b>blood</b> group k at blood bank j is satisfied {{by the same}} group product and substitutions of other blood groups, and the unsatisfied demand will be the shortage. Constraint 5 ensures that the total demand for any type of <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> may not exceed its supply. Constraint 6 denotes that the shortage of each type of <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> is allocated among all blood banks according to their demand proportions. Constraint 7 denotes the limitation on the substitution amount of each blood group at each blood bank. Constraint 8 represents the total substitution amount of each <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> at each <b>blood</b> bank under the limitation of substitution rate. Constraint 9 denotes that the substitution amount of each <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> is allocated among all blood banks according to their demand proportions.

40|$|ObjectiveAllosensitization of left {{ventricular}} assist device recipients {{has been associated}} with perioperative transfusion of cellular <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The relative sensitizing contribution of leukofiltered cellular <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> however, remains unclear. We investigated the pattern of sensitization in {{left ventricular}} assist device recipients in relation to cellular <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> transfusions received. MethodsSeventy-one consecutive nonsensitized recipients of the HeartMate left ventricular assist device (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) as a bridge to transplantation were reviewed. Panel-reactive HLA antibody levels at consecutive times after device implantation were correlated with perioperative cellular <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> transfusions. ResultsFifty-four patients received leukofiltered cellular <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> (transfused), whereas 17 patients received only fresh-frozen plasma (nontransfused). Among nontransfused patients, 58. 8 % (10 / 17) became sensitized during mechanical support, versus 35. 2 % of transfused patients (19 / 54, P =. 15). There was a trend toward more sensitization during the 12 weeks after device placement in nontransfused patients. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed significantly more sensitization in nontransfused patients than in transfused patients, despite equal rates of transplantation (P =. 05). A dose-response analysis revealed significant trends toward less sensitization and lower peak panel-reactive antibody level with more cellular <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> transfusions (P =. 04). Multivariate Cox regression revealed only increasing transfusions to be associated with a reduced risk of sensitization (hazard ratio 0. 18, P =. 01). ConclusionsSensitization becomes more prevalent with increasing length of support. Avoidance of perioperative leukocyte-filtered cellular <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> transfusions does not decrease the incidence or degree of HLA sensitization. Conversely, cellular <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> transfusions may be associated with lessened alloimmunization and may mitigate the sensitization seen in recipients of the HeartMate left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation...|$|R
