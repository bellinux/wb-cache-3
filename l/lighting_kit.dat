50|$|The {{container}} for a flint-and-steel kit {{can come in}} two main forms: the tinderbox and the tinder pouch. A fire <b>lighting</b> <b>kit</b> for 'striking a light' was essential until the gradual introduction of the match in the mid 19th century. The form of the chuckmuck is so different from other tinder pouches worldwide that categorising them together is misleading. The decorated stiff leather purse of the chuckmuck with its attached curved striker make it a design classic.|$|E
50|$|Although TGEA {{supported}} the existing Torque Legacy Terrain, TGEA incorporated entirely new terrain rendering engine, the Atlas Terrain Engine, {{which is an}} improvement over the blended terrains of TGE.

A shaded water rendering system was implemented with full reflection, refraction, and Fresnel reflection. TGEA incorporated a lighting system based on Torque <b>Lighting</b> <b>Kit,</b> including a light manager tool, scene lighting, and dynamic shadows among others.|$|E

The HUD was provided through an unsolicited proposal by Elbit Corp. of Isreal. On 15 Dec 1993 a follow up meeting was conducted regarding aircraft installation, concurrently a symbology review occurred. Several subtle symbology and logic changes changes were made based on experience gained while flying other platforms with a similair HUD installed. Those changes recommended during the 15 Dec meeting are italic~ed. The intent of this technical memorandum is to provide a rationale document for future use.

50|$|In 1984, Casablanca {{introduced}} the world's first computerized ceiling fan control, called Inteli-Touch. The Inteli-touch control included a three-button (changed later to four buttons) wall controller, a PC board inside the fan's housing, {{and a small}} piezo buzzer to emit electronic beeps to verify fan functions. The control was innovative because it had new features that could completely automate the ceiling fan, including Safe Exit, which gave the user 30 seconds to exit the room while the fan's <b>light</b> <b>kit</b> gradually dimmed to off, Fan Minder which would start the fan at a high speed and gradulally slow the fan down to its slowest speed, while still staying on, and Home Safe, which would turn the fan's <b>light</b> <b>kit</b> on and off at random times {{to make it look}} as if someone is in the home. The system also had 6 fan speed settings and variable light settings, while also offering a reversing function. This control system made its way onto many Casablanca fans, and still exists today.|$|R

50|$|In 1980, Casablanca {{introduced}} the Slumber Quiet system, {{which had a}} pull chain switch that controlled both the fan motor and an optional <b>light</b> <b>kit,</b> and a variable speed dial to adjust the fan's speed. This system was discontinued in 1985 and replaced with {{a variation of the}} system known as Slumber-Five, which had five fixed speeds controlled by a stepped potentiometer rather than a fully variable speed dial. Slumber-Five was discontinued in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|A switch housing (also {{known as}} a [...] "switch cup" [...] or [...] "nose column"), a metal {{cylinder}} mounted below {{and in the center}} of the fan's motor. The switch housing is used to conceal and protect various components, which can include wires, capacitors, and switches; on fans that require oiling, it often conceals the oil reservoir which lubricates the bearings. The switch housing also makes for a convenient place to mount a <b>light</b> <b>kit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In June 2007, RadioShack {{released}} two XMODS Evolution {{models to}} coincide with the release of the film Transformers. Unlike other XMODS, which come in reusable plastic cases, these models came in standard boxes. Special body and <b>light</b> <b>kits</b> were available for these models. RadioShack stores were told not to sell them during a period in January due to a defect in the chassis. Under pressure, the chassis will crack and eventually break.|$|R
5000|$|A pull-chain present {{along with}} the variable-speed control; the dial can be set {{in one place and}} left there, with the pull-chain serving only to turn the fan on and off. Many of these fans have an option to wire the <b>light</b> <b>kit</b> to this pull-chain in order to control both the fan and the light with one chain. Using this method, the user can have either the fan or light on individually, both on, or both off.|$|R
