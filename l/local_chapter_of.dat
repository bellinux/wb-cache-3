The <b>local</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E

Homer slowly comprehends that giving up their dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all.|$|E

He had developed a series of local residential subdivisions in the area up until his 1931 death, In 1942, the county road commission named Wilson Avenue in his honor to comply with a state law requiring roads that benefitted from state funds to have proper names.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} in Hasvik was {{an emergency landing}} carried out en route to Svalbard in the early 1970s. The plain where the aircraft landed, located near the village, became {{the site of the}} airport. The regional airline Norving took the initiative in 1972 to construct a simple airfield at Hasvik; they hoped to finance along with the municipality, the National Insurance Administration and the <b>local</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps. In addition to being able to operate an air taxi service and land air ambulances, locals hoped that the construction would be a first step to becoming part of the state-financed construction of regional airports in Finnmark. However, Hasvik was not selected as one of the original regional airports.|$|E

Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well be 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E

A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck with the heel of her shoes, killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a <b>local</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the <b>local</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E

5|$|Witold's father, Julian Pilecki, {{was trained}} as a {{forester}} in Saint Petersburg and joined the Russian civil service, taking a position as a senior inspector with the Board of National Forests in Karelia. He would eventually settle {{in the town of}} Olonets where he married Ludwika Pilecki née Osiecimska. Witold Pilecki was the fourth of couple's five children. In 1910, Ludwika and the children left Karelia and relocated to the Northwestern Krai. After being joined by their father the family settled in Wilno (now: Vilnius, Lithuania), where Pilecki completed primary school and {{became a member of the}} secret ZHP Scouts organization. During the First World War, Wilno was occupied by the German Army on September 5, 1915 and was incorporated into the German Ober Ost administration. Pilecki and his family fled the Eastern Front for Mogilev, Byelorussia. In 1916 Pilecki moved to the Russian city of Oryol, where he attended gymnasium and founded a <b>local</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> the ZHP group.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link.

Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1937, Danville {{resident}} Emma Weisiger {{donated the}} land that comprises Constitution Square Historic Site to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in memory of her brother, John. The state made the land into a state park; it was originally called Old Public Square, then Constitutional Square. Using a combination {{of state and local}} funds, the Danville Chamber of Commerce and the <b>local</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> the American Legion began constructing replicas of the jail, courthouse, and meetinghouse that originally occupied the square. At the time of the park's dedication on April 20, 1942, it was dubbed the John G. Weisiger Memorial State Park. Later, the name was changed to Constitution Square State Shrine. At the time of the dedication ceremony, all non-essential construction projects in the U.S. had been halted by the War Production Board due to the country's entry into World War II, and renovations to the park's attractions had consequently ceased. Dedication speeches by Governor Keen Johnson and Centre College president Robert L. McLeod, Jr. contained reminders of the ongoing war and praise for the ideals of democracy. In addition, a plaque honoring the framers of the first Kentucky Constitution was dedicated by Louisville judge Lafon Allen and unveiled by Johnson's daughter, Judith, and Louise McDowell, a descendent of Judge Samuel McDowell, who presided over all ten constitutional conventions {{that took place in the}} original Constitution Square courthouse.|$|E
