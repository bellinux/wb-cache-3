40|$|The paper industry's {{experiences}} with PCBs were chronologically reviewed {{at a recent}} "PCB Workshop " sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. (1). This history goes back somewhat over a year, at which time two paperboard manufacturers were apprised {{of the presence of}} PCBs in folding cartons for packaging dried fruit. These two manufacturers immediately began searching for the source of the PCB contamination, screening all converting materials used in making cartons from the paperboard. These materials, including printing inks, varnishes and adhesives, proved not to be the source of the contamination. Examination of the fibrous materials used in the paperboard showed the source of PCB contamination to be some of the paperstocks used in manufacturing the paperboard. Certain high quality white and colored paperstock grades, such as <b>ledger</b> <b>papers,</b> were found to contain carbonless carbon papers which were the source of the PCBs. PCBs at that time were used as one component of the dye carrier in the carbonless carbon paper system. The American Paper Institute, the industry association, alerted the paper industry to this source of PCB contamination. Combination paperboard manufacturers, those who use recycled fibers in paperboard manufacture, immediately adopted operating procedures to eliminate the use of carbonless carbon papers and thus to minimize the PCBs in the paperboard. This action unquestionably was essential. Yet, in one respect, it does run counter to the national interest and the goals of the solid waste progra...|$|R

The server of the system generates the same digital image as the ledger and converts the handwritten data into digital text to insert the data into the database. Because the system is superior to data gathering system based on PC, PDA and touch screen in mobility, usability, data input speed, suitability in agro-livestock environment, it is possible to effectively gather traceability information of high quality by users even if they have low information ability and insufficient time to input data.
