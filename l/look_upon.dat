5|$|Virgin, {{whom the}} {{messenger}} salutes in angelic speech, {{you were born}} without stain: I ask that you implore him – who, born from the conception of celestial seed holds the mysterious command as triunal deity – to forgive me my sins, that he may deign to grant longlasting joys through his own eternity and to <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> me with {{the sight of his}} holy vision.|$|E
5|$|A {{little further}} on, I found the older and smaller wall, {{which used to}} enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for ceremony. But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find {{his feet on the}} very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> the rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the {{crowding}} ghosts of many miserable years.|$|E

60|$|And in the {{meanwhile}} the two lads <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> the maid, and the one grew pale and the other red; and the maid <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> the ground smiling.|$|R
5000|$|A p4 pattern can be <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> as a {{repetition}} in rows and columns of equal square tiles with 4-fold rotational symmetry. Also {{it can be}} <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> as a checkerboard pattern of two such tiles, a factor [...] smaller and rotated 45°.|$|R
5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently {{and listen to the}} male filmmakers. Her only role is to be an object for men to <b>look</b> <b>upon.</b> The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June 1913, the Tsardom of Bulgaria {{declared}} war on Greece, thus starting the Second Balkan War. On 4 July, Romania entered the war, allying itself with Greece. The war, which lasted {{a little over a}} month, was worsened by a cholera epidemic. Marie would <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> her first encounter with an epidemic as a turning point in her life. With the help of Dr. Ioan Cantacuzino and Sister Pucci, a Red Cross nurse, Marie travelled between Romania and Bulgaria, lending a helping hand in hospitals. These events would prepare her for her experiences in the Great War. As a result of the war, Romania gained possession of Southern Dobrudja, including the coastal town of Balchik (Balcic), which Marie would come to cherish in 1924 and use to host her residence. Soon after the war ended, Carol became ill.|$|E
60|$|Maud shrank back, and {{her husband}} took her place. But Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> them both as one who <b>looks</b> <b>upon</b> figures in a dream. Miss Brown rose hurriedly from her seat. She came {{over to him and}} thrust her arm through his.|$|R
6000|$|But {{his wife}} answered, 'Master, we <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> that gazelle as we <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> you. It was the gazelle {{who came to}} ask me of my father, it was the gazelle who brought me from my father, and I was given in charge to the gazelle by my father.' ...|$|R
60|$|All {{of which}} served to make White Fang's days enjoyable. If {{the sight of}} him drove these strange dogs upon him, so much the better for him, so much the worse for them. They <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> him as {{legitimate}} prey, and as legitimate prey he <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> them.|$|R

5000|$|Marcus Tullius Cicero, in an oration before Julius Caesar in 46 BCE, {{published}} as Pro Ligario, made the following distinction: [...] "For we {{heard you say}} that we <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> all as enemies that were not with us; but that you <b>looked</b> <b>upon</b> all as friends that were not against you." ...|$|R

25|$|Obsersteiner laid {{stress that}} there is in allochiria no defect in {{vertical}} localization but merely confusion in the patient's mind between the {{opposite sides of the}} body and come to <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> the symptom as simply any form of bad mistake in localization.|$|E
25|$|Rule 4: In {{experimental}} philosophy {{we are to}} <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> propositions inferred {{by general}} induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, not withstanding any contrary hypothesis that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.|$|E

25|$|We are at {{war with}} them: they <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> us as enemies – as invaders – as oppressors and persecutors – they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, {{therefore}} they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.|$|E
25|$|Although fearful {{and without}} sexual experience, she allows {{herself to be}} guided to a bedroom, where in the {{darkness}} a being she cannot see makes her his wife. She gradually learns {{to look forward to}} his visits, though he always departs before sunrise and forbids her to <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> him, and soon she becomes pregnant.|$|E
25|$|My object {{has been}} to dramatize like the Greeks (a modest phrase!) {{striking}} passages of history, as they did of history & mythology. You will find all this very unlike Shakespeare; and {{so much the better}} in one sense, for I <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> him to be the worst of models, though the most extraordinary of writers.|$|E

25|$|We {{prefer to}} <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> science and {{religion}} as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation. If we seek the blending of {{science and religion}} and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then {{it is not in}} the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that we hope to achieve the synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Almighty and {{everlasting}} God, <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> the Heart of Thy well-beloved Son {{and upon}} {{the acts of}} praise and satisfaction which he renders unto Thee {{in the name of}} sinners; and do Thou, in Thy great goodness, grant pardon to those who seek Thy mercy, {{in the name of the}} same Thy Son, Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with Thee, world without end.|$|E
25|$|Hildegard also invented an {{alternative}} alphabet. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's {{use of this}} form of modified medieval Latin, encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words. Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many conlangers <b>look</b> <b>upon</b> her as a medieval precursor. Scholars believe that Hildegard used her Lingua Ignota to increase solidarity among her nuns.|$|E
