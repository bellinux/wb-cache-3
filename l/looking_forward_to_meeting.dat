25|$|Cash {{was very}} close to his older brother, Jack. In May 1944, Jack was pulled into a {{whirling}} head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two. He suffered {{for more than a week}} before dying on May 20, 1944, at the age of 15. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meeting</b> his brother in Heaven.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was with}} a strange feeling that Dolores woke on the New Year's morning, that {{something}} was very sad and strange, and yet {{that there was a}} sense of relief. [...] For one thing, that terrible confession to her father was written, and was no longer a weight hanging over her. And though his answer was still to come, that was months away. There was Uncle Regie greatly displeased with her; there was Constance treating her as a traitor; there was the mischief done, and yet something hard and heavy was gone? Something sweet and precious had come in on her! Surely it was, that now she knew and felt that she could trust in Aunt Lilias--yes, and in Mysie. She got up, quite <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meeting</b> those gentle, brown eyes of her aunt's, that she seemed never before to have looked into, and to feeling the sweet, motherly kiss which had so mud, more meaning in it now, as almost to make up for Uncle Reginald's estrangement.|$|E

She would have said that in Guy's own home, 'the joy' had come to her, no longer in fitful gleams and held by an effort for a moment, but steadily brightening. She missed him indeed, but the power of finding rest in <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>meeting</b> him, the pleasure of dwelling on the days he had been with her, and the satisfaction of doing his work for the present, had made a happiness for her, and still in him, quiet, grave, and subdued, but happiness likely to bloom more and more brightly throughout her life. The anniversary of his death was indeed a day of tears, but the tears were blessed ones, and she was more full of the feeling that had sustained her on that morning, than she had been through all the year before.|$|E
