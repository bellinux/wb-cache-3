40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to {{research}} and <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> in Norway, and their {{positive impact on the}} development of relations with foreign oil and gas companies during the period of formation of the Norwegian oil and gas industry. Based on archival documents, the article considers Norway’s experience of conclusion of research and <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> for transferring the latest technologies of exploration and oil and gas production to national oil and gas companies {{in the process of developing}} the country’s oil and gas industry. The author concludes that Norway made significant scientific and technological progress through promoting active cooperation with foreign companies. Norway’s successful experience could be applied by Russian state authorities in order to develop relations with foreign oil companies. These companies could take part in offshore exploration in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea through concluding similar agreements between Russian state institutions, and foreign oil and gas companies, which would give an impetus to the development of the technological component of Russia’s oil and gas sector. Research and <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> have been used by Norwegians with the aim of diversification of the economy and prevention of excessive dependence on the energy sector, which is one of the major challenges faced by Russia. ...|$|R

Multilateral and hub-and-spoke coalitional structures are PCPNE, even in large economies, {{in the absence of}} income transfers for different values of attrition costs. Fully participated multilateral coalitional structures are not stable in the presence of income transfers; however, the size of the stable coalition increases as the economy expands...|$|R

40|$|The Kyoto Agreement is {{the result}} of {{international}} negotiations over many years. However, because of a number of weaknesses, different sorts of climate agreement have been suggested: for example, coordinated R&D activities that reduce abatement costs for all firms. We will compare an agreement focusing only on emissions (a Kyoto type of agreement) with an agreement focusing only on technology, assuming that the costs of abatement are affected by R&D in all firms through technology spillovers. In an emissions agreement, emissions should be restricted {{to the extent that the}} carbon price exceeds the Pigovian level. For sufficiently low technology spillovers, an emissions agreement is more efficient than a <b>technology</b> <b>agreement</b> specifying an R&D subsidy to be imposed on all firms in all countries.
