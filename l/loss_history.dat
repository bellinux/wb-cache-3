5000|$|A diminished value [...] {{evaluates the}} {{difference}} in value of a motor vehicle after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced {{in the field of}} DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an insurance company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as {{the difference in}} the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no <b>loss</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The usual {{reasons for}} {{including}} other parties as additional insureds {{is due to}} the close relationship or legal requirements between the original named insured and the additional insured. In most cases it is beneficial for a party to be covered as an additional insured on the policies of other parties because this will reduce the <b>loss</b> <b>history</b> of the additional insured and lower its premiums. The losses will be posted against the policies of the party providing the additional insurance and their premiums will rise accordingly. Typically, a larger and more powerful business will require that smaller entities (desiring to do business) have the larger business named as an additional insured. For example, a landlord in a commercial building will often require that a tenant have the landlord named as an additional insured on the tenant's insurance policies. [...] In this manner, if there is an accident or loss on the tenant's premises (such as a fall or a fire), then the landlord will enjoy the benefits of the tenant's insurance coverage. Similarly, general contractors often require subcontractors to name the general and the owner on the subcontractor's policies. [...] In this way, if the general contractor or owner are sued due to accidents arising out of the work of the subcontractor, the subcontractor's insurance will protect the general contractor and owner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Past imaging {{observations}} of a post-AGB star, HD 161796, have probed {{different parts of}} its circumstellar shell which correspond to different epochs of the star’s AGB mass <b>loss</b> <b>history.</b> While the overall structure of the shell can be described by an axisymmetric model consisting of three layers of characteristic structure, the mass distribution in the shell appears to rotate its axis of symmetry in a continuous manner.

The Object HD 161796 (IRAS 17436 + 5003) is a low metallicity oxygen-rich post-AGB star of F 3 Ib located at high Galactic latitude (e. g., Hrivnak et al. 1989).

40|$|This letter {{deals with}} the {{initialization}} of the <b>loss</b> <b>history</b> structure in the TFRC (TCP-Friendly Rate Control) mechanism. This initialization occurs after the detection of the first loss event after every slowstart phase. The <b>loss</b> <b>history</b> is crucial for the algorithm since it returns the packet loss rate estimation. This estimation {{is used in the}} TFRC equation to compute the sending rate. In this letter, we propose a new method to compute the packet loss rate which is more computationally efficient and remains as accurate as the classical commonly used method. The motivation of this work is to reduce the computation time and formulate a unified computation scheme. This method is based on the Newton’s algorithm issued from numerical analysis of the TCP throughput equation. This proposal is evaluated analytically and the results show a significant improvement in terms of the computation time...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} first {{exploratory}} {{investigation of the}} dynamical evolution of a dusty stellar wind envelope along the upper AGB and its transformation into a planetary nebula. We find the existence of AGB stars with detached shells to be a natural consequence of the mass loss variations during a thermal pulse. It is also demonstrated that due to the large dynamical effects caused by the ionizing radiation field and the fast wind of the central star, {{it is impossible to}} deduce the AGB mass <b>loss</b> <b>history</b> from the planetary's density and velocity distribution. The structure of the halo, however, is still determined by the AGB mass <b>loss</b> <b>history.</b> The rapid decline of mass loss expected in the aftermath of thermal pulses leads to extended shells of low densities and explains halos with sharp boundaries.

30|$|Despite soaring demand, {{underwriters}} {{are struggling}} to understand each consumer’s cyber risk profile; a 2015 Cyber Liability Insurance Market Trend report showed the number one barrier to selling cyber policies is ‘not understanding exposures’ [1]. Getting this process wrong can be very costly. Target™ were reimbursed $ 90 million by their insurer following their 2013 data breach [5]. Traditional insurance techniques involve creating actuarial tables of loss histories across defined risk profiles. These are inapplicable for two reasons, the first being that insurers {{do not know the}} properties and attributes which delimit different risk profiles, while the second is that insurers do not have the <b>loss</b> <b>history</b> data to create the actuarial tables. In fact, relevant <b>loss</b> <b>history</b> may never exist given the dynamic nature of cyber risk. At present, all that insurers can rely on to quantify cyber risk is the information they collect in the assessment process. However, the evidence regarding the presence or not of specific security controls that insurers require in these assessment processes may have further consequences.|$|E
