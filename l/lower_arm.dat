5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot and killed. The Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The warriors followed the retreating unit and entered the camp. Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a bayonet charge that repulsed the warriors. During the charge Bartholomew was shot through the <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> breaking both bones. He was still clutching his sword when he was treated hours later. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E

5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) {{is estimated}} to have been 286mm (11in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317mm long (12in).|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E

25|$|The muscle {{performing}} {{an action}} is the agonist, while the muscle which contraction brings about an opposite action is the antagonist. For example, {{an extension of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> is performed by the triceps as the agonist and the biceps as the antagonist (which contraction will perform flexion over the same joint). Muscles that work together to perform the same action are called synergists. In the above example synergists to the biceps can be the brachioradialis and the brachialis muscle.|$|E
25|$|The arm {{had a short}} humerus {{and also}} the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> was short and elegant with an ulna showing only a weakly {{developed}} olecranon process on its back upper end. The hand was very elongated though, {{as long as the}} ulna and upper arm combined. The second metacarpal was expanded at the top {{at the side of the}} first metacarpal, making the entire metacarpus more compact. The second claw was elongated, as long as the thumb claw. The third metacarpal was rather short and carried a thin, third, finger.|$|E

There is a variety of possible alternative functions for its wings, including shielding of eggs, display, intimidation and keeping balance while pinning down prey with the sickle claw. These functions however, do not necessitate quill knobs and the describing authors considered it likely that Dakotaraptor descended from a smaller flying ancestor which had them.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an enhanced independent pole control scheme for hybrid modular multilevel converter (MMC) based on full bridge sub-module (FBSM) and half bridge sub-module (HBSM). A {{detailed analysis of}} power distribution between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> under asymmetrical DC pole voltages is presented. It is found that the fundamental AC currents in the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> are asymmetrical. To enable operation under asymmetrical DC pole voltages, an enhanced independent pole control scheme is proposed. The controller is composed of two DC control loops, two AC control loops and circulating current suppression control based on current injection. Six modulation indices are presented to independently control the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arms.</b> With this controller, the DC voltage operating region is significantly extended. To ride through pole to ground DC fault without bringing DC bias at the neutral point of interface transformer, a pole to ground DC fault ride through strategy is proposed. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are verified by simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R
25|$|A biomechanical study {{conducted}} by Phil Senter (2006) used articulated casts of the Ornitholestes type specimen's right forelimb to determine its range of motion. Senter found that the antebrachium (forearm) could swing freely within a 95¬∞ range. When flexed (bent inward) at the elbow joint to the maximum possible extent, the humerus (upper arm bone) and radius (a <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> bone) formed a 53¬∞ angle. The ability of Ornitholestes to bend the forearm to an angle significantly more acute than 90¬∞ is characteristic of Maniraptoriformes, but absent in more primitive theropods such as Coelophysis and Allosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The scapula {{had a large}} {{rectangular}} acromion, with a sharp upper corner, on {{the lower}} front edge. The more narrow coracoid had a rounded lower edge. Both the upper arm and ulna and radius (<b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> bones) are also {{comparable to those of}} Stegosaurus. The tuberosity of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a deep front part, the processus praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip.|$|E
25|$|In the Henry {{system of}} classification, {{there are three}} basic {{fingerprint}} patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60‚Äì65%, 30‚Äì35%, and 5% of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or ulnar, depending {{on the side of}} the hand toward which the tail points. Ulnar loops start on the pinky-side of the finger, the side closer to the ulna, the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> bone. Radial loops start on the thumb-side of the finger, the side closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.|$|E

25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the <b>lower</b> <b>arm.</b> It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{badge of}} the Order is a gilt cross with enamel, {{similar to the}} Order's emblem {{illustrated}} here, but with a longer <b>lower</b> <b>arm.</b> During the monarchy there were separate badges for civil and military knights: civil knights wore a badge similar to the modern version, but with the Sacred Heart of Christ above it; military knights had a completely different insignia, this being a gilt, white enamelled Maltese Cross with enamelled oval shields (each bearing a design similar to the Coat of arms of Portugal minus the red border) between {{the arms of the}} cross, the whole surrounded by a wreath of palm; the central disc was in white enamel, with a miniature of the modern badge in it; the badge was topped by a gilt crown.|$|E
25|$|A lobster-pot trap is {{a chamber}} that {{is easy to}} enter, and whose exit is either {{difficult}} to find or obstructed by inward-pointing bristles. Lobster pots are the trapping mechanism in Genlisea, the corkscrew plants. These plants appear to specialise in aquatic protozoa. A Y-shaped modified leaf allows prey to enter but not exit. Inward-pointing hairs force the prey to move in a particular direction. Prey entering the spiral entrance that coils around the upper two arms of the Y are forced to move inexorably towards a stomach in the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of the Y, where they are digested. Prey movement is also thought to be encouraged by water movement through the trap, produced {{in a similar way}} to the vacuum in bladder traps, and probably evolutionarily related to it.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional low {{nose cone}} designs (e.g. the McLaren MP4/4) allow the <b>lower</b> {{suspension}} <b>arms</b> {{to be directly}} attached to the main structural members of the car. However, since the move to high nose cone designs - which allow better use of airflow underneath the car, {{and to a lesser}} extent the front wing - location of these <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> has proven problematic. For ideal suspension geometry, and hence maximum mechanical grip, the <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> should be long and near parallel with the road. As there is no longer any structural bodywork in these low positions, extensions were developed to allow the suspension to be mounted with correct geometry. Since the advent of high nose designs in the early 1990s, pioneered on the Tyrrell 019 Formula One car, three major keel designs have emerged to solve this problem: ...|$|R
