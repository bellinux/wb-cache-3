40|$|AbstractMany {{chemical}} engineering processes involve a reaction between a diffusing substance and an immobile solid phase. The usual treatments {{are based on}} the assumptions that either diffusion or reaction dominates. Instead, we shall model an isothermal process in which reaction and diffusion are of the same order as would occur, for instance, in <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coke</b> burning. Mass balances then lead to a parabolic system for the concentrations of the two phases. The system can be reduced to a scalar parabolic problem for the cumulative gas concentration. The popular pseudo-steady-state approximation is then obtained by setting the porosity ∈ equal to zero. This pseudo-steady-state problem is an elliptic problem in which time appears only as a parameter in the boundary condition. In previous work, we have shown that the pseudo-steady-state solution provides an O(∈) approximation to the exact concentration, uniformly in space and time. The present paper is concerned with estimates for the conversion, that is, the fraction of solid that has been converted to products by time t. We obtain bounds for the conversion in terms of a similar quantity (explicity calculable in some cases) for the pseudo-steady-state problem...|$|E
30|$|The TOS {{results provide}} {{evidence}} that the higher activity of 350 HOA USY compared to CBV 720 USY [31] {{is related to the}} number of acid sites. Furthermore, moderately slow deactivation for both catalysts was observed, reaching the pseudo-stable state in the initial few minutes at the lower temperatures of 210 and 230  °C. The nPt/nA ratio for 350 HOA USY was calculated as 0.06, which is in the suggested range of 0.03  ≤ nPt/nA ≤  0.17 for a well-balanced bifunctional catalyst, in conjunction with 0.12 for CBV 720 USY, which allowed deactivation to occur at reasonably <b>low</b> <b>temperatures</b> with lower <b>coke</b> content. Although the mesoporosity texture was similar for both catalysts, the average coke content was higher for 350 HOA USY, which may be due to its higher acidity, as the framework Si/Al was lower, resulting in cracking activity at temperatures of 250 and 270  °C.|$|R
40|$|Zeolite membranes, {{especially}} the MFI-type zeolite membranes, have attracted significant attention for decades {{because of their}} special properties. While organic templates such as tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) have typically been used for the synthesis of ZSM- 5 zeolite and zeolite membranes, the templates remain trapped in the as-synthesized zeolite crystals. A common method for removing organic templates and generating porous frameworks is calcination; however, during this process, the channel structure may be affected. In particular, for ZSM- 5 membranes, membrane defects may be produced and the separation efficiency therefore may decrease to some extent. In this study, the low-temperature hydrocracking of TPAOH in ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals was studied under H- 2 /N- 2, while N- 2 adsorption, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD), and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize zeolite samples. The {{results show that the}} organic template in the pores of ZSM- 5 can be effectively removed below 350 degrees C by low-temperature hydrocracking. Characterization analyses by BET specific surface area, TG, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that a reducing atmosphere containing H- 2 was more conducive to template removal at <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> than atmospheres of air or N- 2. The degree of template removal increased with temperature increasing. The BET surface area of the crystal after hydrocracking at 280 degrees C reached 252 m(2). g(- 1), although a small amount of organic residue remained. Furthermore, after hydrocracking at 350 degrees C, the BET surface area reached 399 m(2). g(- 1), and only trace amount of inorganic carbon residue remained. In addition, the introduction of hydrogen at <b>low</b> <b>temperatures</b> could prevent <b>coke</b> deposits on acid sites and thus ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals had greater numbers of acidic sites after low-temperature hydrocracking...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This project {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of raw materials properties and heat-treatment temperature on the reactivity of carbon anodes. The properties of the raw materials such as structure, porosity, and chemical purity have strong effects on the final properties of the carbon anode composites. These properties {{interact with each other}} during the heat-treatment processes of the anode fabrication process, and may further interact during the reaction of carbon anodes under different gaseous atmospheres. Understanding the effects of these factors on reactivity is important in order to develop high oxidation resistance carbon anodes. There are great potential economic benefits from using high oxidation resistance carbon anodes in the aluminium smelting process, as well as reducing green house gas emission. A high-sulfur petroleum coke (~ 3. 2 wt % S) and a low-sulfur petroleum coke (~ 1. 7 wt % S) with various metal microconstituents in different quantities are used to study the effect of chemical purity. These cokes were calcined at multiple heat-treatment temperatures. A suite of 24 simulated carbon anodes was produced from these calcined petroleum cokes at multiple baking heat-treatment temperatures. The effect of heat-treatment temperature {{on the development of the}} structure and porosity of these samples were studied using various techniques including gas adsorption, XRD, SEM, and TEM. The TGA method was used to measure the reactivity of the coke and simulated carbon anode samples. Sulfur was found to act as both a catalyst and an inhibitor to the gasification reactions. In air gasification, cokes and simulated anodes with high-sulfur content are four times more reactive than cokes and simulated anodes with low-sulfur content. On the basis of chemical structure analysis, the excess sulfur lowers the activation energy of the carbon-oxygen reaction by destabilizing the bonds of the adjacent carbons in the aromatic ring structure, allowing more active sites to form. In CO 2 gasification, cokes and anodes with high-sulfur content are less reactive than cokes and anodes with low-sulfur content. Sulfur is believed to inhibit the catalytic activity of metals such as sodium by forming non-mobile stable metal sulphide complexes. In addition, it was found that excess heat treatment enhanced the catalytic activity of low sulfur based carbons. Some metal complexes such as nickel nitrides destabilized during high temperature heat treatment and become active toward the carbon-CO 2 reaction. The calcination level of petroleum cokes was found to have strong influence on the structural development of simulated carbon anodes. Simulated anode composites made from lower <b>temperature</b> calcined <b>cokes</b> contained a better developed structure than simulated anode composites made from higher <b>temperature</b> calcined <b>cokes.</b> This was mainly due to the underdeveloped structure of lower <b>temperature</b> calcined <b>cokes.</b> On the basis that the under-calcined cokes have similar chemical structure to the binder pitch, the cokes formed stronger bonds with the binder pitch matrix as the composite structure developed during the heat treatment baking process. These under-calcined coke-based simulated anode composites were found to have better oxidation resistance than the simulated anode composites made from higher <b>temperature</b> calcined <b>cokes.</b> The evolution of pore structure and crystalline structure during gasification is investigated. The results showed that gasification in air produced slightly different structural development than gasification in CO 2. Because oxygen is more reactive than CO 2, it prefers to attack the most reactive parts of the carbon structure such as disorganized carbon and smaller crystallites while CO 2 attacks the carbon structure more uniformly. As a result, oxygen creates more porosity during gasification than CO 2. This observation was demonstrated with the simulated anode composites made from high <b>temperature</b> calcined <b>cokes.</b> Due to the mismatch properties between different components in these simulated anode composites, more porosity development occurred in air gasification than in CO 2 gasification. Another important finding is that the pitch component is completely removed from the anode structure by about 50 % solid conversion in both gasification processes. The findings in this project suggested that new processing conditions may be applied to produce anodes with high oxidation resistance. Unlike the current practice of optimizing the properties of one key component in the anode composites, it is better to minimize the differences in properties between different components in the anode composites. This includes the use of <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> calcined <b>cokes</b> and a careful consideration of the chemical impurity of the raw materials...|$|R
