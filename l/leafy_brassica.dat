[...] "The Slave" [...] by Zipes, and [...] "Der Albanese" [...] i.e. 'the Slav', by Kaden) features {{three daughters}} of a cavuciliddaru (German:), that is, {{a man who}} gathers or sells [...] or <b>leafy</b> <b>brassica</b> vegetables (of the cabbages, mustards, or rapes kind) for a living. The man takes the youngest named Rusidda (tr. Rosetta or Rosa) and find a lovely mushroom, which they pull and tug, until there pops {{up out of the}} ground (pulled out by the ear, according to Kaden) a slave (or the Slav). The Slave bargains to have the daughter stay with him in his magnificent dwelling underground, paying the father a purse full of money. She is treated well, until one day the Slave leaves house and after making her promise to do whatever he bids her, instructs her to eat a hand with fresh flesh on it in his absence. Horrified, she crushes the hand up in a mortar and throws the mess in the toilet. Upon the Slave's return, she tells a lie, claiming she ate it, but when the Slave calls out to the hand, it answers and reveals its whereabouts. The Slave beheads and discards Rusidda, then bargains the father for the other sisters, Catarina (Caterina) who fails the test, and 'Ntonia (Antonia) who outwits the Slave. Antonia grinds up the hand and smears the mess on her stomach like plaster. She gains her captor's trust, discovers the fresh corpses of her sisters and kings and princes, finds a pot of healing, whose content when administered with a brush on the severed wound restored the missing body part and revived the dead. The rescued royalty offer to marry or adopt their rescuer, and Antonia chooses to be the wife of the Prince of Portugal. There is an epilogue whereby the Slave tries to take revenge by transforming into an immobile statue or doll, dressed in Portuguese garb and placed in a glass cabinet, fooling the king into buying the doll as decor for his wife's chamber (Kaden's German translation is clearer on this; the original word for the furniture piece is scaffarrata, which Zipes translates as [...] "cabinet", but is really a glass case). The Slave tries to harm her while she lies asleep, but Antonia notices, he is apprehended, all of the Slav's former victims are invited to exact revenge upon the villain until he is dead.|$|E

The range of carbon/nitrogen ratio in the vegetable crops was narrow, between 9 and 24, compared with a C/N ratio of 58 in wheat. The decomposition of the residues could be described by the single-exponential equation Y = a be-k(t - d), where Y is the proportion of residue remaining at any thermal time day degrees above 0 °C, a is the proportion of residue remaining {{at the end of}} the experiment, b is the corresponding proportion of the degradable fraction, k is the rate constant for the decomposition process and d is a delay factor (in units of thermal time) which delays the start of the decomposition process.

With the use of AFLP markers, comparisons were made of the genetic diversity and population structure of ten wild and 22 cultivated populations, as well as of a hybrid population and of four commercial cultivars of different B. oleracea crops. The level of genetic diversity was higher in leafy kales than in wild populations and this diversity was mainly distributed within populations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Kales are {{primitive}} <b>leafy</b> <b>Brassica</b> oleracea L. forms, {{widespread in}} local farming systems of several European countries and {{employed in the}} preparation of traditional recipes. Kales are also potential sources of healthy bioactive phytochemical components. The present study compared the bioactive compound content of kale populations from Italy, Portugal, and Turkey, either from local sources or grown in an experimental field. RESULTS: Total phenolics, glucosinolates (GLS), carotenoids, and chlorophylls were in the ranges 8310 – 38 110, 755 – 8580, 135 – 2354, and 1740 – 16 924 mg kg− 1 dry matter, respectively. On average, locally harvested samples showed a total GLS content about twice as high as populations from the experiment. Conversely, pigments were significantly more abundant in experimental than in local kales, owing to the higher soil fertility. Portuguese samples showed higher phenolic and GLS amounts than Italian and Turkish kales, whereas some of the Italian samples were the richest in carotenoids. CONCLUSION: This paper represented the first cross-country comparison of local kale accessions with respect to bioactive compound amounts. Both geographic origin and growing environment appeared to be remarkable and discriminating factors in determining bioactive levels in leafy kales, with possible effects on their health-promoting and sensorial attributes.

40|$|A <b>leafy</b> crop of <b>Brassica</b> napus L. called nabicol {{has been}} grown by farmers in northwestern Spain for many years, being an {{important}} horticultural product {{during the winter}} season. A collection of landraces of a <b>Brassica</b> napus <b>leafy</b> crop called nabicol is kept at 'Misión Biológica de Galicia' (CSIC-Spain) {{which can be used}} to search for desirable characteristics or to produce new commercial varieties to release in the market. The assessment of the mating system of nabicol landraces is particularly important to carry on adequate breeding and genetic conservation programs. The objective of this work is to estimate the outcrossing rate in nabicol under controlled pollinator conditions using SSRs. Pairs of flowering plants taken from nabicol landrace MBG-BRS 0039 were placed in separated isolation cages and bumble bees (Bombus sp.) were released for facilitating the crosses between plants. A seed sample from each plant in the cross was analyzed by SSRs that were polymorphic in the parental population. We found that the crop is partially allogamous and that there is genetic variation for the outcrossing rate among individuals. Several consequences for the maintenance and genetic improvement of the crop are discussed.

The reason behind choosing five vegetables was not merely for increasing the sample diversity; rather to impart a type of diversity that would provide self-sufficiency to the assessment. As the five vegetables cover a broad spectrum of tuber, <b>brassica,</b> <b>leafy,</b> root, and fruiting vegetables, this enables testing samples {{from a wide variety of}} plant organs to deduce contamination scenario through the soil–water–air continuum in the biogeochemical cycle. Besides, the vegetables selected from these five categories (one vegetable from each category) are widely consumed as well as grown throughout the country. As there are particular contamination routes throughout the country with regard to Pb and Cr, therefore, it is also necessary to incorporate the entire geographical expanse of the country in order to reveal the ecotoxicological fate of recent extensive ambient atmospheric Pb pollution in the country, as well as the impact of the Cr contamination phenomenon through wide dissemination of protein-concentrates produced from chrome-tanned skin cut solid waste for farming practice. It is the inclusion of such wide spectrum of vegetable types as well as the entire expanse of the country into the research design that provides the true significance of the study.

This study comprised four independent experiments: two pot experiments in a controlled environment artificially contaminated with radiocaesium, and two field experiments in an area contaminated with radiocaesium and radiostrontium in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Radiocaesium concentration ratios varied 35 -fold among 27 cultivars grown in pots in a controlled environment. These 27 cultivars were then grown with a further 44 and 43 other cultivars in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in 2003 and 2004, respectively. In the field-grown cultivars radiocaesium concentration ratios varied by up to 35 -fold and radiostrontium concentration ratios varied by up to 23 -fold. In three of these experiments (one pot experiment, two field experiments) one out of the 27 cultivars was found to have a consistently lower radiocaesium concentration ratio than the other cultivars. The two field experiments showed that, five out of the 66 cultivars common to both experiments had consistently lower radiocaesium concentration ratios, and two cultivars had consistently lower radiostrontium concentration ratios. One cultivar had consistently lower radiocaesium and radiostrontium concentration ratios. The identification of cultivars that have consistently lower radiocaesium and/or radiostrontium concentration ratios suggests that cultivar selection or substitution may be an effective remediation strategy in radiologically contaminated areas.

40|$|Rationale and objectives. <b>Leafy</b> {{forms of}} <b>Brassica</b> oleracea L. are {{generally}} known as kales or collards. They are traditional crops of several areas of Europe (Portugal, Spain, Scotland, Holland, Italy) and in Turkey, well rooted in local farming and food systems, but far lesser known as commercial crops. Glucosinolates are typical {{components of the}} Brassicaceae family, to which kales belong, presently valued as health promoting phytochemicals. Leafy kales are virtually the only edible crops containing high relative glucobrassicin content, at the same time, a total gluocosinolate amount compatible with human consumption. With this respect, these local and somewhat neglected species, can {{play a major role}} for the valorisation, in a healthy food context, of the glucobrassicin / indole- 3 -carbinol system. The EU funded project BaSeFood targeted kales as interesting raw materials for further investigation. Materials and methods. Mature kale leaves have been collected in two context: a) on field, in locally grown crops in Turkey, Italy and Portugal during winter 2009 - 2010; b) from an experimental trial planted in Cesena, Italy, using 7 Italian, 6 Turkish and 2 Portuguese populations, in wither 2010. The samples were freeze dried and stored and - 20 ° C until extraction by means methanol/water. Gucosinolates were transformed in the corresponding desulpho-derivatives before analysis. The analyses were carried out by means of HPLC, under appropriate conditions fro the two classess of compounds. Results. The main glucosinolates and phenolics have been identified. Ample variability was detected either in dependence on the origin of the material and within each origin. Conclusions. For the first time, kale populations of different origin were compared in a common environment. This work allowed therefore the characterisation of kale biodiversity. It also allowed the individuation of strains with better opportunities for exploitation in the preparation of health promoting traditional foods.

Brassica oleracea L. is a {{polymorph}} species including, {{besides the}} {{more commonly used}} horticultural types (cauliflower, broccoli, head cabbage, Brussels sprouts), also types which leaves are the more commonly used part. These are mainly referred to as kales, or collards, but also include kohlrabi types, when the leaves are consumed. Kales are typical components of local food systems of many European areas, but are not generally utilised as large scale commercial crops. The rather unique abundance of glucobrassicin, besides that of flavonoids and carotenoids, make them also a potentially interesting health promoting crop. Material and methods. On site surveys were carried out during BaSeFood project, interviewing local respondents, according to qualitative descriptive methods in Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Georgia and Bulgaria. Information about the local populations, growing systems, uses, recipes and health promoting properties perceptions were retrieved. Cross country comparison were carried out. Results. Kales are used in Italy, Portugal and Turkey, whereas the use of kohlrabi leaves is reported in Bulgaria and Georgia. The local populations present a different level of variability; selection is practised by farmers but only in Italy and Portugal some kind of organised seed production seems to occur. In almost all areas, the leaves are used at different stages, as a typical winter vegetable, often representing the only fresh green available during the cool season. Over 40 traditional recipes were recorded and critically compared. They combine locally available ingredients and, in almost all cases, they represent a main course: use of kales as side dish {{does not belong to}} tradition. Kales are exploited at commercial level especially in Italy, and to a lesser extend in Portugal; these cases may represent an example for other situations. The local perception of health promoting value is very low. Conclusions. As a whole <b>leafy</b> forms of <b>Brassica</b> oleracea can be considered a very significant example of traditional crops with potential of exploitation. They are highly adaptable to local conditions but also sufficiently plastic to be fitted to more intensive exploitation systems. This flexibility represents a possibility for the preservation of local populations, together with the selection of stabilised varieties. Kale recipes also represent a typical example of how traditional foods make use of what available, are intrinsically variable and are difficult to define in terms of quality and quantity of ingredients. Kales are also {{a good example of how}} new knowledge of potential health promoting properties can enhance the interest on traditional crops and foods.
