5|$|Shaoguan {{authorities}} {{moved the}} Uyghur workers to temporary accommodation, {{and the workers}} were transferred on 7 July to another facility belonging to Early Light, 30km away in Baitu town. The Baitu factory is now reported to be an Uyghur enclave, with, sporting facilities, canteen serving Xinjiang food, a round-the-clock staff clinic, and plain-clothed police officers in their midst. According to the South China Morning Post, the Kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix with colleagues in their previous location because of the language barrier – a <b>local</b> <b>shop</b> worker estimated that less than one in three spoke Mandarin. Two months on, the South China Morning Post found few {{willing to talk about}} the events of the fateful night. The authorities' claims that 50 Uyghur workers were granted their repatriation requests following the violence are contested by Uyghur workers.|$|E

25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that a lot of}} the characters and indeed the town are based on Pemberton's home town of Chorley, with Royston Vasey based on Adlington, a village within Chorley Borough. The character of Herr Lipp is believed to be based on a hospital chaplain Steve Pemberton encountered after suffering a heart attack in Germany and Pauline is primarily based on a restart officer of Reece Shearsmith's. Similarly, Ollie Plimsolls is based on a community theatre actor that Shearsmith had worked with. In the DVD commentary on the second series, Pemberton and Shearsmith state that Papa Lazarou's speech patterns are based on their former landlord, who would phone their flat and insist on speaking only to Steve. Gatiss has said in interview that the <b>local</b> <b>shop</b> was inspired by a shop in the village of Rottingdean and that he was influenced growing up around the former Winterton Hospital asylum near Sedgefield.|$|E
25|$|Some {{benefits}} from the piracy have also been noted. In the earlier years of the phenomenon in 2008, {{it was reported that}} many local residents in pirate hubs such as Harardhere appreciated the rejuvenating effect that the pirates' on-shore spending and restocking had on their small towns, a presence which often provided jobs and opportunity when there were comparatively fewer. Entire hamlets were in the process reportedly transformed into boomtowns, with <b>local</b> <b>shop</b> owners and other residents using their gains to purchase items such as generators for uninterrupted electricity. However, the election of a new administration in 2009 in the northeastern Puntland region saw a sharp decrease in pirate operations, as the provincial authorities launched a comprehensive anti-piracy campaign and established an official maritime police force (PMPF). Since 2010, pirates have mainly operated from the Galmudug region to the south. According to the Somalia Report, the significant infrastructural development evident in Puntland's urban centers has also mainly come from a combination of government development programs, internal investment by local residents returning to their home regions following the civil war in the south, and especially remittance funds sent by the sizable Somali diaspora. The latter contributions have been estimated at around $1.3–$2 billion a year, exponentially dwarfing pirate ransom proceeds, which total only a few million dollars annually and are difficult to track in terms of spending.|$|E
25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a <b>local</b> <b>shop</b> shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E

500|$|Waterstones {{opened its}} first non-branded shop in Southwold, Suffolk in July 2014 called Southwold Books. The company {{decided not to}} use its {{branding}} as it wished to ‘fit in’ with the town’s high proportion of independent retailers, but this move drew anger from local residents {{at the time as}} they viewed the move as [...] "dishonest" [...] and said that <b>local</b> <b>shop</b> rents were being increased because of chain stores moving in and this subsequently was [...] "changing the character of the high street". Non-branded Waterstones became an issue again in 2016 at a national level, following newspaper reports about not only Southwold Books but two further stores, The Rye Bookshop in Sussex and Harpenden Books in Hertfordshire, being opened and local residents not realising the connection with the retailer. Commentators were split on the ethics of the decision to open unbranded stores, but it was noted that at no point had attempts been made to hide the connection to the retailer. In interviews, James Daunt denied any [...] "subterfuge" [...] and said he wanted for the stores to behave as independent retailers do and have their own identity. He further stated that more unbranded stores were likely to open in the future.|$|E

40|$|Small shops {{located within}} walking or cycling {{distance}} of consumers have, in many communities, {{been relegated to}} the status of convenience stores, with high prices and limited product selections. Consumers who don't have cars are thus disadvantaged. Is this a necessary state of affairs? We develop a model with two kinds of <b>shops</b> (<b>local,</b> and out-of-town) and two kinds of consumer (mobile and immobile). We assume that <b>local</b> <b>shops</b> operate in monopolistic competition, while the market structure for out-of-town shops is a stable oligopoly among large retail chains. We show that policies which raise the net cost (price plus consumer travel costs) of shopping out of town may cause a discontinuous drop in the price level of <b>local</b> <b>shops.</b> The price drop is accompanied by both the entry of new <b>local</b> <b>shops</b> and a reduction of excess capacity in <b>local</b> <b>shops.</b> We draw the following conclusions from the model: to the extent that <b>local</b> <b>shops</b> serve a poorer clientele, a rise in prices at out-of-town shops will have a progressive distributional effect if it results in the local price reduction predicted here. Moreover, the same measures have the potential to improve allocative efficiency through a combination of reductions in local excess capacity and the internalization of social and environmental costs of automobile use...|$|R
