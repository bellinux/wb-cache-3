5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and <b>laxative.</b> Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a <b>laxative</b> and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and <b>laxative</b> abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|Aloin, a {{compound}} {{found in the}} exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) <b>laxative</b> products in the United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it failed to provide the necessary safety data. Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically. Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce side effects.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>laxatives</b> combine {{more than}} one active ingredient. <b>Laxatives</b> may be oral or {{suppository}} in form.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laxatives</b> vary as to {{how they}} work and the side effects they may have. Certain stimulant, {{lubricant}} and saline <b>laxatives</b> are used to evacuate the colon for rectal and bowel examinations, and may be supplemented by enemas under certain circumstances. Sufficiently high doses of <b>laxatives</b> may cause diarrhea.|$|R
5000|$|Differentiation of DIOS from {{constipation}} {{is generally}} performed by unit {{specializing in the}} treatment of cystic fibrosis. Adequate hydration and an aggressive regimen of <b>laxatives</b> are essential for treatment and prevention of DIOS. Osmotic <b>laxatives</b> such as polyethylene glycol are preferred. Individuals prone to DIOS tend to be at risk for repeated episodes and often require maintenance therapy with pancreatic enzyme replacement, hydration and <b>laxatives.</b>|$|R
5|$|Carly and Kate {{travel to}} the beach, where Kate has a run-in with Amber, and the two women inform her that Mark has been {{cheating}} on all of them. All three women then decide to take revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with an estrogen to swell his nipples, has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo; Carly spikes his water with a <b>laxative</b> to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea; Amber has an ugly fake three-way sexual partner against him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known <b>laxative.</b> Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe <b>laxative</b> effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
50|$|Lactulose {{and milk}} of {{magnesia}} have been compared with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in children. All had similar side effects, but PEG {{was more effective}} at treating constipation. Osmotic <b>laxatives</b> are recommended over stimulant <b>laxatives.</b>|$|R
40|$|Context: Constipation {{is common}} and {{sometimes}} distressing in palliative care patients. <b>Laxatives</b> are often prescribed, {{but there is}} little guidance as to the most appropriate time to cease these medications as death approaches. Objective: To conduct a retrospective pilot review of usual prescribing of <b>laxatives</b> toward the end of life in a specialist palliative care unit. Methods: The notes of all 92 inpatients who died over a 2 -month period were reviewed, with the main outcomes of interest being the number and types of <b>laxatives</b> prescribed and the documentation of bowel movements in relation to time of death. Results: On admission 70 % of the patients were receiving <b>laxatives,</b> with a mean of two different types per person. The mean number of days before death that people had a bowel movement recorded by nursing staff was 3. 8 (standard deviation (SD) 3. 55). No differences were identified between those who had not received <b>laxatives</b> at any point, those who received <b>laxatives</b> until death, and those who ceased <b>laxatives</b> at distinct time points. However, differences were found between those who were commenced on an end-of-life care pathway (mean 4. 30 days; SD 3. 84) and those who were not(mean 2. 50 days; SD 2. 31) (P= 0. 01). Conclusions: The correct timing for cessation of <b>laxatives</b> as death approaches remains unclear. Further work is needed to understand how bowel function changes with disease progression and the subjective experiences of patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of <b>laxatives,</b> behavioral therapy, and balanced diet is {{the treatment of}} choice for pediatric constipation (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, based on randomized, nonrandomized, controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials). <b>Laxatives</b> are used for disimpaction and maintenance therapy. Trials that compare different <b>laxatives</b> have shown similar effectiveness, although polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLax) may be better tolerated (SOR: B). The roles of dietary changes and acupuncture have been minimally studied...|$|R
5|$|In 1921, Kimball {{began work}} at the Thatcher branch of the Arizona Trust and Savings Bank, where he was {{eventually}} promoted to assistant cashier at $225 per month, a high salary at the time. The bank failed in 1923, {{in the aftermath of}} the Depression of 1920–21; Kimball lost his $3000 investments in bank stock and was forced to take a lower-paying job at another bank. Kimball also performed a variety of other local jobs to earn extra income to support his wife and children, including playing the piano and singing at local events, stringing with Camilla for local newspapers, distributing for an herbal <b>laxative</b> company, and clerical work for local stores.|$|E
5|$|When old enough, Brunt was {{enrolled}} at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, {{while in the}} sanatorium with mumps, he slipped a <b>laxative</b> into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It was {{while he was at}} Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's knee in the process.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a <b>laxative.</b> He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>laxatives</b> for constipation in those receiving palliative care is unclear, {{as it has}} not been sufficiently studied. The comparative {{effectiveness of}} different <b>laxatives</b> in this group also is unclear as of 2015.|$|R
50|$|A {{patient who}} {{has not had a}} bowel {{movement}} in several days is often given <b>laxatives.</b> Patients who independently toilet themselves often do not report bowel movements, thereby leading them to get <b>laxatives</b> when they do not need them.|$|R
50|$|Lubricant <b>laxatives</b> are {{substances}} that coat the stool with slippery lipids and retard colonic absorption of water {{so that the}} stool slides through the colon more easily. Lubricant <b>laxatives</b> also increase the weight of stool and decrease intestinal transit time.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a <b>laxative,</b> and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a <b>laxative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of <b>laxative</b> effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity, and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E

Although opioids offer potent analgesia for severe acute and chronic noncancer pain, adverse gastrointestinal effects potentially undermine their clinical utility. In particular, between 40 % and 95 % of patients develop opioid-induced constipation (OIC). There-fore, there is a consensus that patients should commence <b>laxatives</b> {{at the start of}} opioid therapy and continue throughout treatment. Nevertheless, <b>laxatives</b> are not routinely coprescribed with opioids.

40|$|Phenolphthalein, {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in many <b>laxatives,</b> was recently {{found to be a}} carcinogen in animal models. Human data suggest a laxative-colon cancer association, but few data specifically address the effects of phenolthalein-containing <b>laxatives.</b> We examined use of phenolphtalein-containing <b>laxatives</b> in relation to occurrence of adenomatous colorectal polyps in data from three case-control studies. The study conducted in Los Angeles, California (1991 - 1993), and the two studies conducted in North Carolina (1988 - 1990 and 1992 - 1995) altogether included 866 cases and 1, 066 controls. The prevalence of using phenolphthalein-containing <b>laxatives</b> {{at least once a week}} in the recent past, however, was less than 5 % among these subjects. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios associated with recent use of phenolphthalein-containing <b>laxatives</b> once a week or more were 1. 8 - 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 5 - 6. 2] in Los Angeles, 1. 0 (CI, 0. 4 - 2. 2) in North Carolina (1988 - 1990), and 1. 1 (CI, 0. 2 - 5. 7) in North Carolina (1992 - 1995). For use of other types of <b>laxatives,</b> the corresponding odds ratios were 1. 3 (CI, 0. 9 - 1. 9) in Los Angeles, 1. 0 (CI, 0. 5 - 1. 7) in North Carolina (1988 - 1990), and 0. 9 (CI, 0. 4 - 1. 8) in North Carolina (1992 - 1995). Although the low prevalence of frequent use made for relatively wide confidence intervals, overall these data suggest that use of phenolphthalein-containing <b>laxatives</b> does not increase risk of adenomatous colorectal polyps...|$|R
5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a <b>laxative</b> to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put <b>laxative</b> pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

40|$|On {{the therapy}} of constipation, {{there are few}} reports that {{surveyed}} the actual circumstance of patients taking <b>laxatives</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} the drug. In this study, we investigated the contents in prescription, the actual conditions of administration of <b>laxatives,</b> and the subjective symptoms of inpatients in all wards of Kanazawa University hospital (2000. 12. 1 - 2000. 12. 10). As a result of the investigation, the percentage of patients prescribed some <b>laxatives</b> was found to be about 31. 5 % (274) of all hospitalized patients (871), and among them about 16 % (43) of the patients had some problems in defecation control. One of the causes leading to the problems for some patients (11) among them seemed to be due to the lesser amount of magnesium oxide taken per day. Then, in the ophthalmology ward we further investigated the proper use of <b>laxatives</b> and the defecation condition of the patient using a questionnaire paper and a record paper (20 cases). Patients became constipated by hospitalization, and although being administered some <b>laxatives,</b> they were often insufficient to control the defecation. Some patients (7) with changeable defecation control could be improved by change or addition of prescription. Pharmacist concerned 5 cases of patients with change or addition of prescription.
