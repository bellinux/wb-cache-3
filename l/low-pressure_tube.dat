Presently, the major community of PV industries uses a p-type silicon solar cell as the starting material. In this work too, boron doped silicon wafers are considered to form solar cells. Likewise, phosphorus oxy-chloride (POCl 3) {{is used as a}} precursor for phosphorus diffusion. To do this, we evaluate the throughput of an industrial low-pressure diffusion tube furnace in order to realize uniform emitters. The <b>low-pressure</b> <b>tube</b> furnace is designed to obtain emitter standard sheet resistances of about 60 Ω/sq and wafer uniformity less than 3 %. An up-to-date control model using {{for the first time a}} CFD numerical code has been derived from some previous work, to achieve better wafer to wafer temperature distribution. Moreover, a numerical process was built using an Atlas-Silvaco® TCAD Simulation Package where we can demonstrate that the short circuit current density (Isc) increases from 4. 97 to 6. 53 mA/cm 2 compared to the conventional photovoltaic process. This (Isc) enhancement can be attributed to the strong temperature effect on furnace atmosphere. Our result proves that we can target electrical properties of an emitter only by the manipulation and optimization of the doping profile. This process refinement is expected to contribute in the development of high efficiency conventional crystalline silicon solar cells considered for mass production...|$|E

40|$|Direct tracheoscopy was {{employed}} to assess tracheal damage following prolonged intubation. Comparison of conventional and low-pressure cuffs showed that there was less trauma from the low-pressure cuff. Comparison of tube sizes showed a reduction in injury with 8 -mm diameter tubes compared with larger ones. Knowledge of tracheal damage following prolonged endotracheal intubation has depended hitherto upon analysis of retrospective evidence, postmortem specimens and animal experimentation. The oppor-tunity was taken to compare the effects of standard cuffed Portex Blue-line tubes with those of low-pressure (floppy) cuffs using a fibreoptic laryngo-scope. The tubes were all made of the same material and had been sterilized with ethylene oxide by the manufacturers. The object {{of the present study}} was to utilize a technique which would enable the observer to visualize the tracheal mucosa at the time of extuba-tion. The patients in this series were undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, and were ventila-ted (IPPV) for an average of 15 hours. All patients returned to the intensive care unit after operation, accurate records of their cardiovascular state and drug administration being available for retrospective analysis.

However, in the concentration profiles, ethylene and water are consistently over-predicted by the current mechanism. Ignition delay times of ethanol and dimethyl ether have been measured in the <b>low-pressure</b> shock <b>tube</b> at NUI, Galway at varying fuel concentrations, equivalence ratios and pressures. Laminar burning velocities of ethanol in air have been measured using the flat-flame burner at the Universite de Lorraine at 358 K and 1. 0 atm. Reactions that influence the ignition delay times of ethanol and dimethyl ether include decomposition and hydrogen-abstraction reactions, while those influencing the laminar burning velocities of ethanol involve the secondary ethanol and acetaldehyde radicals. Diethyl ether has been studied in the <b>low-pressure</b> shock <b>tube</b> at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at pressures of 1. 0 and 3. 5 atm, while burning velocities of diethyl ether in air have been reported at 1. 0 atm and at temperatures from 298 to 398 K. Unimolecular decomposition reactions have been found to affect the ignition delay times of diethyl ether, while hydrogen-abstraction reactions affect both ignition delay times and laminar burning velocities of the fuel. Dimethoxymethane has been investigated in the low- and high-pressure shock tubes at NUI, Galway at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at pressures from 1. 0 to 9. 0 atm. Laminar burning velocities of dimethoxymethane in air have been reported at a pressure of 1. 0 atm and at temperatures from 298 to 358 K. The shock tube ignition delay times of dimethoxymethane at 9. 0 atm have been compared with those obtained in a rapid compression machine, with NTC-like behaviour shown from 850 to 950 K. Ignition delay times of sec-butanol and isobutanol have been measured in the <b>low-pressure</b> shock <b>tube</b> at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at a pressure of 3. 5 atm. Reactions that {{have an effect on the}} ignition delay times of both butanol isomers are decomposition and hydrogen-abstraction reactions. The decomposition of sec-butanol produces ethyl and secondary ethanol radicals, while that of isobutanol produces isopropyl and methoxy radicals and water and isobutene. Isopentanol in air has been investigated in the high-pressure shock tube at various equivalence ratios and at pressures of 7. 0 and 20. 0 atm. Hydrogen-abstraction reactions have been found to influence the ignition delay times of isopentanol at the conditions studied. The seven liquid isomers of pentanol in air have been studied in the flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 358 K. 1 -Pentanol has been found to be the most reactive isomer and 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol the least. Laminar burning velocities of 2 -methylfuran in air have been measured in the flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures from 298 to 388 K, while those of 2, 5 -dimethylfuran in air have been measured in the same facility at the same pressure and at temperatures of 298 and 358 K. Reactions involving the parent fuel molecules have been found to greatly affect the laminar burning velocities, with hydrogen abstraction from the methyl groups and decomposition of the fuel being the most significant. 2016 - 03 - 1...|$|R
40|$|The University of Queensland (UQ) is {{currently}} developing high Mach number, high total pressure scramjet flow conditions in its X 2 and X 3 expansion tube facilities.

We developed a thin-walled ETT cuff made of Lycra polyurethane. METHODS: In vitro, we tested 6 {{of each of the}} new prototype Lycra cuff, the Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo ETT (polyvinyl chloride cuff), and the Kimberly-Clark Micro-cuff ETT (polyurethane cuff), for leakage, in an acrylic mock trachea (inner diameter 20 -mm), with a cuff inflation pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. We poured 15 mL of methylene-blue colored water into the acrylic tube above the cuff and observed for leakage for 24 hours. RESULTS: The Lycra cuffs had no folds upon inflation in the mock trachea and completely prevented fluid leakage for 24 hours (P<. 001 vs the Hi-Lo and the Microcuff). The average leakage past the Hi-Lo was 1, 1821, 321 mL/h. The average leakage past the Microcuff was 1. 2 0. 4 mL/h (P <. 001 vs the Hi-Lo).

30|$|The {{tracheal}} tube prevents closure of vocal cords, and represents an access for bacteria to {{progress in the}} trachea through the folds of high-volume <b>low-pressure</b> tracheal <b>tubes</b> into the lower respiratory tract [7]. Underinflation of the tracheal cuff under 20 cmH 2 O results in microaspiration, and was identified as an independent risk factor for VAP [10]. However, this cut-off is based on one single center study including few patients. Therefore, microaspiration could probably occur at highest or lowest levels of cuff pressure. Mechanical ventilation {{plays an important role}} in microaspiration, and cuff pressure is tightly correlated with airway pressure [11]. The application of a positive end expiratory pressure was identified as protective from microaspiration and VAP [12, 13]. Tracheal suctioning could be associated with higher risk for microaspiration, because of negative pressure applied during this procedure. It has been demonstrated that leakage rate around the cuff depends on the difference in pressure between the two areas above and below the cuff [14]. A recent study was conducted in 25 intubated critically ill patients to determine the impact of tracheal suctioning on leakage of blue dye, diagnosed using fiberoptic bronchoscopy [15]. Whilst blue dye was observed in the folds within the cuff wall in a larger number of patients before compared with after suctioning, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P[*]=[*] 0.063).|$|R

30|$|Most {{currently}} used cuffs are high-volume low-pressure. Several in vitro and animal {{studies showed that}} these cuffs require lower pressure to obtain sealing, and were associated with reduced ischemic tracheal lesions [39, 45]. Honeybourne and colleagues [46] performed a randomized controlled study in 28 patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for 24  hours. Patients were randomized to be intubated with a high-volume low-pressure or a low-volume high-pressure cuff. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed {{at the time of}} extubation to evaluate ischemic lesions based on a score including edema, inflammation, and ulceration. The authors reported significantly lower incidence of ischemic tracheal lesions in patients intubated with high-volume <b>low-pressure</b> cuffed <b>tubes</b> compared with those intubated with low-volume high-pressure cuffed tubes. However, several studies have shown that even when tracheal cuff pressure is adjusted below 30 cmH 2 O, ischemic tracheal lesions could still occur in patients intubated with high-volume low-pressure cuffs [47, 48]. One potential explanation is that manual control of cuff pressure is not accurate. In addition, the target of[*]<[*] 30 cmH 2 O might be inappropriate in critically ill patients, since these lesions could be seen at lowest cuff pressure level, especially in patients with shock or hypoxemia. To obtain optimal sealing with high-volume low-pressure cuffs, they should be inflated to obtain a volume above tracheal diameter. As a consequence, channels occur between the polyvinylchloride (PVC) cuff and tracheal wall, resulting in microaspiration of contaminated secretions above the cuff into the lower respiratory tract.|$|R

The coefficient of variance was largest for the microchip sensor probe technique with lubrication (29 %) and without lubrication (214 %), and was lower for the wall pressure membrane technique (22 %) and the pressure difference technique (19 %). The wall pressure membrane and pressure difference techniques provided comparable results. The microchip sensor probe technique considerably underestimated wall pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: By {{contrast}} to typical high-temperature (100 − 250 °C) telo-/polymerizations of gaseous fluori-nated monomers, {{carried out in}} high-pressure metal reactors, the visible light, Mn 2 (CO) 10 -photomediated initiation of vinylidene fluoride (bp = − 83 °C) polymer-ization occurs readily {{from a variety of}} alkyl, semi-fluorinated, and perfluorinated halides at 40 °C, in <b>low-pressure</b> glass <b>tubes</b> and in a variety of solvents, including water and alkyl carbonates. Perfluorinated alkyl iodide initiators also induce a controlled radical polymerization via iodine degenerative transfer (IDT). While IDT proceeds with accumulation of the less reactive Pm-CF 2 -CH 2 -I vs the Pn-CH 2 -CF 2 -I chain ends, Mn 2 (CO) 10 enables their subsequent quantitative activation toward the synthesis of well-defined poly(vinylidene fluoride) block copolymers with a variety of other monomers.

A beam of electrons, produced by a hot filament, is bent in circles by the nearly uniform magnetic field on the midplane of a pair of Helmholtz coils outside the tube, as seen in Figure 1.

The effects of changing the electron energy and changing the magnetic field are studied in the video. For the case where the electrons move perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field, the centripetal force F c required for the electrons to move in circular orbits is provided by the magnetic force F m on the electrons- where m is the mass of the electron, q is the charge on the electron, v is the velocity of the electron, and B is the value of the uniform magnetic field. From this we can determine the ratio of charge to mass for the electron- This apparatus is commonly used for this determination by measuring (or calculating from the current and geometry of the coils) the magnetic field B and the orbit radius r, and calculating the value of the velocity from the kinetic energy of the electron, which is determined by the accelerating potential...|$|R

As {{a result of the}} absolute and relative measurements, the overall rate coefficients, k 1 = (3. 0 ± 0. 5) × 10 – 11 exp((515 ± 50) /T) and k 2 = (2. 5 ± 0. 6) × 10 – 11 exp((575 ± 60) /T) cm 3 molecule– 1 s– 1, were determined at a pressure of 1 Torr of helium over the temperature ranges 220 – 360 and 233 – 353 K, respectively. k 1 was found to be pressure independent over the range 0. 5 – 5 Torr. There are two possible pathways for the reaction between OH (OD) and limonene: addition of the radical to one of the limonene double bonds (reactions 1 a and 2 a) and abstraction of a hydrogen atom (reactions 1 b and 2 b), resulting in the formation of H 2 O (HOD).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{laboratory studies}} of the kinetics of some reactions of atmospheric significance. The species of interest were Cl atoms, IO radicals and several organic compounds. In particular, the chemistry of acetone and the acetonylperoxy radical was investigated. These species are of importance in the troposphere and the stratosphere, where they may influence the concentrations of HO x, NO x and O 3. The experiments were performed using <b>low-pressure</b> discharge-flow <b>tubes</b> coupled {{to a variety of}} detection techniques, including conventional methods such as resonance fluorescence (RF) and electron-impact mass spectrometry (EEVIS). However, much of the thesis is concerned with the development of techniques that offer a greater sensitivity and selectivity, namely, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and chemical-ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). The reactions of Cl atoms with acetone and butanone were monitored with Cl RF. The study of the former reaction was extended in order to obtain information about the chemistry of the acetonylperoxy radical. IO was observed with LIF. This work involved the first reported coupling of IO LIF to a discharge-flow tube. The system was shown to be a suitable method by which to study reactions of IO. The results of these investigations demonstrate that reaction with Cl and IO may be an important sink for several organic compounds in the marine boundary layer. The design, construction and commissioning of the EIMS system is described. The apparatus was used in an attempt to follow the self-reaction of the acetonylperoxy radical by monitoring the products. The complications that arose during the study illustrated the need for a more versatile form of MS. It was decided to convert the instrument to a CMS system that would allow direct observation of the peroxy radical. The construction of two ion sources, one employing a cartridge of polonium- 210 and the other a simple discharge, as well as an electrostatic ion guide, is described. The discharge source was shown to be better suited to the low-pressure conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|An inviscid, {{analytical}} model is provided for shocktube performance {{when there is}} a large, abrupt contraction in the low-pressure side of a tube. The analysis is independent of initial high-pressure side conditions. Only the ratio of specific heats of the low-pressure gas, the large-diameter tube’s incident shock Mach number, and the contraction ratio are needed for a nondimensional solution of the transmitted flow in the small-diameter tube. This solution is unique, readily evaluated, and various limits and constraints are discussed. Parametric calculations establish the increased magnitude of the transmitted shock Mach number relative to the shock Mach number for a tube without contraction. The Mach number increase, then increases the pressure and temperature downstream of the small-diameter tube’s incident and reflected shocks, again relative to a tube without a contraction. Shock-tube performance, therefore, can be improved by the addition of a small-diameter tube to an existing <b>tube’s</b> <b>low-pressure</b> side. The improvement can be used with a combustion-driven tube, a free-piston tube, etc. Nomenclature A = cross-sectional area a = speed of sound J+ = C+ Riemann invariant M = Mach number p = pressure R = gas constant R ̄ = universal gas constant s = entropy T = temperature W = molecular weight w = flow spee...|$|R
