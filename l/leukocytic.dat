50|$|Non-obese {{diabetic}} or NOD mice, {{like the}} Biobreeding rat, {{are used as}} an animal model for type 1 diabetes. Diabetes develops in NOD mice {{as a result of}} insulitis, a <b>leukocytic</b> infiltrate of the pancreatic islets. Onset of diabetes is associated with a moderate glycosuria and a non-fasting hyperglycemia. It is recommended to monitor for development of glycosuria from 10 weeks of age; this can be carried out using urine glucose dipsticks. NOD mice will develop spontaneous diabetes when left in a sterile environment. The incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse is 60-80% in females and 20-30% in males. Onset of diabetes also varies between males and females: commonly, onset is delayed in males by several weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Insulitis is an {{inflammation}} of the islets of Langerhans, a collection of endocrine tissue located in the pancreas. [...] The islets containing the pancreatic β-cells, and in some cases, the exocrine tissues, become infiltrated by T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. This innate immune cell and lymphocyte infiltration can result in destruction of the insulin producing beta cells of the islets, and clinical diabetes. Insulitis is often studied in the multiple low dose streptozotocin (MLDS) mouse model or the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes. The chemokine family of proteins may {{play a key role}} in promoting <b>leukocytic</b> infiltration into the pancreas prior to pancreatic beta-cell destruction.|$|E
50|$|Microsporum canis {{is among}} the most common {{dermatophytes}} associated with tinea capitis and tinea corporis. Unlike some dermatophyte species, M. canis typically does not cause large epidemics. Humans become infected as a result of direct or indirect contact with infected pets. Microsporum canis generally invades hair and skin; however, some nail infections have been reported. When hair shafts are infected, M. canis causes an ectothrix-type infection where the fungus envelopes the exterior of the hair shaft without the formation of internal spores. This colonization of the hair shaft causes it to become unsheathed, resulting in characteristic round or oval non-inflammatory lesions the develop on the scalp. Infection triggers an acute <b>leukocytic</b> reaction in subcutaneous tissues, which gradually becomes highly inflammatory and leads to hair loss, in the case of tinea capitis.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis is by {{complete}} {{blood count}} (CBC). However, in some cases, a more accurate absolute eosinophil count may be needed. Medical history is taken, with emphasis on travel, allergies and drug use. Specific test for causative conditions are performed, often including chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver and kidney function tests, and serologic tests for parasitic and connective tissue diseases. The stool is often examined for traces of parasites (i.e. eggs, larvae, etc.) though a negative test does not rule out parasitic infection; for example, trichinosis requires a muscle biopsy. Elevated serum B12 or low white blood cell alkaline phosphatase, or <b>leukocytic</b> abnormalities in a peripheral smear indicates a disorder of myeloproliferation. In cases of idiopathic eosinophilia, the patient is followed for complications. A brief trial of corticosteroids can be diagnostic for allergic causes, as the eosinophilia should resolve with suppression of the immune over-response. Neoplastic disorders are diagnosed through the usual methods, such as bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for the leukemias, MRI/CT to look for solid tumors, and tests for serum LDH and other tumor markers.|$|E
5000|$|Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are {{a type of}} cell {{belonging}} to the macrophage lineage. They are found in close proximity or within tumor masses. TAMs are derived from circulating monocytes or resident tissue macrophages, which form the major <b>leukocytic</b> infiltrate found within the stroma of many tumor types. The function of TAMs is controversial as there is growing evidence for their involvement in both pro-tumor (e.g. promotion of growth and metastasis through tumor angiogenesis) as well as anti-tumor (tumoricidal and tumorostatic) processes. TAMs interact {{with a wide range}} of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines in the tumor microenvironment which is thought to educate the TAMs and determine their specific phenotype and hence functional role as the microenvironment varies between different types of tumors. TAMs have therefore been shown to differ in their roles depending on the type of tumor with which they are associated. [...] In many tumor types TAM infiltration level has been shown to be of significant prognostic value. TAMs have been linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, types of glioma and lymphoma; better prognosis in colon and stomach cancers and both poor and better prognoses in lung and prostate cancers.|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{metabolic}} sequelae to infection and inflammation, such as fever, trace mineral redistribution, skeletal muscle catabolism, and the acute-phase protein response, are mediated by <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen (interleukin 1). In the anterior hypothalamus and in skeletal muscles <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen appears to induce {{the synthesis of}} prostaglandin E 2 which mediates fever and skeletal protein catabolism. It is unclear whether any additional metabolic responses to <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen result from prostaglandin production. This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of ibuprofen, a specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to alter protein and trace metal responses to <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen or endotoxin when given in quantities sufficient to block the febrile response. In guinea pigs given continuous infusions of <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen or endotoxin, a 0. 6 to 0. 8 degrees C fever was observed within 4 h, and zinc and iron concentrations in serum fell by 63 to 78 % (P less than 0. 01). Rates of whole body amino acid appearance, oxidation, and incorporation into protein were all significantly increased by <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen and endotoxin treatment, (P less than 0. 05) as were the fractional hepatic and seromucoid protein synthesis rates in <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen-treated animals (P less than 0. 01). Muscle protein synthesis was unchanged. Although pretreatment with infusions of ibuprofen completely ablated the febrile response to <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen and endotoxin, decreases in zinc and iron concentrations in serum and leukocytosis were unaffected. Overall increases in whole body amino acid kinetics induced by <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen or endotoxin were only minimally affected by ibuprofen. We concluded that treatment with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor ibuprofen did not affect whole body trace metal, hematological, or hepatic acute-phase-induced responses to <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen or endotoxin, either because these responses are prostanoid independent or because they are only partially mediated by eicosanoid products...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that {{the interaction of}} exogenous pyrogens, such as bacteria or bacterial products, with host phagocytic cells, activates these cells to release a protein which stimulates the hypothalamus and results in fever (1).

Although it has not been convincingly demonstrated in vivo in human beings, <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen can readily be produced in vitro from human blood leukocytes (2, 3). It is known that, in addition to being a protein, this pyrogen has a mol wt of approximately 13, 000 (4).

40|$|Studies of corneal explants in the hamster {{cheek pouch}} chamber have {{demonstrated}} that blood vessels invade the cornea only if the tissue is first infiltrated by leukocytes. In view of this observation, a comparative study {{of the events that}} precede and accompany corneal vascularization was undertaken in various experimental models. A variety of established methods were used to induce corneal vascularization, including exposure of the cornea to noxious agents, intracorneal injection of antigens into sensitized animals, as well as maintaining animals on diets deficient in vitamin A or riboflavin. In all models studied, the corneal vascularization was a manifestation of the reparative phase of the inflammatory response. A conspicuous <b>leukocytic</b> infiltrate of the cornea preceded and accompanied the corneal vascularization in all of the models. Although the lesions varied in several respects in the different models, all models displayed three phases with regard to vascularization: an early prevascular phase of <b>leukocytic</b> infiltration, a second phase where blood vessels persisted in the cornea in the absence of leukocytes. The latent period that preceded vascularization was directly related to the time of the initial <b>leukocytic</b> infiltration. The models in which a delay occurred in the <b>leukocytic</b> invasion displayed a subsequent delay in the vascular ingrowth.

The extent to which HCMV DNA, detected by PCR, was present in plasma correlated with increased levels ofHCMV <b>leukocytic</b> antigenemia for six of the eight AIDS patients and for all the organ transplant recipients. Positivity for HCMV DNA in PCR and for viremia in cell culture was usually restricted to the highest antigenemia levels.

This result suggests that interferon may cause fever by a novel mechanism not dependent on <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen. Key words: alpha-interferon, human <b>leukocytic</b> pyrogen, interferon fever ThTRODUCT 1 ON Interferon (IFN) is presently undergoing extensive clinical trials to assess its efficacy in the treatment of cancer and viral diseases [1]. A consistent finding has been the occurrence of fever in recipients of either natural or recombinant interferon in doses as low as 2 x i 04 U/kg {{even in the absence of}} significant endotoxin contamination [1 - 3]. This phenomenon is of interest for several reasons. First, with associated symptoms, it represents clinical toxicity and is of medical concern. Second, despite the term “interferon fever ” sometimes given to the phenomenon, the role of interferon per se in its production is still not known. Partially pure natural interferon is a complex mixture, while recombinant interferon, although homogeneous in protein composition, has not heretofore been shown to be free of trace amounts of potent nonendotoxin pyrogens such as peptidoglycan [4] or peptidoglycan-derived products [5]. Third, if fever is in fact attributable to interferon, it is important to determine the relationship between this activity and IFN’s other immunomodulatory roles [1]. ...|$|E

Western blot (immunoblot) analysis indicated that treatment of the zinc-induced 1 B 2 cells with either PMN <b>leukocytic</b> or pancreatic elastase resulted in the release of the mature TGF alpha polypeptide. The released TGF alpha was bioactive, as it was capable of both competing with epidermal growth factor for binding to its receptor and stimulating [3 H]thymidine incorporation in the mitogenic assay.
