40|$|Much {{academic}} {{development work}} that is framed by academic literacies, especially that focused on writing, is concerned with disciplinary conventions and knowledges: conceptual, practical, and procedural. This paper argues, however, that academic <b>literacies</b> <b>work</b> tends to conflate literacy practices with disciplinary knowledge structures, thus obscuring the structures from which these practices emanate. This paper demonstrates how theoretical and analytical tools for conceptualizing disciplinary knowledge structures can connect these with academic <b>literacies</b> development <b>work.</b> Using recent studies that combine academic literacies and theories of knowledge in novel ways, this paper will show that understanding the knowledge structures of different disciplines can enable academic developers to build a stronger body of practice.

40|$|Examining the way low health {{literacy}} effects Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s multicultural communities, this report {{looks at the}} available resources, those that are still required and best practice strategies for enhanced {{health literacy}}. • In 2011, the Ethnic Communities 2 ̆ 7 Council of Victoria (ECCV) Health Policy Subcommittee was made aware of increasing concern, emerging from health service providers, regarding the often very low levels of health literacy present within CALD communities. After much discussion around the reasons why {{this may be the}} case and the impacts this may have, the ECCV Health Policy Subcommittee established the ECCV Health <b>Literacy</b> <b>Working</b> Group. This document is the outcome of the work and consultation undertaken by the ECCV Health <b>Literacy</b> <b>Working</b> Group. This paper aims to provide information and recommendations to the Victorian government, with a view to ensuring that the needs of CALD Victorians are considered in future policies and projects aimed at improving health literacy. Low health literacy is a nation-wide problem and it is extremely costly to all Australians, both in the burden it brings to bear on our healthcare systems and in terms of human costs, such as reduced quality of life for the many Australians who could, potentially, be healthier. For CALD Victorians, the problem of low-health literacy needs to be tackled via targeted strategies and resources, as {{this is the only way}} to overcome exacerbating factors such as language and literacy barriers, differing cultural perceptions of health, culturally unresponsive services and the lifestyle upheavals that can accompany migration and settlement. For the purposes of this paper the key issues identified have been divided into the following four core areas: Health literacy in the current policy context Language, literacy and health literacy Culture and health literacy Community capacity building for improved health literac...|$|R

40|$|The work of Humanities & Social Sciences {{students}} involves {{learning to}} express disciplinary content in essay assessment to disciplinary norms. Though tutors use a genre for professional writing, literacy {{is often not}} part of the classroom discussion. Therefore, many students have difficulty appropriating the communicative tools of that disciplinary genre. This may be solved by a turn in pedagogy towards tutors’ awareness of students’ processes (Hornsby & Osman, 2014) which may, in turn, improve tutors’ feedback. Ethnography has provided insights into students’ attitudes, their impressions of feedback and experiences, largely through interview methods, and classroom observation (Saville-Troike, 1989), but assessment writing does not typically occur in class. What was needed was a closer examination of students’ literacy processes. This study looked at <b>literacy</b> <b>work</b> through Activity Theory (Leont’ev, 1978) which represents human activity as a contextualised system where a group works together towards an object. Group collaboration allows for concepts to be negotiated and for interpretations to be shared, which can aid understanding (Mercer, 1995). This cross-sectional study examined three L 2 -English Business Studies student groups’ collaborative writing with observation of activity as its primary instrument for capturing student <b>literacy</b> <b>work.</b> Using an Educational Talk framework (Mercer, 1995) to examine the qualities of negotiation, this study offers a new understanding of students’ processes of <b>literacy</b> <b>work</b> and their possible effect on literacy appropriation. The results showed how the task and other structural tensions drive <b>literacy</b> <b>work,</b> and how the particular attributes of Educational Talk, in a tertiary context, contribute to the negotiation of meaning in the resolution of tensions. It also showed how <b>literacy</b> <b>work</b> involves the inter-mingling of textual work, subject content (Tardy, 2006, 2009) and contextual factors. These indicate the importance of group literacy activity for students, and the importance of understanding group discussions involving <b>literacy</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E
