40|$|International audienceIn this paper, in a {{development}} of the static theory derived by Steigmann and Ogden (Proc. Roy. Soc. London A 453 (1997) 853), we establish the equations of motion for a non-linearly elastic body in plane strain with an elastic surface coating on part or all of its boundary. The equations of (linearized) incremental motions superposed on a finite static deformation are then obtained and applied {{to the problem of}} (time-harmonic) surface wave propagation on a pre-stressed incompressible isotropic elastic half-space with a thin coating on its plane boundary. The secular equation for (dispersive) wave speeds is then obtained in respect of a general form of incompressible isotropic elastic strain-energy function for the bulk material and a general energy function for the coating material. Specialization of the form of strain-energy function enables the secular equation to be cast as a quartic equation and we therefore focus on this for illustrative purposes. An explicit form for the secular equation is thereby obtained. This involves a number of material parameters, including residual stress and moment in the properties of the coating. It is shown how this equation relates to previous work on waves in a half-space with an overlying thin <b>layer</b> <b>set</b> in the classical theory of isotropic elasticity and, in particular, the significant effect of omission of the rotatory inertia term, even at small wave numbers, is emphasized. Corresponding results for a membrane-type coating, for which the bending moment, inertia and residual moment terms are absent, are also obtained. Asymptotic formulas for the wave speed at large wave number (high frequency) are derived and it is shown how these results influence the character of the wave speed throughout the range of wave number values. A bifurcation criterion is obtained from the secular equation by setting the wave speed to zero, thereby generalizing the bifurcation results of Steigmann and Ogden (Proc. Roy. Soc. London A 453 (1997) 853) to the situation in which residual stress and moment are present in the coating. Numerical results which show the dependence of the wave speed on the various material parameters and the finite deformation are then described graphically. In particular, features which differ from those arising in the classical theory are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Contact {{mechanical}} {{study of}} layered structures {{is useful to}} various fields of engineering, such as - mechanical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering and biomechanics. Thin hard film coating on a compliant substrate used in cutting tool industry {{is an example of}} a layered structure. The protective coating saves the substrate from fracture and wear. However, due to film material brittleness, fracture in the films is of concern. We have developed an analytical model for a film-substrate bilayer system under normal contact loading, which helps us to obtain the stress distribution in the film and fracture behaviour. Our contact model is based on Hankel’s Transform technique, where we assume a Hertzian pressure boundary condition. At each depth of penetration of the indenter in the film-substrate system, we estimate effective modulus of the system based on Gao’s approach. We have validated our analysis by surface strain measurements and photoelastic stress study in the film on a substrate. Experimental observations from literatures show the dependence of different fracture modes in a thin hard film with columnar structure on film thickness and substrate plasticity. We perform fracture analysis, a parametric study of the fracture modes in the film under contact loading. When the film thickness is small and the substrate is relatively hard (e. g. tool steel), the film and the substrate deform conformally under contact loading and the columns of TiN slide against each other into the substrate. On the other hand, when the film is thicker and the substrate is soft (e. g. mild steel or aluminium), the strain mismatch between the film and substrate acts as an added traction at the interface and drives cracks, such as radial tensile stress driven bending cracks that start from the interface at the center of indentation; maximum shear stress driven inclined shear crack that starts inside the film and propagate at an angle to the indentation axis and tensile stress driven edge crack that starts from the free surface outside the contact. We can draw a fracture map based on these calculations which provides a guide to select film thickness depending on the substrate hardness, so that the benign mode of damage, i. e., columnar shear occurs in the film. Apart from generating the fracture map, we can obtain rationale for different fracture phenomenon in the film by studying the indentation stress field. Principal tensile stresses, responsible for driving edge cracks from the free surface outside the contact, become compressive as one approaches the substrate if the substrate is compliant. The cracks therefore do not penetrate deep into the film rather curve away from the axis of indentation. At the transition zone from one mode of damage to other in the fracture map, different modes of fracture may co-exist. The whole column may not shear, rather the shear can start from somewhere in the middle of the film, where the shear stress is maximum and it can end without reaching the interface. The indentation energy is then dissipated in other forms of damage. The contact analysis is further applied to TiN /AlTiN multilayered films having similar elastic properties. Experimental observations suggest that with decreasing layer thickness the fracture resistance of the multilayers increase and some plastic yielding occurs at the top layers of the film. However no substantial change in strain capacity (Hardness/ Young’s Modulus) of the film is observed. Hence we attribute the increase of fracture resistance of multilayers to film plasticity and mimic it by reducing the modulus of the film. The analysis validates the propensity of edge cracking and transgranular cracking as they decrease with increasing number of layers in a multilayer. We next extend our bilayer analysis to a more general trilayer problem where the moduli of the layers vary by several orders. The test system here is a mica-glue-glass system which is used in surface force apparatus experiments. Gao’s trilayer analysis is used to fit the experimental data obtained from surface force apparatus experiments, where a glass sphere indents the trilayer. The parallel spring model used in Gao’s approximation is found to be inadequate to rationalize the experimental data. We have modified Gao’s formulations by reducing the problem to a bilayer problem where the layers are the first layer (in contact) and an equivalent layer which has properties determined by a rule of mixture of the properties of all the layers excluding the top <b>layer</b> <b>set</b> out as a set of springs in series. The modified formulations give a better fit to the experimental data and it is validated from nanoindentation experiments on the same system. The formulation is used to obtain the compression of the glue, which contributes significantly to the deformation of the trilayer system in the SFA experiments. Thus, the analysis can be used to deconvolute the influence of glue in the actual mechanical response of the system in an SFA experiment, which has so far been neglected...|$|E

40|$|Complexity “ {{is for us}} a very ambigous notion. It may be {{understood}} in two contexts. 1. Thorough solution of a problem. Complexity means full recognition of design area, followed by appropriate work. That work must be thorough and interdisciplinary – if necessary, separated to different co-operatives. These trade designers reqiure a branch coordination and – the most important- all of them must have a „common denominator”. Such as a proper CAAD platform and office standards. That will reduce costs of changes, improve an interplay between designers and somtimes enable to face up a new challenge. Nowadays architects are no longer “solitary” individualists working alone – they must concern a team – they become a member, {{a part of a}} huge design machine. “Import/export”, compatibility, interplay – these words must appear and we have to put a stress on them. How to organize work for different trade-designers? How to join in common database architectural design,engineering design, HVAC design, electricity design, technology design, computer network design and all other trades ? [...] . A key to solve this range of problems is in good work organization. Universal prescription does not exist, but some evergreen rules can be observed. We are going to present a scheme of work in CAAD application ALLPLAN FT v. 16 with a Group manager, which starts to conquest polish market and is widely spread in Germany. “Golden rules” of ALLPLAN FT There is one database – it is placed on server. It includes all projects. There is a well-developed office standard. It must be created at the beginning of collaboration, although it is possible to improve it later. It consist of hatches, fonts, symbols, macros, materials, pen-widths, and – the most important –layers. A <b>layer</b> <b>set</b> – predefined structure divided into functional groups – e. g. drafting, text, dimensioning, architecture, HVAC, engineering, urban design, etc. That stucture is a part of an office standard – all workers use a relevant part of it. No name duplicates, no misunderstandings [...] . If however design extends, and a new group of layers is required, it can be easily added, e. g. computer networks, fireguard systems. Administrator of ALLPLAN network defines different users and gives them different permitions of access. For example – an electrician will be able to draft on layer “electricity”, but he won’t modify anything at layer “architecture – walls”, and he won’t even see a layer “engineering- slabs”, because he doesn’t need it [...] At the same time our electrician will be able to see, how architect moves some walls and how HVAC moved and started to cross with his wires. Every user is able to see relevant changes, after they are saved by author. Two different users can not access {{at the same time the}} same file. That excludes inconsistent or overlapping changes. All users operate on a 3 D model. While putting some data into a model, they must remember about a “Z” coordinate at work-storey. But at the same time all create a fully-integrated, synchronous database, which can be used later for bills of quantities, specifications, and – of course – for visuaisation. That method can be described as “model-centric”. To simplify complex structure of architectural object -ALLPLAN offers files. Usually one file means one storey, but at special designs it might become a functional part of a storey, or whatever you wish. Files connected with layers easy enable to separate certain structural elements, e. g. if we want to glance only at concrete slabs and columns in the building – we will turn on all files with “layer filter” – “slabs” and “columns”. ALLPLAN is of course one of possible solutions. We described it, because we use it in our workshop. It seems to be stretchy enough to face up every demand and ever-increasing complexity of current projects. The essence of the matter, however, is not a name or version of application – it is a set of features, we mentioned above, which allows to deal with EVERY project. The number of solutions is infinite. 2. Increasing difficulties during design process. It may be associated with more and more installations inside of new buildings, especially some “high-tech” examples. The number of these installations increases as well as their complexity. Now buildings are full of sensors, video-screens, computer networks, safety-guard systems [...] . Difficulties are connected with some trends in contemporary architecture, for example an organic architecture, which conceives “morphed” shapes, “moving” surfaces, “soft” solids. This direction is specially supported by modelling or CAD applications. Sometimes it is good – they allow to realize all imaginations, but often they lead to produce “unbuildable” forms, which can exist only in virtual world. Obstacles appear, when we design huge cubatures with “dense” functional scheme. Multi-purposed objects, exhibition halls, olimpic stadium at Sydney – all of them have to be stretchy, even if it requires sliding thousands pound concrete blocks! Requirements were never so high. The last reason, why designs become so complex is obvious - intensifying changes due to specific requirements of clients/developers. We could say “ signum tempori” – everything gets more and more complicated, people have to become specialists, to face up new technology. But how CAAD can help us with it? How?! We have already answered that question. Sometimes CAAD is the only way to imagine and sketch something, to visualize something, to compute a construction, to prepare a simulation [...] . So that human must “only” interprete ready solutions. Sometimes CAAD help us to notify a problem. It works exactly in the same way, as spy-glasses does. For example – without a real-time visualization we we would have never realised (until finished!) some strange interference of solids, which have occured in the upper roof part of our new appartment-house. ConclusionsTemporary CAAD is an integral part of design process – not only as a tool, but sometimes as an inspiration. It helps to organize our work, to define problems, to filter relevant elements and to render our visions. It becomes an integral part of our senses – and that will be a real complexity in architecture [...] ...|$|E
