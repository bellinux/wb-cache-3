5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter. In particular, {{he felt that the}} two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness <b>list</b> <b>are</b> authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.|$|E

However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the <b>list</b> <b>are</b> charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Of the 71 {{words in}} this list, 67 are nouns, and most would {{generally}} be considered loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U {{and are not}} borrowed from another language are qiana, qwerty, and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this <b>list</b> <b>are</b> considered to be naturalised in English according {{to at least one}} major dictionary (see References), often because they refer to concepts or societal roles that do not have an accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words which occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included.|$|E
