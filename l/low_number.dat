5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2001 census, 96% of the {{population}} was White British, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of employed immigrant workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to other regions of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 census, Brownhills had 5,768 {{people in}} employment, {{of which the}} largest {{percentage}} (28.85%) worked in manufacturing, followed by retail (19.35%) and construction (8.93%). Compared to the national average, the town had a relatively high percentage of workers {{in the construction industry}} and a relatively <b>low</b> <b>number</b> in real estate and financial intermediation. The average distance travelled to work by Brownhills residents was 10.36km; the vast majority (62%) travelled to work by car.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought}} to have been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E

5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} {{mode of transport}} in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and walking (1.3%). The <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to {{the limited number of}} workplaces within walking distance.|$|E
5|$|Fraser {{was engaged}} to design the coin on the {{recommendation}} of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt.

Due to the <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of surviving pieces, the coins are valuable today.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme {{presented}} a new management {{plan that would}} run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of individuals {{can be expected to}} result in inbreeding depression), maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E
30|$|We {{observe that}} the system {{characteristics}} influence {{the performance of the}} strategy. As mentioned before, there is no difference between the strategies for the small systems considering global costs. The only difference was found for GAO, where Incremental+ performs better. Considering the number of stubs and small systems, Incremental+ generated the <b>lowest</b> <b>number</b> in five cases whereas Combined achieved the <b>lowest</b> <b>number</b> in two cases for Health Watcher. In one of these two cases, Combined required a greater number of stubs for aspects, despite having generated the <b>lowest</b> <b>number</b> of stubs.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties. This {{would make the}} storm the most costly of {{the hurricane}} season. Despite the hurricane's wide swath of damage and strong intensity, only eight people were killed. The <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of fatalities is attributable to the extensive evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{non-specific}} {{nature of}} the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires {{a high degree of}} suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, enlarged spleen, fever, <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of platelets in the blood, and higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells. Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.|$|E
5|$|The clutch was {{described}} as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large size, this led to proposals that the solitaire was K-selected, which means it produced a <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed crèches, that may have followed foraging adults {{as part of the}} learning process. A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a <b>low</b> <b>number</b> of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the <b>low</b> <b>number</b> for the BJP.|$|E
