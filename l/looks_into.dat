40|$|As mobile devices {{become more}} common when surfing the web there is an {{increasing}} demand of making web sites adjusted to other devices than computers. One common platform on the web is Microsoft SharePoint. In this report I <b>look</b> <b>into</b> one method of how to develop web sites that work on multiple devices in Microsoft SharePoint. I will be <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> different techniques as separate web sites compared to responsive web design. By exploring the approach of mobile first I {{try to find a}} working solution of techniques. I also <b>look</b> <b>into</b> another method that is suggested in a book and <b>look</b> <b>into</b> how Bootstrap could be used in the process. I will also <b>look</b> <b>into</b> content to identify what content need to be adjusted between different devices. I find that navigation {{is an important part of}} a web site and <b>look</b> <b>into</b> different methods of handling navigation on mobile devices. By analyzing different techniques and <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> what content is going to be adjusted a solution is proposed where the navigation is adjusted in a responsive design. The design is converted into a SharePoint masterpage and then fixed using stylesheets and JavaScript. The solution works on a web site with a complex site structure since it focuses on how to adjust the navigation...|$|R

Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the intended, implemented, {{attained}} curriculum of East Side Middle School in Anderson Indiana. The main question that is being <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> during the research and construction of this paper is the question of why schools have such low test scores when the standards are given for each teacher to follow throughout the year. This examination is to include three parts: a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the curriculum that East Side Middle School has in place, and what guidelines are given for the teachers to follow when teaching this curriculum, a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the actual curriculum that is getting taught inside the classrooms by the two seventh grade teachers, and a final <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the curriculum that is being attained by the students in both classes. This research culminates with a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> what can be done by the Anderson School Corporation to begin to align each curriculum accordingly so that all students have the best chance of learning the most material possible.

5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper <b>looks</b> <b>into</b> the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she <b>looks</b> <b>into</b> the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he <b>looks</b> <b>into</b> the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E

The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade <b>looks</b> <b>into</b> the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
