40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel design for a {{dual-band}} bandpass filter (BPF) based on the conventional second-order, open-loop BPF. By adding series resonant circuits to the open ends of the resonator, we can create two resonant modes from the even and odd modes. One pair of the even and odd modes constitutes the upper passband, while the other pair constitutes the <b>lower</b> <b>passband.</b> By adding another series resonant circuit to the open-loop resonator, we can control the bandwidth of either the upper passband or the <b>lower</b> <b>passband.</b> We can replace the series resonant circuits with simple microstrip line resonators.

The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency (which is slightly higher than the passband 3 dB cut-off frequency) up to the infinite frequency. The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency (slightly <b>lower</b> than the <b>passband</b> cut-off frequency).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} phase finite {{impulse response}} (FIR) filter is designed without imposing a desired phase response. The maximum passband group delay of the filter is minimized {{subject to a}} positivity constraint on the passband group delay response of the filter {{as well as a}} specification on the maximum absolute difference between the desired magnitude square response and the designed magnitude square response over both the passband and the stopband. This filter design problem is a nonsmooth functional ine-quality constrained optimization problem. To tackle this problem, first, the one norm functional inequality constraint of the optimization problem is approximated by a smooth function so that the nonsmooth functional inequality con-strained optimization problem is approximated as a noncon-vex functional inequality constrained optimization problem. Then, a modified filled function method is applied for find-ing the global minimum of the nonconvex optimization prob-lem.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Liquid metals are an {{attractive}} material choice for designers wishing {{to combine the}} advantages of metals, such as high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity, with the inherently dynamic nature of fluids. Liquid metals have been utilized {{for a wide variety}} of applications, but their high electrical conductivity, surface smoothness, and linear response makes them especially attractive as tuning elements within reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) devices. The recent introduction of non-toxic liquid metal alloys onto the commercial market has further fueled interest in this versatile material. Early experiments with liquid metal as an RF tuning element have yielded promising results, but have largely depended on externally applied pressure to actuate the liquid metal. For commercial implementation this would necessitate the use of clunky and inefficient micro-pumps, which can require both high voltages and high power consumption. This reliance on hydraulic pumping has been a significant barrier to the incorporation of liquid metal as an RF tuning element in applications outside of a laboratory setting. Here, several electrical actuation techniques are demonstrated that allow for the rapid and repeatable actuation of non-toxic gallium alloys as tuning elements within reconfigurable RF devices. These techniques leverage the naturally high surface tension of liquid metals, as well as the unique electrochemistry of gallium-based alloys, to exercise wide-ranging and high fidelity control over both the metal’s shape and position. Furthermore, this control is exercised with voltage and power levels that are each better than an order of magnitude below that achievable with conventional micro-pumps. This control does not require the constant application of actuation signals in order to maintain an actuated state, and can even be ‘self-actuated’, with the liquid metal supplying its own kinetic energy via the electrochemical conversion of its native oxide layer. Several proof-of-concept devices are designed and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of these electrical actuation techniques. A pair of tunable slot antennas are presented that achieve frequency reconfigurability through different implementations of liquid metal tuning elements – the first uses liquid metal as a dynamic short-circuit boundary condition for the magnetic current within the resonant aperture, and the second as a variable-length transmission stub that adds and removes reactance from the antenna. The two antennas are tunable across effective bandwidths of 19 % and 15 %, respectively. In addition, a tunable bandpass filter is demonstrated in which a central liquid-metal resonant element is ‘stretched’ to <b>lower</b> the <b>passband</b> of the filter by 10 % without impacting the insertion loss. Finally, it is demonstrated how liquid metal can be formed into arbitrary shapes at high speeds (approximately 2. 5 cm/s) without the need for an external power supply...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for new wireless services and applications, {{the high level of}} integration and the coexistence of multi-standard (MS) or multi-band operations into a single device are becoming defining trends in designing microwave filters. This has driven considerable technological advances in reconfigurable/tunable and miniaturized filters. More specifically, reconfigurable/tunable filters that tune to different frequency bands instead of classical filter banks have great potential to significantly reduce the system size and complexity; while reducing the filter size becomes essential to achieve the highest degree of integration density in compact and portable wireless devices. In the light of this scenario, the objective of this dissertation is to develop the new design technologies, concepts and filtering configurations for tunable microstrip filters and compact passive microwave filters. To this aim, this dissertation is divided into two main parts. The first part (Part I) focuses on the designs of novel varactor-tuned microstrip filters with advanced performances. In this aspect, new topologies for realizing tunable lowpass and highpass filters are firstly developed. State-of-the-art performances, including wide tuning range, high selectivity with multiple transmission zeros, low insertion loss and compact size for all the tuning states are obtained in both of these filters. Secondly, two novel classes of tunable bandpass filters are presented. One of them is designed based on varactor-loaded parallel-coupled microstrip lines (PCML) and short-circuited stubs, which allows the <b>lower</b> <b>passband</b> edge together with two transmission zeros located around the <b>lower</b> <b>passband</b> skirt to be reconfigured separately. While the other tunable bandpass filter is constructed by the combination of tunable bandpass and lowpass filters, featuring both centre frequency and bandwidth tunabilities, as well as high selectivity with abundant transmission zeros. Furthermore, a new concept of tunable lossy filter is demonstrated, which attempts to achieve an equivalent high-Q tunable performance by using low-Q resonators. This concept makes the presented tunable combline filter interesting for some frequency-agile applications in which the low in-band loss variation and high selectivity are much desired while the absolute insertion loss can be a tradeoff. The second part (Part II) is devoted to the design of miniaturized passive microwave filters with improved characteristics. For this, the concept of artificial right-handed and left-handed transmission lines are applied to the signal interference filtering topology, which results in a compact circuit size and good out-of-band performance. In particular, for a further size reduction, such filter is implemented in the forms of multilayered structure by using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology. Additionally, another two types of miniaturized bandpass filters using stepped impedance resonators are demonstrated, which are implemented based on different fabrication processes (i. e. LCP bonded multilayer PCB technology and a standard planar PCB technology). Among their main features, the compact size, wide passband, broad stopband with multiple transmission zeros and circuit simplicity are highlighted. For all the proposed design techniques and filtering structures, exhaustive theoretical analyses are done, and design equations and guide rules are provided. Furthermore, all the proposed schemes and/or ideas have been experimentally validated through the design, implementation and measurement of different filters. The fabrication processes of multilayer technology utilized: liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) bonded multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology, are also demonstrated for reference. All of the results achieved in this dissertation make the proposed filters very attractive for their use in modern wireless communication systems...|$|E
