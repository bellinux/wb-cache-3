5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to Lech Wałęsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw {{was seen as a}} symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum where it is now on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in <b>London.</b> <b>Today,</b> a kilim embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E

25|$|At its height, the Roman {{city had}} a {{population}} of approximately 45,000–60,000 inhabitants. Londinium was an ethnically diverse city, with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, continental Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The Romans built the London Wall some time between 190 and 225 AD. The boundaries of the Roman city {{were similar to those}} of the City of <b>London</b> <b>today,</b> though Londinium did not extend further west than Ludgate or the Fleet, and the mid-estuary Thames was undredged and wider than it is today thus, the City's shoreline was north of its present position. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as 50 AD, near to today's London Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Mr and Mrs Andrews is an oil {{on canvas}} {{portrait}} of about 1750 by Thomas Gainsborough, now in the National Gallery, <b>London.</b> <b>Today</b> {{it is one of}} his most famous works, but it remained in the family of the sitters until 1960 and was very little known before it appeared in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927, after which it was regularly requested for other exhibitions in Britain and abroad, and praised by critics for its charm and freshness. By the post-war years its iconic status was established, {{and it was one of}} four paintings chosen to represent British art in an exhibition in Paris celebrating the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Soon the painting began to receive hostile scrutiny as a paradigm of the paternalist and capitalist society of 18th-century England, but it remains a firm popular favourite.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in <b>London</b> <b>today</b> when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."

500|$|During the 1850s, quarry owner James Harrison of Charmouth, West Dorset of England found fossils {{from the}} cliffs of Black Ven between Charmouth and Lyme Regis, that were quarried, {{possibly}} for {{raw material for}} the manufacture of cement. Some of these he gave to the collector and retired general surgeon Henry Norris. In 1858, Norris and Harrison sent some fragmentary limb bones to Professor Richard Owen of the British Museum (Natural History), <b>London</b> (<b>today</b> the Natural History Museum). Among them was a left thighbone, specimen GSM 109560. In 1859, Owen named the genus Scelidosaurus in an entry about palaeontology in the Encyclopædia Britannica. The lemma text contained a diagnosis, implicating that the genus was validly named and was not a nomen nudum, {{despite the fact that}} the definition was vague and no specimens were identified. Owen intended to call the dinosaur [...] "hindlimb saurian" [...] but confused the Greek word σκέλος, skelos, [...] "hindlimb", with σκελίς, skelis, [...] "rib of beef". The name was inspired by the strong development of the hind leg. Afterwards Harrison sent a knee joint, a claw (GSM 109561), a juvenile specimen and a skull to Owen, that were described in 1861. On that occasion the type species Scelidosaurus harrisonii was named, the specific name honouring Harrison. The skull later was revealed to be part of a nearly complete skeleton, that was described by Owen in 1863.|$|E
