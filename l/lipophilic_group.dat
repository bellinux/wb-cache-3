25|$|For optimal {{activity}} and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal <b>lipophilic</b> <b>group</b> is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 {{can be replaced}} by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted phenyl ring or a bulky alkoxy substituent (celecoxib). Within the hydrophilic side-pocket of COX-2, the oxygen of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) group interacts with Hist90, Arg513, and Gln192 and forms hydrogen bonds. The substituted phenyl group {{at the top of}} the channel interacts with the side-chains of amino acid residues through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Tyr385 makes for some sterical restrictions of this side of the binding site so a small substituent of the phenyl group makes for better binding. Degrees of freedom are also important for the binding. The central ring of the coxibs decides the orientation of the aromatic rings and, therefore, the binding to COX enzyme even though it often has no electrostatic interactions with any of the amino acid residues. The high lipophilicity of the active site does require low polarity of the central scaffold of the coxibs.|$|E

50|$|Leptophos is an {{irreversible}} inhibitor of cholinesterases in vitro.

50|$|Zanamivir analogues are {{designed}} to improve the therapeutic use. Replacing the carboxylate group at the C1 to phosphonate group led the drug to be more potent with high affinity to form ionic interaction with the active site. Additionally, the click-chemistry reaction was used to synthesize the C4-triazole-modified zanamivir analogue that shows inhibitory activity close to zanamivir. Laninamivir is designed by replacing C7 hydroxy moiety with small <b>lipophilic</b> <b>group,</b> -OCH3, which resulted in an excellent inhibitory activity. The C8 and C9 diol {{play an important role}} in the binding affinity with neuraminidase, prolonging the effect. The polymer scaffolds at the C7 position of zanamivir via an alkyl ether has gained more attention as this showed enhanced antiviral activity.|$|E

With focus on positioning the double bond in the inhibitor to more closely resemble the transition {{state of the}} substrate and replacing the glycerol side chain with a <b>lipophilic</b> <b>group</b> {{on the basis of}} the hydrophobic backbone of the glycerol interacting with the protein lead to the discovery of GS 4071. GS 4071 is cyclohexene based and has 3-pentyl ether, found to be optimal, instead of the glycerol as the side chain. The GS 4071 inhibitor is more lipophilic than the predecessor Zanamivir but does not have more bioavailability. Oseltamivir, the ethyl ester of GS 4071 was produced as a prodrug and is actively converted to the active drug in vivo.|$|E

[...] These VKAs are enhanced to kill warfarin-resistant rodents. The enhancement to the molecule {{takes the form of a}} larger <b>lipophilic</b> <b>group</b> to enhance the fat solubility of the poison and greatly increase the time it acts within the animal's body. However, as described above, the super-warfarins do not inhibit vitamin K and their effect is easily inhibited by vitamin K. Nevertheless, oral vitamin K may need to be given for times that may exceed a month, in order to counter the effect of second-generation VKAs that have very long residence times in the fat of animals and humans.|$|E

In this report, we show that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides conjugated to <b>lipophilic</b> <b>groups,</b> either tocopherol (Vitamin E) or 2 -Di-O-hexadecyl- 3 -glycerol, can significantly inhibit the functioning of the dipeptide transporter system (DTS) in cultured Caco- 2 intestinal cells.

50|$|One of {{the keys}} to {{developing}} COX-2 selective drugs is the larger active site of COX-2, which makes it possible to make molecules too large to fit into the COX-1 active site but still able to fit the COX-2. The larger active site of COX-2 is partly due to a polar hydrophilic side-pocket that forms because of substitution of Ile523, His513, and Ile434 in COX-1 by Val523, Arg513, and Val434 in COX-2. Val523 is less bulky than Ile523, which increases the volume of the active site. Substitution of Ile434 for Val434 allows the side-chain of Phe518 to move back and make some extra space. This side-pocket allows for interactions with Arg513, which is a replacement for His513 of COX-1. Arg513 is thought to be a key residue for diaryl heterocycle inhibitors such as the coxibs. The side-chain of Leu384, {{at the top of the}} receptor channel, is oriented into the active site of COX-1, but, in COX-2, it is oriented away from the active site and makes more space in the apex of the binding site.The bulky sulfonamide group in COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and rofecoxib prevent the molecule from entering the COX-1 channel.For optimal activity and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal <b>lipophilic</b> <b>group</b> is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 can be replaced by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted phenyl ring or a bulky alkoxy substituent (celecoxib).

40|$|SummaryAttachment of <b>lipophilic</b> <b>groups</b> is a {{widespread}} modification that occurs on nearly 1, 000 proteins of diverse structure and function. At least five different types of lipids can be covalently attached to proteins: fatty acids, isoprenoids, sterols, phospholipids, and glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors. Proteins can contain more than one type of lipid, e. g. myristate + palmitate, palmitate + cholesterol, or farnesyl + palmitate. An important principle derived from studies of lipid-modified proteins is that not all fat is the same. Each type of lipid moiety is attached by a different lipid transferase and each modification confers distinct properties to the modified protein. The most common outcome of lipid modification is an increased affinity for membranes. However, attachment of myristoyl or prenyl groups can also promote intramolecular and intermolecular protein–protein interactions. Another key concept is reversibility. The covalent linkage between a protein and either thioester-linked palmitate or a GPI anchor can be broken {{by the actions of}} thioesterases and phospholipases, respectively. By contrast, neither myristate nor the isoprenoids farnesyl or geranylgeranyl are physically removed from a modified protein. Instead, Mother Nature has devised a clever means for some proteins to sequester these <b>lipophilic</b> <b>groups</b> within a hydrophobic cleft, effectively shielding them from the aqueous milieu. Here, I provide an overview of the structural and functional consequences for proteins containing each type of lipid modification (depicted in Figure 1) ...|$|R

Selectivity of these compounds against IDO and TDO, two enzymes sharing substrate similarity with MAO and involved in the serotonergic and kynurenine pathways was also studied. All compounds showed higher activity and selectivity against MAO-B, the most effective one being 3 -methyl- 8 -meta-chlorobenzyloxy- 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 - one (9 a) which was shown to be a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 0. 11 μM. Replacing the methyl group in the 3 -position with a meta-CF 3 -phenyl group (7 a, 7 b and 7 c) abolished the inhibitory potency against MAO-B. Indeed, the substitution of the 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c] pyridazin- 5 -one core in the 3 -position dramatically influences the MAO-inhibiting properties of these compounds. Molecular docking studies of 9 a within MAO-B suggest that the 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 -one scaffold is well stabilized into the substrate cavity with the meta-chlorobenzyloxy side chain extending towards a rather hydrophobic pocket at the entrance cavity. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.
