5000|$|The Unbelievable Truth is a BBC radio comedy panel game made by Random Entertainment, {{devised by}} Graeme Garden and Jon Naismith. It {{is very similar}} to the {{occasional}} I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue game [...] "Lies, All Lies", which was first played in 1985. The game is chaired by David Mitchell and is described in the programme's introduction as [...] "the panel game built on truth and lies." [...] The object of the game is to lie on a subject, whilst also trying to include the truth without being detected. The series was first broadcast as a pilot on 19 October 2006, with the first actual series broadcast on 23 April 2007. Its <b>latest,</b> <b>eighteenth</b> series was aired from April to May 2017.|$|R
25|$|The Estate {{comprised}} very extensive {{lands in}} the County of Fife, and coal was mined on estate lands from at the <b>latest</b> the <b>eighteenth</b> century.

5|$|In the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, {{proposals}} {{similar to}} those of the seventeenth century for a universal measure were made for a common international system of measure in the spheres of commerce and technology; when the French Revolutionaries implemented such a system, they drew on many of the seventeenth-century proposals.|$|E
5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> {{and the early}} nineteenth centuries.

5000|$|Although most reviews were {{positive}} there were voices which criticized Hawksmoor as confusing or morally repellent, particularly in sexual terms. (Hollinghurst, King, Maddox). While most critics especially praised Ackroyd's imitation of 18th-century English there were critical voices here, for example Cedric D. Reverand II, {{who wrote that}} [...] "Ackroyd's notion of the appropriate style seems at times idiosyncratic and more Jacobean-Mannerist than <b>late</b> senventeenth-early <b>eighteenth</b> century".|$|R
50|$|Coldham Cottage itself {{dates from}} the <b>late</b> seventeenth/early <b>eighteenth</b> century and has a timber-frame, {{whitewashed}} and rendered, with pantile roof and brick central ridge and right end projecting stacks. A separate church was created utilising one unit of the existing house (kitchen and bedroom with removal of floor) and building on an extension. The whole represents an unusual and rare instance of continuing Catholic use from at least the eighteenth century.|$|R

As early as 1833, the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue, but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E

5|$|After the Glorious Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter of his generation. Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} wall, Roman sculptures include the marble {{head of a}} Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. It dates to the second century CE {{and may have been}} looted from a Roman {{monument}} further to the south. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.|$|E
5|$|Between the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> {{and early}} nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
50|$|Coldham Cottage itself {{dates from}} the <b>late</b> seventeenth/early <b>eighteenth</b> century and has a timber-frame, {{whitewashed}} and rendered, with pantile roof and brick central ridge and right end projecting stacks. Until 1868 the priest officiated in the chapel at Coldham Hall but after {{the sale of the}} estate in that year a separate church was built utilising one unit of the existing house (kitchen and bedroom with removal of floor) and building on an extension. The whole represents an unusual and rare instance of continuing Catholic use from at least the eighteenth century.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Late</b> in the <b>eighteenth</b> century, {{the church}} had a {{reputation}} as Low Church, as Malcolm in London Redivivum (1803) stated ‘When I mention that the late well-known Methodist Mr Gunn was a preacher in it on certain days, the trampled and dirty state of the church will not be wondered at.’ ...|$|R
50|$|Mucedorus was {{performed}} by strolling players as <b>late</b> as the <b>eighteenth</b> century.

A Puritan preacher considered the accident a sign of God's displeasure with play-acting.|$|R
5|$|From the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century Scotland gained {{many of the}} organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time}} as the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E
5|$|John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as {{painters}} of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where they worked with Hamilton. John died in 1768/9 and Alexander returned home. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological. His version of The Origin of Painting (1773), depicting Pliny's {{story of a}} young Corinthian woman outlining a shadow on the wall, has her hand guided by Cupid, suggesting the ultimate motivation for art was love. The same theme was painted by another of Hamilton's proteges, David Allan, two years later. In the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.|$|E
50|$|When Swedish doctor-botanist Carl Peter Thunberg {{traveled}} in Japan <b>late</b> in the <b>eighteenth</b> century, he secreted out drawings {{of a small}} tree that would eventually become synonymous with the high art of oriental gardens. He gave it the species name palmatum after the hand-like shape of its leaves, similar to the centuries-old Japanese names kaede and momiji, references to the 'hands' of frogs and babies, respectively.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} Canadian militia and France's Amerindian allies, the Troupes de la Marine were {{essential}} to the defence of New France in the <b>late</b> seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> centuries. With the arrival {{of large numbers of}} British regulars after 1755, the nature of warfare in North America shifted from irregular to conventional European warfare, with particular importance attached to sieges and fortifications. French army battalions were also dispatched to fight in North America after 1755.|$|R
5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on Sable Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of Saint Barbara, {{alleged to have}} been brought to Kiev from Constantinople in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Although most of the monastery grounds were secularized in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, as many as 240 monks resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Yakiv Yatsynevych, either studied or taught at the school.|$|E
5|$|The rich fur areas {{along the}} upper Mississippi, Minnesota, Des Moines, and Missouri Rivers, {{otherwise}} occupied by {{peoples of the}} First Nations, were exploited by independent fur traders operating from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. At {{the beginning of the}} nineteenth century, these traders established fur posts in the Minnesota River valley at Lake Traverse, Big Stone Lake, Lac qui Parle, and Traverse des Sioux. The large fur companies also built posts, including the North West Company's stations at Pembina and St. Joseph in the valley of the Red River. The paths between these posts became parts of the first of the Red River Trails.|$|E
5000|$|Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677), in his 1670 Theologico-Political Treatise, criticized Judaism (his birth religion) and all {{organized}} religion. His philosophical {{orientation is}} often called [...] "pantheism," [...] a term coined by John Toland after Spinoza's death. However, in the <b>late</b> seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> centuries, Spinoza's name was often associated with atheism, freethinking, materialism, deism, and any other heterodox religious belief.
