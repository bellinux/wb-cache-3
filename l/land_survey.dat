5|$|Ikata {{is a small}} town, with a {{population}} of 10,637 as of March 31, 2014. The total land area of the town is 94.37km2, making the population density 113 persons per km2.

5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation.

Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle.

25|$|In {{southern}} Wisconsin, {{towns are}} often co-terminous with survey townships, which were established to plat <b>land.</b> <b>Survey</b> townships are not political jurisdictions. The survey, or Congressional, townships, were mapped in the Public <b>Land</b> <b>Survey</b> System, and are subdivided into 36 sections of one square mile each. In Wisconsin, the grid system {{is based on}} a Point of Beginning (POB) created by surveyor Lucius Lyon in 1831 near Hazel Green, Wisconsin (the Fourth Principal Meridian) and used the Illinois boundary for a baseline. Development based on this grid system can be seen on maps today as the major through streets, such as those in Milwaukee, which coincide with boundary intersections. Lyon's POB is observed by a Wisconsin Historical Marker and a reset surveyor's monument.|$|E

A cross-sectional research design was adopted where by a purposive sampling technique simple random sampling and systematic random sampling were used due to involvements of various respondents to obtain a sample of 200 respondents. Interview questions and questionnaire was the main instruments used in data collection. Results had shown that land acquisition procedure in <b>land</b> <b>surveyed</b> projects were not considered during the implementation of <b>land</b> <b>surveyed</b> projects in Ilala Municipal Council which result to inefficiency while the demand for cadastral survey is higher than its supply.
