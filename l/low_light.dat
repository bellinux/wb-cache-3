5|$|The {{sensors to}} be {{developed}} under Shed Light were broken into three categories, <b>Low</b> <b>Light</b> Level TV (LLLTV), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and Forward Looking Radar (FLR).|$|E
5|$|Autonetics (A {{division}} of North American Aviation) R-132 forward looking radar (FLR) to locate targets for closer inspection via <b>Low</b> <b>Light</b> Level TV (LLLTV) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and featured a Moving Target Indicator (MTI) and automatic tracking capability.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} shot using 35mm film. Warren {{said this was}} chosen over high-definition cameras due to the <b>low</b> <b>light</b> levels that would be {{experienced}} when filming in a world without electricity and during an autumn filming period, and over Super 16 due to high-definition transmission requirements.|$|E

5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape. Other examples {{include the use of}} echolocation for hunting in <b>low</b> <b>light</b> conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At <b>low</b> <b>light</b> levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to <b>low</b> <b>light</b> levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|P90 USG:The P90 USG (United States Government) {{model is}} similar to the {{standard}} P90, except the reflex sight housing is aluminium, and the sight has a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in <b>low</b> <b>light</b> conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel and effective video enhancement algorithm for <b>low</b> <b>lighting</b> video. The algorithm works by first inverting an input low-lighting video and then applying an optimized image de-haze algorithm on the inverted video. To facilitate faster computation, temporal correlations between subsequent frames are utilized to expedite {{the calculation of}} key algorithm parameters. Simulation results show excellent enhancement results and 4 x speed up {{as compared with the}} frame-wise enhancement algorithms.

50|$|The High and <b>Low</b> <b>Lights</b> of North Shields {{which are}} {{also known as the}} Fish Quay High and <b>Low</b> <b>Lights</b> are a series of {{historic}} leading lights that were constructed near Fish Quay in North Shields, Tyne and Wear in the United Kingdom. The first pair of lighthouses were erected here in the 16th century by the Guild of the Blessed Trinity of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. By following a course which kept the two lights aligned, pilots were able to navigate along the Tyne, avoiding the dangerous Shields Bar and the Black Middens.|$|R
5|$|To improve {{operations}} at low altitude, the AN/ASQ-151 Electro-Optical Viewing System (EVS), {{which consisted of}} a <b>Low</b> <b>Light</b> Level Television (LLLTV) and a Forward looking infrared (FLIR) system mounted in blisters under the noses of B-52Gs and Hs between 1972 and 1976. The navigational capabilities of the B-52 were later augmented {{with the addition of}} GPS in the 1980s. The IBM AP-101, also used on the Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber and the Space Shuttle, was the B-52's main computer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in <b>low</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and <b>low</b> <b>light.</b> Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E

40|$|Face {{detection}} is {{an important}} preprocessing stage for automated facial recognition systems. Imaging in real world environment experience substantial variation in lighting and weather conditions. Surveillance systems are a typical example of real world imaging systems. Face detection is based upon typical haar like patterns appearing in facial images. Performance of even most successful face detection algorithms such as viola’s work, typically fail in poor <b>lighting</b> or in <b>low</b> SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) images. Therefore subsequent stage of image enhancement after image acquisition is employed to enhance the faces or face patterns in <b>low</b> <b>lighting</b> images. Proposed research work addressed the face detection in automotive environment. Algorithm addressed the situation of <b>low</b> <b>lighting</b> condition and enhanced the images captured in <b>low</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions with lights switched on. Faces of people in automobile cabin go in complete darkness and difficult to enhance. Proposed scheme is based upon local enhancement method and considerable results are achieved...|$|R

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are <b>low</b> <b>light</b> levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in <b>low</b> <b>light,</b> but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in <b>low</b> <b>light,</b> though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} fashion as the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} reflex sight housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in <b>low</b> <b>light</b> conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on stealth-based tactics, which require one to silently take out enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks. However, most {{of the game is}} action-orientated, which involves Logan navigating through levels whilst loudly shooting at enemies with no consequence to the mission. The game takes place {{in a wide variety of}} locations, including narrow interior streets of Washington D.C. to wide open plains of Kazakhstan. In some stealth based missions, the game will involve various puzzles. Some locations feature <b>low</b> <b>light</b> ambience, which force the player to use their torch despite its drawbacks imposed during stealth missions.|$|E
5|$|The native kentia palm (known {{locally as}} the thatch palm {{as it was}} used to thatch the houses of the early settlers) is now the most popular {{decorative}} palm in the world. The mild climate of the island has evolved a palm which can tolerate <b>low</b> <b>light,</b> a dry atmosphere and lowish temperatures – ideal for indoor conditions. Up to the 1980s the palms were only sold as seed but from then onwards only as high quality seedlings. The nursery received certification in 1997 for its high quality management complying with the requirements of Australian Standard AS/NZS ISO 9002.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel integrated algorithm for real-time enhancement of video acquired under challenging lighting conditions. Such conditions include <b>low</b> <b>lighting,</b> haze, and {{high dynamic range}} situations. The algorithm automatically detects the dominate source of impairment, then depending on whether it is <b>low</b> <b>lighting,</b> haze or others, a corresponding pre-processing {{is applied to the}} input video, followed by the core enhancement algorithm. Temporal and spatial redundancies in the video input are utilized to facilitate real-time processing and to improve temporal and spatial consistency of the output. The proposed algorithm can be used as an independent module, or be integrated in either a video encoder or a video decoder for further optimizations. Comment: 10 pages, 23 figure...|$|R
5|$|The sails {{belonged to}} a convoy of Indiamen which had {{gathered}} in Colombo on Ceylon before sailing together to China. By choosing to come up through the Bali Strait rather than through the Straits of Malacca, Farquharson had inadvertently led his fleet directly {{into the path of}} a French squadron whose six frigates were easily more powerful than his six East Indiamen. Farquharson was aware that he could not win a naval engagement with six frigates and so resolved instead to bluff the French into thinking his merchant convoy was a squadron of ships of the line. When he saw Cybèle approaching, Farquharson brought two ships forward to meet the frigate, gambling that in the <b>low</b> <b>light</b> Tréhouart might mistake the East Indiamen for warships. Farquharson compounded his ruse by raising Rainier's Blue ensign on Alfred and instructing the rest of the convoy to raise ensigns of their own.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in <b>low</b> <b>light,</b> by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in <b>low</b> <b>light</b> situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E
