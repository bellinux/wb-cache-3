If it were possible to reduce these costs associated with transfer programmes, this would have an important impact on the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>non-participation</b> <b>rate</b> for single mothers, it would imply large savings in government expenditure on Income Support payments for those not working, and it would increase the welfare of those in receipt of transfers.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{gender differences}} in hourly earnings in Greece using three Household Budget Surveys (1988, 1994, 1999). During this period the aggregate gender earnings gap remained almost stable, amounting to less than a fifth of male earnings {{in the public sector}} and around a quarter of male earnings in the private sector of the economy. In most cases, women have better educational qualifications but men more years of potential experience. Using a number of decomposition techniques, it is shown that in the more competitive private sector of the economy, where wages {{are more likely to be}} determined by productivity, around three quarters of the observed gap should be attributed to discrimination. This finding, combined with the substantially higher incidences of unemployment and involuntary <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>non-participation</b> <b>rates</b> of females, implies that despite the legislative progress in promoting equality of opportunity in recent decades, there is still a long way to go before true gender equality is established in the Greek labour market...|$|R

Furthermore, the utility loss associated with working lower part time, higher part time, full time is 0.92, 1.06, 1.27 respectively, on average for the sample. We can compute a money metric of these utility differences from the mean effect of other income on utility. This values the loss in welfare from moving from <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>non-participation</b> to lower part time at £ 20.56 (i.e. 0.92 / 0.0447) {{with a standard deviation}} of 5.14; and to higher part time at £ 23.69 (1.56); and to full time at £ 28.38 (4.47).

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a simultaneous}} discrete choice model for welfare participation and labour supply of two-adult households in Australia using the Income and Housing Costs Survey of 1994 / 1995. In this paper only unemployment-related welfare payments are considered. Welfare participation {{is assumed to}} have a positive indirect effect (through income) and a negative direct effect on utility. This approach allows for non-participation of eligible people. An earlier developed labour supply and welfare participation model is extended in this paper by adding employment equations to account for involuntary unemployment. In addition, a part-time penalty term is included in the utility function to allow for monetary or non-monetary costs of working part time and the number of discrete choices is increased. The first two extensions seem to improve the model's ability to simulate the correct distribution of actual labour supply. Without these extensions, <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>non-participation</b> is under-estimated and {{the number of people in}} part-time employment is over-estimated. The results indicate that there is evidence of a significant disutility associated with welfare participation for all specifications of the model.

Using data from the <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> Survey, it is estimated that about 55 basis points of the 565 basis point fall in the UK unemployment rate between 1984 and 1998 can be accounted for by changes in the age structure of the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> Changes in the fraction of each age group that is economically active will also affect the composition of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> (and therefore potentially the unemployment rate); however, even controlling for changing <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation rates by age, demographically driven shifts in the age composition of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> still explain about 40 basis points of the fall in the unemployment rate.
